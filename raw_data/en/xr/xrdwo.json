PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 1ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR STATE AGENCIES By eliminating seldom used, duplicative, or unnecessary statutorily required reports, the state would reduce storage and labor costs. An effective process for eliminatingunnecessary reports would require state agencies to affirmthe continued usefulness of reports and would addautomatic sunset language to statutes authorizing newreports. According to the Comptr oller of Public Accounts, agencies and institutions of higher education are collec-tively required to produce 472 different reports each biennium, and the General Appropriations Act addsadditional reporting requirements for agencies every twoyears. While requirements for reports specified in theGeneral Appropriations Act must be renewed eachbiennium, most reports required by statute must be produced indefinitely. Furthermore, all reports generatedby state agencies are subject to state retention and archival requirements. Eliminating redundant and unnecessaryreports and the storage requirements resulting from theirproduction would save valuable tax revenue for otherpurposes. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bState agencies are statutorily required to producereports that have become unnecessary. \u008bThere is currently no comprehensive process to identify and remove statutory requirements forreports that are duplicative or no longer useful. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend the Texas Govern- ment Code to eliminate the Non-resident BidderReport and the Training and Expense Report. \u008bRecommendation 2: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill tha t requires the Texas State Library and Archives Commission to producethe index of statutorily required reports, formerlyproduced by the Comptroller of Public Accounts,assessing each reports' usefulness. \u008bRecommendation 3: Consider adding an automatic expiration provision in any new statute requiring areport. COMMENTS State agencies and institutions of higher education mustproduce reports for public consumption, store them, andsometimes archive them under the principles of open government. No single report is expensive to produce, butwith more than 200 state agencies producing 472 or morestatutorily required reports biennially, the costs of produc- ing, distributing, and storing documents add up. Reportscan be resource-intensive to prepare and costly to retain, soreports that have outlived their usefulness should beeliminated. Figure 1 discusses some of the factors contrib-uting to the costs of reporting. The additional staff time and avoided printing and storage costs from eliminating reports cannot be preciselyquantified. These costs are unlikely to be great enough forany single agency to be able to reduce staff. However,reducing reporting requirements would free up staff timefor other tasks. Legislative Budget Board (LBB) staff solicited input from state agencies through the State Agency CoordinatingCouncil (SACC), Mid-Sized Ag ency Coordinating Council (MACC), and the Small State Agency Task Force (SSATF),and received recommendations for nine reports that couldpossibly be eliminated or consolidated. The two reportsdiscussed in Recommendation 1 are good examples ofFIGURE 1 FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE COST OFPRODUCING, DISTRIBUTING, AND STORING STATUTORILY R EQUIRED REPORTS Availability of the informationAvailability of the informationAvailability of the informationAvailability of the informationAvailability of the information \u2014Any difficulty in acquiring information increases the cost of producing the report; FormatFormatFormatFormatFormat \u2014Publishing the report in electronic format on the agency's website usually costs less than producing and distributing hard copies; Length and printing requirementsLength and printing requirementsLength and printing requirementsLength and printing requirementsLength and printing requirements \u2014The number of pages, number of copies, type of paper, need for color, and detail in graphics allcontribute to costs; Internal record retention policiesInternal record retention policiesInternal record retention policiesInternal record retention policiesInternal record retention policies \u2014Maintaining internal records accrues costs for state agencies; and State record retention and archival policiesState record retention and archival policiesState record retention and archival policiesState record retention and archival policiesState record retention and archival policies\u2014The average retention time for agencies is between 8 and 9 years, with some records kept as long as 50 years. Information storage, which requires additional imaging costs, is even more expensive and is only practical fordocuments intended for long-term storage. One cubic foot of paper documents costs $.185 to store at the Texas State Record Center each month but would cost nearly $64 to convert to electronic image andanother $.88 to store electronically each month. SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 2ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR STATE AGENCIES reports that are duplicative or have outlived their useful- ness. ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY REPORTS Each of the following reports has outlived its usefulness. Recommendation 1 would eliminate these reports, reducingthe administrative burden on all state agencies and cost tothe state for storage and potential archiving. \u008bNon-resident Bidder Report: Texas Government Code \u00a7 2152.064 requires at least 181 state agencies to submit a Non-resident Bidder Report to the LBBin January and July of each year listing out-of-statecontractors to whom a state agency has awarded asubcontract of $25,000 or more. The Non-residentBidder Report collects information about out-of-state bidders on government contracts. The originalstatutory language was amended in the Seventy-eighth Legislature (2003) to exclude universitysystems and institutions of higher education fromthis requirement. As a result, the report does notprovide complete information about the state'scontracting activity with out-of-state vendors. TheLBB has not received any requests for the informa-tion contained in this report. \u008bTraining and Expense Report: Texas Govern- ment Code \u00a7 656.105 requires at least 181 state agencies to prepare and submit an annual report tothe LBB detailing the amount of money expendedfor training by the agency in the preceding fiscalyear. This report duplicates information that isalready recorded in the state's accounting andbudgeting systems and in each agency's annualfinancial report. REQUIRE TEXAS STATE LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES COMMISSION TO PRODUCE \"REPORT OF REPORTS\" There is no current comprehensive process to eliminate or consolidate duplicative or unnecessar y statutorily required reports. The Comptroller of Public Accounts (CPA) eachyear produces the Required Reports Prepared by StateAgencies and Institutions of Higher Education report(Report of Reports), which details the 472 statutorilyrequired reports. The CPA originally began to compile theReport of Reports to assist the legislature regardingreporting requirements, but this guide has evolved into atool to help state agencies and institutions of highereducation identify statutory requirements for reports. TheCPA states that the Report of Reports may not be compre-hensive and encourages agencies to notify it of any new or omitted statutory reporting requirements. The Report ofReports makes no judgment about the continued usefulness of the reports it describes. Recommendation 2 would require the Texas State Library and Archives Commission (TSLAC) to work with CPA toproduce the Report of Reports. Furthermore, the goal ofthe Report of Reports should be expanded to includeinformation from state agencies regarding the continuedviability of statutorily required reports. The mission of TSLAC includes preserving the record of government for public scrutiny and enhancing the capacityfor achievement of individuals and institutions with whomit works. The Report of Reports, as an index of statutorilyrequired reports encompassing all state agencies andinstitutions of higher education, falls within TSLAC'smission. TSLAC should be able to build upon CPA 's workto ensure the completeness of the Report of Reports.Furthermore, TSLAC can create a process, potentially usingforms, Web sites, and its contacts with records administra-tors in all state agencies and with SACC, MACC, andSSATF, to collect information regarding the continuedusefulness of reports. Once TSLAC publishes the report,this information would become public record, thusallowing interested parties to recommend elimination ofunnecessary reports or consolidation of duplicative reports. The following rider should be included in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill for the Texas State Library andArchive Commission: Report of Reports. No later than June 1, 2007, the Texas State Library and Archive Commission, withthe assistance of the Comptroller of Public Ac-counts, shall use funds appropriated above toprepare a complete and detailed written reportindexing all statutorily required reports and provid-ing detail about the preparing agency, title of report,legal authority, due date, recipient, and a briefdescription. The report shall provide indexes by(1) preparing agency, (2) title of report, and(3) report recipient, and the detail section shall bearranged by preparing agency. This report shallinclude an assessment from each receiving agencyfor each statutorily requir ed report affirming or denying its continued usefulness to that agency. Thisreport shall be provided to the Governor and theLegislative Budget Board and made available to thepublic. The following rider should be included in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill for the Comptroller of PublicAccounts: Report of Reports.

INCLUDE SUNSET PROVISION FOR NEW REPORTS Statutorily required reports currently remain in use until the laws requiring them are repealed by the legislature. Recom- mendation 3 suggests that the legislature add sunset language to the laws requiring all future reports to discon-tinue them after six years unless another termination pointis specified by the legislature. The legislature has included automatic expiration language in many areas of current statute. This recommendationwould also align the statutory requirement for reports withthe concept behind the sunset process for state agencies. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS There is no significant fiscal impact from implementing these recommendations. It is assumed that TSLAC wouldbe able to compile the Report of Reports and surveyagencies about the usefulness of their reports usingpresently available resources. Because the process eachagency uses to produce its statutorily required reports isunique, quantifying the staff time saved, printing costs, andstorage costs saved by eliminating unnecessary reportscannot be specifically quantified. Eliminating unnecessaryreports is unlikely to lead to reductions in staff, buteliminating superfluous reporting requirements wouldenable staff to spend time on more productive tasks.CaliforniaCaliforniaCaliforniaCaliforniaCalifornia \u2014The California Performance Review recommended sunset language for all current and future required reports in the California Education Code with a maximum life of two years, unless specificallyidentified for a different lifespan by the legislature. Another recommen- dation identified and eliminated duplicative reports. VermontVermontVermontVermontVermont\u2014In January 2004, the State of Vermont Agency of Administra- tion compiled a list of all statutorily required reports and recommended that state agencies identify obsolete reports. WashingtonWashingtonWashingtonWashingtonWashington \u2014The Web site of the Governor of the State of Washington lists eliminating unnecessary reports as a priority for governmentefficiency. FloridaFloridaFloridaFloridaFlorida \u2014Florida's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability has recommended eliminating unnecessary reports as aperformance review component.FIGURE 2 STEPS TAKEN BY OTHER STATES TOREDUCE UNNECESSARY REPORTS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes riders requiring TSLAC to assume responsibilityfor the Report of Reports and the CPA to assist TSLAC inpreparing this report. There are no adjustments to appro-priations based on these recommendations.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 4ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR STATE AGENCIESSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA TURE BUDGET ARD 5FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUES REL ATED TO TEXAS HOMEL AND SECURITY From September 11, 2001 through August 30, 2004 Texas state agencies were allocated over $854.4 million in Federal Funds to improve the state's homeland security infrastructure. The following sections identify federal allocations to the state for homeland security and pre- paredness and detail associated state general revenue costs. Issues of concern include ongoing costs for administration, equipment, staff, maintenance, and training as Federal Funds are shifted or dissipate. SIGNIFIC ANT FINDINGS uThe Texas Homeland Security Strategic Plan identifies port security, cargo container inspec- tion, interoperability technology, and development of prevention strategies as ongoing costs required to strengthen the state's homeland security infrastructure. uFederal appropriations for fiscal year 2005 changed funding levels of key homeland security programs. Texas allocations for National Homeland Security Grants for States are reduced by $37.0 million, and Hospital Preparedness Grants by $2.7 million. Urban Area Security Initiative Grants were increased by $11.6 million, and Texas will receive $3.0 million under the new federal Metropolitan Medical Response System Program. uState agencies and institutions of higher education have requested $19.5 million in baseline General Revenue Funds for homeland security in the 2006-07 biennium, most of which has been requested by the Office of the Governor (for disaster assistance unrelated to terrorism), the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission and the Texas Engineering Extension Service. uThe Department of Public Safety has requested funding in fiscal year s 2006 and 20 07 for five homeland security related Exceptional Items. These items total $43.2 million in State Highway Fund 6 and $22.5 million in federal National Asset Seizure funds. The Exceptional Items are an Emergency Vehicle Operations Course, an In-Car Computer Project, the Criminal Intelligence Bureau's Texas Security Alert and Analysis Center, a Driver 's License Reengineering Project, and a Driver 's License Image Verification System.SIGNIFIC ANT CONCERN uThe state may retain up to 20 percent of National Homeland Security Grants for States and Urban Area Security Initiative Grants for its own purposes, as well as 3 percent for administration, for a total estimated amount of $54.6 million for the 2006-07 biennium. In fiscal year 2004, the Texas Engineering Extension Service distributed 98 percent of all National Homeland Security Grants for States to local jurisdictions. RECOMMENDA TION uThe Department of Public Safety and the Texas Engineering Extension Service should examine whether homeland security related Exceptional Item requests for the 2006-07 biennium could be funded with Federal Funds. COMMENTS In fiscal year 2001 the governor established a task force on homeland security to conduct a survey and assessment of Texas' preparedness and security needs. The task force gave the state high marks for its overall security capabili- ties. In December 2001, the U.S. Congress passed the first homeland security appropriations legislation, which included funding to assist states with local security improvements. A state preparedness and needs assess- ment was conducted and a plan was submitted in fiscal year 2002 for federal approval. Federal distribution of homeland security funds to Texas state agencies began in March of 2002. State preparedness and assessment survey areas are listed in Figure 1. STATE HOMELAND SECURITY PLAN REQUIREMENTS Each state is required to maintain a federally approved homeland security plan. The first Texas Homeland Security Strategic Plan was completed in March of 2002. It addresses the coordinated and comprehensive use of state resources and federal funding to deter, detect, and respond to terrorism. The Texas Homeland Security Strategic Plan lists four critical mission areas: uintelligence and warning; BUDGET BO ARD 6FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUES RELA TED TO TEXAS HOMELAND SECURITY Ongoing costs related to the four mission areas identified in the Texas Homeland Security Strategic Plan include cargo container inspection, port security, interoperability technology, and development of prevention strategies through surveillance and other methods. The plan also delineates clear lines of authority and communication for government officials, law enforcement, and emergency response personnel. Local security and preparedness assessments are an important tool in piecing the plan together and justifying Federal Funds for communities and the state as a whole. A total of 928 local security and preparedness assessments were completed as of June 2004. It is expected that 98 percent of local entities will be assessed by December 2004. IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE HOMELAND SECURITY LEGISLATION In 2003, the Seventy-eighth Legislature passed House Bill 9, which directs the state to prepare for all threats whether man-made, natural, or terrorist in nature. In addition, House Bill 9 established the Governor's Office of Home- land Security, a Director of Homeland Security, and a Critical Infrastructure Protection Council. The Director of Homeland Security is responsible for overseeing the Critical Infrastructure and Protection Council; state, federal and interstate relations; coordination of the State Home- land Security Strategic Plan; classified intelligence matters with state and federal law enforcement; liaison withcouncils of government; coordination with state adminis- tering agencies of state homeland security grants; and oversight of the Governor's Division of Emergency Management. Council membership consists of the gover- nor or his designee and representatives from designated state agencies. ENHANCEMENTS TO TEXAS HOMELAND SECURITY SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 Federal grants have made up the lion's share of funds expended for enhancements to Texas' homeland security preparedness, response capabilities, and security infrastruc- ture since the events of September 11, 2001. Texas state agencies have been allocated over $854.4 million in new Federal Funds for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 (see Figure 2). As Figure 3 shows, three agencies account for 92.1 percent of Federal Funds allocated to Texas for homeland security. The following are examples of how Federal Funds have been used in Texas for homeland security: uDepartment of State Health Services (DSHS)\u2014 Texas received $171.5 million in Federal Funds from fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for Public Health Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response grants. Funds have been used to develop communi- cations and information technology tools for the Health Alert Network and to enhance the capabili- ties of 10 biology labs statewide. Approximately $13.5 million was devoted to these purposes for areas along the Mexican border. The department has been allocated a total of $76.7 million in Hospital Bioterrorism Preparedness grants, of which $5.8 million has been distributed to hospitals in counties bordering Mexico. uDepartment of Public Safety (DPS)\u2014In fiscal year 2003, approximately $2 million in Byrne Law Enforcement grants was expended for counter- terrorism training, establishment of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, and improvements to information technology infrastructure. uGovernor's Division of Emergency Management\u2014 The agency purchased and installed improved surveillance and information technology at Central Command Headquarters in Austin. It provided coordination, training and reference materials to Texas communities and first responders; coordi- nated and maintained several response and pre- paredness teams statewide; and enhanced the Texas Amber Alert Network, a warning system.FIGURE 1 STATE PREP AREDNESS ASSESSMENT AREAS uCommand and Control uCritical Infrastructure Assessment uContinuity of Operations/Continuity of Government Plans uEmergency Operating Plan uCredible Threat Information uOperational Coordination uCommunications uProtective Recommendations uMutual Plan, Public uTraining uExercises uLaws and Authorities uHealth and Medical uFacilities and Logistics uCritical Infrastructure Mitigation uPersonnel Resources uEquipment and Supplies SOURCE : Office of the Governor.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA BUDGET BO ARD 7FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUES RELA TED TO TEXAS HOMELAND SECURITY FIGURE 2 TEXAS HOMEL AND SECURITY FEDERAL FUNDS BY ST ATE AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUC ATION (IN MILLIONS) Texas Engineering Extension Service National Homeland Security Program Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention $25.9 $25.9 State Homeland Security Administration Urban Galveston National Biocontainment Laboratory $110.1 $110.1 Center for Biodefense Grants $70.9 $70.9 Subtotal $229.3 $229.3 Department of State Health Preparedness and Response $54.0 $68.9 $17.2 Subtotal $17.2 $17.2 Department of Public Safety Byrne Criminal Justice Grants $1.0 $1.2 $2.2 Local Law Enforcement Grants $1.8 $1.8 State and Local All Hazards $8.3 Subtotal $1.8 $6.5 $8.3 The 2004 TOTAL (CONTINUED T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA BUDGET BO ARD 8FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUES RELA TED TO TEXAS HOMELAND SECURITY FIGURE 2 (CONTINUED) TEXAS HOMEL AND SECURITY FEDERAL FUNDS BY ST ATE AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUC ATION (IN MILLIONS) STATE AGENCY/INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUC ATION FY 2002 FY 2003 FY 2004 TOTAL $5.3 $0.9 $6.2 Subtotal $5.3 $0.9 $6.2 Texas Biowatch Monitoring Program $4.2 $4.2 Water Protection Counter Terrorism $0.2 $0.2 Subtotal $0.2 $5.7 $5.9 The University of Texas at San Antonio Center for Information Assurance and Security $2.5 $2.5 Information $0.3 $3.0 Texas Diagnostic Labs $2.0 $2.0 Subtotal $2.0 $2.0 The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Bioterrorism Training and Curriculum Development $1.1 $1.1 Texas Medical Rangers $0.1 $0.1 Subtotal $1.2 $1.2 Texas Department of Survey Program $0.3 $0.3 Subtotal $0.3 $0.3 Texas Animal Health Commission Plant and Animal Disease Control and Care Grant $0.3 $1.0 $1.3 Subtotal $0.3 $1.0 $1.3 The University of Texas Health Center at Tyler Health Care Facilities and Other Construction Legislative Budget Board and all the agencies listed. uTexas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX)\u2014 During fiscal years 2001 through 2004, TEEX administered approximately $309.8 million in homeland security funds. Grants were distributed to local entities for training and equipping first responders, law enforcement officers in terrorism prevention, and Citizen Corps volunteers. TEEX also maintains Task Force 1, a rapid-response team for major emergencies and disasters. In coopera-tion with the councils of government, TEEX conducted 928 security and preparedness needs assessments in communities throughout the state. uTEEX will also be administering Port Security Grants beginning in fiscal year 2005. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a new round of Port Security Grants on September 13, 2004. According to the report, Texas will receiveSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA BUDGET BO ARD 9FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUES RELA TED TO TEXAS HOMELAND SECURITY 15 grants totaling $8.2 million for port security enhancements this fiscal year. uTexas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)\u2014In fiscal year 2002 the department expended $40.8 million in North American Free Trade Agreement transportation funds to improve border inspection facilities and other security concerns. Also, TXDOT recently announced that it has received an additional $28 million in discretionary funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation to enhance border security crossings and state inspection stations.TEXAS FISCAL YEAR 2005 FEDERAL HOMELAND SECURITY ALLOCATIONS In October 2004, Congress passed legislation affecting federal funding for homeland security. This legislation will require federal agencies to meet a list of conditions and obtain Congressional approval before spending money on new projects, such as the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program, an entry-exit program, and Secure Flight, a passenger-screening pro- gram. Funds cannot be spent on any future contracts with companies incorporated overseas.

Congress appropriated $33.1 billion in fiscal year 2005 for homeland security, $2.8 billion more than fiscal year 2004. However, Congress reduced fiscal year 2005 appropriations for National Homeland Security Grants for States, Public Health Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Grants, and Hospital Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Grants. Texas' estimated allocation for the grants is reflected in Figure 4, showing a $35.2 million decrease from fiscal year 2004. Current National Homeland Security Grants for States funding formulas guarantee each state 0.75 percent of available funds. This set-aside accounts for 40 percent of Federal Funds to states, leaving only 60 percent to be distributed on the basis of population. This allocation methodology results in disparities on a per capita basis. For example, in fiscal year 2004, California received only $9.03 per capita in homeland security grants from the Office of Domestic Preparedness while Wyoming received $37.60 per capita. Texas ranked 44th in the nation, receiving $7.07 per capita. Congress shifted funding from National Homeland Security Grants for States to expand or enhance otherprograms, such as US-VISIT, which uses biometrics for fingerprint and photo identification, and increased Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grants for at-risk metro- politan areas. MINIMIZING IMPACT ON STATE GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS AND OTHER FUNDS Legislative appropriation requests for the 2006-07 bien- nium indicate that state agencies and institutions of higher education identified a total of $35.5 million in General Revenue Funds during the 2002-03 and 2004-05 biennia used for homeland security (see Figures 5 and 6). Included in this number is $15.5 million in unused Disaster Funds carried forward by the Office of the Governor. General Revenue-Dedicated Funds and other funding sources totaled $28.4 million over this time period. Some of these funds were expended before Federal Funds became available. Some were required because the expense did not meet guidelines for federal grant funding. A total of $19.5 million in baseline General Revenue Funds is requested for the 2006-07 biennium, as well as $14.0 million in baseline General Revenue-Dedicated Funds and Other Funds. The DPS has requested funding for five homeland security related Exceptional Items for fiscal years 2006-07.

DPS' Exceptional Item requests would fund an Emergency Vehicle Operations Course, an In-Car Computer Project, the Criminal Intelligence Bureau's Texas Security Alert and Analysis Center, a Driver's License Reengineering Project, and a Driver's License Image Verification System. Federal guidelines for State Homeland Security Grants and UASI grants permit states to retain up to 20 percent of the funds for state and local needs. Funds may be used for planning and coordination, infrastructure maintenance, training, equipment purchases, and replacement costs. The funding available to the state from these sources totals approximately $47.0 million for the 2006-07 biennium. The state may also retain up to 3 percent of total funds for administrative costs related to the grants. Funding available to the state for administrative costs is approximately $7.6 million for the 2006-07 biennium. The total from both grant resources over the course of the biennium is esti- mated at $54.6 million. These funds must be appropriated according to the State Homeland Strategic Plan and in accordance with federal guidelines. It is recommended that DPS and TEEX examine whether homeland security related Exceptional Item requests for the 2006-07 bien- nium could be funded with State Homeland Security Grants, UASI grants, or any other federal homeland security grants administered by the state. MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS TO TEXAS FEDERALLY FUNDED HOMELAND SECURITY PROGRAMS Should Federal Funds for homeland security diminish over the years, state agencies may request state funds to maintain equipment, personnel, planning, and infrastructure originally acquired with federal dollars. As previously mentioned, recently passed federal appropriations for homeland security shift some funding into new or ex- panded programs and reduce others. Homeland security programs are new, and priorities change as requirements become more clearly defined. As the states and the federal government update or improve old security structures, they discover additional risks that need to be addressed to make the nation more secure. The focus of funding for the last three years has been on preparedness and response. Security experts are now advising the nation to turn its attention to prevention strategies. These new strategies will involve investments in a variety of technology and research categories, as well as improvements in surveillance tech- niques and mechanisms. The following initiatives provide examples of emerging investments in security planned for Texas:uThe Homeland Security National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense, located at Texas A&M University, will receive $18 million over the next three years to partner with higher educa- tion, industry, and government to address potential threats to animal agriculture. uThe University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston will receive over $110.1 million for construction and the purchase of equipment for one of two national, large-scale biological research facilities focusing on new and emerging disease threats. Also, the existing Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases received over $48 million for construction, equipment and research to develop medical countermeasures against viruses considered likely to be used as weapons by bioterrorists. uOn September 13, 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a new program for bus security. Texas will receive approximately $2.1 million in Federal Funds to be distributed among eight communities. The grants will be used for security equipment for public transportation vehicles and bus facility security enhancements. The U.S. Congress is considering changes to the funding formula for states in both houses. The U.S. House of Representatives may require a 25 percent state match for National Homeland Security Grants for States. Both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate are consid- ering universal identification systems for all U.S. residents. State information and data technology systems would be required to meet minimum federal standards for the universal identification program, but funding to assist states in meeting the federal standards has not been authorized. Unfunded federal mandates are also a possibility with homeland security. For instance on July 22, 2004, the president issued an executive order directing the federal government to address the safety and security needs of people with disabilities in emergency situations, includ- ing both natural and man-made disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and acts of terrorism. The order creates the Interagency Coordinating Council on Emergency Preparedness and Individuals with Disabili- ties to oversee the implementation of policy. The council is expected to make recommendations to the executive branch in July 2005, but no funding has been allocated in the federal budget for implementation of the council's initiatives.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO BUDGET BO ARD 13FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUES RELA TED TO TEXAS HOMELAND SECURITY FISCAL IMP ACT OF THE RECOMMENDA TION Texas agencies and institutions of higher education identified approximately $35.5 million in General Revenue Funds and $28.4 million in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds and Other Funds for homeland security purposes from fiscal years 2002 through 2005. Agencies and institutions of higher education submitted baseline requests of $19.5 million in General Revenue Funds and $14.0 million in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds and Other Funds for the 2006-07 biennium. DPS is requesting funding in fiscal year s 2006 and 20 07 for five E xceptional Items totaling $ 43.2 million in State Highway Fund 6 and $22.5 million in federal National Asset Seizure funds, which may qualify for available federal National Homeland Security Grants for States. Over the 2006-07 biennium, the state could retain up to $54.6 million in federal Homeland Security grant funds that are currently distributed to local entities. No provision to implement the report recommendation has been included in the introduced 2006-07 General Appro- priations BUDGET BO ARD 14FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUES RELA TED TO TEXAS HOMELAND SECURITYSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 15IMPROVE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE-FUNDED AIR EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAMS Through better management and oversight of pass-through expenditures for improved air quality, the state couldultimately achieve savings in General Revenue-DedicatedFunds and perhaps increase the amount of credit the stateis receiving for air quality-r elated spending. The Texas Emissions Reduction Plan, operated by the Texas Commis-sion on Environmental Quality, and the CongestionMitigation and Air Quality program, operated by localmetropolitan planning organizations but funded mainlywith Federal Funds provided through the Texas Depart-ment of Transportation, both provide substantial amountsof funding for projects aimed at reducing the amount ofpollutants emitted by vehicles in areas deemed to benonattainment for federal air quality standards. Projects seeking funding through the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan program must demonstrate a minimumlevel of cost-effectiveness defined in statute for removingeach ton of nitrous oxides, whereas Congestion Mitigationand Air Quality projects need only demonstrate that theywill benefit air quality. Likewise, all Texas EmissionsReduction Plan projects contribute toward meetingobligations in the State Implementation Plan submitted tothe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to demonstratethe state's commitment to emissions reductions, whereasonly a portion of Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality-funded projects receive an y credit in the State Implementa- tion Plan. Furthermore, there cur rently is no clear basis for comparison for cost-effectiveness between Texas Emis-sions Reduction Plan and Congestion Mitigation and AirQuality projects. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bTexas needs to be in compliance with the FederalClean Air Act or could face sanctions by theEnvironmental Protection Agency. The exact criteriafor being in compliance are somewhat uncertain atthis time, because the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency is moving from a one-hour standard fordefining acceptable ozone levels to an eight-hourstandard. However, it does appear certain that Texaswill continue to need to spend significant funds onmeasures, such as the Texas Emissions ReductionPlan and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality, toreduce ozone levels through quantifiable nitrousoxide emissions reductions. \u008bSignificant expenditures on emissions reductions are made by metropolitan planning organizations usingfederal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality fundsreceived by the Texas Department of Transporta-tion (approximately $80 million to $100 million peryear since the early 1990s). However, the portion ofCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality expendituresgoing to projects achieving quantifiable emissionsreductions in the State Implementation Plan is notclear. \u008bThere are no cost-effectiveness criteria required forCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality projectselection, as there are with the Texas EmissionsReduction Plan program. Furthermore, there is noclear basis of comparison for the cost-effectivenessof the two programs. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill that directs the TexasDepartment of Transportation to require allCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality-fundedprojects to achieve some credit within the StateImplementation Plan. \u008bRecommendation 2: Include a common perfor- mance measure related to dollars spent per tonreduction in nitrous oxides in the 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill for the Texas Commission onEnvironmental Quality and the Texas Departmentof Transportation. \u008bRecommendation 3: Require the Texas Depart- ment of Transportation and the Texas Commissionon Environmental Quality to collaborate onestablishing cost-effectiveness guidelines forCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality projects andplay a greater role in determining whether metro-politan planning organization spending plansmaximize use of state funds in terms of populationreductions. COMMENTS For the 2006-07 biennium, state agencies have requestedmore than a total of $670.0 million for strategies toSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 16IMPROVE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE-FUNDED AIR EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAMS reduce air pollution in Texas. The bulk of that funding (more than $507.5 million) would come from two major pass-through programs: the Congestion Mitigation andAir Quality program (CMAQ), through which the TexasDepartment of Transportation (TxDOT) providesFederal Funds (an estimated $196 million for the 2006-07biennium) to local governments in areas considered to benon-attainment for the federal ozone standard for avariety of road, bicycles paths, transit and vehicle pro-grams; and the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP)program, through which the Texas Commission onEnvironmental Quality provides state fee funding(General Revenue-Dedicated TERP Account requestedfunding totals $311.1 million for the 2006-07 biennium)in the form of grants to private and public entities toretrofit and replace high polluting diesel engines. The TERP program was created by the Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, for one imperative reason: to achievecredit in the Statewide Implementation Plan (SIP) forozone reductions in the Dallas and Houston areas or facethe possibility of sanctions against the state for failing tomeet EPA standards. The program was set up with cost-efficiency requirements\u2014only pr ojects shown to achieve a reduction in pollution at a cost of less than $13,000 per tonof nitrous oxide per day removed from the air are eligiblefor funding. Recently, the agency has been able to achievean average cost of around $6,000 per ton. Texas began receiving CMA Q funding from the Federal Highway Administration in 1992. Since then, over $1.2billion has been spent on a variety of projects, all of whichmust have some benefit to air quality. However, the CMAQprogram does not require that cost-efficiency standards beused in determining project eligibility, nor is there anyrequirement that a project receive SIP credit. Ther efore, a portion of the nearly $100 million per year Texas isreceiving in CMAQ funds goes to projects achievingminimal quantifiable benefits to air quality and a level ofSIP credit that appears low, based on the limited compa-rable data available, when compared to TERP levels. The Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) requires Texas to meet certain air quality standards by limiting the amount ofcertain pollutants in the air. Those standards are adminis-tered by the U.S. EPA. Under the CAA, the TCEQdevelops a SIP to address air quality. The SIP includes a setof rules to be implemented in \"nonattainment\" areas, orthose areas exceeding EPA standards for particular airpollutants. In Texas, the major pollutants that cause areas tobe considered \"nonattainment\" are known as \"nitrousoxides\" (NOx). NOx mixes with volatile organic com-pounds to form ground level ozone, which has beendetermined to cause or at least aggravate health problemsamong humans.Prior to 2001, nonattainment was determined based on one-hour ozone readings. In that year, the EPA promul-gated a new standard, based on readings over an eight-hourperiod. That new rule was challenged in court, and today the eight-hour standard remains in EPA rules, but has notbeen fully implemented. Texas thus currently operatesunder both systems. Nonattainment areas are classified based on the extent to which they exceed air quality standards. The one-hourstandard had the following classifications: marginal,moderate, serious, severe, and extreme. Under the eight-hour standard, a \"nonattainment deferred\" classification isadded for areas with slightly better air quality than themarginal areas. Under the one-hour standard, Texas had four nonattainment Houston-Galveston-Br Worth and moderate. Under the eight-hour classification,Houston-Galveston-Brazoria and Dallas-Fort Worth areconsidered moderate, while Beaumont-Port Arthurbecomes marginal. Currently, the three areas that had been considered nonattainment under the one-hour ozonestandard and continue to be considered nonattainmentunder the eight-hour standard have submitted SIPs to theEPA. Only one, Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, has had its SIP approved by the EPA. The Dallas-Fort Worth SIP has never been approved due to a lawsuit filed soon after it wassubmitted to EPA, and the EPA has never officiallyapproved the Beaumont-Port Arthur SIP. Because theseareas lack an approved SIP, they could face sanctions by theEPA. The Dallas-Fort Worth area, for example, could besubject to transportation nonconformity status as soon asJune 2005. Under the eight-hour standard, San Antonio has entered into an early action compact (EAC), a voluntary version ofa SIP, resulting in their nonattainment designation beingtemporarily deferred. As near-nonattainment areas, Austin-San Marcos and East Texas (Tyler-Longview) also have entered into an EAC to prevent the area from beingdesignated in the future as nonattainment. In addition,Corpus Christi and Victoria also are considered to be near-nonattainment. El Paso is a rela tive success story in that the area now met the one-hour standard and will be seeking amaintenance designation from the EPA. For a summary ofEPA designations and SIP status for Texas areas, seeFigure 1. CONTROL STRATEGIES IN THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN Strategies are implemented in nonattainment and near- nonattainment areas, as well as statewide, to improve airquality and to ensure that these areas will achieve orSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 17IMPROVE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE-FUNDED AIR EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAMS maintain attainment status. These strategies prescribe requirements that generally become stricter and morenumerous as an area moves fr om one classification level to another. Areas in nonattainment areas also become eligiblefor funding from the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality(CMAQ) program administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). More funding is available toentities in the severe and serious categories than in themarginal and moderate categories. According to the TCEQ , the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area might be expected to achieve attainment status under ashortened timeline because its attainment status under theeight-hour standard would be moderate, rather than severeas under the one-hour standard. At the same time, theamount of CMAQ funding the state receives will likely be reduced, since the classifications f or each area actually are improving under the eight-hour standard. This could resultin the need for more drastic control measures, including asignificant increase in the need for TERP expenditures. Control strategies contained in the SIPs aim to reduce air pollution, and in most areas strategies focus on reducingnitrous oxides (NOx), the precursor to ground-level ozone.Each control strategy aims to achieve a targeted reductionin the number of tons of pollutants being emitted byidentifiable \"point\" sources, such as industrial facilities, andby less identifiable \"nonpoint\" sources, such as vehicles,construction equipment, and lawn equipment. The TCEQ estimates the number of tons of each pollut- ant, such as NOx or particulate matter, that eachnonattainment area must eliminate through these controlstrategies, and the SIP includes a listing of each strategyand the expected number of tons in daily emissions.Control strategies in the SIPs submitted for Houston-Galveston and Dallas-Fort Worth did not originally achieveall of the reductions necessary for these areas to reach attainment status. The difference between the reduction intons achieved by the SIP and the amount necessary for thearea to reach attainment is known as the area's emissions\"gap.\" The gaps in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria andDallas-Fort Worth SIPs were filled using credits from theTexas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP). THE TEXAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS PLAN PROGRAM Senate Bill 5, Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, created the TERP as an incentive-based program to achieve NOxreductions. The TERP program was modified by HouseBill 1365, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003,and by House Bill 37, Sev enty-eighth Legislature, Third Called Session. TERP programs receiving funding include a diesel engine reduction incentive program and a newtechnology research and development program. The dieselengine reduction incentive prog ram is the only TERP program with a quantified NOx emissions reductions targetcontained in the SIP. TERP funding comes from various fees on construction equipment, but the largest portion of TERP funding comesfrom a $15 to $25 fee paid when a vehicle title is trans-ferred from one individual to another. Revenues to theTERP account in fiscal year 2004 totaled $143 million andare expected to increase to $158 million by fiscal year 2007.Figure 2 illustrates the level of TERP revenues from fiscal years 2003 through 2007. Provisions in Texas Health and Safety Code, \u00a7 386.106, require that projects achieve emissions reductions of atleast one ton of NOx per year for every $13,000 inassistance provided, or $4.7 million per ton of NOxreduced per day. By statute, 89.5 percent of all TERPFIGURE 1 EPA DESIGNATIONS FOR OZONE STATUS OF TEXAS AREAS Austin-San Marcos Near Nonattainment Near Nonattainment EAC1 Beaumont-Port Arthur Moderate Marginal Approved SIP Corpus Christi Near Nonattainment Near Nonattainment None Dallas-Fort Worth Serious Moderate SIP Pending East Texas (Tyler-Longview) Near Nonattainment Near Nonattainment EAC1 El Paso Serious Attainment2Approved SIP Houston-Galveston-Brazoria Severe Moderate Approved SIP San Antonio Near Nonattainment EAC Victoria Near STANDARD SIP STATUS NOTES: 1 EAC= Early Action Compact 2 El Paso remains nonattainment for PM-10 (particulate matter) under the 8-Hour Standard.

TCEQ reports that in fiscal year 2004, theagency awarded a second round of grant awards consist-ing of $80.9 million. These projects had an average costper ton of NOx removed of only $5,960, less than halfof the statutory requirement. The TCEQ reports thatdemand for TERP funds exceeded the supply of fundsavailable in the General Revenue-Dedicated TERPAccount No. 5071 by over $275 million in the fiscal year2004 grant funding cycle. CONGESTION MITIGATION AND AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (CMAQ) The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) administers the CMAQ as a funding source f or transportation projects that will contribute to attainment of national air qualitystandards in nonattainment areas. Since 1992, Texas hasreceived over $1.2 billion in CMAQ funds from FHWA. Tothis point, all of the CMAQ funds have been designatedfor projects in the state' s four nonattainment areas under the one-hour ozone standard, with each area receiving anallocation of the funding based on population and aweighting factor determined by how severe the area's airpollution problems are. Figure 3 gives a breakdown ofCMAQ apportionments by metropolitan planning organiza-tion (MPO) from 1998 to 2004. All CMAQ projects require a 20 percent match, which is usually paid for by the local government entities, butTxDOT can also pay for the match requirement if the project is part of the state highway system, and recently TERP funds have been used as the required match. There are various types of projects that are eligible for CMAQ funding, including, but not limited to the following: \u008bintersection and traffic flow improvements; \u008bhike and improved public pool programs; \u008bon road diesel engine r etrofits and replacement programs (Clean Vehicles); \u008balternatively fueled vehicle programs; and \u008bthe construction of high-occupancy vehicle lanes. In addition, all CMAQ projects m ust conform to an area's transportation improvement plan, and CMAQ funds maynot be used to create or expand single occupancy vehiclecapacity. In all cases, CMAQ projects must demonstratesome benefit to a region's air quality. Although the FHWArequires an annual repor t from each state quantifying emissions reductions from CMAQ projects, the FHWAdoes not require projects to recei ve credit in a SIP . One restriction on CMAQ projects is that they must benefithighway users (i.e., no off-road projects).FIGURE 2 REVENUES TO THE GENERAL REVENUE-DEDICATED TEXAS EMISSIONS ACCOUNT FY 2007In Millions SOURCES : Comptroller of Public Accounts; Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 19IMPROVE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE-FUNDED AIR EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAMS METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS TxDOT is the recipient of CMAQ funds in Texas. TxDOT delegates project selection to each area's metro-politan planning organization (MPO). TxDOT does notimpose any additional criteria on MPOs in their selectionprocess. As long as a project meets CMAQ guidelines, it isup to each local community to decide what type ofprojects it will fund and the order in which projects willbe implemented. TxDOT has no requirement thatprojects receive any credit in the SIP . MPOs do generallypledge to TCEQ to achieve certain emissions reductionsfor purposes of the SIP , but those pledges are notnecessarily tied to CMAQ funding. The TCEQ works with TxDOT and MPOs to calculate emissions reductions resulting from CMAQ projects.Although TCEQ is the agency responsible for ensuring that regions in Texas attain air quality standards, TCEQ has noinput into selection criteria by MPOs regarding CMAQfunding priorities. Although some CMAQ projects areselected that have substantial benefits to air quality, manyprojects fail to gain any credit toward the SIP. MPOs are each responsible for a portion of SIP credit. Each makes a pledge to reduce a target number of tons perday (tpd) of NOx from tw o categories of projects: transportation control measures (TCM) and voluntarymobile emissions reductions program (VMEP). TheH-GAC is responsible for coming up with measures toachieve a 10.6 tpd reduction in NOx for TCMs and a 7 tpdreduction of NOx for VMEP projects. The NCTCOGwould be responsible for a 4.7 tpd reduction of NOx forTCMs and a 1.6 tpd to 4.6 tpd reduction for VMEPprojects in the proposed Dallas-Fort Worth SIP . However,not all of these reductions are necessarily a result ofCMAQ expenditures. Moreover, MPOs do not seem totrack the amount of CMAQ spending that is contributingto the attainment of a specific amount of NOx reductions in the SIP . The TCEQ has specific targets in the SIP for NOx reductions: 38.8 tpd in Houston-Galveston-Brazoria and22.2 tpd in Dallas-Fort Worth, for example. In addition tothe fact that TCEQ must require any TERP grant requestto meet the $13,000 tpd statutory limit, all grant funds arespecifically tied to a portion of the NOx reduction in theSIP . Every TERP dollar spent on grants therefore attributesto some quantifiable NOx reduction, while NOx reduc-tions for projects funded by CMAQ remain unquantified. Over the past several years, MPOs have been programming a greater amount of funding to the Clean Vehicles pro-gram, thereby funding projects that would also be eligiblefor TERP diesel emissions reduction grant funds. Presum-ably, these projects should be able to achieve cost-effective-ness results similar to TERP-funded projects, although datacomparisons currently do not appear to be available. Inaddition, in some cases the amount of funds provided forsuch projects represents only a portion of CMAQ funding.For example, the North Central Texas Council of Govern-ments (NCTCOG), the Dallas-Fort Worth area MPO,reports that of $122.2 million in CMAQ funds pro-grammed for 2003, including funds from prior year'sallocations, only $13.7 million was programmed for CleanVehicles projects. In 2004, of over $100 million in pro-grammed CMAQ funds, only $4 million was for the CleanVehicles program. The H-GAC reports that essentially all of its CMAQ funding, and even a portion of its non-CMAQ funding, forfiscal years 2005 and 2006 is going to the Clean Vehiclesprogram. This demonstrates that the H-GAC is taking anaggressive approach to achieving NOx reductions. How-ever, it is not clear what amount of SIP credit each projectis receiving. Recommendation 1 would require that allFIGURE 3 ANNUAL CONGESTION MITIGATION AND AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM APPORTIONMENT BY METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION (IN MILLIONS) 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 FISCAL YEAR APPORTIONMENT SOURCE : Texas Department of Transportation.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 20IMPROVE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE-FUNDED AIR EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAMS projects receiving CMAQ funding also receive SIP credit, and that the amount of SIP cr edit as it relates to each project be made clear. The following rider language toimplement this recommendation could be included in the2006-07 General Appropriations Bill: The Department of Transportation shall require that any project recei ving Federal Funds from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality ImprovementProgram receive quantifiable credit in the StateImplementation Plan (SIP) toward attaining attain-ment for air quality under the Federal Clean Air Act.In addition, each funded project shall have anamount of SIP credit tied to it, and TxDOT shallprovide a report listing each project, the amount ofcredit each project will receive in the SIP, and theamount of CMAQ funds designated for each projectto the Legislative Budget Board and Governor atleast annually. Since the project-by-project detail currently compiled by the H-GAC and NCTCOG currently uses a completelydifferent methodology than the TCEQ in calculating theemissions reductions assigned to each project, it isvirtually impossible to compare the cost-effectiveness ofthe CMAQ and TERP programs. Recommendation 2would require both and TCEQ to report on the cost-effectiveness of CMAQ and TERP expenditures, respectively, and that cost-effectiveness should bereported using a common methodology. Because TCEQis responsible for ensuring compliance with the Clean AirAct for the state, and because TCEQ already has aperformance measure for Average Cost Per Ton ofNitrous Oxides Reduced Per Year through Texas Emis-sions Reduction Plan Expenditures, a similar measurecould be added to TxDOT's bill pattern in the General Appropriations Act. The T CEQ's proposed target for the efficiency measure for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 is$5,000, so a similar target is recommended for TxDOTwith respect to CMAQ expenditures. Because Federal CMAQ Funds appropriated to TxDOT and General Revenue-Dedicated TERP Funds appropri-ated to the TCEQ both are being spent to achieve acommon goals\u2014reduced air pollution and compliance withthe Federal Clean Air Act\u2014Recommendation 3 directs thetwo agencies to work more closely together on targetingfunding to projects and categories of projects that eachagency can fund while achieving the greatest benefits to airquality and SIP attainment at the lowest cost possible. Thetwo agencies should work together to establish cost-effectiveness guidelines for CMAQ projects and play agreater role in determining whether MPO spending plansmaximize use of state funds in terms of pollution reduc-tions. If it is determined that one program is less cost- effective than the other at achieving NOx reductions,funding at the less cost-effective agency should be targetedtoward more cost-effective project proposals. Any reduc-tion in the need for General Revenue-Dedicated TERPAccount funds would be a savings to the state. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS None of the recommendations, if implemented, would have a significant fiscal impact during the 2006-07biennium. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a rider and a performance measure pursuant toRecommendations 1 and 2, respectively.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 21IMPROVE THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS Like other purchasers of prescription drugs, Texas contin- ues to experience significant increases in the cost ofprescription drug benefits. In spite of cost-containmentstrategies such as restricting formularies, negotiating withproviders for favorable pricing, and increasing cost-sharingobligations for beneficiaries, the state's costs continue torise. These trends are expected to continue as pharmaceuti-cal manufacturers develop new drugs to manage acute andchronic illnesses, brand name prescription drug pricegrowth continues to exceed the rate of inflation, and thepopulation ages. While the state has recently implemented a number of innovative methods aimed at controlling this cost growth,many of these initiatives have been focused on limiting utilization. Efforts to improv e the way the state purchases prescription drugs have been limited by the fact that Texas,in general, manages its spending on prescription drugs inan uncoordinated manner. As a result, it is difficult for thestate to take advantage of the combined purchase volumeof its health benefit programs through consolidatedpharmaceutical purchasing. In an effort to enhance oversight of state cost-containment strategies and coordina tion of state pharmaceutical purchasing, the Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, createdthe Interagency Council on Pharmaceuticals Bulk Purchas-ing. This council is statutorily required, among other things,to analyze the practice of contracting with pharmacy benefit management vendors for services relating to thepurchase of prescription drugs. Many states are consideringconsolidating their state contracting for pharmaceuticalpurchasing to leverage a larger pool for negotiations withpharmacy benefit managers. Texas, through the InteragencyCouncil on Pharmaceuticals Bulk Purchasing, has hadlimited success in achieving consolidation of pharmaceuti-cals purchasing. Establishing a new Pharmaceutical CostManagement Office and giving it certain responsibilitieswith respect to drug purchasing would position Texas toeffectively implement strategies to offset the growth inpharmaceutical costs. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bTexas health programs spent over $6 billion in the2004-05 biennium on pharmaceutical purchasingand expect to spend more than $9 billion in the2006-07 biennium.\u008bThe Employees Retirement System, TeacherRetirement System, The University of Texas System,and Texas A&M University System each haveseparate contracts with pharmacy benefit managerswith different terms. \u008bOther states have successfully formed intra- andinterstate consolidated purchasing arrangements toenhance their ability to manage prescription drugcosts. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bDespite recent cost-containment efforts, newstrategies to control the increase in drug costs areneeded to limit further shifting of cost increases tobeneficiaries. Beneficiaries of certain Texas planscurrently pay between 30 and 40 percent of drugcosts. \u008bTexas manages its spending on prescription drugs inan uncoordinated manner and has had limitedsuccess in achieving consolidation of pharmaceuti-cal purchasing. As a result, it is more difficult for thestate to take advantage of the combined purchasevolume of its health benefits program to negotiatethe most favorable terms with pharmacy benefitmanagers and drug wholesalers. \u008bThe Interagency Council on Pharmaceuticals BulkPurchasing has encountered significant barriers toachieving its goals. \u008bStandardizing drug benefits may increase efficiencyby streamlining administrative functions. This couldlead to greater savings in state pharmaceuticalpurchasing. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend the Interagency Council on Pharmaceuticals Bulk Purchasing statuteto abolish the council, to create and fund a newPharmaceutical Cost Management Office, andestablish an advisory committee, comprised ofrepresentatives from all state drug-purchasingentities, to advise the Pharmaceutical Cost Manage-ment Office.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 22IMPROVE THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS \u008bRecommendation 2: Direct the Pharmaceutical Cost Management Office to implement and overseea statewide pharmaceutical purchasing program. COMMENTS Prescription drug costs in various state programs continueto rise. State spending including beneficiary cost sharing onprescription drugs is expected to increase from more than$6 billion in the 2004-05 biennium to approximately $9billion in the 2006-07 biennium. To address escalatingcosts, state entities have implemented a number of cost-containment strategies, including but not limited torestricting formularies, negotiating with providers forfavorable pricing, and increasing cost sharing obligationsfor beneficiaries. Entities that contract with the pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) have also implemented a number of cost-controlmeasures. These measures include preferred drug lists(PDL) and prior authorization (PA). A PDL is a listing ofprescription products selected by the Pharmaceutical andTherapeutics Committees of each drug plan as efficacious,safe, and cost-effective c hoices for the plan's beneficiaries. Medications that are not included on the PDL are usuallyavailable with the PA by the plan. Prior authorizationrequires physicians to obtain the plan's approval forobtaining drugs not on PDL by submitting request formsor by calling the plan. PBM-type entities also negotiate terms that directly affect drug costs. This includes neg otiation and review of the ingredient costs, determination of dispensing fees, andestablishment of maximum allowable costs for similarmedications in established drug classes. The plans cannegotiate lower reimbursement fees to the pharmacies bynarrowing pharmacy networks. Drug plans also encouragemail delivery of medications to beneficiaries. Drug planscan achieve significant cost reductions if more planparticipants receive their medication through mail deliverybecause plans typically receive larger discounts from PBMs for mail-delivered medications. In addition, to control increases in costs, health programs have established cost-sharing obligations for beneficiaries,which include deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance.Plans establish different tier s for drugs depending on their preferred status. Some tier s require significantly higher co- payments, which encourages plan participants to considerother medications. As a result of implementing cost-sharing obligations, beneficiaries of certain Texas planscontribute between 30 and 40 per cent of their prescription drug costs. As another cost control measure, drug plans either require mandatory generic substitution or encourage it by makingplan participants pay the difference between the brand and generic versions of the medication. Texas' Medicaid program, which is similar in its structure to the entities that contract with the PBMs, has also imple-mented cost-control measures, which include PDL, PA,expanded drug utilization review (DUR), and supplementalrebates. The Medicaid program negotiates supplementalrebates on the drugs included on the PDL. The MedicaidVendor Drug Program also negotiates prices reimbursed topharmacies, but it does not require Medicaid recipients topay a portion of the drug costs. PDLs and other measures are not applicable to the entities that purchase pharmaceuticals directl y from group purchas- ing organizations and wholesalers. Direct purchasingentities establish limited or close formularies to achievesavings. In addition, direct purchasing entities are research-ing whether they qualify to receive one of the mostfavorable pricing schedules ne gotiated by the federal government, which are known as 340B prices. One factor that limits the effectiveness of cost-contain- ment efforts is the fact that the state in general managesits multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical spending in anuncoordinated manner. Currently, prescription drugpurchasing is administered under 10 different programs,managed separately by at least seven different stateentities. Each program is focused on serving the specificneeds of a different group, such as employees, retirees ofstate agencies and their dependents, employees ofuniversities, and employees of public schools. In addition,prescription drugs are also provided to recipients ofpublic assistance and the institutionalized and incarcer-ated populations of Texas. While some savings have been achieved through these cost- containment efforts, the state's drug costs continue to rise.Effective enhancements to the coordination of statepharmaceuticals purchasing would result in greater savings. INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON PHARMACEUTICALS BULK PURCHASING To address increasing pharmaceutical costs and the uncoordinated manner in which state programs purchasedrugs, the Seventy-seventh Le gislature, 2001, created the Interagency Council on Pharmaceuticals Bulk Purchasing(council) and required it to do the following: \u008bDevelop procedures that member agencies mustfollow in the purchasing of pharmaceuticals unlessthe member agency can purchase the pharmaceuti-cals for a lower price than it can through the council. \u008bDesignate one member agency to be the centralpurchasing agency for purchasing pharmaceuticals.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 23IMPROVE THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS \u008bUse existing distribution networks, including wholesale and retail distributors, to distribute thepharmaceuticals. \u008bDevelop procedures under which the council maydisclose information relating to the prices thatmanufactures or wholesalers charge for pharmaceu- ticals according to the category of pharmaceutical. Council membership includes the Department of Health (TDH), the Department of Mental Health and MentalRetardation (MHMR), the Correctional Managed HealthCare Committee (TDCJ), the Employees RetirementSystem of Texas (ERS), the Teacher Retirement System(TRS), the Health and Human Services Commission(HHSC), and the Texas Building and Procurement Com-mission (TBPC). The council achieved its first objective by developing procedures that member agencies should follow in thepurchasing of pharmaceuticals. These procedures weredesigned separately for entities that buy drugs directlyfrom group purchasing organizations (GPO) or wholesal-ers, and entities that reimburse for the purchase ofpharmaceuticals. Procedures for both types of entitiesrequired agencies to compare prices to determine whichentities were receiving more favorable prices for thepharmaceuticals. Price comparison, if executed as it wasintended, could position the member agencies to negoti-ate better prices for state programs. Member agencies have regularly compared certain pricing information as directed by council procedures. However,because certain factors are not included in the pricinginformation compared, the utility of this practice is unclear.In particular, prices reported by agencies that use PBMsinclude only the average ingredient cost and dispensing feeand do not include the amount of rebate each agency hasnegotiated in its contracts, nor does this comparison takesinto account other differences in each plan, such asadministrative costs. This activity compares only therelative drug price and does not provide a comparison ofdrug costs. The council has encountered barriers in comparing detailed pricing information due to confidentiality issues. Statutoryprovisions governing the council's price comparison activityprohibit the council or its members from disclosing theprices charged by a specific manufacturer or wholesaler fora specific pharmaceutical. Information made confidentialby those provisions is also confidential while in thepossession of a member agency, which prohibits a councilmember representing an agency from sharing that informa-tion with his or her agency. The interpretation of theseprovisions by the Office of Attorney General, in part, ledto the HHSC Deputy Commissioner for Health Services in the letter to the Council of October 21, 2003 to state thatthe council's price information gathering activity is a\"meaningless activity.\" As a result, HHSC has requestedthat the council work with stakeholders to recommendstatutory changes that would improve the council'scapabilities in this regard. The council has not achieved its mandate to designate one member agency to be the central pharmaceutical purchas-ing agency for the state. The council reports that thisrequirement does not seem feasible and is not practicalgiven the differences in populations served by each agency,the dissimilar structure of agenc y programs, and that no agency has the resources or expertise to manage pharma- ceutical purchasing for all member agencies. The council has proven to be beneficial to entities that directly purchase pharmaceuticals from GPOs or wholesal-ers, which include TDCJ and former TDH Asdirected by the council's procedures, TDH and MHMRwere able to successfully negotiate a joint contract with apharmaceutical wholesaler leveraging lower pricing basedon their combined purchase volume. The council reportedthat the estimate of savings from the joint contract totaled$2.7 million in All Funds in fiscal year 2003. In addition,effective December 1, 2003, TDCJ joined with TDH and MHMR in its contract for pharmaceutical purchasing, achieving preferable terms based on the combined volumeof business. Overall, the council indicates that the procedures it has established provide an opportunity to improve theexchange of information among agencies, encourageinteragency coordination in purchasing activities, identifybest practices, and assist the legislature in evaluatingagency pharmaceutical expenditures. However, efforts toaggregate statewide drug purchasing have been minimal,with the council's focus concentrated on savings forindividual agencies. For example, little effort was made toachieve savings through joint contracting by entities thatutilize PBMs. In annual reports submitted in 2003 and 2004, the council recommended removal of the requirement to designate acentral purchasing agency. The council is currently prepar-ing its recommendations for the Seventy-ninth Legislature,2005. Among the options considered by the council'smembers is the elimination of the council to be replacedwith a non-governmental body. STATE ENTITIES CONTRACTING WITH THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS The council helped direct purchasing entities to achieve savings from receiving a deeper discount rate from thepharmaceutical wholesaler McKesson Corporation. InSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 24IMPROVE THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS contrast, the council has done little to assess the potential to achieve savings through the consolidation of the PBMcontracts for its own member agencies, ERS and TRS. In addition, there are at least two more state entities that contract with the PBMs, which are The University of Texas System (UT) and the Texas A&M University System(A&M). Neither of these entities participates in the workof the Council. To provide drug benefits to the plan participants, ERS, TRS, UT, and A&M contract with PBMs for variousservices including establishment of a pharmacy network,claims administration, formulary management, manufac-turer price, and dispensing fee negotiations. All of these entities contract separately with a PBM for drug benefit administration for their beneficiaries. Contractterms are considered to be proprietary information;therefore, the state entities believed they were severelyrestricted from comparing the terms of the contacts with each other. Figure 1 shows the PBMs contracting with the state entities, populations represented by each entity (notincluding health maintenance organizations), and the fiscalyear 2004 drug expenditures of the plans and planparticipants. State health plans differ by method of finance, statutory requirements, population covered by the plans, and plandesigns. The Medicaid program offers drug benefits as partof the state's public assistance program. Drug benefits provided through the Medicaid program have to meet thefederal government's requirements. Drug benefits in commercial plans, which include ERS, TRS, UT and A&M, differ based on each entity's determi-nation of the plan design. The areas in which drug benefitsdiffer between plans include drug formulary, copayment or FIGURE 1 STATE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER CONTRACTORS' PROFILES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004 ERS Medco Health September 1, 1999- 455,000 $246.4 $158.2 $404.6 Solution (Medco) August 31, 2002; September 1, 2002, amended September1, 2004 TRS TRS-Active Caremark September 1, 2002 Caremark: September1, 2004 UT Medco Health September 1, 2003 97,000 $62.7 $26.3 $89.0 Solutions A&M Eckerd Health September 1 2001; 33,000 $21.5 $11.2 $32.7 Services for $328.5 $958.5 PBM-type entities Medicaid Work for 2.8 million $2,158.1 N/A $2,158.1 PBM services, and is currently in the process of making determination.

Drug plans also differ inthe tools used to manage drug utiliza tion, such as PDL, PA, drug utilization (DUR) and disease-management programs,and drug pricing. These areas represent the basis fornegotiations of contract terms between state entities andthe PBMs. DRUG BENEFIT TERMS FOR CONTRACTING STATE ENTITIES In general, drug costs are determined by many components that are negotiated through contract terms. The primarynegotiated components are ingredient costs and dispensingfees for the retail pharmacy portion and mail deliveryportion, rebates, and various administrative fees associatedwith matters such as claims processing, disease-managementprograms, and meeting other requirements of clients. The Legislative Budget Board (LBB) staff review of the contracts between state entities such as ERS, TRS, UT andA&M, showed that even though there are similarities in thecontract terms for drug benefit, there are differences as well. Some state entities have deeper discounts on theingredient costs side, while other s pay slightly more for various administrative aspects of the drug coverage.Dispensing fees appear to be consistent in most casesacross the board. In some cases, the participating pharmacynetworks are different. The literature indicates that entities contracting with the PBMs can negotiate flat and guaranteed rebates as well asmarket-share or tiered rebates. Flat and guaranteed rebateamounts or percentages do not change depending on theutilization, while market-share or tiered rebates increase with the increase in the utilization of the drugs. It appearsthat the four entities (ERS, TRS, UT, and A&M) negotiatedsimilar guaranteed rebates. Guaranteed rebates require lessverification from the plan's staf f; however, there is little information about what types of rebates would benefit thestate the most. In cases where guaranteed rebates differed,administrative costs differed as well. Overall, even through it appeared that in some cases some plans were receiving better indi vidual terms for drug cost components, it does not necessarily mean that these planswere receiving a better financial deal overall. To determinewhich contract is in the state's best interest would requireanalyzing each plan's drug utilization and purchasingmethods (retail versus mail order utilization) in the contextof each other plan's contract terms. This would requireactuarial analysis. Research suggests that larger plans may receive better financial terms from the PBMs; therefore, smaller planscould benefit from consolidation. A recent actuarial studylooked at the cost-benefit analysis of consolidating theERS and A&M health plans and concluded that the A&M Care prescription drug reimburseme nt was approximately 2 percent higher than the ERS arrangement. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COST MANAGEMENT OFFICE Recommendation 1 calls for the abolishment of the Interagency Council on Pharmaceuticals Bulk Purchasingand the establishment of a new independent Pharmaceuti-cal Cost Management Office (office). The office could beadministratively attached to ERS , which would provide administrative support and office facilities. The office couldalso be funded through ERS whereby ERS collects fundsthrough interagency contracts from the 20 state agenciesidentified in the proposed contingency rider. At the sametime, the office should be an independent entity andrepresent interests of the state as a whole and not those ofa particular state entity. The Board of Trustees governingERS should not have authority over the office. Theexecutive director of the office should be appointed by thegovernor with the approval of the lieutenant governor andthe speaker of the House of Representatives. The executivedirector would be responsib le for hiring and managing a staff of five full-time employees. In addition, Recommendation 1 creates an advisory committee comprised of representatives from state drugpurchasing entities (which include former council memberagencies), representatives of community centers for mentalhealth and mental retardation, and representatives institu- tions of higher education. Other governmental entitiesshould be invited to participate in the advisory committee. Recommendation 2 directs the office to implement and oversee a statewide pharmaceutical purchasing program.Core responsibilities of the office should include thefollowing: \u008bcentralized review and approval authority overcontracting; \u008bstatewide purchasing procedures; \u008bimplementation and monitoring of cost-contain-ment strategies; \u008banalysis of inter- and intrastate consolidation ofcontracting; and \u008banalysis of other pharmaceutical purchasing issuessuch as drug importation. In executing the above responsibilities, activities of the office should include the following: \u008bConduct inventory of the state-funded programsthat purchase pharmaceuticals, analyze expenditures, and examine drug utilization trends.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 26IMPROVE THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS \u008bReview current purchasing and payment procedures at the state-funded program. \u008bIdentify current cost-containment measuresimplemented by each plan. \u008bIdentify additional cost-containment measures thatwould be beneficial to the plans and the state. \u008bUse approval authority over contracting for pharma-ceuticals purchasing. \u008bConduct a feasibility and cost-effectiveness drugimportation study. \u008bAnalyze interstate and intrastate consolidation ofcontracting for pharmaceuticals purchasing. \u008bAnalyze cost-benefit and feasibility of implementinga single contract for the purchasing of prescriptiondrugs for entities that contract with pharmacybenefit managers. \u008bAnalyze the cost-benefit of standardizing variousstate prescription drug benefits to achieve additionalsavings. \u008bAnalyze local governments' participation in the statepurchasing arrangements. \u008bReport program activities to the Legislative Budget Board and the Governor's office on a semi-annualbasis, with the first report to be submitted no laterthan February 28, 2006. The office should determine the cost-benefit and feasibility of consolidating contracts for the entities that contractwith PBMs for drug benefit management services. Thisanalysis could include ERS, TRS, UT, A&M, and othergovernmental drug purchasers, such as Medicaid, CHIP,community mental health and mental retardation centers, and local governments. The analysis could be done via RFPor RFI and would enable the office to determine whetherthe state could achieve savings from a consolidatedintrastate aggregate purchasing arrangement. Such an analysis does not assume major changes to the existing structures of the entities. State entities selected forconsolidated contracting could remain responsible formanaging drug benefit programs for their beneficiaries andcould continue to receive funding for programs underexisting procedures. The off ice should be able to negotiate the terms of a contract for a majority of the programs thatreimburse for medication thr ough PBMs. In addition, state policy makers could have more access to comparableinformation relating to the pricing, arrangements, and cost-containment strategies of state programs.Standardization of benefits across state plans should be contingent on the results of the analysis governing theestablishment of a single contract for PBM-type entities. Iffeasible, the state could realize greater savings if benefitsacross state plans are made comparable, and if the toolsutilized in those plans, such as PDL, PA, DUR, andpharmacy networks, among others, are standardized acrossthe plans. The office should be required to provide semi-annual reports on the activities and results of the studies to theLegislative Budget Board and the Governor's Office. Thefirst report should be submitted no later than February28, 2006. If the recommendations were to be implemented, the Pharmaceutical Cost Management Office could be fundedvia the following contingency rider added to Article IX inthe 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill: Contingency Appropria tion for Senate/House Bill XXXX: Pharmaceutical Cost ManagementOffice (a) Contingent upon enactment of Senate/House Bill XXXX, or similar legislation relating toestablishment of a new Pharmaceutical CostManagement Office, the following shall takeeffect: The Employees Retirement System ishereby authorized to collect funds to be used bythe Pharmaceutical Cost Management Office fora statewide pharmaceutical purchasing programthrough interagency contracts with the 20 stateagencies identified by this section.

In addition, the states can reduce their administra-tive expenses and standardize their benefits across pro-grams, which can streamline the administration and providethe basis for even greater savings. There are several existingprograms used by states to aggregate pharmaceuticalpurchasing. In general those models include interstatepooling of either Medicaid or commercial PBM-typecontracts and intrastate consolidated purchasing arrange-ments for both commercial and Medicaid plans. INTRASTATE POOLING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING While many states are s tudying the possible benefits from consolidating their contracts for PBM services, one state,Georgia, has achieved this consolidation. In 2000, Georgia'sDepartment of Community Health (Department) executeda contract with the PBM, Express Scripts, for administra-tion of the drug benefit for approximately 2.1 millionbeneficiaries covered through the Medicaid and CHIPprogram, Georgia's public employees' benefit program anddrug benefit program f or employees of higher education covered through the Board of Regents. Public assistance programs and the public employees' benefit program are housed in the department, while theBoard of Regents is a separate entity, which chose to jointhe statewide contract because of the benefits achieved bythe consolidated contract. Even though there is only one contract for all programs, the programs have different benefits, PDL, and PA rules,and each program makes a separate payment to thecontractor for the services receiv ed. The plan that covers state employees went from using one PDL to working withtwo PDLs to offer a less expensive coverage option for thestate employees. The state's savings were expected to be up to $100 million (a one-time decrease) as a result of consolidating thecontracts and running the drug programs through a PBM. Estimated savings can be attributed to a number ofmeasures, including establishment of the PDL, PA, andDUR. Direct savings from consolidation are difficult to estimate because Georgia's programs went from coveringdrug benefits as a part of the medical benefit to managingdrug benefits separately with selected cost-containmentmeasures. However, Georgia' s staff indicates that there are savings in the administrative costs associated with themanagement of the contract, benefits of shared knowl-edge, and advantages arising from the accessibility ofSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 28IMPROVE THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS information to different prog rams that is necessary for the decision-making process. Georgia's Auditor Office is expected to complete a review of the consolidated contracting effort in January of 2005.A portion of this audit will concentrate on the savingsassociated with the contract consolidation. West Virginia created a Pharmaceutical Cost Management Council (PCMC) charged with finding ways to reduceprescription costs for every West Virginia resident. The billthat created the PCMC specified numerous strategies for cost reduction in drug purchasing to be researched by thePCMC, which include developing a pricing schedule basedon the Australian and the U.S. federal government's prices(both for West Virginia alone and for the multi-statearrangement), investigating drug importation, and obtain-ing discounts for the uninsured and seniors. The PCMC recommended consolidating drug purchasing by all state agencies in a cabinet-level Office of thePharmaceutical Advocate (OPA). The OPA would have thebuying power for a group of 500,000 beneficiaries thatincludes 298,000 Medicaid recipients and 205,000 publicemployees. With regard to drug prices, the PCMC recommended using the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) as a benchmark todetermine how much the state is willing to reimburse forvarious medications. FSS prices are substantially lower thanthe prices offered by PBM organizations or drug manufac-turers for the Medicaid progr am. In addition, the state could become a virtual wholesaler and require drugmanufacturers with which it contracts to extend negotiatedprices to the local pharmacies. Illinois, by executive order of the governor, created the Special Advocate for Prescription Drugs. The SpecialAdvocate is authorized to create a central purchasingprogram to review all contracts and programs at agenciesthat relate to the purchase of or payment for prescription drugs. Other duties and authority of the special advocateinclude the following: \u008bDevelop and implement a policy for purchases andpayments of prescription drugs. \u008bNegotiate for or coordinate the negotiation ofcontracts, reimbursement rates, and rebates. \u008bReview all existing contracts for prescription drugsand direct agencies to continue, freeze, or terminatethose contracts. \u008bCombine any and all programs and contracts at thevarious agencies for purposes of negotiatingreimbursement rates, rebates, or other terms.\u008bAll state contracts related to the purchase of orpayment for prescription drugs are subject to theapproval of the special advocate. INTERSTATE POOLING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING Efforts to combine and levera ge a larger volume of business are not limited to consolidation within a state.There has been significant interest on the part of states injoining or forming interstate pooling programs to purchase prescription drugs in the hopes of achieving savingsthrough increased market power, improved efficiency, and benefits management. A leading example of this effort isthe drug purchasing pool named Rx Issuing States (RxIS). In 2001, officials representing state employees, Medicaid programs, and senior programs from nearly 20 statesparticipated in a pharmacy workgroup brought together tofoster cooperation among states in addressing increases inprescription drug costs. Following this pharmacyworkgroup, West Virginia joined together with Missouri,New Mexico, Delaware, and Ohio to form RxIS. Participat-ing states issued a request for proposal and selectedExpress Scripts to act as the coalition's PBM. Severaladditional states considered joining RxIS but opted insteadto remain with their then-current PBMs. RxIS states sought in their contracts with a PBM to receive the full rebate paid by drug manufacturers whilepaying higher administrative fees to the PBM in what isreferred to as an \"administrative services only\" contract.Each RxIS state has a separate contract with ExpressScripts with a range of plan design options to choosefrom, the pricing of which is based on the pool's aggre-gate number of covered participants. In such arrange-ments, savings depend on the state's receipt of 100percent of manufacturer rebates, and on leveragingenhanced bargaining power and reduced unit costs forservices based on the volume of the combined pool. In total, RxIS reportedly aggregates approximately 700,000 covered individuals. RxIS consists, primarily, of commercial(non-Medicaid) plans from each participating state, althoughWest Virginia's State Children's Health Insurance Program(which is not administratively attached to the state's Medicaidprogram) also utilizes RxIS for drug benefits. Literature describing RxIS claims that savings from participating in thepool can come from the following: \u008bA pass through of 100 percent is possible formanufacturers' rebates, which could be greater thanthe increase in administrative fees. This type ofrebate arrangement with a PBM is attributed, inpart, to the collective bargaining power of states thatissued the RFP .STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 29IMPROVE THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS \u008bAs drug costs escalate, so do rebates. \u008bAdministrative fees are based on a sliding scale that correlates to the pool's volume\u2014the greater thenumber of covered lives in a pool the lower per-unitadministrative costs. \u008bThe expansion of pools is expected to enhance thePBM's ability to negotiate with drug manufacturersfor lower drug prices and higher rebates. \u008bAudit costs can be less if shared among participatingstates. All states that participate in RxIS have reportedly experi- enced savings. West Virginia, representing approximately30 percent of RxIS' covered lives, reportedly realized $7to $8 million in net savings in the initial year and antici-pates $25 million in savings over the first three years.Delaware, with approximately 104,000 covered lives, savedapproximately $1.1 million by joining RxIS. Missouri, withapproximately 100,000 covered lives, saved approximately$2 million in the initial year and now reports that insubsequent rebidding, it has left the RxIS pool butretained Express Scripts as its PBM. ERS reviewed a sample RxIS contract in August of 2002 and compared it to ERS' current PBM contract. ERSindicates that the comparison showed the terms of ERS'contract to be more favorable in the areas of administrative fees, formulary management fees, mail service rates,rebates, and disease management fees. The benefit of participation in an interstate pool aggregat- ing covered lives is based on the theory that the greater thevolume, the better the opportunity for enhanced negotia-tions with PBMs and drug manufacturers for morefavorable contract terms. The challenge in joining orforming an interstate pool lies in navigating multiple stateregulations and political interests and the time and willrequired to conduct the analysis and negotiations necessaryto first, determine if savings can be achieved, and, second, execute a sound contract to deliv er those identified savings. The Minnesota Multi-state Alliance for Pharmacy (MMCAP), created in 1985, is a voluntary cooperativepurchasing group, managed and operated by the MaterialsManagement Division of Minnesota's Department ofAdministration. MMCAP was created to combine thepurchasing power of its members to receive the bestprices available for pharmaceuticals, hospitals supplies,and related products. MMCAP contracts with over 160pharmaceutical manufacturers; its membership includesprograms from 41 states. While no aggregate savingsestimates are available for MMCAP, the National Confer-ence of State Legislatures reports that the averagediscount is approximately 23.7 percent below average wholesale drug prices for brand name pharmaceuticalsand 65 percent below average for generics. Many states are follo wing the developments in consolidated purchasing and are studying the possible benefits of joiningand forming new pools. For example, in November of2004, Indiana's State Budget Agency issued a reportexamining the feasibility, costs, and legal parameters ofIndiana's participation in one of the intra- or interstateaggregate purchasing programs. The report discussed threemulti-state prescription drug purchasing programs, andconcluded that participation in a program of this type isfeasible for Indiana. In addition, because Indiana has already conducted an extensive request for proposal process as part of theestablishment of an intrastate drug-purchasing program, the state is in the position to assess the benefits of such anarrangement. The assessment could be done through areview of the proposed financial and administrative termsand a comparison of the terms in the state's existingprograms. Having detailed information as a result of theRFP places Indiana in an advantageous position for itsdecision-making process about consolidated pharmaceuti-cals purchasing. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Because the office is funded out of budgeted appropria- tions through interagency contracts with the 20 stateagencies having the greatest number of employees, theestimated cost of Recommendations 1 and 2 would nothave a fiscal impact on the introduced 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill. An estimated cost of $2 million for the2006-07 biennium is based on the following assumptions: \u008bfour to six full-time employees who have statepurchasing and pharmaceutical expertise; \u008bbudget for contracted services including legal,financial, actuarial, and pharmaceutical safetyconsulting services; and \u008bbudget for travel and other overhead expenses. Although it is reasonable to assume that significant savings would result from the implementation of statewidepharmaceutical purchasing program, the number ofvariables involved precludes a close approximation of the savings at this time. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any adjustments as a result of theserecommendations.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 30IMPROVE THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL COSTSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 31INCREASE CONSOLIDATION OF DATA CENTER SERVICES TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS Over the past decade, Texas has experienced some success in consolidating the management of data center services.Currently, data center service costs of major state agenciestotal approximately $447.0 million each biennium. Based on fiscal year 2004 totals, approximately $76.0 million ofbiennial data center service costs are managed in a consoli-dated manner within the state data center system. As aresult, there remains signif icant opportunity for further consolidation to maximize potential savings. The Legisla-tive Budget Board staff estimate that the state couldpotentially save $18.5 million in All Funds by the end offiscal year 2010 from further consolidation of data centerservices. In addition, opportunities exist for institutions ofhigher education to consolidate the management of datacenter services. While some institutions of higher educa-tion use the state data center system for such services asbusiness continuity planning, only one institution hasconsolidated fully within this system. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bAccording to the Department of InformationResources, state agencies and institutions of highereducation continue to oper ate a significant number of data center facilities independent of the statedata center system. As a result, the state continues toown a number of decentralized data centers innumerous locations with varying resource require-ments, driving unnecessary overhead costs. \u008bOperational data available on independent datacenter services managed by state agencies andinstitutions of higher education is based on self-reported, mostly unverified da ta from surveys. While this data is useful in providing estimates concerningoverall size and cost, it is not adequate for detailedstrategic planning purposes because it is not reliablyaccurate, consistent, or detailed. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: The Department of Informa- tion Resources should recommend to the Seventy-ninth Legislature, 2005, a plan to consolidate the management of state agency data center services.This report should be submitted to the legislature nolater than March 31, 2005 to facilitate legislative action.\u008bRecommendation 2: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill that requires each institution of higher education to conduct a detailedinventory of their data center services and reportthis information to the Department of InformationResources. COMMENTS In May 2004, the Department of Information Resources(DIR) issued a report, A Foundation for Change , outlining a strategy to maximize the value of the state's information technology resources. In the report, DIR identified theneed for a shared technology infr astructure managed in a consolidated manner, including data center services. As a key aspect of the state's technology infrastructure, data centers provide information technology services tostate agencies and institutions of higher education.Generally, a data center is a centralized facility dedicated tothe management of information resources includingpeople, processes and technologies. Figure 1 provides alisting of typical data center services. State data centers range significantly in size, scope and complexity. DIR classifies data centers based on the typeand number and servers, number of full-time-equivalents (FTEs), budg eted costs, and environmen- tal modifications (e.g., installation of back-up power supply systems, raised flooring, and supplemental air condition-ing). Figure 2 identifies the basic characteristics of eachclass of data center. DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION AND SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES Like other technology infrastructure, such as telecommuni- cations, data center services ar e typically provided more efficiently and cost-effectively when managed in a consoli-dated manner. Consolidation provides for the optimizationof technologies in one or more large, centralized datacenters to achieve costs sa vings, improve performance, and mitigate risks. Figure 3 depicts the common areas of consolidation when data center services are managed in a consolidated manner.For example, one of the benefits of data center serviceconsolidation outlined in Figure 3 is the opportunity tomerge storage systems using tec hnologies such as storage area networks (SAN) and network attached storage (NAS) toachieve economies of scale and lowered cost of ownership.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 32INCREASE CONSOLIDATION OF DATA CENTER SERVICES TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS In addition to the savings gained in the areas outlined in Figure 3, data center service consolidation produces specific cost savings according to Gartner, Inc., a leadingprovider of analysis in the inf ormation technology industry, including the following: \u008breduced hardware needs based on lower totalrequirements for data storage systems; \u008blower software costs including greater discountsnegotiated when purchasing systems from fewersuppliers and in larger averag e order sizes. For many larger-scale systems, the incremental cost forsoftware decreases as systems get larger, and forsmaller systems, a merger can reduce duplicate licensing; \u008breduced facilities costs due to the need for less floorspace including reduced rental expenses and lowerpower consumption; and \u008breduced staffing needs in operations and systemssupport, help desk and network support, applicationdevelopment, and asset administration. In another study, Gartner found that organizations can significantly reduce their total data center service budgets byimplementing real-time infrastructure solutions including1.

The study stressed, however, that cost savings will vary based on the proportion ofmainframe versus server spending, and savings will begreatest in organizations with lar ger proportions of server costs that have not standardized platforms, implementedautomation tools, or consolidated the way they manage theirservices. DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION NATIONAL TRENDS Texas is not alone in its efforts to optimize information technology operations and reduce unnecessary coststhrough data center service consolidation. Many other states are planning or have already implemented consolida-tion initiatives including the following: \u008bCalifornia\u2014California is considered a public sector leader in the consolidation of data center ser vices with the establishment of the state's Teale DataCenter serving over 200 state agencies and the Healthand Welfare Data Center serving 11 of the largesthuman service agencies. Today, California is takingthe next step in consolidation. It is merging these twolarge data centers into a state data center system by building a high-capacity, high-performance networkbetween the two sites. This will facilitate furthersavings including server rationalization, whichinvolves replacing the many smaller servers with a fewlarger ones operating multiple applications. \u008bOregon\u2014Oregon is in the process of consolidatingits three major data centers and eleven smallercenters (representing 80 percent of the state'scapacity) into a single data center, thereby reducingthe cost of managing the state's mainframes, servers,storage systems, and networks. The governorestimates savings of between $10 million and $20million per year. \u008bSouth Carolina\u2014South Carolina projects $30 millionin savings over a 10-year period through consolida-tion of 11 departmental data centers. While theevaluation assessment of the consolidation initiativeprojected an initial bump in costs in the first twoyears over the baseline cost, the state is alreadyexperiencing savings with second-year costs belowthe original baseline cost analysis.FIGURE 3 DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES SOURCE : Accenture Data Center Offerings Presentation.

THE STATUS OF DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION IN TEXAS Today, Texas has two data center facilities: one in San Angelo known as the State Data Center (SDC) and theother in Austin known as the Austin Disaster Recovery andOperations Center (ADROC). The operational vendor ofthese facilities provides data center services to stateagencies, institutions of higher education, and other publicsector entities in a consolidated manner. In fiscal year 2004,the state data center system served more than 50 differentpublic sector entities in Texas.Currently, approximatel y $38 million annually (fiscal year 2004) in data center services are provided in a consolidatedmanner by the operational vendor of the state data center system, including server and mainframe managementservices, business continuity planning services, seatmanagement services, and other services such as applica-tion maintenance. Figure 4 shows the state agencies with contracts for data center services provided in a consolidated manner. In addition to the firm, fixed-price contracts for data center services provided at the SDC totaling approxi-mately $29.0 million, there are over 30 time and mate rial contracts for services such as business continuityplanning and application maintenance ser vices at ADROC, totaling approximately $1.5 million annually infiscal year 2004.

In fiscalyear 2004, the estimated value of these services totaled$7.5 million. Also, some agencies have executed individual contracts for data center services directly with the operationalvendor of the state data center system. While theseservices are provided under contract to the state, they arenot provided within the state data center system in aconsolidated manner. Instead, they are provided underseparate contract agreements at independently manageddata center facilities. As a result, the state may be losingout on the benefits of economies of scale, reducing thepotential for savings. The value of these contracts totaled$24.5 million in fiscal year 2004. According to DIR, state ag encies continue to operate and maintain many independent facilities providing data centerservices with some large agencies managing multiplefacilities. As a result, the state continues to manage anumber of decentralized data center facilities in n umerous locations with varying resource requirements, drivingunnecessary ov erhead costs. Based on an analysis of f inancial data from the informa- tion technology detail (ITD) submitted with agencylegislative appropria (LARs) , the estimated cost of inde pendently managed data center services at major state agencies is $161 million ann ually. In addition, DIR estimates that based on State Information Technology Asset Reporting (SITAR) operational data,state agencies operate at least 2,000 servers and almost 20mainframe systems independent of the state data centersystem. Figure 5 displays a pr oportional breakdown of the costs associated with the differe nt approaches utilized to manage data center services in the state. Institutions of higher education also operate a significant number of independent data center facilities and manage atleast 3,500 servers and more than 25 mainframe systems.These estimates are based on third-party surveys conductedin 2003 by EDUCAUSE, a technology in higher educationnonprofit association. While the survey, which includedover 40 Texas institutions of higher education, did notspecifically focus on data center services, it did yield usefulsummary-level information on the extent of these servicesat institutions of higher education in Texas. ADEQUACY OF REPORTED DATA FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING Operational data available on independently managed data center services is based on self-reported, mostly unverifiedsurveys, such as SITAR and EDUCAUSE, that are aimed at collecting data relating to information technology servicesin general. While this data is useful in providing estimatesconcerning overall size and cost, it is not adequate fordetailed strategic planning purposes because it is notreliably accurate or consistent. For example, it is not unusual for operational data from SITAR to be inconsistentwith ITD financial data due to differences in methodolo-gies. DIR has attempted recently to improve its knowledgebase relative to the resources and costs associated with state agency independently managed data center services, bycomparing data reported in SITAR and the ITD budgetrequests. However, DIR still lacks the detailed operationalinformation required f or the development and implementa- tion of an effective data center service consolidationstrategy and action plan. While state agencies and institutions of higher education are required to complete the ITD budget request scheduleas part of thei r 2006-07 LARs, the sc hedule is not intended to pro vide specific informa tion about data center services. Instead, budget information is collected on DailyOperations, a budget category intended to provide a costbaseline of agency and institution ong oing information technology services. Daily Operations is subdivided into 10 elements shown in Figure 6. Five of these elements closely align with data center ser vice costs: Email, local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), Security, and Operations. Using the total ITD reported amounts for these five elements, Legislative Budget Board staff estimate that thestate could potentially save at least $18.5 million in AllFunds by the end of fiscal year 2010 from consolidatingthe management of data center services of major stateagencies. Because of migration costs and considering agradual transition for agencies, savings would likely not berealized in fiscal year 2006. This estimate is based on a 10 percent savings over a five-year period for major agenciescurrently managing independent data center services. While this calculation provides an estimate of potential savings from further consolidation, the state needs morecomplete and consistent data concerning independentdata center services to accurately determine the actualmagnitude of savings resulting from consolidation and todevelop an effective data center service consolidationstrategy and action plan. In particular, the state needs moredata concerning the location, types, platforms, applications,and the age and capacity of servers and mainframes, alongwith the costs and staffing needs that would be necessaryfor consolidating independent data center services withinthe state data center system.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 36INCREASE CONSOLIDATION OF DATA CENTER SERVICES TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS PLAN TO CONSOLIDATE STATE AGENCY DATA CENTERS Recommendation 1 recognizes that while the state has achieved some success in consolidating data center services,cost savings have not been maximized due to the lack of acoordinated consolidation strategy. This recommendationwould provide decision-makers with an action plan forconsolidation based on demonstrable savings. Therefore, DIR should complete its planned assessment of state agency data center services that are managed indepen-dent of the state data center system. DIR should report its findings to the Seventy-ninth Legislature by March 31,2005. The report should address the following key issues: \u008bIdentify all relevant operational details of eachindependently managed data center, including thelocation, types, platforms, applications, and the ageand capacity of servers and mainframes. \u008bIdentify the operational baseline costs of stateagency data center services that are managedindependent of the state data center system. \u008bDetermine the magnitude of savings that will berealized through increased data center servicesconsolidation. \u008bProvide a full estimate of resources needed toimplement the strategy and action plan including thecost of equipment and professional services. Further, the report should define a strategy and action plan for consolidating independently managed data centerservices within the state data center system, includingdetailed options for independent data center servicesconsolidation, with measurable impacts and the savingsFIGURE 6 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DETAILDAILY OPERATIONS ELEMENTS 1 Email 6 Off the Shelf Application Support 2 Web 7 Custom Application Support 3 LAN 8 Security 4 WAN 9 User Support5 Financial/ 10 Operations Human Resources SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.Independently Managed & Operated Services $161 million 72%Outsourced not Consolidated Services $24.5 million 11%Consolidated Services $ 38 million 17%FIGURE 5 COST SUMMARY OF STATE AGENCY DATA CENTER SERVICES, ESTIMATED FISCAL YEAR 2004 Independent data center services ($185.5 million) representing additional opportunityfor savings through consolidation Estimated Biennial Total: $447 million NOTE: Based on ITD fiscal year 2005 budget submissions of 24 major state agencies and reported contract expenditures.

A similar re port was originally required in Senate Bill 1701, Seventy-eighth Legislature, RegularSession, 2003. DIR is currently in the early stages ofinitiating this assessment and has identified funding in fiscalyear 2005 for this initiative. Due to the importance of thisassessment for legislative consideration, it is critical thatagencies cooperate with DIR to ensure the successfulcompletion of this assessment. IMPROVE HIGHER EDUCATION DATA CENTER REPORTING Recommendation 2 would provide decision-makers with information concerning the full size, scope, and cost ofdata center services managed by institutions of highereducation and the potential savings of consolidating theseservices. In particular, Recommendation 2 would require all institutions of higher education (as defined in Section61.003 of the Education Code) to conduct a detailedinventory of their data center services and report thisinventory to DIR. All institutions of higher education thatare associated with university systems, shall report theinventory to DIR on a system-wide basis. The inventoryshould be reported in a format, at a level of detail and bya date determined by the DIR. Due to the importance ofstrong technology leadership in the higher educationsector, the Chief Information Officer (or similar position)of the each institution or system (as applicable) shallapprove and submit the inventory data to DIR. In orderto ensure the validity of the data, it would be the respon-sibility of the internal auditor (or similar position) of eachinstitution or system (as applicable) to verify that thereported data accurately captures the full size, scope, andcost of data center services managed by each institutionor system. In addition, DIR may perform follow-up sitevisits in order to confirm the reported information. Astrong knowledge base of the size, scope, and cost ofdata center services managed by institutions of highereducation would facilitate improved strategic planning forcomprehensive data center service consolidation in Texas,including data center consolidation within institutions ofhigher education or university systems. Finally, DIR should investigate and report on the potential impact on higher education institution or university systemdata center service consolidation of the Texas InternetGrid for Research and Education currently being devel-oped to allow universities to share high-performancecomputing, data storage, and visualization resources. The following rider should be added to Article IX of the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill to require this activity:Higher Education Institution Data Centers. (a) Each institution of higher education (as defined under \u00a7 61.003, Education Code) shall conduct a detailed inventory of all data center servicesregardless of data center service funding sources. (b) The Chief Information Officer (or similar position) shall approve and submit the inventory in a format,at a level of detail and by a date determined by theDepartment of Information Resources (DIR), toDIR. In addition, to ensure the accuracy of theinventory data, the internal auditor (or similarposition) of each institution or system (as appli-cable) shall verify that the inventory data reportedcaptures the full size, scope, and cost of data centerservices of each institution or system based on theformat and level of detail determined by DIR. (c) All institutions of higher education are required to report this inventory to DIR. Institutions of highereducation that are associated with university systemsshall report the inventory to DIR on a system-widebasis. (d) DIR may perform follow-up site visits in order to confirm the information reported by the institutionor system. (e) The results of the inventory and DIR's recommen- dations based on potential cost savings for data center service consolidation including consolidationwithin institutions or systems shall be submitted byDIR to the Legislative Budget Board and theGovernor by September 1, 2006. (f) DIR shall investigate and re port to the Legislative Budget Board and the Governor by September 1,2006 on the potential impact on higher educationinstitution or system data center service consolida-tion of the Texas Internet Grid for Research andEducation. FISCAL IMPACT OF RECOMMENDATIONS There is no significant fiscal impact associated with these recommendations. Howeve r, implementing the recommen- dations would increase the state's opportunities to achieve future sa vings, estimated to be at least $18.5 million in All Funds over five years, through data center service consoli-dation. This estimate is based on a 10 percent savings over a five-year period for major agencies currently managing independent data center services. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes the recommended Article IX rider requiring institutions of higher education to report data centerservices to DIR.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 38INCREASE CONSOLIDATION OF DATA CENTER SERVICES TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 39NEW USES FOR THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE'S OPERATING FUND ACCOUNT Taxes, fees, and other income from the Texas Department of Insurance operations comprise the Texas Departmentof Insurance Operating Fund Account (Fund 36), which isdedicated to support the statutory purposes of the stateagency. Fund 36, although self-leveling, has historicallymaintained a minimum balance of $11 million to $15million. Some of that balance could be used for additionalprograms related to the fund's statutory purpose thatcontribute to reduced insurance premiums across the state,such as the Cancer Council and two of the programs underthe Department of State Health Services. By funding theseother programs through Fund 36, $18 million in GeneralRevenue Funds in the 2006-07 biennium would be madeavailable for other purposes. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bDuring each of the past four fiscal years, the TexasDepartment of Insurance's Operating FundAccount has had a minimum balance of at least$11.0 million. The Texas Department of Insuranceestimates a $22.9 million balance for fiscal year2005. \u008bThe Texas Department of Insurance reports thatits Operating Fund Account balance is necessary to cover agency operations in the event of a latetransfer of maintenance taxes from the GeneralRevenue Fund, a miscalculation of necessarypremium fees, or other unforeseen needs (such as amandated pay raise). However, such events havenot necessitated the use of the balance in the past,and according to Texas Department of Insurancestaff, the balance in the account has never been less than $10 million. \u008bThe Texas Department of Insurance's OperatingFund Account is used to fund several other stateagencies whose opera tions contribute to Texas Department of Insurance's goal of keeping insur-ance rates low. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bThe Texas Department of Insurance's OperatingFund Account balances could be used to replaceGeneral Revenue Funds for other programs withinthe account's statutory the the TexasDepartment of Insurance's Operating FundAccount to the Cancer Council ($6.5 million) andthe Department of State Health Services Environ-mental Health and/or Immunizations programs($11.5 million). COMMENTS The Texas Department of Insurance's Operating FundAccount (Fund 36) consists of revenue collected frominsurance companies, such as maintenance taxes collectedby the Comptroller of Public Accounts and fees andreimbursements collected by the Texas Department ofInsurance (TDI) and the Texas Commission on FireProtection. The fees are directly deposited into Fund 36,but the maintenance taxes are first deposited into theGeneral Revenue Fund and later transferred to Fund 36,generally in April of each year. TDI keeps a minimum balance in Fund 36 to cover three months' operating expenses in the ev ent of a late transfer of maintenance taxes from General Revenue Funds, amiscalculation of necessary premium fees, or otherunforeseen needs, such as a mandated pay raise. Thisminimum balance typically ranges between $11 million and$15 million and has not fallen below $10 million since thecreation of the fund in 1983, even in the context ofmandated pay raises. TDI's appropriation is unaffected byfluctuations in the minimum balance. If TDI were to needa portion of the minimum balance for normal operatingexpenses, the transfer of maintenance taxes from theGeneral Revenue Fund later in the fiscal year would return it to normal levels by the end of the year. The most recent legislation affecting the minimum balance in Fund 36 was passed during the Seventy-sixth Legislature,1999. Funds were transferred from Fund 36 to the TexasForest Service (TFS), and a rider was adopted barring TDIfrom increasing maintenance taxes to cover expenditures to the TFS. Although TFS continues to receive funding fromFund 36, this rider was not carried through to the 2002-03General Appropriations Act; and since fiscal year 2002,TDI's minimum balance has returned to its formersubstantial level. While there are statutory caps on premiumfees and maintenance taxes, TDI's fees and taxes are wellSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 40NEW USES FOR THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE'S OPERATING FUND ACCOUNT below these caps, and the agency has significant room to increase the fees. In f act, maintenance tax rates decreased an average of 41 percent fr om fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003. As Figure 1 shows, appropriations from Fund 36 are currently designated for seven state agencies, some fromFund 36 as General Revenue-Dedicated Funds and somefrom the pre-transfer maintenance taxes in GeneralRevenue Funds. In the 2004-05 biennium, \u008bTDI was appropriated $104.1 million to fund both General Revenue Funds andGeneral Revenue-Dedicated Funds; \u008bthe Texas Building and Procurement Commissionwas appropriated million for its FacilitiesOperations strategy as General Revenue-DedicatedFunds; \u008bthe Office of the Attorne General was appropri- ated $5.9 million from pre-tr ansfer General Revenue Funds for its Legal Services strategy to compensatefor legal services provided to TDI; \u008bthe Commission on Fire otection was appropri- ated $5.6 million from operations; Section, Comptroller's Department wasappropriated $2.2 million from pre-transfer General FIGURE 2 FUND 36 MINIMUM BALANCE FORFISCAL YEARS 1999-2005 SOURCE : Texas $15.3 $12.5$18.4$31.7 $16.8 $11.4$22.9 05101520253035 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005Revenue Funds, which partially funded its Public Integrity Unit strategy for investigation and prosecu-tion of insurance fraud cases; \u008bthe Department of Public Safety was appropriated $2 million from General Revenue-Dedicated Fundsin fiscal year 2004 (with the balance carryingforward in fiscal year 2005) for its Traffic AccidentRecords strategy to further develop and implementthe Crash Records Information System; and \u008bthe Texas Forest Service was appropriated $6.7million for its Wildfire and Emergency Programstrategy from pre-transfer General Revenue Funds, which, by rider, was designated for the TexasWildfire Protection Plan. OTHER PROGRAMS RELATED TO FUND 36'S PURPOSE While TDI is not required to keep a minimum balance, it maintains a minimum balance in Fund 36, generallybetween $11 million and $15 million, to cover unforeseen needs. The minimum balance fluctuates by year, and noappropriate minimum amount has been identified. Figure 2 shows the Fund's balance from f iscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2005. The balance of Fund 36 could be used to replace all or some of the General Revenue Funds appropriations toother state programs meeting the statutory purpose ofFund 36. (\"The money in the fund may be used for thepurposes for which any of the money deposited in the fundis authorized to be used by law.\" Article 1.31A \u00a7 5, Insur- ance Code.) The General Appropriations Act is the only FIGURE 1 FUND 36 ALLOCATION2004-05 BIENNIUM SOURCE : Texas Department of Insurance.Total: $128.4 MillionTexas Department of Insurance $104.1 (GR & Public Safety $2.0 (GR-D)Texas Forest $6.7 (GR)Comptroller of Public $2.2 (GR)Commission on Protection $5.6 (GR)Office of the Attorney $5.9 (GR)Texas Building and Procurement Commission $2.1 (GR-D)IN MILLIONSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 41NEW USES FOR THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE'S OPERATING FUND ACCOUNT legal authority for appropriations to agencies other than TDI and the tax administration function of the Comptrol-ler of Public Accounts, which is authorized in Article 4.19,Insurance Code, to draw from Fund 36 to cover the costsof administrating the maintenance tax. For all other stateagencies drawing funding from Fund 36, the authority inthe General Appropriations Act aligns with the statutorypurpose of the fund. Research of insurance cost drivers found that cancer, environmental quality, and lack of vaccinations are leadingcontributors to healthcare costs. LBB analysis identified astate agency, the Cancer Council, and two Department ofState Health Services programs, Environmental Health andImmunizations, that contribute to TDI's statutory mission\"to work for the availability of quality insurance productsfor all Texans at reasona ble prices and under reasonable terms and to strive to protect consumers' insurance assets.\"Appropriations to these agencies do not require additionalstatutory changes. As shown in Figure 2, the projected minimum balance of Fund 36 for 2005 is $22.9 million. This recommendationwould replace $18.0 million in General Revenue Funds forthe identified programs from Fund 36 in the 2006-07biennium. If fee and tax rates remain at current collectionlevels, this recommendation would leave TDI with a minimum balance of $4.9 million for unforeseen needs in the 2006-07 biennium. The following rider language would prevent the increase of TDI's maintenance tax in the 2006-07 biennium tocover the new expenditures to the Cancer Council and theDepartment of State Health Services, although TDIwould have the ability to increase taxes in later biennia to cover these expenses: Maintenance Tax on Gross Premiums. It is the intent of the legislature that during the 2006-07biennium the Texas Department of Insurance shallnot increase its maintenance tax on the grosspremiums of any line of insurance to compensatefor expenditures by the Cancer Council and TexasDepartment of State Health Services from theTexas Department of Insurance Operating FundAccount 0036 for the use of reducing insurancecosts through preventative healthcare. THE CANCER COUNCIL The Cancer Council provides direct service grants to communities in an effort to reduce the incidence ofcancer. According to a 2000 study in The American Journal of Managed Care , the cost of treatment for cancer patients at one major U.S. employer increased healthcarecosts per employee by $224. The study concluded that\"expenditures to reduce the incidence and severity of conditions indirectly associated with cancer may alsoreduce overall employer healthcare expenses.\" With thisin mind, the Cancer Council's mission of \"reducing thehuman and economic impact of cancer on Texansthrough the promotion and support of collaborative,innovative, and effective programs and policies forcancer prevention and control\" aligns with the missionof TDI and the statutory purpose of Fund 36 to assistTDI's operations. An annual Fund 36 appr opriation of $3.3 million in fiscal year 2006 and $3.2 million in fiscalyear 2007 w ould end the Cancer Council's reliance on General Revenue funding for this purpose. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES Two Department of State Health Services programs contribute to TDI's mission and the statutory purpose ofFund 36: Environmental Health and Immunizations. A2002 report for Blue Cross Blue Shield found thatenvironmental quality and immunization are two of the10 leading health indicators that drive healthcare costs.Although the study points out that the influence of thesehealth indicators were lower than expected, they areamong factors that are likely to have recently increased insignificance. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH The goal of the Department of State Health Services Environmental Health program is to develop and imple-ment comprehensive, uniform, and effective risk assess-ment and risk management programs in the areas ofconsumer products, occupational and environmentalhealth, and community sanitation. The Department ofState Health Services Bureau of Environmental Healthincludes the following divisions: \u008bToxic Substances Control Division with programsaddressing asbestos, environmental lead, and indoorair quality; \u008bGeneral Sanitation Division, which regulatesenvironmental health in schools, childcare facilities,youth camps, migrant labor housing facilities, publicswimming pools, and public lodging facilities; and \u008bProduct Safety Division, which licenses and regu-lates the manufacturers and retailers of hazardous orpotentially hazardous consumer products. All of these programs contribute to protecting the general public health and act to control incidence of illness, injury,or death, thus helping to reduce insurance rates.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES IMMUNIZATIONS The goal of the Department of State Health Services Immunizations program is to implement programs toimmunize Texas residents. The mission of the Immuniza-tions Division of the Department of State Health ServicesBureau of Immunization and Pharmacy Support is toimprove the quality and longevity of life for people inTexas by achieving and maintaining an environment free ofvaccine-preventable diseases, whic h, the Division states, will add to the state's economic base by avoiding substantialhealthcare costs. An Institute of Medicine report publishedin calendar year 2000 found that Texas, with a 73 percentimmunization rate, is tied f or the third-lowest immuniza- tion rate in the nation. An Institute of Medicine reportpublished in calendar year 2003 stated that immunizations benefit not just the individual receiving the vaccine but alsothe community as whole by helping to reduce medicalcosts. The study further asserted that 11 percent ofchildren age five and under and 76 percent of adults ages18 to 64 are underinsured for immunizations. Avoidinghealthcare costs through pr eventative medicine contributes to TDI's mission to work to keep insurance products atreasonable prices. In the 2006-07 biennium, the Immuniza-tions program will recei ve $25.8 million from the General Revenue Fund annually. An appropriation of $2.5 million in2006 and $2.6 million in 2007 from Fund 36 for thisprogram would replace General Revenue Fund appropria-tion, which could be used for other purposes. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION As Figure 3 shows, this recommendation would result in net savings of $18 million in General Revenue Funds andan equal net cost to General Revenue-Dedicated Funds inthe 2006-07 biennium. It is assumed that the recom-mended rider would not continue in the 2008-09 biennium,allowing TDI to raise f ees or maintenance taxes in subse- quent years and increasing the amount available forcertification.FIGURE 3 FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.PROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/(LOSS) TO GENERAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDS The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any adjustments as a result of thisrecommendation.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 43RECOVER CERTAIN STATE AGENCY OVERPAYMENTS TO VENDORS Recovery audits identify and recover overpayments and lost vendor discounts. Recovery audits typically recover 0.1percent of total expenditures in private industry andbetween 0.03 and 0.05 percent in the public sector.Auditors retain a percentage of the money recovered as payment for their work. The federal government and other states have benefited from wide scale recovery audits, but Texas' use of them hasbeen limited. In addition to recovering funds misspent,recovery audits provide recommendations to improveaccounting processes and prevent future overpayments. Byrequiring state entities with more than $100.0 million inbiennial expenditures of appropriated funds to undertakeannual recovery audits, the state could recover up to $4.5million in All Funds annually starting in fiscal year 2007. Ifthis program first revie ws expenditures from the three previous fiscal years in its first year of operation, fiscal year2007 savings would be greater than collections in subse-quent years. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bIn the private sector, recovery audits typically find0.1 percent of total expenditures in lost discounts oroverpayments to vendors. In the public sector, thisrate is between 0.03 and 0.05 percent. Recoveryaudit firms typically keep between 20 and 40 percentof recovered funds as payment. \u008bIn the 2004-05 biennium, 45 state entities hadexpenditures of appropriated funds exceeding $100million and spent more than $19 billion annually inAll Funds on goods and services from vendors. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bBased on recovery audit rates achieved by thefederal government and other state governments,Texas potentially loses up to $9 million annually inAll Funds through overpayments, lost discounts, andnoncompliance with contracts. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill that requires theComptroller of Public Accounts to negotiate andadminister an umbrella contract with a third-partyrecovery audit firm or firms to be used by all stateagencies.\u008bRecommendation 2: Amend Chapter 2101, Government Code to require those state entitieswith biennial expenditures from appropriated fundsexceeding $100 million to participate in recoveryaudits unless exempted by the Comptroller of PublicAccounts based on a low proportion of expendi-tures to vendors. \u008bRecommendation 3: Amend Article IX, Section 8.03, of the 2004-05 General Appropriations Act toappropriate 50 percent of recovered GeneralRevenue Funds, General Revenue-Dedicated Funds,and Other Funds to each state entity that partici-pates in the contracted recovery audit to pay therecovery audit firm and to use the balance for theoriginal purpose for which the recovered funds wereappropriated. COMMENTS Recovery auditing is the 30-year-old practice of reviewinginformation regarding expenditures for overpayments, lostdiscounts, and noncompliance with contracts over aspecified period of time. Recovery audit firms look forerroneous invoices, discounts of fered but not received, improper late penalties, incorrect shipping costs, andmultiple payments for single invoices. In the private sector,recovery audit firms typically recover 0.1 percent of thebusiness' volume in an audit and keep between 20 and 40percent of their findings as payment. In addition to therecovered expenditures, recovery audit firms providerecommendations to reduce future overpayments and lostdiscounts by improving accounting and procurementprocedures. Public sector agencies have r ecently begun to contract with third-party recovery auditing firms. The U.S. Departmentof Defense (DoD) Defense Supply Center began a pilotrecovery audit program in 1996 that identified $30.4million in overpayments, of which the DoD was able tovalidate $17.9 million. By 2000, the DoD had recovered$5.3 million from vendors. Based on the success of thispilot, DoD started an agency-wide pilot program in 1998,and in fiscal year 2001, contractors returned $488.0 millionin overpayments based on identified overpayments. Congress mandated recovery auditing for federal agencies with the 2002 Defense Authorization Act. The DefenseAuthorization Act requires federal agencies with more thanSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 44RECOVER CERTAIN STATE AGENCY OVERPAYMENTS TO VENDORS $500 million in expenditures on goods and services to use recovery audits and authorizes the agencies to do thefollowing: 1) return recovered money to the account it came from or to the general treasury, 2) pay the third-party recovery auditors, and3) conduct management improvement programs to address the overpayment issues. Texas has never required state entities to use recovery auditing on a wide scale. However, the Council on Com-petitive Government is in the process of negotiating a third-party contract to be overseen by the State EnergyConservation Office that would include recovery audits of all agencies' utility expenditures. Current internal reviews of Texas expenditures include sample-based audits conducted by the Comptroller ofPublic Accounts (CPA) and the Texas Building andProcurement Commission (TBPC). As Figure 2 shows,post-payment audits conducted by the CPA can identifylost discounts or interest erroneously paid to vendors.Unlike recovery audits, however, they test a sample ofexpenditures rather than all of them. TBPC's procurementaudits, on the other hand, investigate state paymentprocesses for compliance with procurement statutes, rules,or procedures, and do not test for lost discounts, duplicate payments, or contract compliance. In a memo of May 8, 2003, the federal Office of Manage- ment and Budget authorized the use of part of the moneyrecovered from overpayments from federal programs for state and local governments to pay for contingency feecontracts with recovery audit firms. Each federal programhas differing rules regarding whether a state may keep ormust return the rest of the recovered payments. The three recommendations are interdependent. Recom- mendation 1 requires the CPA to contract with a recoveryaudit firm or firms. Recommendation 2 amends statute toset the parameters of the recovery audit and to requirestate entities with expenditures exceeding $100 million toparticipate in recovery audits. Recommendation 3 depositshalf of the recovered funds back into the state treasury andappropriates the remaining half of recovered funds to stateentities to pay for the audit and to expend for the purposesof the original appropriation. Recommendation 1 would require the CPA to negotiate and administer an umbrella contract with a recovery auditfirm or firms for use by all state entities. The CPA is thebest agency to negotiate and administer this contractbecause of its extensive experience administrating third-party umbrella contracts for the state and direct access toinformation from the Uniform Statewide AccountingSystem (USAS). The following rider should be included in the bill pattern for Comptroller of Public Accounts in the 2006-07General Appropriations Bill: Recovery Audit. The Comptroller of Public Accounts shall contract with a consultant orconsultants during the 2006-07 biennium for thepurpose of auditing expenditures for overpaymentsor lost discounts and to receive recommendationsfor improved accounting operations. Any reportssubmitted to the Comptroller of Public Accounts inconnection with such a contract shall be submittedto the Legislative Budget Board, State Auditor's Office, and the Governor no later than seven daysafter receipt of the report by the Comptroller. Nolater than January 1, 2007, the Comptroller shallissue a report summarizing the findings to theLegislature. Recommendation 2 would amend Chapter 2101, Govern- ment Code to require those state entities with greater than$100 million biennially in expenditures from appropriatedfunds to participate in contracted recovery audits unlessexempted by the CPA based on a low proportion ofexpenditures to vendors. The new language in ChapterFIGURE 1 OTHER STATES' EXPERIENCE WITH RECOVERY AUDIT FIRMS Missouri: Missouri: Missouri: Missouri: Missouri: The Missouri Department of Administration has contracted with a recovery audit firm since 1998, and between fiscal years1998-2003, the recovery audit firm identified and collected $3.5 million. Missouri's typical recovery audit starts at the end of a fiscal year and takes about a year to complete. Missouri has not had any legalproblems with collection from overpaid vendors. As Missouri's accounts payable processes improve due to recommendations from the recovery audit firm, the focus of Missouri's recovery audit has shifted to Medicaidpayments. Delaware:Delaware:Delaware:Delaware:Delaware: The State of Delaware's recovery audit contract, which is about a year old, has resulted in recovery of $60,000 in overpaymentsfrom state purchases between fiscal years 2001 and 2003, with a recovery rate of 0.03 percent. The recovery audit firm has recommended that Delaware tie payments to purchase orders in its new accountingsystem. North Carolina: North Carolina: North Carolina: North Carolina: North Carolina: North Carolina contracted with a recovery audit firm in 1999 and has audited expenditures, exempting medical services, back through 1996.

SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 45RECOVER CERTAIN STATE AGENCY OVERPAYMENTS TO VENDORS 2101 should specifically allow state entities to reimburse the recovery audit firm or firms from recovered funds. Recommendation 3 would amend Article IX, Section 8.03, of the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill to appropriate 50 percent of recovered General RevenueFunds, General Revenue-Dedicated Funds, and OtherFunds to state entities on an individual basis. Each stateentity would need to pay the recovery audit firm thecontracted payment rate from the recovered funds butwould be able to keep the remainder. This practice wouldprovide an incentive for state entities with expendituresunder $100 million biennially to voluntarily participate inrecovery audits. Because recovery audit firms typicallycontract to keep between 20 and 40 percent of recoveredfunds, this practice would provide state entities withbetween 10 and 30 percent of recovered funds as anincentive to undertake recovery audits. Figure 3 illustrates the process of appropriating recovered General Revenue Funds under Recommendation 3. Halfwould be deposited in the state treasury as unappropriatedrevenue in the authorized fund, which in this examplewould be General Revenue Fund 0001. The other halfwould be appropriated to the state entity. The state entitywould pay the recovery audit firm the contracted percent- age, and would be able to keep the remainder as a newappropriation with the same purpose as the originalappropriation.Section 8.03, as amended, would read as follows: Sec. 8.03.

FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS In the 2006-07 biennium, the estimated net savings of all recommendations would be $9.6 million to GeneralRevenue Funds and $0.9 million to General Revenue-Dedicated Funds. Recovery audits typically start at the end of the fiscal year and take one year to complete, meaningthat recovered expenditures are not collected until thefiscal year after the audit has been completed. Because ofthe time necessary to issue requests for proposals andnegotiate contracts, the earliest any recovered revenuewould be seen from this program would be in fiscal year2007. However, recovery audits tend to start by reviewingseveral previous years. Consequently, if this program firstreviews expenditures from fiscal years 2003 to 2005 infiscal year 2006, fiscal year 2007 would realize greatercollections than subsequent years. Half of recovered Gener al Revenue Funds, General Revenue-Dedicated Funds, and Other Funds would bereturned to the state treasury, while the other half would beappropriated to the state entity, which would then need topay the recovery audit firm's contracted percentage from its50 percent allotment. Federal Funds would be returned tothe state agency, which would pay the contracted percent- age of the recovery audit firm, and would use the remain-der or return it to the federal go vernment, as provided in the rules of each federal program. Figure 4 assumes a 0.04 percent recovery rate on all expenditures and that recoveries from fiscal years 2003 to2005 would be collected in fiscal year 2007. Because therecovery audit collection rate in other states is between 0.03percent and 0.05 percent of gross expenditures, theestimated cost savings for all three recommendations wouldbe $13.5 million in All Funds in fiscal year 2007 and $4.5million in each subsequent fiscal year. However, at theaverage private industry recovery rate of 0.1 percent, it is possible that Texas could realize savings up to $11.3 millionannually in All Funds by instituting a system of recoveryaudits. As each Federal Funds program has its own rulesregarding recovered expenditur es, it is estimated that there would be no savings or revenue gain.Recovery Audit Firm X% Agency Incentive (50-X%)FIGURE 3 RECOVERED GENERAL REVENUE SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.State Treasury 50%Agency 50%Other Funds General Revenue-DedicatedFederal FundsGeneral RevenueSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 47RECOVER CERTAIN STATE AGENCY OVERPAYMENTS TO VENDORS FIGURE 4 FIVE-YEAR SAVINGS/ (COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE NET SAVINGS/ (COST) TO OTHER FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.

First, more return-to- work retirees are eligible for benefit replacement pay thanaverage state employees. Benefit replacement pay is a salarysupplement created to offset a loss to employees when thestate stopped paying a portion of an employee's socialsecurity taxes. Second, return-to-work retirees often receivelongevity pay at a higher rate. Longevity pay awardsemployees with additional wages for increased years of service to encourage them to remain employed with thestate. As a return-to-work r etiree, an employee receives longevity pay and benefit replacement pay from two sources: (1) as an enhancement to their retirement annuityand (2) as part of their state employee compensation.Discontinuing longevity pay and benefit replacement payfor return-to-work state retirees would save the state up to$10.9 million in General Revenue Funds in the 2006-07biennium. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe number of return-to-work retirees has in-creased 716 percent from 469 in 1999 to 3,830 inAugust 2004. \u008bIn fiscal year 2004, the aver age salary of a return-to- work retiree was $39,652 while the average salary ofa general state employee was $32,681. \u008bIn May 2004, more than half of all return-to-work retirees active in the state's workforce earned a post-retirement salary that was equivalent or greater thanthey earned before retirement. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bReturn-to-work retirees benefit twice from benefit replacement pay and longevity pay, in their retire-ment annuity and in their compensation when theyreturn-to-work. \u008bReturn-to-work retirees are more likely to earnbenefit replacement pay, longevity pay, and vacationleave at higher rates than the average state employee. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend Government Code, Chapter 659 to prohibit retur n-to-work r etirees from receiving benefit replacement pay and longevity pay.By rider to the General Appropriations Bill, reduce agencies' appropriations by the amount of longevitypay and benefit replacement pay agencies wouldhave paid to return-to-work retirees in the 2006-07biennium. \u008bRecommendation 2: Amend Government Code, Chapter 661 to require retir ees who return to state service to restart their years of service with the stateat zero. This measure would ensure that return-to-work employees earn vacation at the same rate asemployees with no years of service. COMMENTS During fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the state spent $156.8million on benefit replacement pay (BRP) and $198 millionon longevity pay. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, 57 percentof BRP payments will be paid from General RevenueFunds. Return-to-work retir ees contribute to this expense. On average, return-to-work retirees earn $140 a month inlongevity pay, and 89 percent of them are entitled toreceive BRP. As described in Figure 1, state employees hired after August 31, 1995 are not eligible for BRP . As a result, theannual appropriation for BRP decreases each year as eligible employees separate from the state. Figure 2 showsthe rate of decrease in the BRP expenditure for generalstate employees. BRP benefits employees with greatertenure, who are closer to retirement and often more likelyto remain employed with the state. Therefore, it is esti-mated that the BRP expenditure will only decrease 9.8percent in the 2006-07 biennium. BENEFITS FOR RETURN-TO-WORK RETIREES Return-to-work retirees benefit twice from BRP and longevity pay: \u008bBRP and longevity pay are part of the average salarythe Employees Retirement System of Texas (ERS)uses to calculate the amount of an employee'sretirement annuity. \u008bEligible return-to-work r etirees continue to receive BRP and longevity pay when they return to work forthe state. A typical state employee's retirement annuity is based on salary, years of service (or service credit), and a multiplierSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 50CHANGE POLICIES GOVERNING RETURN-TO-WORK RETIREES (currently set at 2.3 per cent). As salary or retirement service credit increases, the amount of the employee'sretirement annuity increases. An employee's average salaryis based on the employee's gross pay plus longevity, benefitreplacement pay, and hazardous duty pay. Therefore, whena retir ee returns to work, he or she benefits twice from BRP and longevity pay; once through increased retirementannuity and again as a payment included in employeecompensation. State employee salaries and benefitscontinue to be one of the largest single state expenditures.Changes to employee benefits and cost-sharing arrange-ments should be considered in light of available staterevenue and goals for employee recruitment and retention. Recommendation 1 eliminates BRP and longevity pay to return-to-work retirees. The recommendation reduces the2006-07 biennial estimated appropriation to the Comptrol-ler of Public Accounts (Comptroller) for benefit replace-ment pay in all funds proportional to employees' salaries. Recommendation 1 also requires the Comptroller at thestart of each fiscal year of the 2006-07 biennium to do thefollowing: \u008bIdentify the amount of longevity pay each agencywould have paid to r eturn-to-work retirees during the fiscal year. \u008bReduce each agency's appropriations by the amountthe agency would have paid in longevity pay to itsreturn-to-work retirees' during the fiscal year. Contingent upon the passage of appropriate legislation to prohibit return-to-work retir ees from r eceiving benefit replacement pay and longevity pay, add the following riderin the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill: Return-to-work retirees. Contingent on the passage of legislation by the Seventy-ninth Legisla-ture, regular session eliminating benefit replacementpay and longevity pay payments to retirees whoretire from the state and retur n to work for the state (return-to-work retirees): (a) The Comptroller shall identify:a. The number of return-to-work retirees receiving benefit replacement pay on September 1, 2005 b. By agency, the n umber of return-to-work retirees receiving longevity pay on September 1,2005, and c. By agency, the n umber of return-to-work retirees receiving longevity pay on September 1,2006; and. (b) On September 1 of each year of the biennium, The Comptroller shall reduce each agency'sfiscal year appropriation by the annual amountof longevity pay that would have been paid toreturn-to-work retirees employed by the agencyduring that fiscal year and by method offinancing, as identified pursuant to Subsection(a). (c) On September 1, 2005, The Comptroller shall estimate the amount of benefit replacement paythat would have been paid to return-to-workretirees during the 2006-07 biennium by articleof the General Appropriations Act and bymethod of financing and shall reduce biennialappropriations for benef it replacement pay to each article by that amount and by method offinancing.FIGURE 1 WHAT ARE BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PAY AND LONGEVITY? Benefit replacement pay was created in 1996 to replace the state-paid portion of an employee's social security tax for employees receiving thatbenefit at the end of fiscal year 1995. Benefit Replacement Pay of up to $1,026.86 each year provides supplemental compensation to eligible state employees based on their salaries. An employee retains BRPentitlement as long as he or she does not have a break in service from the state of 12 consecutive months. This eligibility requirement also applies to return-to-work retirees. Therefore, if a retiree who receivedBRP returns to work sooner than 12 months after retirement, the return- to-work retiree is eligible for BRP. Longevity pay awards tenure. After three years of state service, employees receive $240 a year in longevity pay. For each additional three years of state service, longevity pay increases $240 a year until reaching a maximum of $3,360 a year at 42 years. SOURCE : Comptroller of Public Accounts.

Figure 3 shows the average salary, years ofservice, and vacation earned by the average return-to-workretiree versus the average state employee. A return-to-workretiree's years of service takes into account all years workedfor the state\u2014pre- and post-retirement. As a result, return- to-work retirees receive vacation leave at the same rate asthey did before retirement. For example, an employee whoretired with 23 years of service would return to stateemployment earning 15 hours per month of vacation, 50percent more than the average state employee. Also, when a return-to-work retiree separates from state employment the second time, the retiree is entitled to alump-sum payment for unused vacation. Return-to-work retirees have a higher average salary and earn vacation at afaster rate than the average state employee, which causestheir unused vacation leave reimbursement to be more expensive. Figure 3 compares the costs related to anaverage r eturn-to-work retiree and an av erage general state employee. A lump-sum payment for one year vacation leave to the average return-to-wor k retiree is almost double the amount paid to an average employee if neither used anyvacation leave for one year. Recommendation 2 would amend statute to allow a return- to-work retiree to be treated like a newly hired employee.They would earn vacation leave at the \"less than two yearrate,\" or eight hours per month. This recommendationwould require retirees to restart earning years of servicebased on each year of post-retirement employment. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Discontinuing longevity pay and benefit replacement pay for return-to-work state r etirees would result in a net General Revenue Fund savings of $10.9 million and a netGeneral Revenue-Dedicated Fund savings of $1.1 millionin the 2006-07 biennium.

Benefitcosts must be proportional to an agency's funding sources;therefore, amounts reflected in Figures 4 and 5 are basedon the proportionality of the funds used to pay employeessalaries in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The savings estimateis based on the projected number of return-to-workretirees that would likely be employed with the state infiscal years 2006 through 2010. The savings would increaseif state agencies hired retirees at a higher rate in the comingyears. The cost savings estimate includes employees at stateagencies, but excludes employees at institutions of highereducation. Institutions of higher education pay BRP as partof an employee's salary not as a separate component of anemployee's salary as it is paid to state employees. Thechanges in law would affect return-to-work retirees atinstitutions of higher education; therefore, the cost savingsestimate is conservative. The estimate was based on datasupplied by the Comptroller regarding the number of BRPand longevity pay eligible employees who retired from stateemployment during the first half of fiscal year 2004 and returned to work. It is estimated that Recommendation 2 would avoid future costs by reducing the amount of the lump sum payment areturn-to-work retiree would r eceive when he or she leaves state employment. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any adjustments as a result of theserecommendations.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 52CHANGE POLICIES GOVERNING RETURN-TO-WORK RETIREES FIGURE 5 LONGEVITY PAY COST TO OTHER FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.PROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSFIGURE 4 BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PAY COST SAVINGS (COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO OTHER FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 53ELIMINATE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREES' DEPENDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM Healthcare costs and retiree populations are expected to increase in the next several years. The current policy of thestate contributing 50 percent of the cost of general stateretirees' dependent health insurance premium will cost$584.1 million in the 2006-07 biennium. This is a 24.5percent increase over the 2004-05 biennium. Research shows that many other government and private entities do not contribute to retirees' dependent healthinsurance premiums. Eliminating the state's contribution for health insurance premiums for retirees' dependentsunder age 65 would reduce the state's share of insurancecosts by $121.2 million in All Funds during the 2006-07biennium, $93.6 million of which is General Revenue andGeneral Revenue-Dedicated Funds. It would reduce theestimated appropriations to the Employees RetirementSystem and the Higher Education Employees GroupInsurance System for the 2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bIn fiscal year 2004, 37 percent of retirees in theEmployees Retirement System and the HigherEducation Employees Group Insurance Systemcovered dependents on their health insurance. \u008bUnder TRS-Care, the health plan offered to retireesof the Teacher Retirement System, the state requirespublic education retirees to pay the entire healthcarepremium for their dependents. However, thedependents' healthcare costs are indirectly subsi-dized by the state, school district, and member. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bBased on historical trends, healthcare costs and thenumber of state retirees are expected to increase ineach of the next sever al years. Insurance premiums have increased by 7 percent, more than twice therate of inflation, since 2001 and retiree populationshave increased by 5 percent each year during thissame time period. RECOMMENDATION \u008bInclude a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropria-tions Bill requiring state and higher educationretirees to pay 100 percent of the premium fordependent health insurance coverage for dependentsunder the age of 65.COMMENTS The state currently pays 50 percent of the total cost ofhealth insurance premiums for spouses and dependents ofits retirees. As shown in Figure 1, at the end of fiscal year2004, there were 65,981 general state and higher educationretirees who received their health insurance through theEmployees Retirement System (ERS). Since 2001, as thenumber of retirees has grown, so has the number ofretirees who include de pendents on their health insurance. Figure 1 also shows that 24,545, or 37 percent, of retireescovered dependents on their health insurance in fiscal year2004. Of the 24,545 retirees covering dependents, 13,005retirees have dependents under age 65. Legislative Budget Board staff estimate that the retiree population will grow by 5 percent annually in the comingyears. As the number of retirees grows, so will the numberof dependents enrolled in the state health plan. Historically,an average of 38 percent of retirees in the state health planhave added dependents to their insurance coverage. Theapproximate cost to the state f or general state retiree and dependent health insurance premiums for fiscal year 2005 will be $246 million. This is a $24 million increase over thefiscal year 2004 level. In addition to the growing number of retirees and their dependents, health insurance premiums have followed thesame upward trend, and according to the National Confer- ence of State Legislatures, health insurance premiums forfamily coverage have increased by 64 percent nationwidesince 1999. Texas state employee health insurance premiums have increased by an inflation-adjusted 7 percent from fiscal year2001 to 2005. In fiscal year 2005, HealthSelect's premiumincreased by 5.1 percent, and the premiums for the participating HMO plans in ERS increased by an averageof 12.6 percent over fiscal year 2004 rates. In 2004, ERS increased copayments, implemented tighter eligibility rules,and instituted a prescription drug deductible. While thesemeasures reduced the rate of increase in healthcare andpremium costs, they have not prevented the further increase in insurance premiums. Requiring retirees tocontribute toward their dependent health insurancepremium may help to reduce overall expenditures forretiree healthcare costs, and the practice is a cost-sharingmeasure used in other states and by major private employ-ers. This recommendation would not affect dependents ofSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 54ELIMINATE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREES' DEPENDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS deceased retirees since they already pay the full premium cost of their health insurance. OTHER GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE EMPLOYERS Other states and major private employers have reduced health benefits for retirees and their dependents, and theyhave increased retiree contributions for health insurance premiums to mitigate increasing healthcare costs. As Figure2 shows, few major private employers in Texas contributeto retiree dependent health insurance. In fact, SouthwestAirlines, Motorola, IBM, Dell, and HEB (if over age 65)pay nothing for retiree dependent health insurance premi-ums. The contribution levels for other local governmententities, like the cities of Dallas, Austin, and Houston andthe counties of Dallas, Travis, and Harris vary significantlybut range between 0 percent, as is the case in TravisCounty, and 65 percent (if age 65 or older) in Houston. Figure 2 also shows the differ ent levels of contribution that retirees pay for their dependents' health insurance premi-ums in Arkansas, California, Florida, and New York. In line with what many other government and major private employers do, it is recommended that state andhigher education retirees pay the entire premium fordependent health insurance coverage for dependents underthe age of 65. The recommendation would be implementedby including rider language in the 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill for ERS and the Higher EducationEmployees.

State Contribution to Group Insurance for General State Employees. Funds identified above for group insurance are intended to fund: a. the total cost of basic life and health coverage for all active and retired employees; b. fifty percent of the total cost of health coverage for spouses and dependent children of all activeand r etired employees who enroll in coverage categories which include a spouse and/ordependent children; c. fifty per cent of the total cost of health co verage for spouses and de pendent c hildren 65 y ears and older of all retired emplo yees; and d. the additional cost of providing a premium structure comparable to the Children's HealthInsurance Program (CHIP) for dependentchildren of state emplo yees enrolled in the State Kids Insurance Program (SKIP). Higher Education Employees1. State Contribution to Group Insurance for Higher Education Employees Participating inthe Employees Retirement System GroupInsurance Program. Funds identified above for group insurance are intended to fund: a. the total cost of basic life and health coverage for all active and retired employees; b. fifty percent of the total cost of health coverage for spouses and dependent children of all activeand r etired employees who enroll in coverage categories which include a spouse and/ordependent children; and c. fifty per cent of the total cost of health co verage for spouses and de pendent c hildren 65 y ears and older of all retired emplo yees. If the state were to eliminate the 50 percent contribution towards health insurance premiums for retiree dependentswho are under age 65, it would realize $93.6 million in General Revenue and General Revenue-Dedicated Fundssavings in the 2006-07 biennium and could reduce theappropriations to ERS-General State Employees, ERS- Higher Education Employees, the Texas A&M UniversitySystem (A&M System), and the University of Texas System(UT System). In addition to reducing state retiree health insurance expenditures, eliminating the state's share for healthinsurance premiums for retirees' dependents under age 65 would more closely align the state retirement systems ofTexas. As part of TRS-Care, there is no policy in place thatrequires the state to contribute anything toward teacherretiree dependent health insurance premiums. However, thehealth insurance premium for dependents of TRS retireesis indirectly subsidized by the member, state, and schooldistrict. Therefore, while the member pays the full cost fordependent coverage, the premium is set at approximatelyhalf of the cost of market value, reducing the cost to theretiree. The current policy of the state paying half of thepremium for general state retirees' de pendents results in retirees' dependents under age 65 paying less than 40percent of their healthcare costs. Requiring them to pay thefull premium cost would result in them paying less than 75percent of their healthcare costs. In order to shield the state health plan from adverse selection, this recommendation proposes that the statecontinue its 50 percent contribution level for retirees'dependents aged 65 and older. Adverse selection, in thecontext of the health insurance industry, is a commonconcern among employers offering health plans for theiremployees. It occurs when the pool of members becomessaturated with less healthy plan members, causing costs toincrease\u2014those who need the coverage the most will stay,while those with fewer health problems will seek lessexpensive coverage and create an imbalance of healthy andunhealthy members. Contributing 50 percent of premiumcosts for dependents once they turn 65 would provide anincentive for healthy retiree dependents to continue theirparticipation in the state health plan once they becomeeligible for Medicare. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION This recommendation would result in a net General Revenue Fund savings of $75.4 million and a net GeneralRevenue-Dedicated Fund savings of $18.2 million in the2006-07 biennium. As shown in Figure 3, eliminating the state's 50 percent contribution towards health insur ance premiums for retirees' dependents under age 65 would save the state$121.2 million in All Funds in the 2006-07 biennium. Thisfigure accounts for an annual 5 percent retiree populationincrease and applies current participation levels of mem-bers with different coverage types. The savings estimatealso reflects the dependent population growth broken outby dependents over and under age 65.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 56ELIMINATE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREES' DEPENDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FIGURE 3 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COSTS) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COSTS) TO OTHER FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.

On the other hand, the stateprovides longevity pay to all eligible employees regardlessof their performance levels for their continued service tothe state. It is uncertain whether compensation tools likelongevity pay encourage positive employee performance.Yet, in the 2002-03 biennium, the state spent $198 millionon longevity pay. At the same time this practice has beenprevalent, the legislature has esta blished several pay-for- performance programs to encourage better employeeperformance. Freezing longevity pay would make funds forpay for performance programs available to agencies toreward employees whose job performance exceedsexpectations and would allow the state to more directly linkcompensation to professional achievement. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bState employees receive $240 a year in longevity pay for each three years of state service. Longevity payreaches a maximum of $3,360 a year after 42 yearswith the state. \u008bLongevity pay cost the state approximately $99.4million in All Funds in fiscal year 2004. The averageeligible state employee receives $650 a year inlongevity pay. \u008bThe average tenure of employees is increasing. Infiscal year 2001, 36 percent of employees had 10 ormore years of service while in fiscal year 2003, 38percent had 10 or more years of service, whichmay be increasing the state's spending for longevitypay. \u008bBeginning September 1, 2001, the legislatureremoved the limitation from the General Appropria-tions Act on the amount agencies could expend formerit salary increases and promotions. In fiscal year2003, 18 percent of eligible employees receivedsome type of performance pay. \u008bThe State Auditor's Office surveyed state agencies in November 2003 regarding their perceived usefulnessof certain retention strategies. State agenciesindicated that merit salary increases, one-time meritpayments, and retention bonuses are three of themost useful strategies for retaining key employees.SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bLongevity pay rewards tenure only and is awarded toeach eligible employee regardless of performance ordisciplinary standing. \u008bState agencies do not utilize the state's compensationprograms because funding is limited. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend Government Code, Chapter 659, Subchapter D to allow employees tocontinue to receive longevity pa y at their current rate until they terminate from state employment. \u008bRecommendation 2: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill tha t requires agencies to use funds made available from freezing longevitypay to reward positive employee performance. COMMENTS In the 2002-03 biennium Texas spent $198 million onlongevity pay for state employ ees. Longevity pay is included in an agency's budget as part of salaries and wages and isnot a separate appropria tion like benefit replacement pay. Approximately 57 percent of the longevity pay expenditureis paid from General Revenue Funds because Texasrequires employee benefit costs be proportional to anagency's funding sources. The effect of longevity pay on the state's workforce is uncertain. In 2001, the legisla ture approved a substantial longevity pay increase nearly doubling the state's expendi- ture for longevity pay from $51.5 million in fiscal year 2001 to $95.5 million in fiscal year 2002, as shown in Figure 1. InNovember 2003, the State Auditor's Office sent a survey toall state agencies asking them to list the types of strategiesthey use for retention purposes and to rate those strategies'effectiveness. State agencies reported that merit salaryincreases, one-time merit payments, and retention bonusesare three of the most useful strategies for retainingemployees. It is difficult to predict how the longevity pay expenditures will vary from y ear to year because different factors influence the number of employees receivinglongevity pay. For example, the longevity expendituredecreased slightly in fiscal year 2004. The decrease may beattributable to the 8,489 employees who retired betweenAugust 2003 and August 2004. Many of those retirees wereSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 58FREEZE LONGEVITY PAY TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO REWARD PERFORMANCE highly tenured employees who receive longevity pay at a higher rate than the average state employee. Figure 2 illustrates the various pay for performance programs available to award employees. Yet, state employeecompensation issues are consistently at the forefront.House Bill 2914, Seventy-seventh Legislature, RegularSession, 2001, created the Employee Compensation SystemEvaluation Task Force to evaluate employee compensationand the strengths and weaknesses of the current meritsystem in Texas. In November 2002, the task forcereported that a key tool to use for keeping high performingemployees in state government is the effective implementa-tion and sufficient funding of a pay-for-performancesystem. In the same bill, the legislature expressed its desirefor agencies to ensure the expectations for an employee'sperformance are linked to agency goals and strategic plans.During the Seventy-seventh Legislature, Regular Session,2001, the legislature removed the salary cap set in theGeneral Appropriations Act (GAA), 2002-03 bienniumthat limited the amount agencies could spend on meritincreases and promotions, a move which was certainly inthe spirit of providing additional opportunities to rewardpositive employee performance. The federal Office of Mana gement and Budget published a Strategic Management of Human Capital plan for fiscal year 2005 setting forth management practices intended tomake employees more aware of their roles in the organiza- tion. In federal fiscal year 2005, the federal government will make sure its employees understand how their work contributes to the achievement of the agency's mission andwhat is expected of them. Appraisal systems will makeclear how employees will be evaluated and will distinguishbetween high and low perfor mers. Implementing a perfor- mance appraisal system provides the necessary foundationfor establishing pay for performance programs in the federal workforce. In the future, a federal employee'sadditional pay will be directly linked to his or her perfor-mance and achievements instead of simply longevity. State employee salaries and benefits continue to be one of the largest single state e xpenditures. Changes to employee benefits and cost-sharing arrangements should be consid-ered in light of available state revenue and goals foremployee recruitment and retention. Recommendation 1would amend Government Code, Chapter 659, SubchapterD to accomplish the following: \u008bfreeze longevity pay at the rate employees arereceiving it on August 31, 2005; and \u008beliminate longevity pay for new employees and anyemployee who terminates from state employment. Freezing longevity pay would stop the growth rate of the expenditure and should decrease the state's expenditure by$15.2 million in All Funds by 2010. Figure 3 reflects thecosts the state would forgo in longevity pay by prohibitingfuture increases. The estima te assumes that freezing longevity pay will eliminate the 1 percent growth in theexpenditure from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2010. The avoided costs from the 2006-07 biennium would remain inagencies' budgets to award good employee performance.Employees receiving longevity pay on August 31, 2005 would continue to receive it at a frozen rate until they terminate from state employment.

However, there are not specific appropriations to finance these programs. Beginning June 2001, statute required agencies to implement a policy that ensured an employee's performance expectations were linked to the goals of the agency contained in its strategic plan. Statue authorizesperformance to be awarded in these ways: \u008bMerit pay is like a raise, it increases an employee's monthly salary. \u008bOne-time merit is like a bonus and is paid in one lump-sum. Bothmay be awarded every six months when an employee's job performance and productivity are consistently above what is normally expected or required. To foster and award outstanding performance, productivity, and innovation, the General Appropriations Act (GAA) authorizes an agency to enhance an employee's compensation if the agency achieves or exceeds 80 percent of its key performance measures. The GAA alsoauthorizes an agency to sign a retention bonus contract with an employee for up to $3,000 to guarantee an employee remains with the agency for the next year. The employee must be considered essential tooperations to receive this bonus payment.

Recommendation 2 directs state agencies to use the longevity savings created when employees eligible forlongevity pay leave state employment for merit pay andother pay-for-performance programs established by thelegislature. It is reasonab le to expect that the state's longevity expenditure would decrease at approximately thesame rate as the benefit replacement pay expenditure because both decrease when employees terminate or retire.In the 2006-07 biennium, Recommendation 2 would makeapproximately $14.3 million available in All Funds to stateagencies as a result of channeling the money no longerspent on longevity pay to pay-for-performance initiatives.This recommendation will not fully fund an employeeperformance or incentive program, but will allow agenciesto strengthen the link between employee compensation andemployee achievement. Contingent upon the passage of legislation to implement Recommendation 1, the following rider should be includedin the General Appropriations Bill for the 2006-07biennium: Performance Pay. State agencies will retain appropriations made for salaries that becomeavailable from freezing longevity pay.

T he law provides for an interim prescription drug card for certain seniors until December31, 2005. On January 1, 2006, the full voluntary prescrip-tion drug benefit program goes into effect. It operates on acalendar year basis. The provisions of Medicare Part D allow employers to receive a subsidy of roughl y 28 percent for most of their expenditures for prescription drugs to encourage them tocontinue providing prescription drug coverage to theirMedicare-eligible insurance plan participants. However,employers have other options. Texas can take advantage ofthe options with respect to its Medicare-eligible retirees.Significant cost savings are possible through alternatives forproviding prescription drug coverage to retirees in theEmployees Retirement System, Teacher Retirement System,Texas A&M University System, and The University of Texas System. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bUnder current policies, the state retirement systemswill spend $582.3 million in General Revenue Funds($701.4 million in All Funds) in the 2006-07biennium on prescription drug coverage forMedicare-eligible retirees. \u008bAcross Texas state retirement systems, Medicare-eligible retirees will spend $363.9 million out-of-pocket, excluding payments toward premiums, onprescription drugs in the 2006-07 biennium. Infiscal year 2007, this will average $1,141 per person. \u008bThe retirement systems could save $164.2 million inGeneral Revenue Funds ($200.5 million in AllFunds) in the 2006-07 biennium, without addedexpense to the retirees, by continuing currentprescription drug coverage and claiming a subsidyfrom the federal government for 28 percent ofexpenditures on each retiree's annual drug costsbetween $250 and $5,000. \u008bThe retirement systems could save $388.7 million inGeneral Revenue Funds ($464.0 million in AllFunds) in the 2006-07 biennium by eliminatingprescription drug coverage and only paying theMedicare Part D premiums for retirees and their spouses. \u008bThe retirement systems could save $233.6 million inGeneral Revenue Funds ($279.2 million in AllFunds) in the 2006-07 biennium by eliminatingprescription drug coverage, paying the Medicare PartD premiums, and providing a payment of $600 forretirees to use for paying their deductible andcopayments. \u008bThe retirement systems could save $250.1 million inGeneral Revenue Funds ($298.9 million in AllFunds) in the 2006-07 biennium by eliminatingprescription drug coverage and developing a cost-sharing plan to cover part of the Medicare Part Dbenefits. Payments would cover premiums, roughlyhalf of the Medicare $250 deductible, and half ofdrug costs between $250 and $8,150. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: To reflect availability of the 28 percent subsidy for prescription drug costs fromMedicare for Medicare-eligible individuals, appro- priations to the state retirement systems should bereduced by $164.2 million in General RevenueFunds for the 2006-07 biennium. \u008bRecommendation Consider eliminating prescrip- tion drug coverage for Medicare-eligible stateretirees and dependents, and instead provide aportion of the costs for premiums, deductibles, andcopayments for accessing Medicare Part D benefits. COMMENTS The Medicare Part D prescription drug program begins onJanuary 1, 2006. Medicar e-eligible individuals who choose to participate in the Medicare Part D program must pay a monthly premium (estimated at $35 for calendar year 2006and adjusted annually for inflation) to a prescription drugplan (PDP) sponsor who offers a federally approvedprescription drug plan. The participants have a $250 annualdeductible, which is also adjusted each year to accommo- date increased costs due to inflation. After the participantpays the deductible, Medicare will pay 75 percent of thecost of covered prescription drugs up to an initial coveragelimit ($2,250 in calendar year 2006 and adjusted annuallySTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 62IMPACT OF MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS ON STATE RETIREES for inflation). The program participant is then responsible for all prescriptions drug costs until they have reached an annual out-of-pocket threshold ($3,600 in calendar year2006 and adjusted annually for inflation). The $3,600 inannual out-of-pocket cost includes the deductible but must be paid by an individual; payments by employers do notcount toward the threshold. Once the annual out-of-pocketthreshold is reached, Med icare provides catastrophic coverage, paying 95 percent of the cost of coveredprescription drugs. Figure 1 gives an example of costsharing for a person with annual prescription drugs costing$6,000. Not all prescription drugs are covered under Medicare Part D. Drugs or classes of drugs excluded or optional underMedicaid (except for smoking cessation agents) are not covered. Exclusions include agents used for weight loss orweight gain, medications for the symptomatic relief ofcoughs and colds, prescription vitamins and mineralproducts, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Expenditureson these items do not count toward the individual's annualout-of-pocket threshold. In addition, Medicar e-eligible individuals with income under 150 percent of the feder al poverty level\u2014$1,211 per month for a single person or $1,626 per month for a couplein 2007\u2014are entitled to a premium subsidy paid totally or in part by Medicare. They do not have to pay the annual deductible or they pay at a reduced level. Cost sharing isalso eliminated or reduced. Congress provided a subsidy to employers in order to encourage them to continue providing prescription drugcoverage for Medicare-eligible retirees. Medicare willreimburse employers 28 percent of the cost of drugs forwhich Medicare allows payment under Part D for Medi-care-eligible retirees and dependents. Covered costs includethe ingredient costs (the cost of the drug itself) and thedispensing fee, but exclude administrative costs. In 2006, this subsidy is limited to covered costs between $250 and$5,000, and will be adjusted for inflation in future years.The subsidy amount is reduced by the amount of any priceconcessions, such as rebates or discounts, received onbehalf of these retirees for covered drug costs. On the other hand, the 28 percent subsidy is applied to the cost paid by the employer plus the direct cost paid by theretiree. For example, retirees at the Employees RetirementSystem (ERS) typically pay about 40 percent of the cost ofprescription drugs. If an ERS retiree had $1,000 inprescription drug expenses in a year, the retiree would pay$400 and ERS would pay $600. Medicare would reimburseERS 28 percent of $750 because the subsidy only appliesto costs between $250 and $5,000. ERS would receive $210or 35 percent of the $600 it paid. Aggregated over all costsand all retirement systems, the subsidy effectively reim-burses retirement systems for 33 percent of their paymentsfor covered drugs. For the employer to get this subsidy, the retiree cannot be enrolled in a Part D prescription drug plan or a MedicareManaged Care plan with prescription drug coverage. Inaddition, prescription drug plans have to provide drugcoverage at least equal to a standard set by Medicare. CURRENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR STATE RETIREES AND SPOUSES As Figure 2 shows, in state fiscal year 2006 there will be about 168,000 Medicare-eligible retirees and spouses (alsoreferred to as \"participants\") in the state retirementsystems, excluding about 4 percent of retirees andspouses in Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).More than half of the 168,000 participants (55 percent) receive benefits through the Teacher Retirement System (TRS), about 35 percent through ERS, and the remaining10 percent through the two university systems.

Of this, $701.4 millionis estimated to be retirement system funds, and theremaining $363.9 million is projected participant contribu-tions. Of the $701.4 million, 83 percent ($582.3 million) isattributable to General Revenue Funds, and 4 percent($30.4 million) is attributable to General Revenue-Dedicated Funds across all four systems (Figure 3).However, within each retirement system, the method of finance varies greatly. For example, General Revenue Fundsmake up 100 percent of system funds at TRS, yet only 60percent of system funds at ERS. The remainder of theERS System funding is made up of General Revenue-Dedicated Funds, 6 percent; Federal Funds, 15 percent;Highway Fund 6, 12 percent; and Other Funds, 6 percent. Coverage of prescription drugs is included in the total healthcare premiums paid out of each system. However,retirement systems vary in the level of support toretirees and spouses. Participants' deductibles andcopayments cover from 30 percent (at TRS) to 40percent (at ERS) of total prescription drug costs. ERSand The Univer sity of Texas (UT) pay all of the premi- ums for retirees, but only half of the premiums forspouses and dependents. Premiums plus copaymentscover all of the healthcare expenditures. At TRS andTexas A&M University (A&M), both retirees and spouses pay a premium, but the premiums plus copayments donot cover all of the healthcare expenditures. Deductiblesfor prescription drugs are in effect for ERS, UT, andA&M, but not for TRS. All systems use a three-tieredapproach to copayments for prescription drugs, withstaggered amounts for generic drugs, preferred namebrand drugs, and other drugs. Yearly estimates of the increase in the number of partici- pants aged 65 and older range from 1 percent to 4 percent,depending on the retirement system. At the same time,estimates of the increase in the average cost of prescriptiondrugs per Medicare-eligible person ar e approximately 15 percent per year. STATE OPTIONS FOR SAVING GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MEDICARE PART D The new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit has significant potential savings for Texas state retirementsystems. Four options were reviewed and are presentedhere. Assuming no change in cove rage from state fiscal year 2005 other than cost inflation and population growth, allof these options save General Revenue Funds comparedwith the estimated cost of retirement systems' prescriptiondrug plans. The analysis presented here does not account for the possibility that some retirees may have incomes under 150percent of the federal poverty level. These retirees wouldpay less under Part D, and savings to the state retirementsystems would be slightly higher than the analysis indicates.Furthermore, estimated costs or savings in agency adminis-tration are not included.

S OURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 64IMPACT OF MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS ON STATE RETIREES Option 1: Maintain the current systems, but secure the 28 percent drug subsid y from Medicare for prescription drugs provided to Medicare-eligibleretirees (including covered Medicare-eligiblespouses). Option 2A: Eliminate prescription drug coverage to Medicare-eligible individuals and pay Medicarepremiums, but provide no cost sharing. Option 2B: Eliminate prescription drug coverage to Medicare-eligible individuals, pay Medicare premiums,and provide a fixed payment amount to retirees thatwould enable them to maintain the current averagemonthly per capita payment (based on ERS). Option 2C: Eliminate prescription drug coverage to Medicare-eligible individuals and develop a cost-sharing plan to cover part of the Medicare Part Dbenefits. Payments could cover monthly Medicarepremiums, roughly half of the $250 deductible, andhalf of drug costs between $250 and Medicare'slimit for catastrophic cove rage, without a significant increase in costs to participants. The Medicare prescription drug program does not begin until January 1, 2006, and the analyses presented hereassume that the current drug benefits will continue fromSeptember 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. Figure 4 sketches the types of costs associated with each option. It also includes estimates of the cost and change incost per participant borne by the retirement system,participants, and Medicare. Figur e 5 graphically presents the costs and changes in costs per participant for eachoption. The cost estimates for Options 2A, 2B, and 2C assume identical prescription drug benefits for retirees and spouses.Currently, retirees and spouses have the same deductiblesand copayments; however, state retirement systems'subsidies for healthcare premiums for the two groups aredifferent. It is assumed that differences between retiree andspouse healthcare premiums will continue under anyprescription drug option, with the prescription drugbenefits being the same. In many cases, the following analysis is based on the average impact on retirees and spouses across all thesystems; but the systems have differing levels of benefits.The vast majority of TRS retirees are in TRS-Care III,which has no deductible and significantly lower copaymentsthan the other systems. In addition, TRS has the mostretirees, so a change to prescription drug coverage which iscost neutral to participants in general would tend to impactTRS retirees somewhat negatively but would provide costadvantages to all other participants.Option 1: The retirement systems would maintain their current prescription drug benefits but take the stepsnecessary to get the 28 percent retiree drug subsidy fromMedicare for prescription dr ugs provided to Medicare- eligible retirees (including covered Medicare-eligiblespouses). Over the 2006-07 biennium, this option wouldsave an estimated $164.2 million RevenueFunds, $2.2 million in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds,and $200.5 million in All Funds compared to the estimatedcost for the biennium if no changes are made from theplan in place for state fiscal year 2005. Under this option,all cost savings accrue to the systems, and programparticipants continue to incur prescription drug costs at thesame level as they currently do. This option would be relatively simple to implement. As long as the prescription drug plans are actuarially equivalentto the \"standard drug coverage\" under Medicare Part D,retirement systems can continue their currently plannedprescription drug programs and obtain the subsidy. Thisoption allows considerable flexibility in establishingformularies, but the retirement systems or benefit coordi-nators will have to be able to separate medications thatMedicare covers from prescription drugs that Medicare does not cover. In addition, if any participants are enrolled in Medicare Part D, they would need to be identified andexcluded from claims for the 28 percent subsidy. Retire-ment systems must also be able to apportion rebates orother cost concessions to those attributable to the MedicarePart D populations' drug costs. Moreover, retirementsystems will incur some administrative costs in applying forthe subsidy, providing notices to participants, reporting tothe federal Centers f or Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and maintaining records. These costs have not been included in the estimates presented here. Finally, the timingof the subsidy payments by Medicare under this option isuncertain. Medicare could delay paying the subsidy byraising questions about information provided to them bythe retirement systems. Option 2A: Retirement systems would eliminate prescrip- tion drug coverage for Medicare-eligible individuals, butsystems would pay for Pa rt D premiums (estimated at $35 per month in 2006) for retirees and spouses. Over the2006-07 biennium, this option would save an estimated$388.7 million in General Revenue Funds, $7.8 million inGeneral Revenue-Dedicated Funds, and $464.0 million inAll Funds compared to the estimated cost for the bienniumif no changes are made from the plan in place for statefiscal year 2005. Retirees and their covered spouses wouldincur an additional out-of-pocket cost of $171.3 millionover the biennium if they participate in the Medicare PartD prescription drug program and incur prescription drugcosts at current levels. This is equivalent to an increase ofSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 65IMPACT OF MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS ON STATE RETIREESFIGURE 4 ANNUAL COSTS PER PARTICIPANT ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS OPTIONS NOTES: The description of current premium coverage is based on the Employees Retirement System and The University of Texas System; t he Teacher Retirement System and Texas A&M System have a more complex premium- sharing plan.

About 82 percent of participants would have increases in out-of-pocket expendi-tures, with about 27 percent of the total paying an addi-tional $1,000 or more for prescription drugs. Option 2B: The retirement systems would eliminate prescription drug coverage for Medicare-eligible individu-als, but would pay Medicare Part D premiums and providea payment of $600 for retirees and their spouses to use forpaying prescription drug copayments. Under this option,the total benefit paid by retirement systems in fiscal year2007 would be $1,085 per participant. On average, thispayment level allows retirees' annual per capita paymentunder their current plans to be maintained, resulting in aslight savings of $69 per participant in state fiscal year 2007(see Figure 4). Over the 2006-07 biennium, this optionwould save an estimated $233.6 million RevenueFunds, $4.7 million in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds,and $279.2 million in All Funds compared to the estimatedcost for the biennium if no changes are made from theplan in place for state fiscal ye ar 2005. This option saves $69.5 million more in General Revenue Funds thanclaiming the 28 percent subsidy under Option 1. While this option is relatively simple to implement, it raises a number of issues. Retirees with low drug expenses wouldhave extra cash while those with medium-to-high drugexpenses would have considerably higher out-of-pocket costs than they do under the current system. State retire-ment system funds now used to pay for healthcare wouldbe available for people with low drug costs to use at theirdiscretion. About 35 percent of participants would incurhigher out-of-pocket costs under this option than they dounder the current prescription drug programs, with 14percent of the total seeing their out-of-pocket costs rise byover $1,000. In addition, participants in ERS would fare better in terms of their current out-of-pocket costs at this payment levelthan participants in other systems. This is because ERSparticipants' current out-of-pocket costs for prescriptiondrugs are higher than out-of-pocket costs in the othersystems. Without prescription drug benefits or assistancewith deductibles and copayments from the state retirementsystems, participants' out-of-pocket costs rise dramatically. Since ERS participants are already paying a relatively highlevel of out-of-pocket costs, the $600 payment would resultin their out-of-pocket costs, on average, going down byabout $300. Similarly, participants at A&M would have areduction in out-of-pocket costs of about $85. Participantsat TRS, on the other hand, would see an increase in theirout-of-pocket costs of about $100. UT participants wouldpay about the same.FIGURE 5 COMPARISON OF MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG OPTIONS COSTS PER PARTICIPANT , CALENDAR YEAR 2007 SOURCE : Cost per Participant (Dollars) Retirement system Participant MedicareTotal cost per participant = $3,341STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 67IMPACT OF MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS ON STATE RETIREES Finally, a cash payment would be considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore, theactual amount available for payment of prescription drugsis lower, the amount depending on the participant's taxbracket. For example, a person in the 15 percent tax bracket would only have $510 of the $600 cash payment tospend on prescription drugs. The cash payment would haveto increase to $706 to result in $600 being available at the15 percent tax level. At a payment of $706, GeneralRevenue Fund savings would drop by $23.6 million to$210.0 million over the 2006-07 biennium. Option 2C: The retirement systems would eliminate prescription drug coverage for Medicare-eligible individualsand develop a cost-sharing plan to cover part of theMedicare Part D benefits. Payments by the retirementsystems would cover monthly Medicare premiums, roughlyhalf of the $250 Medicare deductible, and half of drugcosts between $2,250 and Medicare's limit for catastrophiccoverage. Participants would pay the first $50 of the $250deductible and half of the remaining $200 of the deduct-ible. They would be responsible for the 25 percentcopayment between $250 and $2,250 in total prescriptiondrug costs, with Medicare paying the other 75 percent.Participants would then pay half of drug costs between$2,250 and Medicare's limit for catastrophic coverage, and5 percent after they have paid the annual out-of-pocketthreshold. Medicare would pick up the remaining 95 percent above the out-of-pocket threshold. Over the 2006-07 biennium, this option would save an estimated $250.1 million in General Revenue Funds, $4.9million in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds, and $298.9million in All Funds compared to the estimated cost for thebiennium if no changes are made from the plan in placefor state fiscal year 2005. It would save $85.9 million more in General Revenue Funds than claiming the 28 percentsubsidy under Option 1. Under this scenario, participants'costs for prescription drugs would increase an average of$41 per person in fiscal year 2007 over their payments inthe current system. Almost 60 percent of participantswould have higher out-of-pocket expenditures, but 37percent of the total would pay less than $250 in additionalcosts, and only 4 percent would see their out-of-pocketcosts rise by over $1,000. Out-of-pocket costs would belower for almost 80 percent of ERS participants, and only15 percent of ERS par ticipants would face additional costs in excess of $25. The average out-of-pocket costs for ERSparticipants would be about $200 less than they are now. Because only expenditures made by participants count toward filling the Medicare gap between $2,250 and thecatastrophic level, the more the state retirement systemscover the gap, the higher the total drug expenditures mustbe to trigger Medicare's 95 percent catastrophic coverage level. Thus, the state retirement systems and participantsare paying for drugs that Medicare would be paying for under Options 2A or 2B. With the retirement systemscovering 50 percent of the costs in this gap, the gapexpands to $8,440 in calendar year 2007 before Medicarecatastrophic coverage is applied. Option 2C is complex by necessity due to the complexity of the Medicare Part D structure. It would be confusing toparticipants, who would face different copayment levels depending on the total amount spent on prescription drugs.It would also require retirement systems or benefit manag-ers to closely track total drug expenditures in order toverify correct payment. Nevertheless, every personparticipating in a Medicare Part D prescription drugprogram will face this complexity. Pharmacies and benefitmanagers will also have to deal with tracking drug expendi-tures related to Part D co verage, which could increase administrative costs. Option 2C is equitable in the sense that payments by the state retirement systems are tied to the use of prescriptiondrugs. State retirement system funds intended forhealthcare will be spent on healthcare rather than discre-tionary spending, as they could be under Option 2B. Inaddition, this option is an efficient use of state retirement system funds because all of the benefits are used to purchase healthcare rather than some of them going to payfederal income taxes. While those with higher costs wouldpay more in total as they currently do, the state retirementsystems would share the burden up to the point Medicarecatastrophic coverage is reached. Because the Medicare Part D program runs on a calendar year, Option 2C would be difficult to implement unlessretirement systems also switch their prescription drugplans to a calendar year. Further, retirement systems mayhave difficulty modifying their health plans and auto-mated systems in time to implement this option byJanuary 1, 2006.

SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. Recommendation 2 suggests consideration should be given to eliminating prescription drug coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees and dependents and providing a portion ofthe costs for premiums, deductibles, and copayments foraccessing Medicare Part D benefits. The information used in developing the estimates includes the cost of some drugs that are covered by the retirementsystems but are not covered by Medicare Part D. It is estimated that 2 percent of prescription drug costs are fornon-covered drugs. Costs under Options 2A, 2B, or 2C willbe higher for state retirement systems that choose tocontinue coverage of these drugs. Additionally, theregulations for the Medicare Part D prescription drugprogram are not yet finalized. Final regulations couldchange some of the assumptions used to obtain the figures.Finally, removing retiree drug benefits from systemcoverage could have an impact on the costs of prescriptiondrugs for remaining covered employees.FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Figure 9 shows the five-year fiscal impact of claiming the 28 percent subsidy, by method of finance. Implementingthis recommendation would save an estimated $164.2million in General Revenue Funds and $2.2 million inGeneral Revenue-Dedicated Funds during the 2006-07biennium. Retirement systems would incur some adminis-trative costs in applying for the subsidy, providing noticesto participants reporting to the federal Centers for Medi-care and Medicaid Services, and maintaining records. Thesecosts have not been included in the estimates presentedhere. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a reduction of $164.2 million in General RevenueFunds related to claiming the 28 percent subsidy fromMedicare.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 70IMPACT OF MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS ON STATE RETIREESSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 71IMPLEMENT A TIERED COINSURANCE PLAN FOR STATE EMPLOYEES Participants in the Employees Retirement System HealthSelect health plan pay a flat coinsurance rate of 20percent as their share of the cost of medical services inaddition to other healthcare costs for which they areresponsible, such as copayments and sometimes deductibles.As an alternative to a flat percentage rate, a tiered coinsur-ance plan would stipulate different coinsurance percentagesfor different levels of medical spending. Such a methodwould directly link the amount a participant pays for medicalservices to the cost of healthcare service received and moreevenly distribute the cost of medical services according toeach participant's consumption of medical services. Under atiered coinsurance plan, participants have more incentive tobe efficient purchasers of medical services, and whenparticipants make cost-effective choices, both the state andthe participant save money through equitable cost sharing.Tiered coinsurance could save the state approximately $ 38.8 million in General Revenue Funds and $4.0 million inGeneral Revenue-Dedicated Funds in the 2006-07 bien-nium. As participants make more cost-effective choicesabout utilization, the savings would be greater. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe average annual increase in Employees Retire-ment System health plan expenditures from fiscalyear 1998 to fiscal year 2003 was 11 percent. \u008bThe Employees Retirement System projects healthplan expenditures to exceed $3 billion in the2004-05 biennium. \u008bIn fiscal year 2003, 7 percent of the participants in HealthSelect had annual medical benefits spendingbetween $5,000 and $49,999, which accounted for45 percent of the health plan's medical expenses. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bHealthSelect's current coinsurance structure limits aparticipant's coinsurance to $1,000 regardless of thecost of their medical expenses. \u008bParticipants who account for the majority of thecosts have less financial incentive to be efficientpurchasers of medical services. RECOMMENDATION \u008bInclude a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropria-tions Bill to direct the Employees Retirement Systemto implement a tiered coinsurance plan to control healthcare costs and link the amount a participantpays for his or her medical services (excludingprescription drugs to his or her costs). COMMENTS Tiered coinsurance requires par ticipants who spend more on healthcare to pay a larger portion of their expenses. As such,it motivates participants to shop for value, scrutinize bills foraccuracy, and curb unnecessary utiliza tion. Unlike flat rate coinsurance, tiered coinsurance more directly links thecontributions of participants to their individual spending.Additionally, tiered coinsurance promotes a consumerapproach to the use of medical services. It requires partici- pants to pay a percentage of their healthcare expenses untiltheir out-of-pocket spending reaches a maximum dollaramount. After the participant pays the maximum out-of-pocket amount established in the healthcare plan, the planthen covers 100 percent of any additional allowable costs. Under the current HealthSelect coinsurance arrangement the Employees Retirement System (ERS) pays 80 percentof medical expenses and the participant pays 20 percentuntil the participant pays an out-of-pocket maximum of$1,000. Thereafter, the plan pays 100 percent. By contrast,a tiered coinsurance plan requires participants' out-of-pocket expenses to be more proportional to the amountof their medical spending. A tiered coinsurance wouldshift a proportionate amount of the cost of physician andmedical services to participants, thus ensuring equitablecost sharing between the state and participants forhealthcare expenses. Legislative Budget Board staffestimate tiered coinsurance would save $38.8 million inGeneral Revenue Funds and $4.0 million in GeneralRevenue-Dedicated Funds in the 2006-07 biennium. Thiscost savings estimate is based on the sample coinsuranceplan in Figure 1. The sample tiered coinsurance plan isapplicable to medical spending up to $200,000 annually.It also limits an individual's coinsurance maximum andprovides reduced coinsurance rates for employees whoqualify for low-income family subsidies for insurance. Ninety-two percent of participants in the ERS health plan had less than $5,000 in medical claims in fiscal year 2003.Once a participant satisfies the coinsurance maximum of$1,000, his or her coinsurance contribution responsibilitiesstop. For example, if a participant spends $5,000, his or her contribution is $1,000. If a participant spends $49,000, his orSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 72IMPLEMENT A TIERED COINSURANCE PLAN FOR STATE EMPLOYEES her contribution is still $1,000, and the state is required to pay the other $48,000. As healthcare costs continue to rise, employers have fewer cost-saving options. Decreasing network size and negotiatinglower contract fees with providers are exhaustible options. Atsome point, employers must consider changes to benefitplans or the modification of cost-sharing arrangementsthrough increasing the f ollowing for participants: deductibles, coinsurance amounts, and other plan out-of-pocket costs. Raising deductibles adversely affects employeeswith low claims by requiring them to pay a large percentage of their individual spending. Texas employers are strugglingto cope with the national trend of rising healthcare costs.The national expenditure for healthcare has nearly doubledsince 1992, reaching a pproximately $1.6 trillion in 2002. The annual ERS health plan expenditure was $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2002 and $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2003. ERS implemented several benefit plan design changes in fiscal year 2003, including changes to copayments, coinsur-ance, and eligibility for certain employee groups to addressrising healthcare costs. ERS is cu rrently estimating that those changes to the benefit plan will result in over $600 million insavings to the state in the 2004-05 biennium. Still, an increasing number of participants turned in medical claimsover $50,000 in 2003. Furthermore, 7 percent of participants in HealthSelect had an annual medical benefit spendingbetween $5,000 and $49,999, which accounted for 45 percentof the health plan's medical expenses. A tiered coinsuranceplan would address higher cost claims and require the 8 percent of participants with claims over $5,000 to contrib-ute more toward the cost of their medical claims. If participants are required to pay greater out-of-pocket expenses, they will have more incentive to become involvedin the selection of effective car e providers and treatments. This involvement on the part of participants is likely to placeadditional pressure on hospitals and physicians to discloseinformation about costs and performance. Instead ofcontrolling costs by limiting supply with managed care,employers could control costs by limiting demand for services, thereby producing a more consumer-drivenapproach to healthcare purchases. A consumer-drivenapproach to healthcare spending would put greater economicpurchasing choices in the hands of the participants. If aparticipant's financial ability to access healthcare becomes aconcern, the state could cap participant expenses at apercentage of the individual's income, thereby placing a limiton the burden to the sick according to their ability to pay. A secondary benefit to implementing a tiered coinsurance plan is the cost avoidance resulting from decreasedutilization. As participants make more cost-effectivedecisions, utilization decreases and sav ings increase. Under the current coinsurance arrangement (80/20), when aparticipant avoids a $100 out-of-pocket expense, the plansaves $400. The same cost avoidance in a tiered coinsur-ance plan from a participant in the upper tier would avoid$9,900 in costs to the state. While no additional savingsfrom decreased utilization is quantified here, it is expectedthat more cost-effective choices by participants wouldresult in greater savings to the plan. Even if these savings are not fully realized through lower appropriations this biennium, they would be reflected infuture trends. For example, if a participant avoids 10 percentof their healthcare costs, the plan would save 5.5 percent of its costs. This is because the current coinsurance arrange- ment only applies to approxima tely 40 percent of benefit expenditures and tiered coinsurance will affect about anadditional 55 percent of benef it expenditures. If participants avoid 10 percent of their costs, the plan would be expectedto save 10 percent of the costs now affected by the tieredcoinsurance plan, which would be 5.5 percent. A 5.5 percentsavings in plan costs would equate to a savings of a bout $150 million in All Funds in the 2006-07 biennium. State employee salaries and benefits continue to be one of the largest single state e xpenditures. Changes to employee benefits and cost-sharing arrangements should be consideredin light of available state revenue and goals for employeerecruitment and retention. The recommendation proposes atiered coinsurance plan as a feature of the HealthSelecthealthcare plan in an effort to achieve more equitable costsharing. Figure 1 provides an example of a tiered coinsur-ance design. The percentages in Figure 1's tiered coinsurancedesign distribute the cost of medical services more evenlyamong participants at all spending levels. An annual coinsur-ance maximum or lifetime coinsurance maximum may beadjusted to limit a participant's out-of-pocket contribution. For the purpose of making the cost-sharing levels propor- tional to spending and to establish the most equitable ratespossible, the recommendation requires ERS to identify the appropriate coinsurance percentages based on participantutilization and spending. In addition, ERS should consider aFIGURE 1 SAMPLE TIERED COINSURANCE PLAN Tier 1 $1 - $5,000 20 percent Tier 2 $5,001 - $10,000 10 percentTier 3 $10,001 - $40,000 5 percent Tier 4 $40,001 - $80,000 2 percent Tier 5 $80,001 - $200,000 1 percentTIERMEDICAL SPENDING RANGEEMPLOYEE COINSURANCE SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 73IMPLEMENT A TIERED COINSURANCE PLAN FOR STATE EMPLOYEES similar distribution or compatible plan for non-network and out-of-area HealthSelect participants.

FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION This recommendation would result in a net General Revenue Fund savings of $38.8 million and a net GeneralRevenue-Dedicated Fund savings of $4.0 million in the2006-07 biennium. The cost-saving estimate in Figure 2 isbased on actual expenditures, the sample tiered coinsuranceplan in Figure 1, and the following: \u008bHealthSelect in-network coinsurance percentages(medical only, do not individual coinsurance maximum employees whose annual salary is below $18,620;and \u008bcontinuation of the same cost trends throughout theprojection period. The appropriate tiered coinsurance plan may require adjustments to the range of medical spending in eachcoinsurance tier, the employee contributions for each tier, orthe participants' annual or lifetime out-of-pocket maximum.However, a main characteristic of tiered coinsurance is theparticipants' ability to make more healthcare choices basedon their own budgetary constraints. Cost sharing is necessaryto manage the employer's burden of providing healthinsurance benefits. The proposed recommendation wouldlead to a cost-sharing structure to encourage participants to become informed consumers of physician and medicalservices. Figure 2 displays the direct savings that could beachieved from implementing the sample tiered coinsuranceplan in Figure 1. Additionally, savings would increase as participants choose less costly services or use fewer services. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any adjustments as a result of thisrecommendation.FIGURE 2 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO OTHER FUNDS SOURCES : Legislative Budget Board; Employees Retirement System.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 74IMPLEMENT A TIERED COINSURANCE PLAN FOR STATE EMPLOYEESSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 75OFFER AN INCENTIVE TO EMPLOYEES WHO OPT OUT OF THE STATE EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM Currently, the state pays 100 percent of the cost of a full- time employee's employee-only premium for all generalstate employees and university employees in the EmployeesRetirement System Group Benefit Plan. The TexasEmployees Group Benefit Act and the State UniversityEmployees Uniform Insurance Benefits Act allow employ-ees to waive participation in the state health plans. TheUniversity of Texas System and Texas A&M UniversitySystem inform employees of their option to waive partici-pation in the health plan. By rider, the University of TexasSystem and Texas A&M University System have additionalauthority to provide a financial incentive to employees whowaive participation in the system's health plan, but onlywhen the employee has another source of health coverage.The Employees Retirement System does not provide anincentive to employees who waive basic insurance coverage. Often, a state agency's benefits coordinator enrolls full-time employees in the Employees Retirement System GroupBenefit Plan. These employees may not have the opportu- nity to decline the state's health benefits even though somemay have another source of health coverage through aspouse or from prior military service. Requiring theEmployees Retirement System to establish a process thatprovides an opportunity for all employees to waiveparticipation in the group benefit plan and receive anincentive could save the state $8.3 million in All Fundsduring the 2006-07 biennium with a potential $4.7 millionsavings in General Revenue Funds. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe University of Texas System and the Texas A&MSystem notify employees that they may elect not toparticipate in the system's health plan. Currently, 3percent of eligible employees in the University ofTexas System and 5 percent of eligible employees inthe Texas A&M System have waived coverage inplan year 2004-05. \u008bThe University of Texas System and the Texas A&MSystem provide a financial incentive equal to one-half of the employee-only premium to employeeswho waive participation in the system's health planand provide documentation indicating they havehealth insurance coverage from another source.\u008bIn October 2004, the Employees RetirementSystem's health plan administrator reported 3,242state employees and retirees had the TRICAREmilitary health plan as their secondary healthcoverage. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bCurrent statute allows an employee to waiveparticipation in the basic health coverage providedby the Employees Retirement System, but employeesare not necessarily informed of their option to waivethe coverage. \u008bMilitary retirees are eligible for health insurance benefits under the TRICARE military health system.However, the federal government requiresTRICARE beneficiaries who are enrolled in anothercomprehensive health plan like the EmployeesRetirement System Group Benefit Plan to useTRICARE as their secondary payer on medicalexpenses.

COMMENTS The Texas Insurance Code, Chapter 1551 allows anemployee to opt out of basic coverage; however, the statutedoes not require Employees Retirement System of Texas(ERS) to inform employees of their option to waivecoverage. Part-time employees are indirectly informed oftheir option to waive coverage because they are responsiblefor a portion of their premium and must authorize theiragency to withhold the premium amount from their pay. OPTING OUT OF INSURANCE: THE ILLINOIS EXPERIENCE In 2003, the state of Illinois added an opt-out provision to its group insurance program. Illinois was seeking a way toreduce healthcare costs that would have no direct impacton employees and would allow the state to maintain theintegrity of the group insurance program. The state and theregional state employees association both supported theinclusion of an opt-out provision in the health plan. As ofSeptember 30, 2004, Illinois had 1,558 members in opt-outstatus, a little less than 1 percent of the 190,000 memberscovered by the state group insurance program. The opt-out provision allowed the state to save an estimated $3.2 million annually without negatively affecting employees.The opt-out provision was not a detriment to the State ofIllinois group insurance program or the pool of insured.Recommendation 1 would require ERS to establish aprocess to provide an opportunity for employees andretirees who are members of the group benefit plan towaive their participation in the plan. Figure 1 shows howthe opt-out provision would affect plan participants. Both the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M System notify employees that they may elect not toparticipate in the system's health plan. Full-time employees who waive coverage and document health insurancecoverage from another source are entitled to a financialbenefit of $150.92 per month with the University of TexasSystem and $145.60 per month with the Texas A&MSystem. This amount is equal to one-half of the employee-only state contribution. Employees may use that money topay for the cost of optional coverage, such as dentalinsurance and vision coverage. In plan year 2004-05, theUniversity of Texas System had an opt-out rate of approxi-mately 3 percent, and the Texas A&M System had an opt-out rate of approximately 5 percent of eligible participants. This incentive is authorized in the 2004-05 GeneralAppropriations Act Rider 3 and Rider 4 page III-45, underHigher Education Employees Group InsuranceContributions. Recommendation 2 would establish an incentive program for employees who opt out of basic coverage and requiresERS to provide a $60 monthly incentive to full-timeemployees and a porportional amount to part-timeemployees who opt out of the basic health coverage. Theincentive amount could be applied to other optionalcoverage defined by ERS such as: \u008boptional disability; and \u008blong-term disability. The Employees Retirement System has fewer optional coverage types and a greater number of plan participantsthan the university system health plans; therefore, thefinancial incentive is smaller than the amount provided bythe university systems. At ERS, most optional coveragerates are based on salary, age, or both. If an average stateemployee were to purchase all the optional coverages thatcould be purchased with the incentive, the cost to theemployee would range between approximately $55 and $67.The $60 incentive would allow full-time employees who optout to enroll in most additional coverage types. Anyamount not used for optional coverage would remain in theERS fund. A financial incentive to opt out could increase the savings to the state, as a result of more employees decliningcoverage in order to recei ve other benefits. As the number of participants waiving coverage increases, it is likely that total plan costs would decrease. Recommendation 3 wouldprohibit employees from waiving participation in the basichealth plan unless the employee furnishes proof ofalternate health benefit coverage. The incentive would onlyFIGURE 1 HOW THE OPT OUT PROVISION WOULD AFFECT PARTICIPANTS The election to opt out of the Group Benefit Plan would be voluntary. An employee who chooses to opt out of the employee-only benefit of the Group Benefit Plan may not enroll dependents in the plan. After an employee opts out of basic health coverage, there would be two ways toopt back in: \u008bduring the annual summer enrollment period; or \u008bwhen a qualifying life event occurs, such as a change in maritalstatus or employment status. Those who opt back in to basic coverage during summer enrollment or after a qualifying life event would be subject to the current rules relating to evidence of insurability and any applicable provisions of the HealthInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

The University of Texas System andTexas A&M University System have not experienced anynegative effects to their insurance plans as a result of providing a financial incentive to employees who opt outof the plan. The 2004-05 General Appropriations Act provides additional authority for the University of Texas System andthe Texas A&M System to provide one-half of theemployee-only state contribution to employees who waive basic coverage. To provide an incentive to waive coveragefor general state and higher education employees, thefollowing rider should be included in the 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill: Incentive Program. Active and retired employees are authorized to use $60 per month of the \"em-ployee-only\" state contribution amount for optionalinsurance. Optional insurance for the employeesparticipating in the group insurance program shallbe defined under rules adopted by the EmployeesRetirement System. An active or retired employeeparticipating in the group insurance program asdefined by the Employees Retirement System pursuant to this rider may only use $60 per month of the employee-only state contribution if they signand submit a document to their employer or theEmployees Retirement System indicating theemployee has health insurance coverage fromanother source. RETIRED MILITARY EMPLOYEES According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Texas has one of the largest populations of military retireesin the United States. In October 2004, the EmployeesRetirement System's health plan administrator reported3,242 state employees and retirees had the TRICAREmilitary health plan as their secondary health coverage. Thisgroup of employees is eligible for health insurance benefitsunder the TRICARE military health system. However, theTRICARE program requires that when a beneficiary isenrolled in another health plan, the other plan is primaryand TRICARE becomes secondary. Other public employ-ers have begun to offer a TRICARE supplement to retiredmilitary employees in lieu of their health insurance plan inan effort to reduce healthcare costs . In fiscal year 2005, the monthly premium for employee-only health coverage was$315 per month while a TRICARE supplement costs about$60 per month. Recommendation 4 requires ERS to contract with a provider to offer a TRICARE supplementas an optional coverage to employees. Employees with health insurance coverage through TRICARE who waiveparticipation in basic health coverage could apply their optout incentive to the TRICARE supplement. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS This recommendation would result in a net General Revenue Fund savings of $4.7 million and a net GeneralRevenue-Dedicated Fund savings of $502,700 in the2006-07 biennium. Recommendation 1 would require ERS to provide employees with an opportunity to opt out of thehealth plan and could save the state $8.3 million in AllFunds during the 2006-07 biennium. State employeesalaries and benefits continue to be one of the largestsingle state expenditures. Changes to employee benefits andcost-sharing arrangements should be considered in light ofavailable state revenue and goals for employee recruitmentand retention. The estimate in Figure 2 is based on Texashaving an additional 1 percent of employees and retireesopting out of the health plan. It is difficult to be certain ofhow many employees have an alternative source for healthcoverage and would choose to opt out of the state's plan.In an effort to provide a fiscal impact, the cost savingspresented assumes that Texas would continue to pay 100percent of the employee-onl y premium and that the cost of the premium would remain constant. For the purposes of this estimate, the population in the ERS Group BenefitPlan is held constant and the amount of the incentiveremains $60. The recommendation would decrease the number of employees in the ERS Group Benefit Plan resulting in asavings to the General Revenue Fund through decreasedappropriations for healthcare premiums. The introduced2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect anyadjustments as a result of this recommendation.FIGURE 2 FIVE-YEAR REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO OTHER FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 78OFFER AN INCENTIVE TO EMPLOYEES WHO OPT OUT OF THE STATE EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 79POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORTATION Importation of certain drugs could result in significant savings to the state and the beneficiaries of state-supportedprescription drug benefit programs. Depending onprogram design attributes, it is estimated that potentialsavings range between $455 million and $898 million in AllFunds including beneficiary cost-sharing obligations in the2006-07 biennium. Like other states that provide prescrip- tion drug benefits, Texas has experienced significant costincreases in recent years. These cost trends are expected tocontinue as pharmaceutical companies develop new drugsto manage acute and chronic illnesses, brand name pre-scription drug price growth continues to exceed the rate ofinflation, and the population ages. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bPrescription drug costs continue to increase withoverall spending by the state (All Funds includingbeneficiary cost sharing) expected to total almost$9.2 billion in the 2006-07 biennium. \u008bAnalysis of actual expenditures for certain drugsshows that the state and beneficiaries of state-supported prescription drug benefit programs willpay an estimated $1.1 billion more in All Funds inthe 2006-07 biennium when current prices are compared to prices of imported drugs. \u008bWhile drug importation promises potential savings, many factors will affect the actual savings that may be realized. Depending on program design at-tributes, it is estimated that potential savings rangebetween $455 million and $898 million in All Fundsin the 2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bWhile importing most prescription drugs violatesfederal law, an increasing number of jurisdictionsnationwide are actively pursuing drug importation initiatives through a provision that allows citizens withvalid prescriptions to import drugs for personal use. \u008bQuestions concerning the permissiveness of drugimportation cloud the issue. A number of federal initiatives in both the legislative and executivebranches are focused on clarifying the issue. \u008bDrug importation raises safety concerns and mayimpact the business economics of retail pharmacies.RECOMMENDATION \u008bInclude a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropria-tions Bill directing the Employees RetirementSystem to conduct a detailed prescription drugimportation cost-effectiveness and feasibility study,and require the 20 state agencies having the greatestnumber of employees to provide $12,500 each in the2006-07 biennium to fund this study via interagencycontract. COMMENTS Overall spending on prescription drugs (All Fundsincluding beneficiary cost-sharing obliga tions) is e xpected the 2006-07 biennium. In spiteof cost-saving strategies, such as restricting formularies,negotiating with providers for favorable pricing, andincreasing cost-sharing obligations for beneficiaries, thestate's costs continue to increase. For example, the VendorDrug Program experienced an average cost-per-prescription increase of 30 percent in Medicaid between fiscal years 2001 and 2005. The cost increase would havebeen 43 percent if cost-saving measures, such as thepreferred drug list initiative to shift the market to lessexpensive drugs, had not been implemented. As Figure 1 shows, the sta te provides pharmacy benefits to different groups of beneficiaries including state employees,higher education employees, public education employees,recipients of public assistance, and institutionalized andincarcerated populations. The drug needs of these benefi- ciaries are managed by a variety of administrative agenciesand institutions, which sometimes use a pharmacy benefitsmanager (PBM) to help coordinate benefits. While Figure 1 shows prescription drug costs across all self-insured prescription drug benefit programs adminis-tered by state agencies and institutions, it does not showHealth Maintenance Organization (HMO) costs foremployee pharmacy benefits. Instead, these benefits are provided on a fully insured and integrated basis with otherhealthcare benefits managed by the HMOs. In all, 12HMOs provide pharmacy benef its to approximately 8 percent of covered beneficiaries at the Employees Retire-ment System of Texas, 6 percent at the Teacher RetirementSystem, 35 percent at the University of Texas System, and38 percent at the Texas A&M University System.

DRUG IMPORTATION SAVINGS TO TEXAS In order to assess the state's potential cost savings of drug importation, actual prices and expenditures incurredbetween September 2003 and May 2004 by the state; and beneficiaries of state-supported prescription drug benefitprograms for certain drugs were analyzed. Eighty-eighthighly utilized brand name prescription drugs deemedsuitable for importation from Canada comprise the drugsused in this review to assess potential cost savings. These drugs were selected based on a drug importation study conducted by the Office of Special Advocate forPrescription Drugs (OSAPD) for the State of Illinois. Inorder to be deemed suitable for importation by theOSAPD, drugs had to meet the following criteria: \u008bPatient safety\u2014Any drug that could not be trans-ported safely or used by the patient in a safe manner was excluded. \u008bDrug safety\u2014Any drug that was not approved bythe Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for use inthe United States was excluded. \u008bUrgency of need\u2014Any drug that the patient couldnot reasonably wait for was eliminated, including all antibiotics.\u008bControlled substances\u2014All controlled substances were excluded. \u008bCost\u2014Any drug that was more expensive in Canada including almost all US generic drugs was excluded. The pricing component of this analysis focused on comparing unit costs and utilization for certain drugs tounit prices for these drugs. Prices for different strengthsand package sizes of each brand name prescription drug were analyzed, comprising over 200 individual medications.State costs were benchmarked against prices available onthe Minnesota Rx Connect website. T his resource, devel- oped by the Minnesota Department of Human Services,provides a channel for obtaining prescription drugs fromCanada. As Figure 2 indicates, the state and beneficiaries of state- supported prescription drug benefit programs will spend anestimated $3.3 billion on drugs suitable for importation inthe 2006-07 biennium. If imported, the same set of drugswould cost an estimated $1.9 billion, reflecting a $1.4billion cost difference. When the loss of approximately$321 million in manufacturer rebates is considered, thetotal estimated cost difference is almost $1.1 billion in AllFunds for the 2006-07 biennium.

In order to assess potential cost savings, many factors must beconsidered. Quantifiable factors that should be consideredinclude the following: \u008bParticipation rates\u2014The level of participation in anymail order importation program will significantlyaffect the potential savings. The participation ratemay be influenced through incentives such asreduced copayments. \u008bMethod of Finance (MOF)\u2014Each prescriptiondrug benefit program administered by the state isfinanced differently. Depending on the MOF, thestate may be required to share the savings with other financing sources. For example, in the Medicaidprogram, the state contributes 39 percent of theactual cost while the federal government contributes61 percent. As a result, savings in this program willaccrue to the state and federal government in thesame proportion as the MOF. \u008bImpact on Medicaid and state employee benefitprograms of the Medicare Part D Prescription DrugBenefit\u2014Medicare Part D will shift a portion of the cost burden for prescription drugs for elderlyMedicaid eligible recipients (the so-called dual-eligible population of Medicaid) and retired stateemployees from the state to the federal government.The Medicare Part D benefit will start to take effect in the beginning of calendar year 2006. In addition to quantifiable f actors, other considerations that will require further analysis in order to estimate theirimpact on costs or savings include the following: \u008bimplementation and ongoing administrative costs ofan importation program; \u008bimpact of legal questions surrounding importationon participation rates; \u008bexpanded importation options such as the EuropeanUnion, where generic as well as brand nameprescription drugs may be less expensive; \u008bability of foreign supply to meet U.S. importationdemand; andFIGURE 2 COSTS FOR DRUGS SUITABLE FOR IMPORTATION FROM CANADA 2006-07 BIENNIUM (IN MILLIONS) Vendor Drug Program Managed Healthcare Savings on subset of drugs suitable for importation 4$0.9 - Children with Special Health Care DIFFERENCE 1 Actual cost (All Funds including beneficiary cost-sharing obligations) and rebate information was obtained from each agency or institution for the period between September 2003 and May 2004.

The drugs excluded are Prevacid, Protonix, Aricept, and Advair Diskus. 4 TDCJ qualifies for 340B drug pricing status which requires manufacturers to sell covered outpatient drugs at a price determined by a federal statutory formula. As a result of this status, imported prices are not lower in most cases than the current prices paid by TDCJ. NOTE: The cost difference and potential savings of importation at the 43 Community Healthcare Centers could not be estimated within the scope of this study due to a lack of available data on specific drug spending patterns.

In order to estimate potential cost savings to the state, the Legislative Budget Board staff analyzed two scenarios forillustrative purposes. Scenario 1 assumes that all prescrip-tion drug benefit programs will be included in an importa-tion program, while Scenario 2 assumes that Medicaid andthe Children's Health Insurance Program will not beincluded in such a program. Each scenario focuses onestimating the impact of quantifiable factors on potentialsavings and assume the implementation of a comprehen-sive importation mail order program based on the brandname drugs included in this review, stable currencyexchange rates, reliability of supply and current manufac- turer pricing. This scenario analysis, however, does notestimate the impact of other costs or savings consider-ations that require further analysis to quantify, such asprogrammatic implementation costs and expandedimportation options. SCENARIO 1: ALL PROGRAMS POTENTIAL SAVINGS By implementing a drug importation program with the following attributes, the potential savings are estimated to total almost $898 million in All Funds in the 2006-07biennium: \u008bmandatory mail order participation by publicassistance beneficiaries (e.g., Medicaid and CHIPbeneficiaries); a 75 percent participation rate isassumed; \u008ba 19.25 percent cost shift in fiscal years 2006 and2007 from the Medicaid prescription drug programto the new Medicare Part D prescription drugbenefit program, which will be federally funded; \u008ba 5 percent to 8 percent average cost shift in fiscalyears 2006 and 2007 from the state employeeprescription drug benefit programs to the newMedicare Part D prescription drug benefit program,which will be federally funded; and \u008bvoluntary mail order participation by employees,retirees, and other beneficiaries of state-supportedprescription drug benefit programs; it is estimatedthat a 90 percent participation rate could beachieved through a share of savings incentivestructure such as reduced or waived copays anddeductibles. A significant obstacle in implementing this scenario is the lack of an enforcement mechanism for the state in theMedicaid program. Since most beneficiaries receive benefits without paying any copays or deductibles, the statehas less leverage to encourage or penalize noncompliance.In addition, other federal rules relating to the state'smanagement of the Medicaid and CHIP programs maycomplicate implementation. Figure 3 summarizes the composition of potential savings by benefit program and funding source. SCENARIO 2: NON-PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS POTENTIAL SAVINGS By implementing a drug importation program with the following attributes, the potential savings are estimated to total almost $455 million in All Funds in the 2006-07biennium: \u008bno participation by most public assistance beneficia-ries; \u008ba 5 percent to 8 percent average cost shift in fiscalyears 2006 and 2007 from the state employeeprescription drug benefit programs to the newMedicare Part D prescription drug benefit program,which will be federally funded; and \u008bvoluntary mail order participation by employees,retirees, and other beneficiaries of state-supportedprescription drug benefit programs; it is estimatedthat a 90 percent participation rate could beachieved through a share of savings incentivestructure. This scenario would be less complex to implement since it would focus primarily on state agency, higher education,and public education employees. In addition, these groupsare already utilizing prescription dr ug mail order programs for their maintenance drug needs. Current mail orderparticipation rates for the prescription drugs in this reviewrange between 50 and 70 percent. Figure 4 summarizes the composition of potential savings by benefit program and funding source. STATE AND FEDERAL DEVELOPMENTS An increasing number of governmental entities nationwide are actively facilitating drug importation so that their citizens, employees, retirees, dependents, and otherbeneficiaries can obtain prescription drugs at a lower cost.At least 18 states and eight municipalities are consideringimportation or are acting to import less expensive brandname prescription drugs for their public assistance andemployee benefit programs. See Figure 5 for a listing of importation initiatives that other jurisdictions are planningor implementing.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 83POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORTATION FIGURE 3 ALL PROGRAMS SAVINGS ESTIMATE 2006-07 BIENNIUM (IN MILLIONS) Vendor SAVINGS BY FUNDING SOURCE SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.

In thisarrangement the state compiles a list of medications itdeems most appropriate for importation, negotiateswith foreign wholesalers for the best price, andimports the drugs to a central repository fordistribution to local pharmacies. The advantage ofthis approach is the state's enhanced ability to monitor the safety of imported medications. Forinstance, the plan may include random testing ofimported medications at state laboratories oruniversities. There are disad vantages as well, such as potentially greater responsibility and administrativecosts. \u008bContracting directly with foreign drug suppli-ers: Government contracts directly with foreign suppliers. The Springfield, Massachusetts citygovernment, for e xample, has contracted with a Canadian company to allow city employees, retirees,and their dependents to import maintenanceprescription medications via mail order fromCanada. Beneficiaries send their prescriptions to the company, which fills them at participating Canadian pharmacies and sends the drugs directly to thebuyers and bills the city. The city is waivingcopayments to encourage participation. \u008bEstablishing websites to assist citizens, employ-ees, and other beneficiaries to find lower drugprices at foreign pharmacies: Government establishes a state-sponsored Web site to helpconsumers find safe and legitimate Canadian onlinepharmacies. This option may reduce the state'sresponsibility and reduces administrative costs.Seven states\u2014Illinois, Missouri, New Hampshire,Minnesota, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Kansas, andNorth Dakota\u2014operate such Web sites. Some states pursuing this option offer financial incentives, suchas copayment waivers to beneficiaries for switchingto Canadian online pharmacies for their prescriptiondrug needs. While importation of prescription drugs from foreign countries generally violates one or more provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the FDAhas used significant enforcement discretion to allowimportation of certain drugs for personal use. Congressenacted this law in 1938 to create a closed drug distributionsystem, which helps ensure that the domestic drug supply issafe and effective. Howeve r, the personal use enforcement discretion demonstrated by the FDA, allowing citizens witha valid U.S. prescription to import a 90-day supply of drugsfor personal use, has diminished the legal clarity of thisissue. Federal policy on the subject may change in the future. In May 2004, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS)Secretary Tommy Thompson stated he would recommendthat the President not stand in the way of drug importationlegislation that results from ongoing deliberations in theU.S. Senate. Several bills are pending in Congress to permitdrug imports from Canada and elsewhere on a commercialscale, including three Senate bills (S. 2493, S. 2328, S.2307)that seek to legalize drug importation from Canada andpossibly other countries in the European Union. They aresimilar to a House bill (H.R. 2427), which passed thehouse last year (by a vote of 243- 186) allowing drugs to be imported from 25 industrialized nations. If a drugimportation bill passes, more states and localities maypursue drug importation soon. In addition, Secretary Thompson appointed a 13-member federal task force, which held public hearings to gathertestimony from consumers, pharmaceutical manufacturers,pharmacists, health care providers, and other involvedgroups over the summer to examine the issue of drug importation. A report was released in December 2004. In May 2004, 18 state attor neys general (AGs) wrote to Secretary Thompson urging him to adopt a procedure toallow states to import prescription drugs. In their letter, theAGs proposed a drug importation procedure with threeelements: \u008bAllow states to be appointed as licensed wholesalers,or allow them to contract with licensed wholesalersfor the importation of FDA-approved prescriptiondrugs from Canada; \u008bProvide for states to work with Health Canada (theCanadian equivalent of HHS) and the FDA toinspect Canadian pharmacies and exchange drugplant inspection information; and \u008bRequire drugs to be manufactured in FDA-approvedfacilities and imported into the United States fromCanada in their original packaging, with provisionfor labeling and tracking of drugs. Figure 5 provides a listing of drug importation initiatives being planned or implemented in other jurisdictions. SAFETY AND ECONOMIC CONCERNS Safety concerns over drug importation have been at the forefront of the FDA 's objections to the importation ofprescription drugs into the U.S. from foreign sources.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 85POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORTATION FIGURE 5 NATIONAL IMPORTATION INITIATIVES (AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2004) STATE/LOCAL GOVERNMENT PHASE MODELEXPECTED ANNUAL SAVINGS Planning Not available Ohio State-sponsored Web site provides a link to Canadian pharmacies.Michigan Planning State-sponsored Web site provides a link to Canadian pharmacies.

Not availableSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 87POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORTATION According to the FDA, many drugs obtained from foreign sources that appear to be the same as U.S.-approvedprescription drugs are, in fact, of unknown quality. Thefollowing are the primary risks that concern the FDA: \u008black of confidence in manufacturing practicestandards of non-FDA-approved facilities thatproduce drugs; \u008bincreased concern over counterfeit drugs orderedonline from pharmacies that misrepresent the natureand origin of drugs; \u008brisks associated with using untested medications,that while approved by foreign governments, havenot received FDA approval; \u008bconcerns over unsupervised patient usage of certaindrug therapies that usually require close medicalsupervision to monitor the onset of potential side-effects; and \u008bissues with inadequate labeling and labels printed inforeign languages, increasing the potential thatimportant dosage or side-effect information will notbe communicated effectively to the consumer. In addition to these safety concerns, drug importation raises potential liability issues. In the current closeddistribution system, liability for harm resulting from defects with prescription medications typically falls to the manufac-turer. However, under a drug importation program set-upby a state or local governmental entity, it is unclear whichparty may bear the burden of liability. Finally, drug importation may also impact the business economics of retail pharmacies. While dispensing fees (i.e.,the fee collected by a pharmacist for dispensing prescrip-tion drugs) typically represent a small portion of drugcosts, a potential reduction in this revenue source due toincreased utilization of mail order systems may impactretail pharmacies. However, the magnitude of the impactdue to lost prescriptions and other incidental sales isdifficult to assess within the scope of this review. Alsodifficult to assess is the impact that potential cost savings tothe state and consumers could have on the local economy.These are important considerations that should be includedin a detailed importation feasibility analysis. Some jurisdic-tions have attempted to minimize the potential impact onretail pharmacies and at the same time enhance patientsafety by including a \"Primar y Care Pharmacist Model\" in planned importation programs. Under this proposedmodel, a retail pharmacy w ould coordinate patients' drug purchases from foreign sources and would be compensatedon a transaction basis.INTERAGENCY CONTRACT FUNDING FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORTATION STUDY As this analysis illustrates, drug importation is a complex issue with both significant potential cost savings and risks.In order to enhance the state's capacity to realize costsavings and minimize risks, it is recommended that theERS conduct a detailed drug importation cost-effectiveness and feasibility study. In order to implement and fund this recommendation, the following rider should be added to Article IX of theintroduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill: Interagency Contract Funding for Prescription Drug Importation Study. (a) The Employees Retirement System is hereby authorized to collect funds to be used asprovided by this section through interagencycontracts with the 20 state agencies identifiedby this section. A new strategy is hereby createdin the Employees Retirement System's billpattern, Statewide Drug Cost Containment, andfunds received through interagency contractshall be deposited to the new strategy and spentfor the purposes as provided in this section. (b) Each agency identified by this section shall provide $12,500 for fiscal year 2006 viainteragency contract by October 1, 2005 to theEmployees Retirement System for the purposeof conducting a detailed prescription drugimportation cost-effectiveness and feasibilitystudy. If an agency has not executed thecontract by the specified date, then the Comp-troller of Public Accounts shall transfer thefunds. The Employees Retirement System isrequired to report the results of this study tothe Legislative Budget Board and Governor byMarch 1, 2006. (c) In conducting this study the Employees Retirement System shall analyze and report onthe following: 1. Safety of managed prescription drugs importation 2. Feasibility and cost-savings by method of finance of prescription drug importation foreach drug purchasing program administeredby state agencies and institutions of highereducation including but not limited to theHealth and Human Service Commission,Teacher Retirement System, EmployeesRetirement System, Department of StateSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 88POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORTATION Health Services, Department of Aging and Disability Services, Texas Department ofCriminal Justice, University of TexasSystem, Texas A&M University System 3.

Unless the StateAuditor's Office and Employees RetirementSystem cooperatively identify other agencies tobe substituted on the list of 20 agencies subjectto this section, the 20 agencies subject to thissection include: 1. Texas Education Agency;2. Texas Health and Human Services Com- mission; 3. Texas Department of Transportation;4. Department of Aging and Disability Services; 5. Texas Department of Criminal Justice;6. Department of State Health Services;7. Department of Family and Protective Services; 8. Texas Workforce Commission;9.

FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION The funding mechanism defined in the rider provides for the 20 state agencies having the greatest number ofemployees to provide $12,500 each to fund this study viainteragency contract. The design of this mechanism is based on the assumption that the agencies that will enjoythe bulk of the potential savings from a reduction inprescription drugs costs should fund this study. Since theseagencies will transfer funds to ERS from budgetedappropriations, this recommendation does not have a fiscal impact on the General Appropriations Bill. The estimated cost of $250,000 for the 2006-07 bien- nium for this recommendation is based on the followingassumptions: \u008bthree full-time employees who have state purchasingand pharmaceutical expertise; \u008bbudget for contracted services including legal,financial, actuarial and pharmaceutical safetyconsulting services; and \u008bbudget for other overhead expenses. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a rider requiring ERS to study the feasibility ofdrug importation and requires interagency contracts tofund this work.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 89REDUCE THE 12-MONTH BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PAY ELIGIBILITY GRACE PERIOD Benefit replacement pay was created in 1996 to replace a benefit the state provided to employees which paid aportion of an employee's social security tax. The BenefitReplacement Pay program includes a grace period provi-sion, which allows individuals to leave state employment and remain eligible to receive the benefit if they return to work for the state within one y ear. Its appropriation for the 2002-03 biennium totaled $156.8 million for general stateemployees. Reducing the grace period to 30 days woulddecrease the state's Benefit Replacement Pay expenditureby approximately $367,000 in General Revenue Funds, which would be available for other purposes in the 2006-07biennium. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008b66,491 or about half of full-time employees at stateagencies receive Benefit Replacement Pay. \u008bEligible employees typically receive a benefit amountof $1,026 each year, costing the state $156.8 millionin All Funds during the 2002-03 biennium. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bEmployees and return-to-w ork retirees remain eligible to receive Benefit Replacement Pay if theyreturn to work for the state within one year of theirtermination date, which prolongs the program andincreases the cost of providing the benefit. RECOMMENDATION \u008bAmend Government Code, Chapter 659 to reducethe Benefit Replacement Pay eligibility grace periodfrom one year to 30 days. COMMENTS Before 1996, state employ ees received a benefit called \"state-paid social security.\" State-paid social securityprovided additional compensation to employees by payingthe employee portion of the social security contribution inlieu of an across-the-board salary increase. The Seventy-fourth Legislature, 1995, repealed the provisions relating tostate-paid social security. Beginning Ja nuary 1, 1996, Benefit Replacement Pay (BRP) took effect to offset a lossof compensation to employees. Employees hired after thechange in law took effect were not eligible for BRP . BRP , apayment of up to $1,026 each year, provides supplementalcompensation to eligible state employees based on theirsalaries. An employee retains BRP entitlement as long as he or she does not have a break in ser vice from the state of 12 consecutive months. This eligibility requirement alsoapplies to return-to-work retirees. In the 2002-03 biennium, BRP cost the state $156.8 million in All Funds. In the 2004-05 biennium, 57 percent of BRPpayments will be paid from General Revenue Funds. Figure1 shows the declining rate of decrease in the BRP expendi-ture for general state employees. Because BRP-eligibleemployees have greater tenure, they often have moreincentive to remain with the state until retirement. As aresult the BRP expenditure is projected to decrease only 9.8percent in 2006-07, which is significantly less than its rateof decrease in previous biennia. Reducing the eligibilitygrace period would help offset this trend. At present, employees r emain eligible for BRP as long as they have been away from state employment for less than a year. Another benefit, vacation leave, is withdrawn soonerthan one year. The law requires employees be paid for anyunused vacation time 30 days after they leave state employ-ment. Implementation of this recommendation wouldcause employees to lose BRP eligibility 30 days afterterminating their employment with the state. State employee salaries and benefits continue to be one of the largest single state expenditures. Changes to employeebenefits and cost-sharing arrangements should be consid-ered in light of available state revenue and goals for FIGURE 1 BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PAY SPENDING EACHBIENNIUM SINCE INCEPTION (IN MILLIONS) 1996-97 $284.8 FROM PRIOR BIENNIUM 1 Budgeted 2 Estimated SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 90REDUCE THE 12-MONTH BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PAY ELIGIBILITY GRACE PERIOD employee recruitment and retention. Adopting the recom- mendation would accelerate the decrease in BRP spending,which is only achieved through loss of eligibility. Figure 2 shows the total cost savings that would result fromamending Government Code, Chapter 659 to reduce theBRP eligibility grace period to 30 days. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION This recommendation would reduce the 2006-07 appro- priation for BRP by $367,575 $38,692 in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds. Theestimate is based on the number of state employees who returned to work in fiscal year 2004 and received BRP, butwho would have been ineligible under this recommenda-tion. The fiscal estimate is based on only general state employee costs. Institutions of higher education includeBRP in the salary of eligible employees and do not makethe payment under a separate expenditure code; therefore,BRP amounts are not identifiable. The change in policywould affect all eligible state employees and eligible state-paid judges as those terms are defined in GovernmentCode, Chapter 659.121. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill recommends a $116.6 million All Funds appropriationfor Benefit Replacement Pay. This recommendationwould reduce that appropriation by $644,868 in AllFunds. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any adjustments as a result of thisrecommendation.FIGURE 2 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACTBENEFIT REPLACEMENT TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO OTHER FUNDSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 91REDUCE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE Over the five-year period between fiscal years 1998 and 2003, All Funds expenditures associated with insurancecoverage for general state employees and retirees served bythe Employees Retirement System's group insuranceprogram increased 68 percent. The agency anticipates that state health insurance costs will continue to increase; infact, it is projected that a ppropriations will have to increase by 27 percent to maintain the current premium contribu-tion policy in the 2006-07 biennium. To contain this costincrease, the state should r educe its contribution for active employee insurance coverage from 100 percent to 90percent. This would result in a General Revenue Fund and General Revenue-Dedicated Fund savings of $101.4million for the next biennium (excluding certain highereducation funding). Reducing the state contribution foremployee coverage to less than 100 percent is consistentwith the contribution policy adopted by most largeemployers nationwide. State employee salaries and benefits continue to be one of the largest single state expenditures. Changes to employeebenefits and cost-sharing arrangements should be consid-ered in light of available state revenue and goals foremployee recruitment and retention. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bTo maintain the current group insurance premiumsubsidy, it will cost the state $260 million more inGeneral Revenue Funds during the 2006-07biennium than it did in the 2004-05 biennium tomaintain the current contribution policy. Thisrepresents a 27 percent increase, which undercurrent policy will be borne by the state alone. RECOMMENDATION \u008bLower the state's group insurance contribution forbasic health and life insurance from 100 percent to90 percent for active employees whose totalhousehold income is greater than 200 percent of thefederally determined poverty level. COMMENTS Even though the Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, requiredthe Employees Retirement System (ERS) to implementsignificant changes in order to reduce state insurance contributions from what they would have been, the underlying trend in healthcare costs continues to affecthealth insurance premiums. This trend has and will continue to play a role in the upward cost of employerinsurance contributions. For historical reference, fiscal year1998 group insur ance expenditures for general state and higher education employees cost $528 million in All Funds.By fiscal year 2003, this expenditure had grown to $890million, a 68 percent increase. Figure 1 displays this trend in expenditure growth. RECENT EFFORTS TO CONTROL HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS In order to contain the growth in state contributions for group insurance, the Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003,required ERS to make sever al changes in its overall plan design. These changes were intended to address a $715.5million employee group insurance cost increase projectedby ERS at the beginning of the 2003 regular session. Thebenefit design changes included increasing deductibles andcopays for employees, as well as changing the eligibility for retiree health benefits. REDUCING FUTURE CONTRIBUTION COSTS The state currently subsidizes all of the employee-only premium and half of the additional cost of coveringdependents. Continuation of this premium subsidy policy isprojected to cost the state $465 million in All Funds, and$528 $541$591$635$813$890$843$897$1,028$1,178 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Fiscal YearFIGURE 1 EXPENDITURE HISTORY ERS INSURANCESTATE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION EXPENDITURES*ALL FUNDS (IN MILLIONS) * Fiscal years 2005-07 are projected spending estimates. SOURCE : Employees Retirement System.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 92REDUCE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE $260 million in General Revenue Funds for the 2006-07 biennium. This represents a 27 percent increase in expendi-tures over the 2004-05 biennium. Keeping with the nationwide trend toward reduced employee-only contributions among lar ge employers and because of the significant cost increase anticipated for the2006-07 biennium, the recommendation would reduce thestate's employee contribution to 90 percent for active employees ( not retirees). In order to offset the impact of such a change on lower-paid employees, the recommenda-tion would reduce the state employee contribution from 100 percent to 90 percent of the premium just for employ- ees whose total household income is greater than 200percent of federally determined poverty levels. Thisapproach aligns with the eligibility for premium subsidiesunder the State Employee Kids Insurance Program (SKIP),which also uses a 200 percent of poverty threshold foremployees covering dependents. LARGE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE Requiring employees to contribute to their personal health insurance coverage is typical among large employers. The2003 Employer-Sponsored Health Plan survey by MercerHuman Resources Consulting found that most largeemployers that offer health plans similar to the oneprovided by the Employees Retirement System (ERS)require employee contributions f or personal coverage. Approximately 90 percent of the large organizations surveyed by Mercer r equired employees to contribute to their own coverage. According to the Mercer study, among these employers that required personal coverage contributions, the averageemployee's contributions was 24 percent of the total costof insurance, indicating that employe rs generally covered 76 percent of the employee-only contribution. Among large government employers, the average employeecontribution was 23 percent in 2003. The Kaiser Family Foundation's report, \"Employer Health Benefits, 2004 Summary of Findings,\" alsoindicates that large private employers usually subsidizesignificantly less than 100 percent of the employee'spremium. The report indicates that the average largeprivate firm contributes 85 percent. CONTRIBUTIONS AMONG LARGE TEXAS PRIVATE EMPLOYERS AND GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES Figure 2 shows information from a May 2004 ERS document that compares the contribution percentages paidby employees of selected large private employers in Texas,as well as local and state governmental entities. The contribution levels for all plans except ERS relate toemployer preferred pro vider plans, which are similar to HealthSelect. As depicted in Figure 2, eight major employers require employees to contribute to their coverage, and six of themrequire contributions exceeding 10 percent of the pre-mium\u2014Dell, Motorola, HEB, City of Dallas, IBM, andTexas A&M. Employee contributions to health insurancepremiums under these six plans range from the City ofDallas at 39 percent and Dell at 32 percent, to IBM andMotorola, both at 13 percent. According to an article in the San Antonio Express-News , the Texas-based financial services and insurance firm USAAwill require employees to contribute 10 percent of theirhealth insurance premiums beginning in 2006. Reducing the state's contribution for active employee insurance is therefore consistent with the policy of manylarge employers nationwide, as w ell as several large Texas employers. Some may argue that the state must continuethe current contribution policy in order to be competitivewith other employers. However, the surveys mentionedabove indicate a widespread pattern of employees sharingthe cost of health insurance with their employers.EMPLOYEE ONLY CONTRIBUTION WAITING PERIOD EMPLOYERFIGURE 2 COMPARISON OF ERS HEALTHSELECT EMPLOYERCONTRIBUTIONS AND WAITING PERIOD TO OTHERMAJOR PLANSFISCAL YEAR 2004 ERS HealthSelect 100% 90 days UT System 100% 90 days Texas A&M System 88% 90 days City of Austin 100% 0 daysTravis County 100% 0 days City of Houston 91% 90 days Harris County 100% 3 full monthsCity of Dallas 61% 0 daysDallas County 95% 1 full month HEB 80% 0 days SW Airlines 100% 30 daysIBM 87% 0 daysMotorola 87% 0 days Dell 68% 0 days SOURCE : Employees Retirement System.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 93REDUCE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE RIDER PROVISIONS FOR REDUCING THE CONTRIBUTIONS The following rider provisions, and amendments to the Texas Insurance Code, would implement the recommenda-tion. Amendments to the Insurance Code are necessary toauthorize the state insurance prog rams to have premium subsidies that vary depending on an employee's salary. Employees Retirement System (Article I of the General Appropriations Act) 5. State Contribution to Group Insurance for General State Employees. Funds identified above for groupinsurance are intended to fund: a. ninety percent of the total cost of the basic life and health coverage for all active and r etired employees whose total household income is greater than 200 per cent of appropria te federal poverty thr esholds; or b.the total cost of the basic life and health coverage for other acti ve emplo yees w hose total household income is less than 200 percent of appropria te federal po verty thr esholds , and f or all retired emplo yees; and c.b. fifty percent of the total cost of health coverage for the spouses and dependent childrenof all active and retir ed employees who enroll in coverage categories which include a spouse and/or dependent children; Higher Education Employees (Article III of the General Appropriations Act) 1. State Contribution to Group Insurance for Higher Education Employees Participatingin the Employees Retirement System GroupInsurance Program. Funds identified above for group insurance are intended to fund: a. ninety percent of the total cost of the basic life and health coverage for all active and r etired employees whose total household income is greater than 200 per cent of appropria te federal poverty thr esholds; or b.the total cost of the basic life and health coverage for other acti ve emplo yees w hose total household income is less than 200 percent of appropria te federal po verty thr esholds , and f or all retired emplo yees; and c.b. fifty percent of the total cost of health coverage for the spouses and dependentchildren of all active and retired employees whoenroll in coverage categories which include a spouse and/or dependent children; EMPLOYEE IMPACT Figure 3 indicates the impact the recommendation would have on active state employees with incomes above$18,620. The unadjusted cost equals a flat 10 percent ofthe HealthSelect fiscal year 2005 annual premium. Theadjusted cost reflects the savings associated with using thestate's premium conversion, or TexFlex, program for payment of the 10 percent contribution. Premium conver-sion results in savings because employees pay for insurancewith pre-tax dollars. The adjusted cost, therefore, woulddepend on the employees' marginal income tax bracket. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION The following fiscal impact information (Figure 4) indicates savings of $96.2 million in General Revenue Funds and$22.5 million in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds in the2006-07 biennium would result from implementation ofthe recommendation. The savings estimate was calculated using: \u008bthe fiscal year 2005 employee-only monthly pre- mium of $315.56 (for HealthSelect); no increase inthe premium cost is assumed; \u008bthe number of active sta te employees who have health insurance through ERS (including highereducation employees) as of October 2004; noincrease in the number of employees covered isassumed; \u008ban adjustment to account for part-time employees,assuming that about 14 percent of the populationare part-time employees; this adjustment reducedthe savings by the same percentage; andFIGURE 3 EMPLOYEE IMPACT REDUCE CONTRIBUTION TO 90 PERCENT-BASED ON FISCAL YEAR 2005 PREMIUM BRACKETANNUAL ADJUSTED EMPLOYEE COSTANNUAL UNADJUSTED EMPLOYEE COST SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 94REDUCE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE \u008bwaivers for employees with annual state salaries less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The Health and Human Services Commission currentlydetermines eligibility for the State Kid's Insurance Program through a contract with a third-partyvendor. A similar eligibility determination processwould need to be established to qualify stateemployees who apply for an exemption to paying 10percent of their healthcare premium. This adminis-trative cost would reduce the savings shown inFigure 4. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any savings as a result of these recommenda-tions. The ERS Trust Fund, as well as the University of Texas Sytem and Texas A&M University System healthplans, would gain revenue from employees paying 10percent of the cost of active employee insurance coverage. This revenue gain could be used to offset employeehealthcare costs and, as a result, make $96.2 million ofGeneral Revenue Funds available in the 2006-07 biennium.FIGURE 4 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACTREDUCE CONTRIBUTION TO 90 PERCENTGENERAL AND HIGHER REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO OTHER FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 95REQUIRE STATE RETIREES UNDER THE AGE OF 65 TO PAY A PORTION OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS The cost of health benefits for state retirees increased 36 percent from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2003. In the2002-03 biennium, healthcare for retirees covered by theEmployees Retirement System cost the state $652 millionin All Funds. State retirees age 65 or older are eligible for Medicare and pay a federal insur ance premium for Medicare Part B. The state is the primary provider of health insurance coveragefor its retirees under age 65, but when a retiree reaches age65, Medicare becomes the primary health insuranceprovider and the state becomes the secondary. Requiringretirees under age 65 to pay to the state the equivalent ofthe Medicare Part B premium would reduce the GeneralRevenue Funds required for retiree healthcare coverage by$59.7 million and $14.3 million of General Revenue-Dedicated Funds in the 2006-07 biennium. If imple-mented, retirees would contribute $78.20 per month, orapproximately 25 percent of the fiscal year 2005 premium for members only. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe state retiree population is expected to grow by 5percent each year for the next few years. \u008bHealth insurance premiums are also expected tocontinue to increase. Premiums for retirees have increased by 7 percent each year since 2001. This is more than twice the rate of inflation. \u008bUnder TRS-Care, a health plan offered to retirees ofthe Teacher Retirement System, the state requirespublic education retirees to pay a premium towardstheir health insurance. This is also true of severalother states, major employers, and non-stategovernment entities in Texas. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bThe increasing number of state retirees coupledwith rising insurance premiums call for the consider-ation of strategies to share the increased cost ofhealth insurance between retirees and the state. RECOMMENDATION \u008bRequire state and higher education retirees underage 65 to pay the state the equivalent of theMedicare Part B premium as their share of healthinsurance premiums.COMMENTS The state currently pays 100 percent of its retirees' healthinsurance premiums regardless of their age. In fiscal year 2004 there were 65,981 general state and higher educationretirees who received their health insurance through theEmployees Retirement System (ERS). Forty-four percent,or 29,134, were retirees under the age of 65, which doesnot include retirees of the Texas A&M System (A&MSystem) or the University of Texas System (UT System). The state's retiree population under ERS is projected to grow 5 percent in each of the next several years. This means that there will be an additional 1,457 general stateand higher education retirees under age 65 in fiscal year2005. Historically, plan members within this age rangecontribute to higher healthcare costs. The All Funds cost tothe state for retiree and retiree dependent health insurance will be approximately $246.6 million in fiscal year 2005.This is a $24 million increase from the estimated fiscal year2004 figure of $222.6 million. Healthcare costs are also e xpected to continue to increase. In fiscal year 2001, total healthcare plan expenditures forgeneral state and higher education retirees equaled $258million. By fiscal year 2003, healthcare costs grew by 36 percent, or $92 million. CURRENT RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS State retirees under age 65 do not pay a premium for their health insurance coverage, while those 65 and older mustassume financial responsibility for their primary healthinsurance. Prior to reaching age 65, Medicare benefits arenot typically available. ERS must, therefore, recognizemedical expenses that will shift to Medicare at age 65. Forfiscal year 2004, Legislative Budget Board staff estimatethat the state paid $105 million from All Funds to coverthe cost of member-only health insurance premiums for general state and higher education r etirees under age 65. In calendar year 2005, retirees age 65 or older will pay $78.20 monthly for Medicare Part B insurance coverage tothe federal government. Under current ERS rules, the statedoes not require retirees to purchase Medicare coverage;however, the state plan is the secondary provider of healthcoverage regardless of whether the retiree has Medicarecoverage or not. Therefore, if a Medicare-eligible retireedoes not purchase Medicare, the retiree, and not the stateinsurance, is responsible for the portion of the claim thatSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 96REQUIRE STATE RETIREES UNDER THE AGE OF 65 TO PAY A PORTION OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS would otherwise have been paid by Medicare. Nevertheless, in this situation the state insurance, while secondary, is stillprovided to the retiree at no cost. Retirees of the Teacher Retirement System under the age of 65 are required to pay a variable premium based on the retiree's years of service and the program in which theretiree participates. Beginning in fiscal year 2005, theseretirees are required to pay an additional amount ofpremium equal to the Medicare Part B premium. OTHER STATES' CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD RETIREE HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS Other states and major private sector employers have reduced health benefits for retirees and increased retireecontributions for health insurance premiums to help defrayhealthcare expenses. As Figure 1 shows, few major employ-ers in Texas contribute to r etiree health insurance. In fact, Southwest Airlines, Motorola, and Dell pay nothing forretiree health insurance premiums. Since 1998, the number of states that pay the full cost of their employees' healthcare premiums has decreased from22 to16. Thirty-four states require their retirees to pay all ora part of their health insurance premium. Figure 2 showsthe different contributions that states make for the healthinsurance of their retirees in Arkansas, California, Florida,and New York.A recent study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt Associates found that 91 percent of the 408firms surveyed require retirees to pay a portion of theirpremium. It also found that the retiree's share for healthinsurance increased by 19 percent between 2002 and 2003.Even in the context of the trend of reductions in employercontributions for retir ees' health insurance, 86 percent of the firms indicate that they ar e very likely to increase the portion that retirees are required to contribute to theirhealth insurance premiums in the next three years due torapidly increasing premiums. REQUIRING RETIREES TO PAY THE EQUIVALENT OF MEDICARE PART B PREMIUMS The recommendation would require retirees under age 65 to pay for a portion of the cost of their healthcare pre-mium. As the number of state retirees and the cost ofhealth insurance continue to increase, the financial burdenon the state is also increasing. Higher healthcare costs andthe limited contributions of other government andcommercial entities to retiree health insurance are reasonsfor state retirees in Texas to be required to pay for aportion of their healthcare premiums. The recommendation would pro vide the state with an option for offsetting the rising cost of healthcare. Imple-mentation of this recommendation would allow a reductionin the appropriation for retiree group insurance for ERSand the Higher Education Employees Group Insurance.The recommendation would be implemented by including rider language in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Billfor ERS and the Higher Education Employees. Additionallanguage from the riders continued in the 2004-05 GeneralAppropriations Act is underlined on the following page.

If implemented, the state's contributionfor retiree health insurance would be reduced by theequivalent of the Medicare Part B premium and would offset a portion of ERS's-general state and higher educa-tion, A&M System's, and UT System's appropriationrequirement for retiree health insurance coverage for allstate retirees who receive health insurance. The amounts in Figure 3 take into account the federally projected Medicare Part B premium for each of the years noted below. The number of retirees is assumed to increaseat 5 percent per year and to have the current percentage ofretirees under age 65. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not include the savings noted in the fiscal impact tableshown above. The gain to the Trust Fund would comefrom retiree's under age 65 paying a portion of their healthinsurance premium. This gain could be used to offsetretiree healthcare costs and, as a result, make available$59.7 million in General Revenue Funds.FIGURE 3 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACTRETIREES UNDER 65 PAYING A MEDICARE PART B PREMIUM EQUIVALENT TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO OTHER FUNDSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 98REQUIRE STATE RETIREES UNDER THE AGE OF 65 TO PAY A PORTION OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 99DECREASE ADMINISTRATIVE ALLOWANCE FOR COLLECTION OF GASOLINE TAX Current statute allows suppliers, distributors, and importers of gasoline to retain, as a group, 2 percent of the revenuegenerated by the tax to cover the administrative costs ofprocessing and paying the tax. This percentage has notbeen adjusted since fiscal year 1971, yet Texas' tax rate ongasoline has quadrupled in the last 30 years, and domesticmotor fuel consumption has increased by 76.6 percentduring the same period of time. Adjusted for inflation,gasoline distributors and suppliers retained approximately $30.0 million as a result of the allowance in 1972 and willretain $48.0 million in each year of the 2006-07 biennium,even though the widespread use of computers for account-ing purposes has reduced administration costs. In thiscontext, the 2 percent share of the tax presently retained by suppliers, distributors, and importers seems unjustified.Reducing the administrative allowance for the gasoline taxto 1 percent would generate $12.1 million in additionalrevenue for the Available School Fund and $36.2 millionfor the State Highway Fund in the 2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bOver the past 30 years, the 2 percent of the stategasoline tax retained by suppliers, distributors, andimporters to cover administrative costs has becomeexcessive in the context of a quadrupled tax rate anda dramatically increased rate of domestic motor fuelconsumption. RECOMMENDATION \u008bAmend Chapter 162 of the Tax Code to reduce theadministrative allowance for collection of thegasoline tax to 1 percent f or suppliers, importers, and distributors, with three-fourths of the allowanceprovided to distributors. COMMENTS Motor fuels taxes consist of the state's consumption taxeson gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied gas. The state'srevenue from these taxes results from a combination oftotal consumption and the tax rate. Adjusted for inflation,in fiscal year 1972, Texas collected $1.6 billion in motorfuels taxes. By fiscal year 2003, the state collected $2.8billion in motor fuels tax receipts. The tax on gasoline was first enacted in fiscal year 1923 at a rate of one cent per gallon. The tax rate was raised to 4cents per gallon in fiscal year 1941, then to 5 cents per gallon in fiscal year 1955, 10 cents per gallon in fiscal year 1984, 15 cents per gallon in fiscal year 1986, and finally 20 cents per gallon in fiscal year 1991. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. domestic motor fuel consumption has increased from 92.3 billiongallons in 1970 to 163 billion gallons in 2001. This increaserepresents a 76.6 percent increase over this 30-year timeperiod. Specifically in Texas, the Federal Highway Adminis-tration reports that consumption has increased from 10.3billion gallons in 1992 to 14.5 billion gallons in 2002. Thisgrowth represents a 41 percent increase. ADMINISTRATIVE ALLOWANCE Article VIII, Section 7-a of the Texas Constitution dedicates three-fourths of the revenue from motor fuels taxes to uses related to the state highway system. Theremaining one-fourth is dedicated to the Available SchoolFund. Motor fuels tax receipts are collected each monthand deposited in the General Revenue Fund. After theComptroller of Public Accounts (comptroller) makesrequired deductions and refunds (Section 162.502 of theTax Code), the receipts are allocated to the AvailableSchool Fund and the State Highway Fund. However, the administrative allowance on motor fuels taxes is separated from the state's tax revenue before it isdeposited with the comptroller. The administrativeallowance is allowed to remain with suppliers, distributors,and importers of motor fuels taxes in exchange for theirtimely submission of the taxes to the state treasury. The first statutory provision outlining the allowance in relation to the gasoline tax (House Bill 8, Forty-seventhLegislature, Regular Session, 1941) set it at 1 percent ofrevenues collected and indicated it was \"to cover losses andthe expense of collecting the tax levied herein.\" Theallowance was raised to 1.5 percent of revenues collected inthe 1950s, when the statutory language indicated it was \"forthe expense of collecting, accounting for, reporting, andhandling such motor fuel and the taxes collected.\" In fiscalyear 1971, the allowance was raised to 2 percent ofrevenues collected and has not been raised since. Thestatute was amended in fiscal year 1981 to indicate theallowance was \"for expenses of collecting, accounting for,reporting, and remitting the tax collected and for keepingrecords.\" Current statute now indicates the allowance is \"tocover administrative expenses.\"STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 100DECREASE ADMINISTRATIVE ALLOWANCE FOR COLLECTION OF GASOLINE TAX According to the comptroller's January 2003 report of tax exemptions and incidence, the allowances for the gasolinetax are estimated to amount to $48 million per year in the2006-07 biennium. Opponents to a reduction in the administrative allow- ance for gasoline distributors and suppliers argue thatthe current 2 percent allowance does not fully reimbursefor the costs of collecting the tax. However, accordingto a 1999 survey commissioned by an industry associa-tion, while the allowance was not sufficient to cover thecosts of some suppliers and distributors, 48 percent ofthose surveyed said they had costs that were less thanthe allowance. Furthermore, in addition to the allow-ance, distributors keep the interest earned on pre-deposited tax revenues. Suppliers deposit taxes to the state treasury, which are due on the twenty-fifth day of the month following the month inwhich the tax accrued. Distributors and importers can deferpaying their taxes to suppliers until two days before this date.This allows them to keep it for almost one month beforegiving it to the supplier who then remits it to the comptrol-ler. During this time period, the collected funds can earninterest or realize other earnings from temporary use. In thesame 1999 study, they found that the median amount earned by respondents from the use of the pre-depositedfunds was $2,130 per year. An electronic transfer must be used to make payments. Distributors who make these payments on a timely basismay keep 1.75 percent of the total taxes due to cover theiradministrative expenses. Suppliers and importers are thenallowed to deduct an additional 0.25 percent from their tax payment, if they too are timely. Figure 2 illustrates thecollection process for a single distributor, supplier, and thestate treasury. The text of the gasoline tax provisions relating to allow- ances follows: Sec.162.113. REMITTANCE OF TAX TO SUPPLIER OR PERMISSIVE SUPPLIER; ALLOWANCES. (e) A licensed distributor or licensed importer who makes timely payments of the gasoline tax imposedunder this subchapter is entitled to retain an amountequal to 1.75 percent of the total taxes to be paid tothe supplier or permissive supplier to cover adminis-trative expenses. Sec.162.116. INFORMATION REQUIRED ON SUPPLIER'S AND PERMISSIVE SUPPLIER'SRETURN; CREDITS AND ALLOWANCES. (b) A supplier or permissive supplier that timely pays the tax to this state may deduct from the amount oftax due a collection allowance equal to two percentof the amount of tax payable to this state. Sec.162.119. INFORMATION REQUIRED ON IMPORTER'S RETURN; ALLOWANCES. (b) An importer of gasoline that timely files a return and payment may deduct from the amount of tax payablewith the return a collection allowance equal to twopercent of the amount of tax payable to this state. The report recommendation w ould require changes to sections 162.113, 162.116, and 162.119 of the Tax Code.Amendments to the above-mentioned sections wouldreflect the reduction in the administrative allowance forcollection of the gasoline tax to 1 percent for suppliers,importers, and distributors, with three-fourths of theallowance provided to distributors.FIGURE 1 DEFINITIONS OF SELECTED GAS TAX COLLECTION TERMS SOURCE : Tax Code, Chapter 162.Bulk transfer / terminal systemBulk transfer / terminal systemBulk transfer / terminal systemBulk transfer / terminal systemBulk transfer / terminal system means the motor fuel distribution system consisting of refineries, pipelines, marine vessels, and terminals.

At that time, theestimated gain to the Available School Fund would havebeen approximately $8 million per year and the gain to theState Highway Fund would have been approximately $23million per year. In January 1993, the comptroller's TPR recommended eliminating filing allowances related to the sales tax,alcoholic beverage excise tax, and the hotel/motel tax, aswell as the motor fuels taxes. That recommendation wasestimated to bring approximately $50 million more into theGeneral Revenue Fund per year, as well as $11 million forthe Available School Fund and $32 million for the StateHighway Fund. House Bill 2458, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, as introduced, would have reduced theadministrative allowance to 0.5 percent, split equallybetween suppliers and distributors. However, the commit-tee substitute for the bill returned the allowance amount to2 percent, as it was in pr evious statute, split 1.75 percent to distributors and 0.25 percent to suppliers. ADMINISTRATIVE COST ALLOWANCES IN OTHER STATES Twenty-four states have some kind of allowance to cover the administrative costs of collecting and reporting motorfuels taxes to their respective treasuries. Based on 2002data, five of the top ten states, ranked by gross motor fueltax collections, provide some form of administrativeallowance. Figure 3 summarizes this information.Florida provides an allowance of 0.2 percent for suppliers if they are timely in their tax payments and split theallowance evenly with purchasers. Ohio allows an allowanceof up to 3 percent, although in addition to administrativecosts this amount covers actual losses of fuel resultingfrom handling losses. In Illinois, timely suppliers ordistributors may take a 1.75 per cent allowance for record- keeping and tax collection costs. This rate was loweredfrom 2 percent, effective June 30, 2003. In some cases, states gradually reduce the allowance as the amount of tax increases. For example, Pennsylvaniaprovides a 2 percent allowance on taxes up to $50,000, 1.5percent on taxes between $50,000 and $75,000, 1 percent on taxes between $75,000 and $100,000, and 0.5 percent ontaxes over $100,000. As an alternative to an across-the-board administrative allowance reduction, Texas could use a similar model tothe one being used in Pennsylvania. Based on annualizedgasoline tax collections from February 2004 to September2004, gradually reducing the allowance as the amount oftax increases could yield the state $68 million in All Fundssavings for the 2006-07 biennium. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION This recommendation would result in a net General Revenue Fund gain of $12.1 million in the 2006-07biennium. In January 2003, the comptroller estimated the 2percent gasoline tax allowances at $48.1 million in fiscalyear 2006 and $48.5 million in fiscal year 2007. Figure 4reflects the fiscal impact resulting from reducing the totaladministrative allowance to 1 percent. The gain to GeneralRevenue is for the Available School Fund. The gain toOther Funds is for the State Highway Fund. Since the recommendation will not increase the state's taxes onmotor fuels, it is assumed that no additional federalhighway funds will be available to the state should therecommendation be implemented.

Businesses and individuals who occupy a hotel room for 30or more consecutive days are considered permanentresidents and are exempt from the hotel tax. Corporations and individuals who enter into written lease agreementswith hotels for the continuous lease of rooms for morethan 30 days benefit from this exemption. In fiscal year 2004, the state collected $238.9 million in hotel tax revenue. Without the permanent resident excep-tion for individuals and corpora tions, the General Revenue Fund would have received $6.9 million more in revenue for that same period. Eliminating this exception would requireamending Chapter 156 of the Tax Code to repeal theclause that exempts businesses and individuals who havethe right to use or possess a hotel room for at least 30 dayswithout interruption of payment from paying the hotel tax.Implementing this recommendation could provide anadditional $14.2 million in General Revenue and GeneralRevenue-Dedicated Funds for the 2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bThe state forfeits $6.9 million in General Revenueand General Revenue-Dedicated Funds annually asa result of corporations and individuals takingadvantage of the 30-day, long-term stay exemption. RECOMMENDATION \u008bAmend Chapter 156 of the Tax Code to repeal thepermanent resident exception to the hotel occu-pancy tax. COMMENTS At present, the hotel occupancy tax is imposed at a 6 percentrate. The state hotel tax applies to room rental charges forperiods of less than 30 continuous days by the same person.Cities and counties are also allowed to levy their own hoteltaxes. According to state statute, a city's hotel tax rate maynot exceed 7 percent, and a county's hotel tax rate must bebetween 2 and 7 percent. However, if local governmentschoose to levy a hotel tax, the combined state, county, andcity hotel occupancy tax may not exceed 15 percent. In fiscalyear 2004, approximately 400 cities and 48 counties in Texaslevied local hotel occupancy taxes. The hotel occupancy tax is collected by the hotel providing the service and sent to the Comptroller of Public Accountson a monthly basis. Section 156.251 of the Tax Codeprovides that, \"The revenue from the tax imposed by this chapter shall be deposited in the state treasury to the creditof the general revenue fund.\" By statute, one-twelfth of the revenue generated by the tax is used for the purpose ofpromoting tourism in the state. One-third of the revenuegenerated by the tax fr om hotels in eligible coastal munici- palities is allocated to those municipalities for the mainte-nance of their public beaches. One percent of the revenuegenerated can be deducted and withheld by the hotel asreimbursement for the cost of collecting the tax. While state hotel tax reven ue has increased steadily for the last two years, as Figure 1 shows, it has not returned to itsearly 2000 levels. Hotel tax revenues decreased from $247million in fiscal year 2001 to $228 million in fiscal year2003. According to the comptroller, hotel tax revenues areprojected to grow to $247 million in fiscal year 2005. Section 156.101 of the Tax Code provides that a \"person\" with the right to use or possess a hotel room for at least 30consecutive days without interruption of payment is notrequired to pay the state hotel occupancy tax. In thecontext of the law, the term \"person\" also includesbusinesses. Approximately 83 percent of hotel tax exemp-tions are claimed by businesses such as consulting firms,airlines, trucking companies, and railroads that oftenbenefit greatly when they r ent entire blocks of hotel rooms for more than 30 consecutive days. The permanent residentexception to the hotel occupancy tax is the only clause inChapter 156 of the Tax Code that grants a tax exemptionto corporations and private individuals.

HOTEL TAXES IN OTHER STATES Ten states presently have hotel occupancy taxes. The tax rates range from 4 per cent in Montana to 12 percent in Connecticut. Also, the period of time after which guestsbecome exempt from paying state hotel occupancy taxesvaries from a typical period of 30 days to as much as sixmonths, which is the case in Florida. As is the case in Texas, the majority of states allow their local governments to impose and collect hotel taxes, which is also the case for states such as California that do not levy statehotel occupancy taxes. In California, local and countyjurisdictions tax hotel guests at rates up to 14 percent,comparable to Texas' combined 15 percent hotel tax rate. REPEAL THE PERMANENT RESIDENT EXCEPTION Chapter 156 of the Tax Code should be amended to repeal the permanent resident exception to the hotel occupancytax. In fiscal year 2004, an estimated $117.0 million in hotelreceipts were not taxed due to the permanent residentexception. This translates into a $6.9 million loss in taxrevenue for the state. The majority defrayed costs tobusinesses. If this recommendation is approved and the taxexemption repealed, corporations and individuals would berequired to pay the hotel occupancy tax regardless oflength of stay. This recommendation would have little impact on private individuals as a group because they typically represent asmall portion of the guests who stay for continuousperiods of more than 30 days . Furthermore, this recom- mendation would not eliminate other hotel tax exemptionscurrently allowed for f ederal and state employees on official business, non-profit organizations, religious institutions, and public or private institutions of highereducation, entities for which an exemption makes theircosts more manageable. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION This recommendation would result in a net General Revenue Fund gain of $13.1 million and a net GeneralRevenue-Dedicated Fund gain of $1.2 million in the2006-07 biennium. Revenue from the hotel occupancy taxis projected to grow in the next few years. The revenue gainwas derived by taking a sample of hotels in Texas thatclaim large amounts of exemptions and by calculating theportion of their gross receipts that is exempt due to thepermanent resident exception. The fiscal impact in Figure 2assumes a growth rate of 2 percent in taxable receipts per year, which is equal to the current rate of inflation. Figure2 shows one-twelfth of the revenue resulting from elimi- nating the permanent resident exception as GeneralRevenue-Dedicated for the promotion of tourism asrequired by statute. The 1 percent administrative allowanceretained by taxpayers is also reflected in the savingscalculation. Figure 2 does not reflect the deduction fromthe revenue generated from the hotel tax that would beallocated to coastal municipalities because there are so fewthat receive this dedicated hotel tax revenue. As such, the impact on the state revenue gain is insignificant. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not include the revenue gain noted in the fiscal impact tableshown above.FIGURE 2 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACTPROPOSED TAX EXEMPTION ELIMINATION FISCAL YEARPROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/(LOSS) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSPROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/(LOSS) TO Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 105REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE PAID ON TAX REFUNDS In 1999, the Seventy-sixth Legisla ture required the state to pay interest on tax refunds at an interest rate equal to theprime rate plus 1 percent. Ho wever, the interest rate paid on tax refunds is greater than the rate of return on deposits in the state treasury. For example, in fiscal year 2003, theprime rate plus 1 percent was 5.25 percent, whereas the average yield for the state treasury was 2 percent. The stateshould reduce the interest rate paid on refunds to taxpayerswho voluntarily overpay their taxes to the average yieldearned on funds in the state treasury. By doing this, thestate could avoid spending approximately $22.4 million inGeneral Revenue Funds for interest payments during the2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bThe state pays a higher rate of interest to taxpayerson tax refunds than it earns on funds in the statetreasury. RECOMMENDATION \u008bSection 111.064 of the Texas Tax Code should beamended to change the interest rate paid on taxrefunds for voluntary overpayments to the averageyield earned on funds in the state treasury. Refundclaims filed on or after September 1, 2005 shouldearn interest at the reduced rate regardless of whenthe tax was paid. COMMENTS The primary taxes collected by the state are sales tax,franchise tax, minerals tax, and motor vehicle sales tax. TheComptroller of Public Accounts is responsible for collect-ing most taxes and fees, auditing taxpayer records todetermine compliance, and educating the taxpayer aboutthe tax requirements. Taxes and fees can be due monthly,quarterly, or yearly. It is the responsibility of the vendor tofile a tax return and pay its tax es by the due date. Likewise, if the vendor overpays the amount of tax it owes, it isresponsible for filing a r efund claim with the comptroller. Section 111.104 of the Texas Tax Code directs the comp- troller to provide refunds to taxpayers when taxes areerroneously collected. Refunds are either a result of avoluntary overpayment or a protest payment. The mostcommon voluntary overpayment occurs when a tax-exemptorganization fails to present its approved exemption when making purchases and therefore is required to pay sales tax.This results in an overpayment of taxes, and in order to receive a refund, the organization must seek a tax refundfrom the vendor who originally collected the tax. Thevendor may refund the tax to the organization and make anadjustment on the vendor's next tax payment to thecomptroller, or the vendor may issue an \"assignment ofright\" to the organization to collect the refund directly from the comptroller. Another type of refund that occursis a protest payment. A protest payment is made when thetaxpaying organization contends the tax or fee is not legal;yet, Section 112.051 of the Tax Code still requires thetaxpayer, under protest, to pay the tax by its due date pending disposition of any legal challenge. In either case, if the comptroller determines that the tax was erroneously collected, the tax is refunded with interest.Section 111.064 of the Tax Code directs the comptroller topay interest on tax overpayments for the period beginning60 days after the due date of the tax payment and endingon the date the comptroller determines the money is owedto the taxpayer. The interest rate paid on all tax refunds isprime rate plus 1 percent. The prime rate used for eachyear is the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journalon the first business day of each calendar year. The recommendation suggests the interest rate paid to taxpayers for voluntary overpayments should be reduced tothe average yield earned on state funds in the state treasury.Figure 1 provides a comparison forecast of the averageyield to be earned on state funds and the average prime rateplus 1 percent for the corresponding fiscal years. Duringthe 2006-07 biennium, the state will pay, on average, an FIGURE 1 INTEREST RATE COMPARISON FORECAST 2006 2.8% DEPOSITS FORECASTPRIME RATE PLUS ONE FORECAST DIFFERENCE SOURCE : Comptroller of Public Accounts.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 106REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE PAID ON TAX REFUNDS interest rate that is 3.3 percent more than what it will earn on state deposits. If the interest rate paid to taxpayers forvoluntary overpayments were reduced to the average yieldearned on funds in the State treasury, the state would nolonger be penalized by voluntary overpayments made bytaxpayers. However, for those who pay under protest, the interest rate should remain the prime rate plus 1 percent. Thesetaxpayers were required by the state to pay tax theycontended to be unlawful and therefore did not make avoluntary overpayment. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION By implementing this recommendation, the state could avoid spending approximately $22.4 million in GeneralRevenue Funds and $70,000 in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds for the 2006-07 biennium. Figure 2provides a break down of the total savings by fund type. Voluntary tax overpayments are refunded from the same fund accounts into which the original payments weredeposited. Interest payments on voluntary tax overpay-ments are also provided from the corresponding fund oraccount. In order to obtain the potential savings by fundtype, expenditures for each fund are averaged for fiscal years 2002 to 2004. Figure 3 provides an average of theexpenditures for each fund type. The average for each fund type shown in Figure 3 is multiplied by the difference between the forecasted primerate plus 1 percent and the forecasted average yield onstate funds for fiscal years 2006 to 2010 shown in Figure1. This new figure is then divided by the correspondingprime rate plus one percent to obtain an estimated savingsin General Revenue Funds, General Revenue-DedicatedFunds, and Other Funds.

In a 2003 survey, chief appraisers of localappraisal districts estimated tha t mandatory disclosure would add $18.8 billion of taxable value to the tax rolls. State aid to school districts is based, in part, on district wealth per student. In general, if taxable property valueincreases, state aid to school districts decreases. Therefore,increases in appraised value realized from mandatory realestate sales price disclosure could result in significantsavings to the state. Savings to the state would begin infiscal year 2008 with savings for that year estimated at $19 million. Savings would increase to $64 million in fiscal year2009, $110 million in fiscal year 2010, and $135 millioneach fiscal year thereafter. During the four-year periodencompassing fiscal years 2007 to 2010, school districtswould experience a cumulative net gain of $135 million. Closely related to the local appraisal process is the annual property value study conducted by the Comptroller ofPublic Accounts. The study measures the validity anduniformity of local appraisals to ensure that state aid is distributed fairly among sc hool districts. The study is currently funded with general revenue. Imposing a realestate transfer fee could pro vide a net gain of $9.9 million to the General Revenue Fund in the 2006-07 biennium.This revenue could be used to fund a portion of the costof the property value study. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bThe absence of accurate real estate sales priceinformation leads to increased costs to the state inaid to school districts. \u008bThe state appropriates a pproximately $6 million per year from the General Revenue Fund to finance theannual property value study conducted by theComptroller of Public Accounts. A nominalproperty transfer fee collected in conjunction withsales price disclosure could be used to fund thestudy.RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend Chapter 22 of the Tax Code to require real estate sales price disclosure. \u008bRecommendation 2: Amend the appropriate statute to impose a $35 fee on each real estatetransfer in the state. COMMENTS The lack of real estate sales price information leads toincreased costs to the state in aid to school districts becauseof the link between local school property tax appraisals andstate funding of public schools. The Texas Constitution prohibits the state from imposing a state property tax, but the local property tax is thelargest source of revenue for local governments in thestate. Cities, counties, special districts, and school districtsimpose property taxes. Property taxes are administeredlocally and are based on property values determined bylocal appraisal districts. LOCAL APPRAISAL The state is divided into 253 appraisal districts. (The appraisal districts follow county boundaries, except for the Potter-Randall appraisal district, which encompasses twocounties.) The appraisal districts are governed by localboards, and each district has a chief appraiser. Eachappraisal district is charged with determining the marketvalue and taxable value of property in that district. Statelaw requires appraisal districts to reappraise each taxable property at least once every three years, but many appraisal districts reappraise annually. The most frequently used method of appraisal, the market data comparison method, uses sales price data to establishthe market value of proper ty. This process is dependent on the availability of accurate sales price data. Texas does nothave mandatory real estate sales price disclosure. In theabsence of mandatory disc losure, appraisal districts use various sources of voluntarily disclosed or purchased salesprice data, such as multiple-listing-service data, in theappraisal process. While adequate sales information is frequently available on low-priced and mid-priced residen-tial properties, chief appraiser s have testified that insuffi- cient price data are available on nonresidential propertiesand high-priced residential properties.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 108REQUIRE REAL ESTATE SALES PRICE DISCLOSURE AND IMPLEMENT A REAL ESTATE TRANSFER FEE In a survey conducted by the Comptroller of Public Accounts in 2003, chief a ppraisers estimated that $18.8 billion in property value would be added to the tax rolls ifthe state enacted a mandatory disclosure statute. Totalschool district taxable value for 2003 was $1,057.9 billion;therefore, the $18.8 billion in estimated property valueincreases represents 1.8 percent of total 2003 schooldistrict taxable value. Chief appraisers indicate that they tend to be conservative in their appraisals when they lack adequate sales price data. They also cite the low rate of taxpayer appeals as evidence of conservative appraisals . In 2003, 9.1 million appraisal notices were sent out by appraisal districts but only 751,290protests were filed. THE COMPTROLLER'S PROPERTY VALUE STUDY AND HOW VALUE IS DETERMINED FOR SCHOOL FINANCE PURPOSES Government Code, Section 403.302, requires the state comptroller to conduct an annual property value study(PVS). The primary purpose of the study is to ensurethe proper distribution of state aid to school districts. The study is carried out by the Property Tax Division (PTD) of the comptroller's office. In the PVS, the PTDestimates the taxable value of property in each school district. To accomplish this estimate, property is generallydivided into the following cate gories: single-family esidential; vacant lots and tracts; acreage at market value, and farm and ranch improvements; acreage at productivity value; commercial r eal property; oil, gas, and other minerals; utility real and tangible personal property;and commercial personal property. The PTD estimates the value of property in each of these categories in each school district by appraising a representa-tive sample of the properties in each category in eachschool district. Most of the appraisals are done by themarket data method. Sales data used by the comptrollerinclude data from the appr aisal districts, data from multiple listing services, and voluntary disclosures by propertyowners. When insufficient sales data are available in aproperty category, the comptroller conducts field apprais-als. The PTD appraises only a sample of the properties in each appraisal category in each school district, whereas the appraisal districts appraise all properties. The PTD matches its appraisals for each of the sample properties to the local appraisal value for each of the sampled properties. Through statistical analysis, the PTDuses the relationship between PTD values and local valueson the sample properties to estimate market value ofproperty in each school district and ultimately to estimatethe taxable value of property in each school district.The outcome of the PVS determines what appraised property values will be used in the distribution of stateaid to each school district. As illustrated in Figure 1, if thelocal appraised value is equal to or greater than 95 percentof the PVS estimated value for a school district, localvalue is judged to be valid and is used to calculate stateaid to that school district. If the local appraisal districtvalue for a school district is less than 85.5 percent of thePVS value, the PVS value is used to calculate state aid tothat district. If the local appraisal district value for aschool district is between 85.5 percent and 95 percent ofthe PVS value, and the local value was valid in the twoprevious years, the school district is given a grace periodof up to two years during which state aid is calculatedbased on local value. If the local appraisal district valuefor a school district is between 85.5 percent and 95percent of the PVS value, and the district is not eligiblefor the grace period, the school district's state aid iscalculated based on PVS values. (In a few districts themargin of error of the PVS is greater than 5 percent. Forthose districts the margin of error of the study ratherthan 5 percent is used as the standard for validity.) As Figure 1 illustrates, the distribution of state aid to most school districts is based on local appraisal district values.There are 1,031 school districts in the state. However, someschool districts cross appraisal district lines, making thetotal number of school district/appraisal district combina-tions 1,049. The comptroller evaluates each school district/appraisal district combination separately. The comptroller FIGURE 1 VALUE USED IN SCHOOL FINANCE FORMULA More than 5 percent 30 Local 2 higher than PVS value Up to 5 perc ent higher 304 Local 95 than PVS value 100 percent of PVS value 2 Local Less than 1 At least 95 percent but 648 Local 932 less that 100 percent ofPVS value In grace period 54 Local 22 Received State Values 11 PVS 5 Total 1,049 1,058LOCAL VALUE DISTRICTSVALUE USEDAGGREGATE TAXABLE VALUE OF THOSE DISTRICTS ($ BILLIONS) NOTE: PVS = Property Value Study. SOURCE : Legislative Budget BoardSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 109REQUIRE REAL ESTATE SALES PRICE DISCLOSURE AND IMPLEMENT A REAL ESTATE TRANSFER FEE certified local values in 1,038 of the 1,049 districts in the 2003 PVS. The districts for which local values werecertified account for over 99 percent of total school districttaxable value in the state. State aid is distributed to each school district based, in part, on district property value per student. All else being equal,the higher the district property value the less state aid adistrict receives. For the overwhelming majority of school districts, any increase in local appraised value from manda- tory disclosure would result in an increase in local revenueto the district, and after a one-year lag, a correspondingreduction in state aid to that district. REAL ESTATE TRANSFER FEE A study conducted by the National Conference of State Legislatures in 2001 indicated that 36 states impose someform of state real estate transfer tax or fee. Texas does not collect a state transfer tax or fee. However, under Local Government Code, Section 118.011, countiescollect a real property records filing fee of $3.00 for thefirst page of a real-estate-related document, $2.00 for eachadditional page or attachment, and $0.25 for each name in excess of five that must be indexed. The county realproperty records filing fee applies to various real estate transactions, not just property transfers. According to the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University, 214,375 multiple-listing-service, residentialhousing sales were reported in calendar year 2003. Theaverage annual number of multiple listing service housingsales for the last five years has been 196,645. A real estatetransfer fee of $35 would generate approximately$7 million per year. ADMINISTRATION OF PRICE DISCLOSURE AND TRANSFER FEES Mandatory sales price disclosure and a real estate transfer fee would both be administered at the county level. Thereal estate transfer fee would be collected by the countyclerk at the time the clerk collects the local real propertyrecords fees under Local Government Code, Section118.011. The sales price disclosure information would besent directly to the appraisal district at the time the sale isclosed. The appraisal districts would then provide the salesinformation to the comptroller. Tax Code, Section 5.07(c)already requires each appraisal district to provide thecomptroller with information concerning the sale of realproperty in the district. The statute requiring sales price disclosure suggested by Recommendation 1 should contain sufficient safeguards toprotect the confidentiality of the sales price information.FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations 1 and 2 would result in a net General Revenue Fund gain of $9.9 million in the 2006-07 bien-nium. Recommendation 1 would amend the Tax Code torequire all buyers of real property to disclose the sales priceto the local appraisal district. According to thecomptroller's fiscal note estimate on House Bill 1779,Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, appraisaldistricts reported that as much as $18.8 billion couldeventually be added to tax rolls under some form ofmandatory disclosure. For purposes of the estimate offiscal implication shown in Figure 2, it is assumed that 50percent of that value, or $9.4 billion, would be added over a four-year period beginning in f iscal year 2007. State aid to school districts is based on prior year property values;therefore, state savings would begin in fiscal year 2008. The statewide average tax rates for school districts, counties,and cities were applied to the estimated property values tocalculate the fiscal impact. In fiscal year 2011 and each fiscal year thereafter, the General Revenue Fund savings are estimated to be $135.0 million. Recommendation 2 would amend statute to impose a $35 real estate transfer fee on the buyers of real property. Theestimate of fiscal implications in Figure 3 uses the five-year average of annual residential sales of 196,645 (adjusted by5 percent to reflect sales of commercial properties andhousing sales not captured by the multiple listing services)and assumes a January 1, 2006 effective date. The estimate assumes that the $35 fee w ould initially be collected by the counties and remitted to the comptroller for deposit to theFIGURE 2 FISCAL IMPLICATION OF IMPLEMENTINGMANDATORY REAL ESTATE SALES PRICE DISCLOSURE PROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSFISCAL YEARPROBABLE GAIN TO SCHOOL DISTRICTSPROBABLE GAIN TO CITIESPROBABLE GAIN TO COUNTIES SOURCE : THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 110REQUIRE REAL ESTATE SALES PRICE DISCLOSURE AND IMPLEMENT A REAL ESTATE TRANSFER FEE General Revenue Fund. It is also assumes that the counties would retain $2.50 of each fee to defray adminis-trative cost. The estimate of administrative cost to theComptroller of Public Accounts in fiscal year 2006 isbased on the comptroller's estimate of administrative costfor House Bill 1667, Seventy-eighth Legislature, RegularSession, 2003, which would have imposed a fee adminis-tered in a similar manner.

In general, the property valueappraisal process begins on January 1 and ends July 1 ofthe following year when the comptroller certifies the\"final\" property values to the commissioner of education.Historically, property values did not change significantly after \"final\" certification. In recent years, however, the amount of late property value adjustments has grownsignificantly, and updates to the \"final\" property valueshave extended the property value appraisal process from 18 months to several years. Increases in property valueadjustments made after \"final\" cer tification result in additional costs to the Founda tion School Fund appropria- tions. If increases are made after the related appropriationyear end, the costs are paid from future Foundation School Fund appropriations. Several key deadlines, exemptionperiods and extensions could be revised to reduce lateproperty value adjustments and the related expense to theFoundation School Fund. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bLate property value adjustments have collectivelycaused a significant negative fiscal impact. Forcalendar year 2001, property values have beenadjusted downwards by approximately $4.6 billion,or 0.5 percent, from the \"final\" certification,resulting in additional costs to the state of approxi-mately $60 to $70 million. For calendar year 2002,property values have been adjusted downwards byapproximately $2.4 billion, resulting in additionalcosts of $30 to $40 million. It is anticipated that thecalendar year 2002 values will continue to decline, significantly, adding to the costs. Late adjustmentsfor calendar years 2003 and 2004 are not available. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend the Property Tax Code to change the time limit for corrections toappraisal rolls that affect tax liability (other thancorrections to homestead exemptions) from fiveyears to one year after appraisal review boardapproval for residential property. Eliminate thesecorrections for non-residential property. \u008bRecommendation 2: Amend the Property Tax Code to reduce the deadline for filing late home-stead exemptions from one year after the taxesbecome delinquent to the actual date taxes become delinquent so that final certification includeshomestead exemptions filed late. \u008bRecommendation 3: Amend the Property Tax Code to eliminate the automatic extension provisionfor rendition statements. \u008bRecommendation 4: Amend the Government Code to limit audits of a school district's totaltaxable value and audits of related revisions to theannual property study to one year after the final certification of property values. Provide an excep-tion to this rule for school districts that have paidlarge tax refunds as the result of a lawsuit settle-ment. In these instances, an audit would be allowedfor three years after final certification. \u008bRecommendation 5: Amend the Education Code to require payments to school districts for changesin property values that result from a significant lawsuit settlement made after the related appropria-tion year expires to be paid out evenly over fiveyears, rather than all at once. \u008bRecommendation 6: Amend the Property Tax Code to require taxpayers who litigate a non-residential appraisal valued over $1 million andultimately are not successful to pay the attorney feesresulting from the case for the appraisal district. COMMENTS In Texas, each school district is authorized to levy andcollect local property taxes to support public education intheir districts. Two main variables impact the property taxamount: tax rates and property values. School districtscontract with one or more appraisal districts to determinelocal property values. Once the appraisal district providesthe property values, school boards set the tax rate basedupon the needs of the school district and the amount ofappraised property values. Each district submits its local property value to the comptroller's office. It is the comptroller's responsibility todetermine the amount of property values to be used in thecalculation for state aid to the school districts from theFoundation School Fund.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 112RESTRICT LATE PROPERTY VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TIMELINE FOR PROPERTY VALUES The time line for the appr aisal process can be separated into three major categories: \u008bAppraisals performed by the local appraisal districts; \u008bthe property value study preformed by the comptroller's office; and \u008bthe appropriation and distributions of funds basedupon those property values. Local appraisal districts are responsible for certifying property values in their districts and reporting those valuesto the comptroller's office. T he comptroller's office in turn analyzes and studies those values as well as other data andprovides property values to the commissioner of educationto be used to distribute funds to the school districts. Theappropriations and distributions are initially based onestimated property values and are later updated with actual values. Figure 1 provides a summary of the timeline. TYPES OF LATE PROPERTY VALUE ADJUSTMENTS The \"final\" property value may be updated after certifica- tion to the commissioner of education for several reasons,including successful taxpayer laws uits, statutorily authorized extensions or exemptions, and audits of the property valuestudy. Some provisions have been recently authorized such as an extended deadline for freeport exemption. Otherprovisions, such as the right to appeal property valueappraisals to district court, are long established, but are utilized more frequently. Following is a list of the types of adjustments with related recommendations. A summary of adjustments, other thanjudicial remedies, as well as the legislative history isprovided. Figure 2 lists other significant types of adjust-ments. Corrections of appraisal roll after ARB approval (Section 25.25, Tax Code) - The appraisal review board may changethe appraisal roll to correct different types of errors:(1) clerical errors or other inaccuracies that affect aproperty owner's lia bility for a tax; (2) multiple appraisals of a property in a single tax year; (3) the inclusion ofproperty that does not exist, either in the form describedon the appraisal roll or at the location described on theappraisal roll; (4) one-third over-appraisals; or (5) jointmotions on incorrect value.

In 1997, the legislature extended the provision to community hous ing development organizations (CHODO) that provide low-income and moderate-income housing. Since a charitable organization may file for a late exemption, the taxes may also be prorated at a later date.

Initially, a c hief appraiser was allowed to change the appraisal roll at any time to correct data thatdid not affect the tax liability . In addition, the appraisal review board or its equivalent could change the appraisalroll at any time to correct clerical errors that affected taxliability or to correct multiple appraisals of a property. Thechief appraiser had to certify each change within five daysafter the date of the change. In 1985 the provision was amended to require the appraisal review board to hear a r equest of both the property owner and the chief appraiser (joint motion) to correct a substan-tial error. The hearing had to be requested before the taxesbecame delinquent. A property owner who filed a motionunder this section had to comply with the paymentrequirements in place when the motion was filed. In 1989, this provision was amended to limit corrections, which affected tax liability or multiple appraisals to three years. This time limit was extended to five years by theSeventy-second Legislature in 1991. In addition, theSeventy-second Legislature authorized changes to removeproperty that did not exist in the form or at the locationdescribed in the appraisal roll. Finally, the Seventy-secondLegislature added restrictions to the provision (initiallyadded in 1985) requiring a hearing for substantial changes other than clerical errors, multiple appraisals, or removing certain property that did not exist. Under the amendedprovision, either the property o wner or the chief appraiser may make the motion for a hearing. The error may becorrected only if the appraised value exceeds the correctvalue by more than one-third. It cannot be changed if theproperty owner protests the appr aisal, or if the appraisal was established under a written agreement. If the appraisalis not changed under this pro vision, the property owner or the chief appraiser may file suit to order a change in the appraisal within 45 days. In 1993, the legislature r equired the Appraisal Review Board to correct an appraisal error if the motion was madejointly by the property owner and the chief appraiserbefore the taxes became delinquent. In addition it autho-rized the transfer of remedies to a new property ownerwhen the property is transferred during a tax year. In 1997, the legislature authorized the chief appraiser to change the appraisal roll at any time to correct a clerical error or other inaccuracy that did not increase the taxliability. (Previously these corrections were limited toclerical errors that did not affect tax liability.) Also in 1997,the legislature authorized the pr operty owner to request a hearing, if the property owner and the chief appraiser hadnot agreed to a correction, for certain changes within 15days. This provision does not apply to corrections forclerical errors or other inaccur acies, multiple appraisals or non-existing property. Recommendation 1 would amend the Property Tax Code to limit corrections, which affect tax liability under thisprovision from five years to one year after appraisal reviewboard approval for r esidential property changes other than homestead exemptions, and eliminate the provision fornon-residential property. Late-filed homestead exemptions (Section 11.431, Tax Code)\u2014Homeowners may file for a homestead exemptionup to one year after the delinquency date\u2014usually Febru-ary 1 of the following year. For example, a homeownercould file for a calendar year 2001 homestead exemptionuntil February, 2003. Homeowners who are 65 or older ordisabled may apply for the exemption no later than one year after their 65th birthday or one year after the delin-quency date, whichever is later. This extension was added in 1981 and applies to each tax year that begins on or after January 1, 1982. Section 11.431was adopted in response to an attorney general rulingwhich said that the former April 1 cut-off date for applica-tions could not operate to deny a constitutionally grantedover 65 homestead exemption, but a taxpayer could bestopped from claiming the exemption if he waited so longto apply that his delay made it administratively impracticalto grant it. Recommendation 2 would amend the Property Tax Code to reduce the deadline for filing late homestead exemptionsfrom one year after the taxes become delinquent to thedates taxes become delinquent to ensure final certificationincludes all homestead exemptions filed late. Filing Date for Rendition Statement (Section 22.23, Tax Code)\u2014A taxpayer is required to file a rendition statementby April 15. The taxpayer may request an extension, andthe chief appraiser must grant the extension to May 15.The taxpayer may request an additional 15-day extensionfor good cause with the chief appraiser's approval. This provision was amended in 1981 to require the rendition statements to be deliver ed to the chief appraiser after January 1 and before May 1 unless a chief appraiserextended the deadline to May 15 for good cause. In 1985the deadline was reduced to April 1, and an automaticextension until May 30 was added. In 1993, the deadlinewas moved to April 15 and the automatic extensionprovision was removed. In 2003, the legislature added aprovision, which requires the chief appraiser to extend the deadline to May 15 if a proper ty owner requests one. Recommendation 3 would amend the Property Tax Code to eliminate the automatic extension provision for rendition statements.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 115RESTRICT LATE PROPERTY VALUE ADJUSTMENTS Audits of Total Taxable Value (Section 403.302 (h), Government Code)\u2014The commissioner of education or aschool district may request the comptroller to audit thetotal taxable value of a school district and revise the annualproperty study finding. The request for audits must be filedby the third anniversary of the final certification of thevalues or within one year of change to the appraisal rollmade under Section 25.25 or 42.41, Tax Code. This section was first ad ded in 1995. It required the comptroller to conduct an annual study, defined themethodology to be used, defined taxable value, and allowedfor audits by the comptroller. In 2003, the request for auditwas limited to corrections and changes in a school district'sappraisal roll made after preliminary certification. It alsorequired the audit request to be filed no later than threeyears after the final certification or one year after a changeto the appraisal roll made under Section 25.25 or 42.11, TaxCode. Recommendation 4 would amend the Government Code to limit these audits to one year after the final certification ofproperty values, with an exception for school districts thathave paid large tax refunds as the result of a lawsuitsettlement. In these instances, an audit would be allowedfor three years after final certification. Judicial Review (Chapter 42, Tax Code)\u2014A property owner may appeal an appraisal review board decision to district court. The chief appraiser must adjust the appraisal rollbased on the final determination. Recommendation 5 would amend the Education Code to require payments to school districts f or changes in property values as a result of a significant lawsuit settlement madeafter the related appropriation year expires to be paid outevenly over five years. This recommendation should evenout the impact of large settlements. Recommendation 6 would amend the Property Tax Code to require taxpayers who litigate a non-residential appraisaland lose to pay attorney fees for the appraisal district. This recommendation should reduce the n umber of lawsuits and the related property value changes. ANALYSIS OF 2001 AND 2002 LATE PROPERTY VALUE ADJUSTMENTS For calendar year 2001, property values have been adjusted downwards by approximately $4.6 billion or 0.5 percentfrom the \"final\" certification. This adjustment includes:(1) a reduction in market values of $1.9 billion: (2) anincrease in exemptions of $1.1 billion and (3) an increase inother deductions, such as freeport exemptions, of $856million. For calendar year 2002, property values have been adjusted downwards by appr oximately $2.4 billion or 0.2 percent, including a $1.3 billion reduction in market valuesand an increase in state exemptions of $856 million.Figures 3, 4 and 5 include a comparison of the calendaryear 2001 property values certified to the Texas EducationAgency commissioner in July 2002 to the calendar year2001 property values calculated in September 2003 and inSeptember 2004. Figure 6 includes a detailed comparisonof the calendar year 2002 property values certified to theTexas Education Agency Commissioner in July 2003 to thecalendar year 2002 property values calculated in September2004. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS The fiscal impact of the recommendations can not be determined. However, it is anticipated that, if implementedthe recommendations would reduce late property value adjustments and the related expense to the School Founda-tion Program. None of the recommendations are reflected in the introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill.

These include federal mandates in terms of clients ser ved, services provided, and other program characteristics. States, including Texas, haveexplored various cost-containment mechanisms over thepast several years. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bMedicaid comprises a large and quickly growingproportion of state expenditures. \u008bThe federal government requires that the state covercertain groups, which in Te xas results in coverage of a large number of clients. \u008bThe federal government requires coverage of manyservices for a state to participate in the Medicaidprogram. \u008bStates have made efforts to contain the costs of theprogram in recent years. Texas adopted measures inmost of the possible categories of cost containmentduring the previous biennium. COMMENTS Congress established the Medicaid program in 1965 underTitle XIX of the Social Security Act. Medicaid is a federal-state partnership to provide healthcare to certain low-income persons. The federal government provides match-ing funds in accordance with a formula based on therelationship between a rolling three-year average of thestate's per capita income to the nation's per capita income.There are no predetermined caps on the amounts a statemay draw down using the matching formulas. States mustidentify state, often General Revenue Fund, resources asmatch for the federal dollars. The federal government setsmany parameters of the Medicaid pr ogram, but states are allowed some flexibility. States must adopt and haveapproved by the federal go vernment a state plan, which identifies populations served and various details of theservices provided. The Medicaid program accounts for a significant portion of Texas' state expenditures. Approximately $29 billion in All Funds was appropriated for the Medicaid program during the 2004-05 biennium out of the $118 billion in All Funds appropriated for state expenditures. Medicaid madeup about 25 percent of the total. All Funds expenditures for Medicaid have grown by 90 percent during the periodfrom fiscal year 1994 through 2003. In comparison, thestate budget in All Funds grew 65 percent during the sameperiod. Texas tax revenues, including sales tax, oil and gasproduction taxes, corporate franchise taxes, and alcohol and tobacco consumption taxes, grew by only 44 percentduring the same period. The economic pressure resultingfrom these trends challenges state policy makers to identifyresources to fund the Medicaid program. CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM As a condition of participating in the Medicaid program, the federal government requir es that states serve any person who seeks assistance and meets certain criteria. Thecriteria are generally related to the person's age and familyincome and are sometimes relative to participation inanother federal program such as Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI). Figure 1 identifies the categories of personsentitled to Medicaid coverage under federal law. Forexample, children through age 18 in families with incomesat or below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level are generally eligible for Medicaid. Younger children to age sixare eligible for Medicaid if they are in families withincomes at or below 133 percent of the Federal PovertyLevel (FPL). Figure 2 illustrates the equivalent annualaverage incomes at various percentages of the FederalPoverty Level and for families of various sizes. In light of Texas' large population and these categories that mandate eligibility based on age and family income, a largenumber of children and a relatively high proportion of persons in low-income categories in Texas qualify forMedicaid. \u008bHigh Proportion of Low-Income Individuals. Texas has both a large population and a large number of low-income persons. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, in 2000, 3.1 million Texans out of a population of 20.9 million persons, or 15.4 percent,fell below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. Nationally, 12.4 percent of the people in the United States have incomes at or below 100 percent of theFederal Poverty Level. The size of the Texas population and its percentages of persons at or below the poverty level require Texas to cover a great number of people in order to participate in the Medicaid program.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 118FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH COST OF MEDICAID \u008bLow-income families with children, as described in Section 1931 of the Social Security Act, who meet certain of the eligibility requirements in the State's AFDC plan in effect on July 16, 1996. \u008bSupplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients (or in States using more restrictive criteria\u2014aged, blind, and disabled individua ls who meet criteria which are more restrictive than those of the SSI program and which were in place in the State's approved Medicaid plan as of Ja nuary 1, 1972). \u008bInfants born to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women. Medicaid eligibility must continue throughout the first year of life so long as the infant remains in the mother's household and she remains eligible, or would be eligible if she were still pregnant. \u008bChildren under age 6 and pregnant women whose family income is at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. (The minim um mandatory income level for pregnant women and infants in certain States may be higher than 133 percent, if as of certain dates the State had established a higher percentage for covering those groups.) States are required to extend Medicaid eligibility until age 19 to all children b orn after September 30, 1983 (or such earlier date as the State may choose) in families with incomes at or below the Federal Poverty Level. This phases in coverage, so that by the year 2002, all poor children under age 19 will be covered. Once eligibility is established, pregnant women remain eligib le for Medicaid through the end of the calendar month in which the 60th day after the end of the pregnancy falls, regardless of any change in f amily income. States are not required to have a resource test for these poverty level related groups. However, any resource test imposed can be no m ore restrictive than that of the AFDC program for infants and children and the SSI program for pregnant women. \u008bRecipients of adoption assistance and foster care under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. \u008bCertain Medicare beneficiaries. \u008bSpecial protected groups who may keep Medicaid for a period of time. Examples are: persons who lose SSI payments due to earning s from work or increased Social Security benefits; and families who are provided 6 to 12 months of Medicaid coverage following loss of elig ibility under Section 1931 due to earnings, or 4 months of Medicaid coverage following loss of eligibility under Section 1931 due to an incre ase in child or spousal support.FIGURE 1 CATEGORIES OF PERSONS ENTITLED TO MEDICAID COVERAGE IN FEDERAL LAW SOURCE : U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 2004 HHS GUIDELINES (FEDERAL POVERTY LEVELS-FPL) SIZE SSI eligibility is at 73 percent of FPL. 2. CHIP eligibility is up to 200 percent of FPL. SOURCES : U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Department of Aging and Disability Services. \u008bHigh Proportion of Low-Income Families with Children. According to the U.S. Bureau of theCensus, in 2000 there were around 600,000 familiesbelow the poverty level in Texas. This represented12 percent of the families in the state. Nationally,9.2 percent of families fall below the poverty level. \u008bHigh Proportion of Children and Growth in theNumber of Children. Texas has a relatively youngpopulation. Children make up a larger share of thepopulation in Texas than in other states. The proportion of adults who are of child-bearing age isalso larger in Texas than in other states. In addition,Texas receives a net in-migration each year, bothfrom other states and from other countries. Thecombination of growth from new births andmigration leads to higher population growth inTexas compared to the U.S. as a whole. For instance,between 1992 and 2002, Texas grew by 23.4 percent,STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 119FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH COST OF MEDICAID compared to the U.S. average of 13.1 percent during the same period. Rapid growth in younger cohortsmeans that the number of children Texas must servein the Medicaid program will likel y grow each year. To illustrate the sheer size of the Texas Medicaid program, it pays for approximately one of every two births in Texas. In addition, the Medicaid program is projected to provide coverage during some portion of the year for approxi-mately one out of three children under age 19 in Texasfrom fiscal year 2005 forward. COVERED POPULATIONS AND SERVICES For the 2004-05 biennium, the state of Texas is serving primarily mandated or entitlement populations. As shownin Figure 3, some groups served by Texas above thefederally mandated levels are pregnant women and infantsand nursing home and waiver clients. The state servespregnant women up to 185 percent FPL. The federalrequirement is that states serve up to 133 percent FPL.During fiscal year 2005, the Health and Human ServicesCommission (HHSC) restored coverage for pregnantwomen up to 185 percent of FPL from the fiscal year 2004level of 158 percent of FPL. Another group Texas servesbeyond the federal requirement is persons in nursingfacililties. Texas serves up to 300 percent of SupplementalSecurity Income (SSI), or 218 percent FPL. The federallymandated minimum is SSI, whic h is approximately 73 percent or 74 percent FPL. Figure 3 shows categories ofclients served in Texas acute care programs above federallymandated minimums.Serving both mandated and some optional populations results in a large number of clients for the Texas Medicaid program. Figure 4 shows recent growth in the Medicaidprogram. The average monthly number of recipientmonths approaches 2.5 million in fiscal year 2003, and children comprise a large part of the total caseload. As a condition of participating in the Medicaid program, states must offer a number of basic services. According to the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), states participating in the Medicaidprogram must provide the following services to mostcategorically 21 or older; \u008bfamily planning services and supplies; \u008brural health clinic healthcare for skilled-nursing services; \u008blaboratory x-ray services; \u008bpediatric Infants Pregnant 1-5 Children 6-18 Medically NeedyTANF SSI Aged and DisabledNursing Homes & WaiversPercent of Federal Poverty Level Minimum Federal Mandated Texas Covers185% 185% 133% 100% 21%14%74%218%FIGURE 3 MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY IN TEXAS NOTE: The Health and Human Services Commission restored coverage for Pregnant Women up to 185 percent of FPL retroactive to Septemb er 1, 2004.

States may also receive f ederal matching funds to provide certain optional services. Following are the most commonof the 34 currently approved optional Medicaid services: \u008bdiagnostic prosthetic devices; \u008boptometrist services and services for children age 21; \u008btransportation \u008brehabilitation and physical therapy services; community-based care to certain personswith chronic impairments.For children, Medicaid requires that states provide essen- tially any medically necessary service. The specific require-ment is that medical treatment must be provided forconditions or medical needs identified through the Earlyand Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment program,also known in Texas as Texas Health Steps. This results in agenerous benefit package f or children, who make up approximately two-thirds of the Medicaid caseload. Forchildren with special medical needs, coverage can includesuch additional services as priva te-duty nursing or durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs. These services aregenerally paid through the Texas Medicaid ComprehensiveCare Program (CCP) for children. In Medicaid, adultswould generally only receive these services through a\"waiver\" program. Insurance plans in the private marketface some \"mandated benefits\" but generally have moreflexibility in limiting services through exclusions, limitationson amount, duration, scope, and lifetime maximum expenditures. An example of Medicaid coverage in Texas exceeding mandated benefits is the Vendor Drug Program. Prescrip-tion drugs are an optional benefit, but if the state providesprescriptions, the federal gove rnment requires that states maintain \"open formularies\" in order to benefit from thedrug rebate program. The concept of an open formularymeans that a Medicaid recipient is entitled to receive anyFDA-approved drug prescribed by his or her physician.0500,0001,000,0001,500,0002,000,0002,500,0003,000,000 FY 1996 FY 1997 FY 2003Total Recipient Months/Month Children Recipient Months/MonthFIGURE 4 GROWTH IN MEDICAID, TOTAL AND CHILDREN'S GROUPS SOURCE : Health and Human Services Commission.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 121FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH COST OF MEDICAID The Texas Medicaid program is implementing a \"preferred drug list\" in an attempt to contain costs, pursuant to HouseBill 2292, Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003. The preferreddrug list will require prior authorization for products noton the preferred drug list. The approach is an attempt toguarantee continued access to prescription drugs for clientswhile securing some of the cost advantages of limitedformularies for the state. LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES Medicaid is also a significant provider of long-term care. This can include institution-based care, such as nursinghome care for low-income persons, institution-based carefor persons with mental r etardation, or community-based care for low-income seniors or persons with disabilities. Long-term care tends to be more expensive on an average monthly basis than acute care. Long-term care includesservices necessary to meet a client's needs related toactivities of daily living, such as bathing and eating. Moreover, most clients receiving long-term care servicesalso receive acute care services through Medicaid. The entitlement in Medicaid tends to be for institution- based care. This may be related to Medicaid's history ofproviding services based on a medical model. In 1981, thefederal government began authorizing home- and community-based \"waiver\" programs in order to offer long-term careservices in the community instead of institutional environ-ments. These are referred to as Section 1915(c) waivers,after the section in Title XIX of the Social Security Actthat created the program. States are given some flexibility,including limiting the number of clients served. However,states must follow certain rules established by the federalgovernment to document and assurances that the averageper capita expenditures for waiver assistance do not exceedthe average per capita expenditures that would have beenmade for services if the waiver had not been granted. Names of community-based waiver programs operating in Texas, currently operated by the Department of Aging andDisability Services (DADS), include the following: \u008bCommunity Based Alternatives (CBA); \u008bCommunity Living (MDCP); \u008bdeaf/blind multiple disabilities; Home Living and Home and CommunityBased Services (HCS). Figure 5 summarizes long-term care programs in Texas Medicaid by entitlement or nonentitlement basis and showswhether the program is operated on a community orinstitutional basis.Because Medicaid is designed as a safety net program to serve very low-income, elderly, and disabled persons, theprogram serves more high-needs persons than the average commercial health insurance provider. A recent study concluded that the higher apparent cost of providingmedical care in Medicaid is eliminated if the differences in disability or \"limitations\" of its clientele are taken into consideration. The paper argues that the Medicaid programserves a much larger proportion of persons with disabilities than private insurers, and it is the costs to provide needed services to those clients that result in higher per personexpenditures than might be seen in comparable private coverage. The largest group of clients in the Texas Medicaid program is children. However, although aged and disabled peoplemake up a smaller percentage of clients, they account for the majority of expenditures, as indicated in Figure 6. DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING MEDICAID EXPENDITURES In order to participate in the Medicaid program, each state must serve all persons determined to be eligible and offer those persons medically necessary services in accordancewith the state's federally appr oved state plan. Therefore, states cannot budget fixed amounts for Medicaid services. It can be difficult to predict the number of persons who will apply for and be determined eligible for Medicaid.First, the number of persons eligible for Medicaid servicesappears to be influenced by trends in the economy,particularly the unemployment rate. Therefore, accurateInstitution Nursing Home Intermediate Care Facility-Mental Retardation Community Primary Home Care Community-Based Alternatives (CBA) Day Activity Community Living Health Services Assistance and Support Services (CLASS) Deaf/Blind Home and Community Based Services (HCS) and Texas Home LivingFIGURE 5 SELECTED TEXAS-OPERATED, LONG-TERM-CARE PROGRAMS, BY INSTITUTION OR COMMUNITY-BASEDPROGRAM AND ENTITLEMENT OR NON-ENTITLEMENTSTATUS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.ENTITLEMENT NON-ENTITLEMENTSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 122FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH COST OF MEDICAID predictions of the number of clients can be affected by whether an accurate prediction of economic trends isavailable at the time a forecast is made. A second factor making accurate predictions difficult is any policy change affecting eligibility. During the Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, legislation was enacted that authorized six months of continuous eligibility forchildren's groups and simplified application procedures.Previously, there was no guarantee of continued eligibilityfor children, and they could lose eligibility if their parents'income or asset status changed. The changes were ex-pected to increase caseloads in children's groups, soperformance targets adopted by the legislature reflected anincrease in the number of children to be served and theirlength of stay in the Medicaid program. A third factor complicating accurate projections is the interrelationship between changes in Medicaid policyregarding and the economy of the state. The changes toMedicaid children's eligibility were implemented at thesame time the state and nation experienced a downturn inthe economy and increased unemployment. Higher rates ofunemployment are likely to increase Medicaid caseloads. If one or both parents lose employment, family incomes arereduced. More families may fall within Medicaid income eligibility levels if family incomes are sufficiently reduced. Both the simplified application and the six months ofcontinuous eligibility were implemented in January of2002. Figure 7 shows two pove rty-related children's groups with the unemployment rate superimposed over thecaseload growth. When estimates were made of caseloadimpacts of continuous eligibility, it was not known thatunemployment would increase signif icantly at approxi- mately the same time. A fourth complicating factor with regard to Medicaid projections is the lag between the time agencies preparetheir legislative appropriations requests and the legislativesession. Due to the time necessary to process claims, thereis a lag in receiving final data in Medicaid programs.\"Completion factors\" are often applied to data to adjustincomplete data to make budget projections. However,during preparations for the Seventy-ninth Legislature, 2005,some agencies utilized data points fr om as far back as October or December of 2003 to make projections forneeds in the 2006-07 biennium. Data points are the datafed into statistical models to make pr ojections. The more complete the data utilized and the shorter the term of theprojection, the more likely the projection is to be accurate. A problem with using \"older\" rather than \"newer\" data is that changes in trends in the intervening period are notreflected in the appropriations requests of the agencies.From a technical perspective, quantitative models used toforecast caseloads are much more likely to be close to theactual caseload for the period when the forecast is for ashorter term. If data used for forecasts are as old asFIGURE 6 RELATIVE WEIGHT OF CHILDREN VERSUS OTHER CLIENTSPERCENTAGE OF CLIENTS COMPARED TO PERCENTAGE OF EXPENDITURES 0%20%40%60%80%100% Recipient Count (Avg.

Agencies often supply updated caseload and costdata to funding committees during the legislative session toensure committees have the most recent data and forecastspossible. Predictions regarding the costs of services are also complicated. National pr ojections regarding growth in medical inflation, particularly inflation in drug costs, havebeen outstripped by the actual growth in these items duringthe last several year s. Health economists attribute the significant increases to factors such as the aging of thepopulation, the influence of the media on consumption ofhealth/pharmaceutical services, but particularly to continu-ing innovations in the health field. The costs of theMedicaid program are directly af fected by these factors, as well. STATE ACTIONS TO CONTAIN COSTS OR REDUCE EXPENDITURES IN MEDICAID States experienced rapid growth in Medicaid expenditures in the context of declines in state revenues during the lastseveral years. States have taken a variety of approaches to addressing the resulting economic pressures, including reducing coverage to optional populations, decreasingoptional services, making changes to the Medicaid deliverysystem, making reductions in payments to hospitals andFIGURE 7 GROWTH IN CHILDREN'S MEDICAID AND TEXAS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FISCAL YEARS 2001-2004 SOURCES : Health and Human Services Commission; Texas Workforce Commission. physicians or other providers, instituting cost sharing requirements, and making changes to Medicaid administra-tion. The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and theUninsured has produced several 50-state surveys tosummarize the approaches states have taken. According tothe most recent survey, all 50 states and the District ofColumbia adopted actions to control Medicaid spending infiscal year 2004, and all states planned to implement somemeasures to contain costs in 2005. Some states have responded to increased Medicaid expenditures by reducing coverage for optional popula-tions. Many of those states covered more categories ofoptional populations than Texas. Coverage for the pregnantwomen category in Texas was reduced from 185 percent to158 percent during fiscal year 2004 but was restored to 185 percent FPL retroactive to September 1, 2004. The state legislature has discretion over the number of clients served in Medicaid Home and Community-Basedwaiver programs, such as those operated by the Depart-ment of Aging and Disability Services. Additional savingscan be produced by not allowing new clients to enter theprogram as other clients leave it. In the last budget cycle, Texas adopted various measures to counteract increased costs. For instance, certain optionalservices (health counseling, mental health services, hearingaids, and eyeglasses) were eliminated for adult clients.Approaches adopted by other states and reviewed by Texasincluded additional limits on Continuous Eligibility and Simplified Application Implemented January 2002STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 124FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH COST OF MEDICAID prescriptions or hospital days. In the long-term care arena, there were reductions in the maximum hours of service perweek for clients served in the community. Service hours for using a combination of agency funds and State Fiscal Relief funds. Another significant approach to cost containment was the institution of a preferred drug list in the prescription drugprogram. The Health and Human Services Commissionbegan implementing a preferr ed drug list during fiscal year 2004, phasing in categories of drugs as they were evaluatedby the Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee. Priorapproval is required for medications not on the preferreddrug list. Supplemental rebates offered by the pharmaceuti-cal manufacturers were part of the savings measuresincorporated into the new approach. The Health and Human Services Commission also con- tracted for a study to evaluate savings through furtherexpansion of managed care in Texas. According to theagency, additional sites of STAR+PLUS, an acute-care andlong-term care model, are planned for the 2006-07biennium, along with statewide expansion of the PrimaryCare Case Management acute-care model. Texas made reductions in payments to providers, including hospitals and physicians, during the last legislative session.The payments were partially restored in fiscal year 2004using State Fiscal Relief dollars and many were againpartially restored in fiscal year 2005 using funds identifiedby the Health and Human Services Commission, includingState Fiscal Relief dollars. Cost sharing, wherein a client contributes to the payment for care, is generally seen as a control on utilization orencouragement towards proper utilization. The federalgovernment places limits on the groups of clients forwhom cost sharing can be imposed and the amount of costsharing. Generally, cost sharing cannot be imposed forchildren, pregnant women, or institutionalized clients.Medicaid cost sharing was discussed during the lastlegislative session, but it has not been implemented. Fraud is sometimes cited as a possible source of over- expenditure in Medicaid. Texas added staff to investigateMedicaid fraud at the Office of the Attorney General andestablished an Office of Inspector General at HHSC tocombat potential Medicaid fraud. The combination of these approaches and an infusion of additional federal funds in the form of an enhancedmatching ratio helped the state to partially address higherthan expected Medicaid expenditures during the 2004-05 biennium.CHANGING THE FEDERAL MATCHING FORMULA Some states, including Texas, have raised issues relating to the formula of the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage,or FMAP, the Medicaid match rate. The formula is basedupon the ratio of the state's per capita personal incomeover the previous three year s in relationship to national per capita personal income over the same period. It has beenargued that a formula that took into consideration thepercentage of a state's population in poverty might be moreadvantageous for Texas. Any changes in formula, however,would have some states gaining and some losing. At presentthere appear to be no pending proposals at the federal levelthat would help Texas. CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM Different proposals have been offered as long-term solutions to funding Medicaid. Some approaches that would effect structural changes in the Medicaid programinclude moving to a block grant approach, having thefederal government take budgetary responsibility for dualeligible Medicare/Medicaid clients, and eliminating theMedicaid program entirely. Over recent years, there has been some discussion at the federal level about instituting a block grant for Medicaid. However, proposals identified to date appear to not beadvantageous to Texas, in that they offer a fixed grantamount but still require tha t mandatory populations be served. The flexibility often offered by the block grantproposals is limited to optional populations. The proposalshave included enhanced federal amounts to states in thefirst few years with subsequent reductions in federalfunding. Some states could take advantage of this approachby potentially amending optional coverages. However, sinceTexas has large and growing n umbers of per sons who fall within the mandatory populations, receipt of a fixed grant,even if increased in the first few years, would create evenmore acute budget problems for the state. There are large numbers of Medicaid clients who are low- income Medicare recipients. Depending on the type ofclient, the Medicaid program can pay for the client's Part A or Part B Medicare premiums. In Medicare, Part A premi-ums cover hospital and Part B physician and other services.There are also low-income Medicare beneficiaries calledfull-dual eligibles, which means that all cost sharing underMedicare and even services through the Medicaid programthat are not provided under Medicare are covered by thestates' Medicaid programs. The states receive matchingfunds at the Medicaid match rate for these services. Itgovernment took full budgetary responsibility for theselow-income Medicare recipients.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 125FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH COST OF MEDICAID Some groups have argued for the elimination of the current Medicaid program in favor of medical savingsaccounts and additional tax credits for low-income personsto purchase health insurance. There do not appear to beproposals currently in Congress to accomplish this. Therewould need to be more detail available on how such aproposal would be implemented in order to evaluatepotential impact on the Texas budget.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 126FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH COST OF MEDICAIDSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 127IMPACT OF POLICY CHANGES TO THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) Since fiscal year 2000, the Children's Health Insurance Program has provided health insurance to Texas childrenunder the age of 19 in families with incomes up to 200percent of the Federal Poverty Level. The Seventy-eighthLegislature, 2003, enacted certain changes to eligibility andbenefits for the Children's Health Insurance Program through House Bill 2292 and House Bill 1, the GeneralAppropriations Act (GAA) f or the 2004-05 biennium. This review analyzes the caseload and fiscal impacts of thepolicy changes enacted by the Seventy-eighth Legislature,2003, compared to the impacts assumed in the 2004-05General Appropriations Act. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bDuring fiscal year 2004\u2014as policy changes wereimplemented\u2014the number of children served(caseload) in the Children's Health InsuranceProgram declined by a pproximately 147,000 or 29 percent. The average monthly cost per child alsodeclined. However, the program did not achievefiscal year 2004 performance targets for caseloadand average monthly costs, as established by the2004-05 General Appropriations Act. \u008bThe Health and Human Services Commissionestimates a supplemental need in the Children'sHealth Insurance Program of $78.5 million inGeneral Revenue Funds for the 2004-05 biennium.The regular appropriation for the Children's HealthInsurance Program for 2004-05 biennium was$807.9 million All including $286.7 millionfrom the General Revenue Fund. \u008bPremium copayments are a significant contributingfactor to the supplemental need. The Health andHuman Services Commission's projections forpremium copayment revenue for 2004-05 aresignificantly than the 2004-05 appropriation.Additionally, unanticipated costs resulted from notreceiving a waiver of a federal cost-sharing require- ment and from not disenrolling recipients fornonpayment of premium copayments. \u008bWithout a statutory change, continuous eligibilitywill revert to 12 months as of September 1, 2005.House Bill 2292 authorized six months ofcontinuous eligibility for the 2004-05 bienniumbut reestablished 12 months of continuous eligibil- ity for fiscal year 2006. COMMENTS The Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, enacted severalchanges to the Children's Health Insurance Program(CHIP) through House Bill 2292. CHIP continues to serveall eligible children up to 200 percent of the FederalPoverty Level ($37,700 for a family of four), includingchildren funded entirely by the state without the participa- tion of the federal government (Legal Immigrants andSchool Employee Children). Figure 1 summarizes selectedpolicy changes, implementation dates, and the statutory direction provided to the Health and Human ServicesCommission (HHSC).

In August 2004, an assets test was applied to ne w applicants and renewals whose eligibility was undetermined as of the 24th of themonth. The caseload impact of the assets test occurred inOctober 2004. To be eligible for CHIP, the assets of afamily with gross income above 150 percent of the FederalPoverty Level may not exceed $5,000 in countable liquidassets and excess vehicle value combined (Figure 2).Certain liquid assets and vehicles are exempted from thecalculation of assets.According to HHSC, the process of developing rules and procedures for the assets test contributed to its delayedimplementation. As a result, no savings were realized infiscal year 2004 from the assets test. ELIMINATION OF INCOME DISREGARDS Prior to the enactment of House Bill 2292, eligibility for CHIP was based on a family's net income (gross familyincome reduced for expenses for work and dependentcare). Reductions were allowed for up to $120 per employed person, $200 per child under two years of age, $175 perperson age two and older, and $50 for child supportpayments received by a CHIP household. Payments todependents living outside a CHIP household were alsodisregarded from the determination of income. House Bill2292 eliminated income disregards and based eligibility ongross family income before any payroll deductions. InNovember 2003, HHSC redetermined the eligibility of allexisting enrollees and began determining the eligibility ofnew enrollees based on gross family income. HHSC indicates the elimination of income disregards accounted for 16,170 (53 percent) of the Novemberdecline in total enrollment. In ad dition, there is an ongoing reduction in new enrollment due to the elimination ofincome disregards. The elimination of income disregards also resulted in a shift in enrollment from the lower income groups (below100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level) to the higherincome groups (151-200 percent of the Federal PovertyLevel) (Figure 3). This shift began in November butcontinued throughout fiscal year 2004.

Therefore, determiningeligibility based on gross income shifts some families into ahigher income group. Between October 2003 and August 2004, the percentage of children in families with incomes below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level decreased from 21.3 percent to 8.6percent, representing a 60 percent decrease. Conversely, thepercentage of children in families with incomes above 150 percent of the Federal Pove rty Level increased from 27.6 percent to 43.8 percent for a 59 percent increase. Beyond the elimination of income disregards, HHSC indicates thatpart of the decrease in enrollment in the lowest incomegroup (below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level)may be because children transitioned to Medicaid. Thenumber of children enrolled in Medicaid from CHIP isunknown. Medicaid eligibility criteria for children includean assets test and an exemption for certain family income(income disregards). INCREASED PREMIUM COPAYMENTS FOR FAMILIES House Bill 2292 authorized HHSC to establish cost sharing up to the maximum allowable levels under federal law. InOctober 2003, HHSC increased premium copayments forall income groups above 100 percent of the FederalPoverty Level (Figure 4). The largest increase was appliedto the income group between 101 percent and 150 percentof the Federal Poverty Level, whose monthly premiumcopayments increased from $0 to $15. Prior to October 2003, this income group was assessed a $15 annualenrollment fee but no monthly premium copayments. Under federal law, total annual aggregate cost-sharing for afamily may not exceed 5 percent. Additionally, federal lawprohibits enrollment fees, premiums , or similar charges that exceed the maximum monthly charges allowed underMedicaid and cost-sharing that exceeds a nominal amountfor families with incomes below 150 percent of the FederalPoverty Level.Following the premium copayment increases, the number of families noncompliant with cost-sharing requirementsincreased. Under HHSC policies, families who do not makepremium copayments for three months are disenrolledfrom CHIP. HHSC delayed disenrolling children fornonpayment of premium copayments f or all of fiscal year 2004 to provide notice to families of the premiumcopayment increases and the disenrollment policy. InAugust 2004, the governor requested that HHSC furtherdelay the disenrollment of children planned for August.The governor also requested that HHSC explore linkingadditional benefits to the payment of premiumcopayments. As of November 1, 2004, HHSC temporarilysuspended the collection of monthly premium copaymentsfor all enrollees. The projection for premium copa yment revenue for the 2004-05 biennium in HHSC's 2006-07 appro-priations request is $56.5 million lower than its 2004-05biennial appropriation of $88.0 million (Figure 5). HHSC's2006-07 Legislative Appropriations Request assumes nopremium copayment revenue in fiscal year 2005 due to thesuspension of premium copayments. In addition to thenonpayment and suspension of premium copayments, it ispossible that the projection for the 2004-05 GeneralAppropriations Act (GAA) assumed higher monthlypremium copayments for each income group than wereadopted. Another factor contributing to the supplemental need is the assumption in the 2004-05 GAA that a waiver of a federalcost-sharing requirement would be approved for the biennium. Federal law requires the use of premiumcopayment revenue to reduce the federal share and state share of expenditures in the CHIP program. The GAAassumed premium copayments could be used for the stateshare of expenditures only and thus assumed more inFederal Funds than was allowable. In June 2004, HHSCsubmitted a concept paper for a waiver of this requirement.

In September 2004, theCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services notifiedHHSC that the applicable provision of federal law can notbe waived. The cost of not receiving a waiver is estimatedto be $22.8 million in General Revenue Funds for fiscalyear 2004. There may be additional costs in fiscal year2005, depending on the amount of premium copaymentrevenue collected. RESTRUCTURED BENEFITS PACKAGE House Bill 2292 allowed for the restructuring of CHIP benefits by eliminating the requirement that CHIP benefitsbe equivalent to the basic plan for active state employeesand provide the minimum coverage recommended in 1998by interim committees of the legislature. Effective Septem-ber 2003, vision, dental, mental health, substance abuse,chiropractic, skilled nursing facilities, tobacco cessation,and hospice benefits were eliminated from the benefitspackage. In February 2004, HHSC partially restored mentalhealth and substance abuse benefits retroactive to Septem-ber 2003. Figure 6 compares the mental health andsubstance abuse benefits offered in CHIP prior to and afterSeptember 1, 2003. In January 2004, HHSC estimated the cost of partially restoring mental health and substance abuse benefits at$5.3 million in General Revenue Funds for the 2004-05biennium. This estimate does not include the cost ofretroactivity and was based on 2004-05 GAA caseloadtargets. 90-DAY WAITING PERIOD FOR ALL NEW ENROLLEES Prior to the 2004-05 biennium, children with health insurance at any time in the 90 days before applying for Mental HealthMental HealthMental HealthMental HealthMental Health annual inpatient services 30 days annual inpatient services60 days annual outpatient limit 30 days annual outpatient limit Substance AbuseSubstance AbuseSubstance AbuseSubstance AbuseSubstance Abuse Substance AbuseSubstance AbuseSubstance AbuseSubstance AbuseSubstance Abuse 14 days annual detoxification and stabilization services 5 days annual limit on inpatient detoxification and stabilization servi ces 60 days of inpatient services per episode 30 days annual limit for inpatient servicesOutpatient Services (up to six months per episode) 30 annual outpatient visitsPRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2003FIGURE 6 CHIP MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE BENEFITS AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 2003 NOTE: This represents the major benefit changes. Some exceptions may apply. SOURCE : Health and Human Services Commission.CHIP were subject to a waiting period of 90 days from the last day of coverage in order to prevent \"crowd out.\" Crowd out is the substitution of publicly funded healthinsurance for privately funded health insurance. Exemptionsfrom the 90-day period included involuntary loss of healthinsurance, good cause as determined by HHSC, or becauseavailable insurance was unaffordable (exceeded 10 percentof net income). House Bill 2292 extended the waitingperiod to all CHIP enrollees and continued existingexemptions from the waiting period. Additional exemptionsfrom the waiting period are allowed for participation in aCHIP premium assistance program and for childrendisenrolled for nonrenewal who renew the followingmonth. Children not exempted from the waiting periodmust wait 90 days from application until enrollment. The waiting period begins on the first day of the applicationmonth, if the child applies by the fifteenth day of themonth; otherwise, the waiting period begins the first day ofthe following month. The 90-day waiting period w as applied to new applicants beginning October 1, 2003. As a result, new enrollment waslower from October 2003 to Jan uary 2004. In January 2004, new enrollment increased when the waiting period endedfor 3,800 children who applied in October 2003. SIX-MONTH CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY PERIOD House Bill 2292 authorized HHSC to provide six months of continuous eligibility in CHIP instead of 12 months.Beginning in January 2004, enrollees in their sixth ortwelfth month of coverage were required to renew.Additionally, all new enrollees received six months ofcontinuous eligibility. As a result of six months of continuous eligibility, there was an increase in the number of renewals, nonrenewals,and attempted renewals in f iscal year 2004, as more children were due for renewal each month. The increase inSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 131IMPACT OF POLICY CHANGES TO THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) nonrenewals and attempted but unsuccessful renewals contributed to higher total disenrollment in fiscal year2004, which when combined with lower new enrollmentdue to other policy changes resulted in a decline in totalenrollment. As of July 2004, the change to six months of continuous eligibility was fully implemented. However, theimpact will continue due to higher numbers of children duefor renewal. Without a statutory change, continuouseligibility will revert to 12 months as of September 1, 2005pursuant to House Bill 2292. CASELOAD CHANGES AND PROGRAM COSTS The policy changes enacted by the Seventy-eighth Legisla- ture, 2003, had a significant impact on CHIP caseloads,costs, and revenues. Policy changes such as the elimination of income disregards, 90-day waiting period, six-months continuous eligibility, and the assets test combined toreduce caseloads by 147,525 between September 2003 andAugust 2004 (Figure 7). It is noteworthy that while totalCHIP enrollment declined during fiscal year 2004, the totalnumber of children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIPcombined increased between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year2004. The number of childr en who moved from CHIP into Medicaid is unknown. Despite the caseload decline, the average monthly caseload for fiscal year 2004 exceeded the 2004-05 GAA target by29,262. This is in part because (409,865)FIGURE 7 NUMBER OF CHILDREN ENROLLED IN CHIP - AUGUST 2003 THROUGH AUGUST 2004 SOURCE : Health and Human Services Commission.policy changes was delayed in fiscal year 2004. In its most recent caseload projections, HHSC projects to achieve the2004-05 GAA caseload target for fiscal year 2005(Figure 8). Additionally, the average monthly cost exceeded the 2004-05 GAA target in fiscal year 2004. However, HHSCprojects in its 2006-07 Legislative Appropriations Requestto achieve the GAA target f or fiscal year 2005 (Figure 8). According to HHSC, vendor drug costs, the partialrestoration of mental health and substance abuse benefits,and the restoration of half of the 5 percent rate reductionare contributing to higher than projected average costs.Unanticipated costs also resulted from the denial of awaiver of a feder al cost-sharing requirement and the decision to delay disenrollment for nonpayment ofpremium copayments. The combination of higher than projected caseloads and costs and lower than projected premium copaymentrevenue helps to explain the estimated $78.5 millionbiennial supplemental need in General Revenue Funds inCHIP. In addition to the supplemental need, the Seventy-ninth Legislature, 2005, will face decisions regardingcontinuous eligibility and premium copayments. Astatutory change is required to continue six months ofcontinuous eligibility, which expires September 1, 2005.Additionally, HHSC has not indicated when premiumcopayments will be reinstated.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 132IMPACT OF POLICY CHANGES TO THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) Caseloads cost per child.

COMMENTS The National Heritage Insurance Company (NHIC) wasTexas' Medicaid claims administrator, responsible forprocessing Medicaid claims from 1976 until December2003. NHIC acted as an insurance agent, receiving pre-mium payments from the state and paying claims fromthose funds. In 2003 the contract was awarded to TexasMedicaid and Healthcare Partnership (TMHP), and onJanuary 1, 2004 TMHP assumed responsibility for theprocessing of Medicaid claims. TMHP acts as a fiscal agentfor the state's Medicaid prog ram, processing claims and receiving payment from the state when those claims arefinalized. Under the arrangement with NHIC, the state paid a premium each month for each fee-for-service Medicaidrecipient and NHIC in turn paid the claims for thoserecipients. Each month NHIC submitted a financialsummary to the Health and Human Services Commission(HHSC). A list of selected elements included in thesesummaries and their descriptions appears in Figure 1. NHIC had no responsibility for claims payments after December 31, 2003. NHIC provided a financial summaryon January 15, 2004 for the period ending December 31,2003. Analysis of this financial summary indicated NHICmight owe the state a refund of up to $200.6 million in AllFunds, $77.7 million in General Revenue Funds. NHIC calculated the excess of benefit premium incurred over benefit cost incurred as (Premium Payments +Estimated Premiums Incurred But Not Paid) - (TotalClaim Payments + Total Estimated Incurred Liability). AnyRisk Stabilization Reserve (RSR) adjustments started fromthis base. The amount remaining after adjustment is theRSR balance. There was a $25.0 million minimum balancein the RSR while the contract with NHIC was active. Anyamounts in excess of $25.0 million were to be refunded tothe state in the form of premium credits. According to theDecember 2003 NHIC Financial Summary, the RSRSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 134CLOSE OUT ISSUES RELATED TO TEXAS' MEDICAID C ONTRACT WITH THE NA TIONAL HERITAGE INSURANCE COMPANY balance was $48.9 million in All Funds, $44.4 million for fiscal year 2003 and $4.5 million for fiscal year 2004. Additionally, the December 2003 NHIC Financial Sum- mary continued to estimate incurr ed liability as far back as fiscal year 1990. However, beginning in January 2004, claims are processed by TMHP; TMHP is responsible forall claims, regardless of date of service and including thoseclaims for which a premium was previously paid to NHIC.Therefore, NHIC should have no incurred liability. From fiscal year 1977 to fiscal year 2004 NHIC was paid premiums totaling $47.0 billion in All Funds. NHIC in turnmade total claim payments of $44.4 billion in All Funds.The difference of $2.6 billion in All Funds is excesspremium payments. This amount is reduced by $2.4 billionin All Funds for refunds already made to the state agencyand other adjustments to the RSR, including $53.1 millionin All Funds in risk charges retained by NHIC. Theremaining $200.6 million in All Funds is the total amountof funds that were remaining at NHIC, including the $48.9million in All Funds in the RSR. Excluding the RSRbalance, $151.8 million in All Funds was being held byNHIC for incurred liability. This $151.8 million is equal toNHIC's Estimated Incurred Liability less EstimatedPremiums Incurred But Not Paid.The $48.9 million in All Funds ($18.9 million in General Revenue Funds) in the RSR and the $151.8 million in AllFunds ($58.8 million in General Revenue Funds) being heldfor incurred liability could have been due back to the state(an estimated $77.7 million in total General RevenueFunds). However, according to HHSC, NHIC does notowe the state any additional refunds. According to HHSC'sanalysis, there was a deficit in fee-for-service of $66.6 million in All Funds and a balance due of $71.2 million inAll Funds in managed care. These amounts were combined,and the net positive amount of $4.6 million in All Fundswas refunded to the state in May 2004. HHSC provided an additional NHIC Financial Summary detailing adjustments and costs through January 31, 2004.This document shows additional Claim Payments of $25.6million in All Funds for fiscal year 1995 and $4.3 million inAll Funds for fiscal year 2001. According to notes in thereport, these amounts were added by NHIC to reconcilethe financial summary to the general ledger. Additionally,the report shows Net Cost Adjustments Paid for fiscal year 2004, in January 2004, of $237.4 million in All Funds.(Note: The NHIC financial summaries do not state what isaccounted for in the Net Cost Adjustments Paid entry, buthistorically these amounts have reduced the total claimpayments amount.) Together these amounts total a $267.3million in All Funds increase in costs over what wasreported in the December 2003 NHIC Financial Summary,and reflect adjustments made after the December 31, 2003close of the contract. These costs are the differencebetween the estimated $200.6 million in All Funds remain-ing at NHIC on December 31, 2003 and the $66.6 millionin All Funds deficit reported by HHSC. Prior to the close of the NHIC contract, HHSC imple- mented a plan to avoid increasing the RSR balance and tospend down the existing balance. The agency withheldpremium payments from November and December 2003totaling $418.4 million in All Funds ($154.2 million inGeneral Revenue Funds), whic h would have increased the balance in the RSR. Additionally, $220.5 million in AllFunds, for services typically paid by NHIC from the RSRand then reimbursed by the state, were not reimbursed inorder to spend down the RSR balance. Most of theseclaims were processed by NHIC in November and Decem-ber 2003, although a small amount of claims were fromOctober 2003. These services included payments for thefollowing: Qualified Medicar e Beneficiaries, Texas HealthSteps (Medical, Dental, and Comprehensive CareProgram), Cost Reimbursed (primarily UndocumentedAliens and Federally Qualified Health Centers), and TitleXIX Family Planning. This resulted in a $220.5 million inAll Funds reduction to the RSR balance.

Adjustments and additions to claims cost made in the final NHIC Financial Summary, after the close of thecontract, have not been verified. Of particular concernare the additional Claim Payments of $25.6 million in AllFunds for fiscal year 1995 and $4.3 million in All Fundsfor fiscal year 2001. There should have been no additionalclaims cost after the close of the contract. All adjustmentsmade in January 2004 were made by NHIC and they havenot been verified. Using data provided by HHSC in itsmonthly data submission, the amounts not reimbursed bythe state could not be duplicated. An audit of thecloseout of the contract could alleviate any concerns overthe possibility of funds remaining at NHIC. Specifically,the audit should include verification of increased claimscost for past fiscal years, and of the $237.4 million in AllFunds cost adjustment. Recommendation 1 would modify the rider related to the Risk Stabilization Reserve in the 2006-07 General Appro- priations Bill to read as follows: Risk Stabilization Reserve. Out of funds a ppro- priated a bove, the a gency shall contr act with an independent audit entity to audit the c loseout of the Medicaid c laims pa yment contr Insur ance Compan y (NHIC). In lieu of pursuing a contract and at the discretion of the State Auditor , the Sta te Auditor's Of fice ma y conduct the audit.

Further, HHSC forecasting staff forecast costs on an incurred basis. Their forecast of fiscal year 2004 includedfull premium payments through December 2003 and fullcost of claims for services provided January to August2004. Budget staff, however, produce estimates on a cashbasis. This results in a need to adjust the cost forecast toalign it with budgeted and/or expended amounts. For fiscalyear 2004, budget staff cor rectly reduced expenditures in the premium strategies by $220.5 million in All Funds toreflect the fact that premium payments made to NHICwere used to fund other strategies. However, they failed toadjust for the nonpayment of premiums to NHIC in eitherthe Fiscal Year 2004 Operating Budget or the 2006-07Legislative Appropriations Request. This resulted in anoverstatement of supplemental need. HHSC has sincecorrected this, reducing their estimate of supplementalneed by the $418.4 million All Funds ($154.2 million inGeneral Revenue Funds) not paid to NHIC. In order toensure future adjustments are properly made and ac-counted for, HHSC should establish a procedure forroutinely adjusting forecasts and reporting these adjust-ments to the Legislative Budget Board. Recommendation 2 would modify the rider related to other reporting requirements in the 2006-07 General Appropria- tions Bill to include the following: Other Reporting Requirements. c.Monthl y Financial R eports.

FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS There is no significant fiscal impact from Recommenda- tions 1 and 2. Recommendations 1 and 2 have both beenincorporated in the introduced 2006-07 General Appro-priations Bill.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 136CLOSE OUT ISSUES RELATED TO TEXAS' MEDICAID C ONTRACT WITH THE NA TIONAL HERITAGE INSURANCE COMPANYSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 137ALLOW ADDITIONAL GENERIC DRUG SUBSTITUTION The administrative rules of the Texas State Board of Pharmacy prevent pharmacists from substituting genericdrugs for a number of brand-name prescriptions. In Texas,generic drug substitution is governed by the U.S. Food andDrug Administration's Approved Drug Products with Therapeu- tic Equivalence Evaluations . This publication (commonly called the \"Orange Book\") identifies drug productsapproved on the basis of both safety and effectiveness.Drugs approved only on the basis of safety as well as those with active ingredients in e xistence before the passage of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 havebeen exempted from the Food and Drug Administration'sevaluation process and are not listed in the Orange Book.As a result of the Texas State Board of Pharmacy'sadministrative rules, these drugs are not available forgeneric substitution in Texas. In fiscal year 2004, Texas spent approximately $3.0 billion on prescription drug benefits for employees and beneficia-ries of state medical programs. This amount is expected toincrease to an estimated $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2005. Tocombat the increasing cost of prescription drugs, 11 stateshave mandated generic substitution of prescription drugs.This policy is discretionary for the other 39 states, includ-ing Texas. In addition, 34 states allo w generic substitution of drugs not included in the Orange Book. Allowing genericsubstitution of these drugs in Texas would reduce thestate's expenditure for prescription drugs for Medicaid by at least $9.9 million in All Funds in the 2006-07 biennium.Approximately $3.9 million of this amount could be savedfor the General Revenue Fund. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe Orange Book provides states with a list of allprescription drug products approved by the Foodand Drug Administration for safety and effective-ness as well as therapeutic equivalence determina-tions for multi-source prescription products. In mostcases, multi-source prescription drugs are pharma-ceutical equivalents available from more than onemanufacturer. \u008bPharmaceuticals that contain active ingredientsintroduced prior to the passage of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 are \"grandfatheredin\" by the Food and Drug Administration and donot have to go through the Food and Drug Admin- istration evaluation process. As a result, these drugsare not listed in the Orange Book; nevertheless, timeand human experience have proven them to bevaluable medications. \u008bNon-Orange Book drugs can be well-known Tylenol Suspension, PedialyteSolution, and Tussi-12D Suspension. \u008bThe Food and Drug Administration regulatesmanufacturing of all drugs, including those notevaluated in the Orange Book. \u008bSome Texas state health programs have begun toencourage substitution of generic drugs notincluded in the Orange Book for patients who haverecently used certain generic equivalents but werelater prescribed brand-name products. However,these pilot programs require that physicians re-prescribe the medication as the generic prior topharmacists substituting these drugs. \u008bThirty-four states allow generic substitutions beyondthe drugs listed in the Orange Book. In these states,pharmacists can choose generic versions of brand-name drugs not listed in the Orange Book bymatching active ingredients, dosage form, anddosage strength. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bThe Texas State Board of Pharmacy's (PharmacyBoard's) current administrative rules restrictsubstitution of generic drugs to the equivalencieslisted in the Orange Book. Therefore, pharmacistscannot always substitute cost-effective genericalternatives for Texas state employees and programbeneficiaries. RECOMMENDATION \u008bThe Texas Pharmacy Board should change itsadministrative rules to allow the substitution ofgeneric drugs that are not evaluated in the OrangeBook. COMMENTS In 1938 the U.S. Congress passed the Food, Drug andCosmetic Act. This legislation required drug manufacturersSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 138ALLOW ADDITIONAL GENERIC DRUG SUBSTITUTION to provide scientific proof that new products could be safely used before introducing them to the market. The law\"grandfathers in\" dr ug products that contain active ingredients that were on the market prior to 1938, allowingthem to be manufactured and sold in the United Stateswithout going through the approv al process r equired for new products. All drug products with active ingredients introduced after 1938 have been required to go through the New DrugApplication Process (NDA) before they are marketed. Thedata that drug manufactur ers have collected during clinical tests have to be included as a part of the applicationinformation. As the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)states in its description of the NDA, \"The documentationrequired in an NDA is supposed to tell the drug's wholestory, including what happened during the clinical tests,what the ingredients of the drug are, the results of animalstudies, how the drug behaves in the body, and how it ismanufactured, processed and pac kaged.\" Generic drugs go through the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA),which is somewhat less rigorous than NDA. Even thoughpre-1938 drugs did not have to go through NDA orANDA, the manufacturing of these drugs is still regulatedby the FDA. USE OF THE ORANGE BOOK States implement different measures to control the costs of prescription drugs. Many of these measures encouragesubstituting less expensive drugs for those commonlyprescribed. To provide assistance to all states, in 1978 theFDA established a single list of all prescription drugproducts that are approved by the FDA for safety andeffectiveness. This list also contains therapeutic equivalencedeterminations for multi-source prescription products.Figure 1 describes what drugs are considered to betherapeutic equivalents based on the FDA determination. The final version of the list was published in 1980. Enacted in 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent TermRestoration Act required the FDA to make the list ofapproved drugs publicly available and required that list to beupdated monthly. The Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations publication, or Orange Book, is updated monthly and therefore satisfies this requirement. In the preface to the Orange Book, the FDA emphasizes that the publication is a guide to substitution, which givesadvice to the professionals, but does not constitute afederal mandate regarding which drugs to use duringsubstitution or which drug products to avoid. The publica-tion also states that the exclusion of certain drugs from the Orange Book does not necessarily mean that these drugproducts are not safe or effective, or that these productsare not therapeutically equiv alent to other drug products.As the Orange Book stresses, exclusion of certain drugs from the Orange Book means only that the FDA has notevaluated the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drugproduct. Drugs not evaluated in the Orange Book can be well- known drugs. For example, Children's Tylenol Suspension,Pedialyte Solution, Panafil Accuhist DMPediatric Syrup, and Tussi-12D Suspension are drugs thatare not included in the Orange Book. ENSURING THE QUALITY OF DRUGS To ensure drug quality, the federal government has adopted multiple rules and standards for drug manufacturers.Manufacturers have to meet requirements of the CurrentGood Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations. TheFDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Control states thatthese regulations make sure that a product is safe for use and that it has the ingredients and strength the manufac-turer claims it to have. The FDA has not evaluated drugs with active ingredients in existence prior to 1938, thus there is no proven evidence thatnon-Orange Book generic drugs have the same clinical effectas non-Orange Book brand name drugs. However, evenwhen drugs approved in the Orange Book are substituted with equivalent drugs, there may be some small effects ofthe substitution. Drugs that are evaluated in the OrangeBook and have been determined to be equivalent to otherdrug products still might differ in shape, color, flavoringredients, and preservatives as well as other characteristics.As one example, the Orange Book states there may bedecreased patient acceptance because of flavor. The Orange Book also points out that the FDA evaluation of the drugs in no way relieves practitioners of theirprofessional responsibilities in prescribing and dispensingDrug products are considered to be therapeutic equivalents only if they are pharmaceutical equivalents and can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile when administered to patients under theconditions specified in the labeling. \"Pharmaceutical equivalents\" are drugs that \u008bcontain the same amount of active ingredient, \u008bare of the same dosage form, \u008bare identical in strength or concentration, and \u008buse the same route of administration.

States that do not limit genericsubstitution to the drugs evaluated in the Orange Book givefinal discretion regarding substitution to pharmacists. SURVEY OF OTHER STATES The results of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy's most recent survey show that 16 states (includ-ing Texas) report that they use only the Orange Book as the basis for generic substitution. The other 34 states allowedadditional generic substitution at the time of the survey. Legislative Budget Board (LBB) staff surveyed 11 states to confirm that the states do allow substitution of drugs notevaluated in the Orange Book to determine the basis forstates' use of substitut ed drugs and to estimate savings related to additional substitution. Survey results aresummarized in Figure 2. Pharmacists in all states use the Orange Book as the basis for generic substitution. Furthermore, states with regula-tions similar to Texas have rules stipulating that pharma-cists may substitute only products tha t are rated therapeuti- cally equivalent in the Orange Book. States that do not specify the source for drug substitution require the products to contain identical amounts of theactive ingredients contained in brand-name drugs. No statethat allows substitution of non-Orange Book drugs based onthe pharmacists' discretion reported considering limitingdrug substitutions to those listed in the Orange Book. Onestate responded that the Orange Book excludes too many drugs that may be equivalent to more costly brand-nameproducts. None of the states surveyed could provideestimated savings from additional generic substitution. STATUS OF NON-ORANGE BOOK DRUGS CAN CHANGE If the FDA has concerns about the quality of a drug not evaluated in the Orange Book, it can require an assessmentof the medication. For example , in 1997, the FDA required all of the levothyroxine drugs used in thyroid treatment togo through a new drug a pplication process, even though they were initially excluded from evaluation because theyexisted prior to NDA requirements. The FDA required theevaluation process for these drugs because of stability andpotency problems. If drug manufacturers refuse to complywith an FDA request for evaluation, the FDA can take theproducts off the market. The evaluation process can belengthy. In the case of levothyroxine drugs, the FDAevaluation process took approximately five years. TEXAS UTILIZATION OF NON-ORANGE BOOK DRUGS LBB staff surveyed state agencies that purchase or reimburse for drugs to estimate utilization of non-OrangeBook drugs in Texas. Figure 3 shows the estimated amountTexas state agencies spent on these drugs during fiscal year2004. Note that the cost difference of $11.5 millionbetween brand and generic drugs as depicted in Figure 3 FIGURE 2 OTHER STATES' RESPONSES Arizona Orange Book No N/A California United States Adopted Names (USAN) Yes Not AnsweredFlorida Pharmacists' professional judgment Yes Since approximately 1979 Maine Orange Book or Equivalent No N/A Michigan State statute - must be generically equivalent Yes 1978 Minnesota Pharmacists' professional judgment Yes Since approximately 1974 New Mexico Orange Book No N/A Ohio State statute 1Yes 1981 Oregon Orange Book2Yes 1987 Texas Orange Book No N/AVirginia Orange Book No N/A Washington Orange Book and the pharmacists' discretion Yes 1979STATEBASIS FOR DETERMINING EQUIVALENCY OF DRUGSALLOW SUBSTITUTION OF DRUGS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORANGE BOOKHOW LONG ADDITIONAL SUBSTITUTION HAS BEEN ALLOWED NOTES: 1The drug used in substitution should contain identical amounts of the active ingredients. 2The statute does not stipulate the required source. SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 140ALLOW ADDITIONAL GENERIC DRUG SUBSTITUTION does not equate directly to potential savings to the state programs and plan participants. Assumptions made toestimate the savings are described in the Fiscal Impactsection at the end of this paper. The records of the Employees Retirement System (ERS), the Teacher Retirement System (TRS), Texas A&MUniversity, and The University of Texas (UT) do notinclude expenditures for non-Orange Book drugs in healthmaintenance organizations (HMOs). The drug expendituresinformation contained herein is based on LBB staff 'scompilation of a list of drugs not included in the OrangeBook. Because no complete list of non-Orange Book drugsexists, some expenditures for non-Orange Book drugs may not be reflected, which makes this list a conservativeestimate of current expenditures. Cost difference varies among prog rams. Differing factors include drug utilization, cost difference between brand andgeneric drugs, and price of drugs established by eachprogram. For example, in the Medicaid program, the drugsthat have significantly contributed to the large costdifference between brand names and generics are drugsthat prevent dehydration, r educe fever, and suppress cough. However, utilization rates for these drugs may differ inother programs.The Medicaid program had the highest utilization of non- Orange Book drugs in fiscal year 2004. This is due, in part,to the various over-the-counter medications covered byMedicaid, many of which are not included in the OrangeBook. Expenditures for drugs not included in the OrangeBook for state programs other than Medicaid in fiscal year 2004 are relatively low. Fo r example, in fiscal year 2004 the Texas Department of Criminal Justice spent $47,013 onnon-Orange Book, brand-name drugs, and the TexasDepartment on Mental Health and Mental Retardationspent approximately $23,000. The Texas Department ofHealth did not identify expenditures for drugs not evalu-ated in the Orange Book. Figure 3 shows that if additional generic substitution had been allowed, state prog rams and health plans could have saved $10.8 million (All Funds) in fiscal year 2004, and planparticipants could have saved approximately $0.8 million.Recommendation 1 would require the Pharmacy Board torevise Title 22, Part 15, Chapter 309 of the Texas Adminis-trative Code to allow substitution of the generic drugs thatare not evaluated in the Orange Book. Allowing the substitution of drugs not evaluated in the Orange Book does not imply that the substitution will berequired. Based on the state law set in \u00a7 562.008 of theFIGURE 3 PROGRAM EXPENDITURES FOR NON-ORANGE BOOK DRUGS IN FISCAL YEAR 2004 AND POTENTIAL COST DIFFERENCE FROM GENERIC SUBSTITUTION Health and Human Services Medicaid $35,363,165 $25,340,680 $10,022,486 Commission (HHSC)* Children's Health $1,542,759 $1,457,371 System Health Plan Plan $331,192 $175,900 $155,292ERS-Health Select Plan Participants $349,064 $228,274 Plan Participants $ Participants $115,937 $77,319 $38,618 Total for State Programs (Medicaid and CHIP) and Health Plans $10,750,424Total for Plan Participants $776,130 Total $11,526,554STATE ENTITYFISCAL YEAR 2004 EXPENDITURE FOR BRAND NAME DRUGS NOT EVALUATED IN THE ORANGE BOOKPOTENTIAL EXPENDITURE IF GENERIC SUBSTITUTION ALLOWEDCOST DIFFERENCE(ALL FUNDS) *HHSC provided cost data for non-Orange Book drugs after calculating rebates for these drugs.

Furthermore, if aprescriber does not indicate a preference, the pharmacist,based on his or her professional judgment and the patient'shistory, may decide that the substitution is not in the bestinterest of the patient. Entities that contract with pharmacy benefit managers were able to provide data related to prescriptions in cases inwhich brand names were medically necessary per thephysicians' instructions. Such cases are known as \"dispenseas written\" (DAW) prescriptions. Prescriptions with theDAW indicator were not included in the analysis of thecost difference for ERS, TRS, UT, and A&M. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION The recommendation in this report would result in a net General Revenue Fund savings of $3.9 million in the2006-07 biennium. LBB staff calculated the fiscal year2004 cost difference for state entities based on allowingadditional drug substitutions. Because non-Orange Bookdrugs are not used extensively in other programs, the fiscalimpact below represents savings to the state for theMedicaid program only. For example, in fiscal year 2004 ERS could have saved $116,078 in General Revenue Fundsby allowing additional generic substitution, and TRS-Caresavings could have been $136,018 in General RevenueFunds. UT savings in General Revenue Funds fromadditional generic substitution could have been approxi-mately $11,074 in fiscal year 2004. Actual savings could differ from estimates for a number of reasons. Each non-Orange Book, brand-name drug mayhave several generic versions available for substitution. TheHealth and Human Services Commission (HHSC) esti-mated its cost of generic drugs based on the average of thegeneric drugs costs. Substitution based on the lowestgeneric version's price could add an additional $2.7 millionto the cost difference between brand-name drugs and theirgeneric versions in the Medicaid program. To estimate the savings in the Medicaid program shown in Figure 4, LBB staff \u008bused the cost difference for the Medicaid programfrom Figure 3; \u008bassumed a 1 percent reduction for prescriptionswhere brand-name drugs would be medicallynecessary; and \u008bassumed that substitution would take place only in50 percent of all prescriptions.These assumptions are consistent with Medicaid prescrib-ing practices. LBB staff did not assume an increase in thecost of non-Orange Book drugs in fiscal years 2006through 2010 because non-Orange Book drugs are a smallsubset of the total prescription drug pool, and the rate ofcost increase for these drugs is unknown. The savingswould be shared between the General Revenue Fund andFederal Funds. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any adjustments as a result of these recommen-dations. To realize savings shown in Figure 4, the Pharmacy Board would need to change its administrative rules toallow additional generic substitution, and HHSC's GeneralRevenue Fund appropriations for Vendor Drug Programwould need to be reduced by $3.9 million.FIGURE 4 FIVE-YEAR FUNDSFISCAL YEARPROBABLE NET SAVINGS/(COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 142ALLOW ADDITIONAL GENERIC DRUG SUBSTITUTIONSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 143CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A MULTI-STATE MEDICAID DRUG PURCHASING POOL Many states are facing budget difficulties due, in part, to persistent escalating healthcare costs. In 2002 prescriptiondrug spending represented 11 percent of nationalhealthcare spending and was also one of the fastestgrowing components of spending, experiencing double-digit percentage growth in each of the last eight years. InTexas, drug costs represent approximately 21 percent ofthe total Medicaid expenditures. In fiscal year 2004, the Health and Human Services Commission spent $2.2 billionon drugs for 2.8 million Medicaid recipients. The Healthand Human Services Commission projects a 19.7 percentincrease in drug expenditures for the Medicaid programfrom fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005. States are considering a variety of cost-control measures to reduce expenditures or at least to slow the increase inspending. Texas implemented a number of cost-contain-ment strategies after the Seventy-eighth Legislative Session.For example, House Bill 2292, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, required the Medicaid Vendor DrugProgram to establish a Medicaid preferred drug list, whichaccording to the commission, would lead to $150.8 millionin savings. Other cost-control measures implementedinclude supplemental rebates, prior authorization, drugutilization review, and generic drug substitution. Other states, especially those that have smaller Medicaid populations, are looking bey ond state lines to control spending. In April of 2004, the U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services approved the first multi-state Medic-aid drug pooling arrangement. This arrangement allowedfive states initially (curr ently seven states) to pool their collective purchasing power to gain greater discounts onprescription drugs for Medicaid recipients. Texas currently does not participate in a multi-state drug purchasing agreement. If Texas joined a drug pool thatincreased supplemental rebates by 1 percent of total drugexpenditures, savings in the Medicaid program would be anestimated $25.8 million annually in All Funds beginning in fiscal year 2007. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bAccording to the U.S. Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services, states that participate in multi-state arrangements are able to negotiate with drugmanufacturers for lo wer drug prices while still maintaining control over their individual drugselection and utilization structures.\u008bCurrently, seven states participate in the onefederally approved multi-state drug pool. This poolincludes more than 2.6 million beneficiaries withdrug purchases exceeding $2 billion annually.Reported savings for participating states average1.3 percent of total Medicaid prescription drugspending. \u008bTexas has more beneficiaries covered by theMedicaid program than the states in this drug poolcombined. As a result, any multi-state drug poolwould likely benefit from Texas' participation. \u008bMany states are exploring potential benefits ofestablishing multi-state programs. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bTexas, like other states, continues to experiencesignificant increases in healthcare costs. Cost-containment measures such as multi-state drugpurchasing pools can help slow cost increases forpharmaceutical drugs. \u008bThe new federal Medicare Part D prescription drugbenefit, effective Ja nuary 2006, could reduce the state portion of the revenue from supplementalrebates by $37.9 million in the 2006-07 biennium. \u008bEstablishing or joining a multi-state purchasingarrangement can require extensive preparation,including conducting analysis, negotiating with otherstates, issuing requests for proposals, and receivingapproval of the federal government. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: By rider, require the Health and Human Services Commission to conduct ananalysis to determine the benefit of establishing orjoining a Medicaid multi-state, drug-purchasing pooland to report results of the finding to theGovernor's Office and the Legislative Budget Boardby January 15, 2006. \u008bRecommendation 2: Require the Health and Human Services Commission through a statutorychange to Chapter 531, Government Code, toestablish or join a Medicaid multi-state, drug-purchasing pool beginning in fiscal year 2007,STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 144CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A MULTI-STATE MEDICAID DRUG PURCHASING POOL contingent on the results of the analysis and with the approval of the Legislative Budget Board andthe Governor's Office. COMMENTS Under sections of the Social Security Act and as specifiedby the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS), states can establish preferred drug lists (PDLs) anddecide which drugs can be placed on prior authorization(PA) lists to help reduce prescription drug costs. Inaddition, states can request CMS approval to enter intoagreements with drug manufacturers for supplementalrebates on drugs used in Medicaid programs. Drugmanufacturers are generally willing to provide states withsupplemental rebates in addition to regular vendor drugrebates negotiated by the federal government, providedthat their drugs are placed on PDLs and excluded from thePA requirement. A number of states have already estab- lished agreements with drug manufacturers for supplemen-tal rebates. House Bill 2292, Seventy-eighth Legislature,Regular Session, 2003, r equired the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) to develop supplementalrebate agreements with drug manufacturers to reduce thecost of prescription drugs for the Medicaid program. States with large Medicaid populations are typically in a more advantageous position when negotiating supplemen-tal rebates. Some states with a smaller number of Medicaidbeneficiaries have begun to look outside their borders tomaximize the savings from cost-containment measures. On April 22, 2004, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) approved a plan by five states topool their collective purchasing power to gain greaterdiscounts on prescription drugs for their Medicaid pro-grams. This pooling initiative, known as the NationalMedicaid Buying Pool (NMBP), originally included thefollowing states: Michigan, Ve rmont, Nevada, Alaska, and New Hampshire. According to HHS, this measure gives states participating in the multi-state arrangement anopportunity to decrease their costs by negotiating lowerdrug prices with drug manufacturers. The ability topurchase drugs at lower costs can improve a state's abilityto continue providing critical medications to Medicaidbeneficiaries. In September 2004, HHS approved plans ofMinnesota and Hawaii to join the NMBP. States that participate in the NMBP expect to achieve savings from a combination of cost-containment measures,but especially from the reduction of drug costs due tosupplemental rebates. Pooling across states can lead tolarger discounts on drugs that overlap in state PDLs. Thisis because the greater the total volume and utilization of aparticular drug, the more likely that more favorable termscan be obtained from drug manufacturers in the negotia- tion for supplemental rebates. Figure 1 shows statistics r elated to the states participating in NMBP. This data is from a number of sources includinga survey of states performed by the Legislative BudgetBoard staff, Kaiser Famil y Foundation data, and Atlantic Information Services, Inc. data. In addition, information r eceived directly from selected states suggests that the savings from joining the pool couldbe higher than the estimates included in Figure 1. Forexample, Alaska's representatives indicated that the statecould decrease Medicaid drug costs by $10 million fromincreased supplemental rebates and other cost containmentmeasures. Prior to joining the NMBP, states were at different stages of implementing cost-containment measures. For example,Michigan and Vermont were among the first states toimplement PDLs and establish supplemental rebates. Otherstates were either in the process of establishing PDL, PA,and supplemental rebate agreements, or did not yet havesupplemental rebate programs in place. Also, some of the states in the pool already had contracts with the First Health Services Corporation (First Health),the pharmacy benefit administrator for the NMBP , prior tojoining the multi-state arrangement. Other states had toissue a request for proposal, and states that awarded thecontract to First Health as a result of the bidding processcould request to join the existing multi-state pool. An important consideration for the states that joined the NMBP was to decide whether they wanted to establish asingle, multi-state Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T)committee, single PDL, and PA list, or to allow each state to maintain its independent drug evaluation process. SinglePDL and PA could lead to larger cost reductions becausethe states would have the same concentrated utilization ofdrugs on the PDL to leverage in negotiations for supple-mental rebates. States joining a multi-state pool with pre-existing, cost-control mechanisms, such as PDL and PA,may not necessarily experience the additional savingsdirectly associated with those mec hanisms that are realized by those states that did not have such mechanisms prior tojoining. States that have already implemented cost-controlmeasures, such PDL and PA, could still achieve significantsavings by joining a purchasing pool through the collectionof additional supplemental rebates obtained throughenhanced negotiations with drug manufacturers. STATES' ARRANGEMENT IN THE NATIONAL MEDICAID BUYING POOL Currently, states that participate in the NMBP maintain their own PDL and P&T committees to evaluate drugs andSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 145CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A MULTI-STATE MEDICAID DRUG PURCHASING POOL determine which ones can be placed on the PDL and PA lists. Participating states report that their PDLs are similarto a large extent, but differences are needed to meet theunique needs of the population in each state's program. States differ not only in the drug selection process but also in program policies. For example, some states collect drugco-payments from Medicaid beneficiaries while others donot. However, all states receive the same supplementalrebates negotiated by First Health. CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES POSITION ON MULTI-STATE POOLS Once a state decides that it wants to join the NMBP or similar multi-state Medicaid purchasing arrangement, thestate has to submit a State Plan Amendment (SPA) to theCMS. The SPA has to demonstrate that the state consid-ered a number of factors showing that care and services tothe Medicaid population are provided in the best interestof those covered by the program. CMS requests that eachstate's PDL include drugs tha t are needed by different portions of the Medicaid populations, including those withthe most serious health conditions, such as HIV/AIDS,mental disorders, and other conditions for which individualreaction to drugs might vary. States also have to establish atimely process for reviewing the requests for drugs placedon the PA lists. CMS is supportive of multi-state pooling arrangements because, according to federal agenc y, they allow states to decrease their drug costs while permitting them to maintaincontrol over drug selection and utilization structure.However, CMS has indicated that there would be a limit on the number of states allowed to join this pool because theeffectiveness of the pool would decrease at some point.CMS has encouraged states to look at other vendors thatcould establish new pools to disper se the market share to other pharmacy benefit administrator s. CMS believes that states would benefit from supplemental rebates negotiated in a competitive environment. Representatives from different states and the contractor that negotiates supplemental rebates indicate that the largerthe population being represented by the pool, the moreeffective the pool is likely to be at reducing costs. Accord- ing to First Health, the contractor that negotiates supple-mental rebates for the NMBP , supplemental rebates fordrugs increase as the population co vered increases, up to at least nine million people. However, the inclusion ofcompeting drugs from the same drug class could impactsupplemental rebates from drug manufacturers. OPTIONS FOR COST CONTAINMENT The Texas Medicaid program covers approximately 2.8 million Texans who receive health and drug benefits. Texashas a larger population in its program than all the states inNMBP combined. Because Texas currently utilizes severalcost-control methodologies, combining its population withthe existing NMBP likely w ould not benefit Texas to the same extent that it would benefit the other states in thepool.

Texas should consider joining an existing pool or establishing a newmulti-state pool and exploring several options for identify-ing other states to cooperate with: \u008bOption 1: Texas Medicaid staff could analyze the potential for cooperation with states with popula-tions similar in size to Texas and that have the samecontractor for managing supplemental rebates. Thisoption would give the state the opportunity toestablish a multi-state dr ug purchasing arrangement without a new bidding process. \u008bOption 2: Staff in the Medicaid program could also analyze PDL selection and drug utilization in thestates that have a different contractor but are similarin drug utilization and size. If it is determined thatthe state would benefit fr om cooperating with states with a different contractor for supplemental rebates,the Texas Medicaid program and the selected state,or states, would have to issue a RFP for a newsupplemental rebate management vendor. The stateswould have to work through a number of adminis-trative issues that include evaluation of the existingPDLs, work of the P&T committees, and applica-tion to CMS for establishment of the multi-statearrangement among others. Recommendation 1 requires HHSC to identify other states that could be included in a Medicaid multi-state drug pool.HHSC staff would have to analyze similarities of drugutilization in comparable states. If states do not have manycommon drugs included on the PDL, it is likely that they would not benefit from a pooling arrangement. In addition,recommendation 1 requires HHSC to report the results ofthe analysis to the Legislative Budget Board and theGovernor's Office by January 15, 2006. The following rider that requires HHSC to conduct an analysis to determine the cost-benefit and feasibility of amulti-state, drug-purchasing arrangement was added tothe introduced version of the 2006-07 General Appro-priations Bill: Analysis of Multi-state Medicaid Drug Purchas- ing Pool. Out of funds appropriated above in Strategy B.2.2 Medicaid Vendor Drug Program, theHealth and Human Services Commission shallconduct an analysis to determine the cost-benefit andfeasibility of establishing or joining a multi-stateMedicaid drug-purchasing pool. Analysis shall includethe identification of other states with which poolingof Medicaid drug purchasing provides the greatestopportunity to achieve savings in Texas. The Com-mission shall report the results of this analysis to theLegislative Budget Board and the Governor not later than January 15, 2006. HHSC may not be able to quantify the amount of savings the Medicaid program could achieve prior to establishingor joining a multi-state arrangement because the savingswill depend on the negotiations with drug manufacturers.Currently, the HHSC staff estimates that supplementalrebates reduce drug expenses by approximately 6 percent. In the 2006-07 biennium, supplemental rebates areexpected to decrease due to the implementation of theMedicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Based on theestimate for supplemental rebates in fiscal year 2005, stateportion of the supplemental rebates will decrease by atleast $37.9 million in the 2006-07 biennium. If Texasincreases supplemental rebates by 1 percent as a result ofentering into a multi-state drug pool, savings in theMedicaid program would total $25.8 million in All Fundsannually. This level of savings is consistent with otherstates' experience in the NMBP. Recommendation 2 calls for a sta tutory change to Chapter 531 of the Government Code to require HHSC to establisha Medicaid multi-state, drug-pur chasing pool in fiscal year 2007 with the approval of the Legislative Budget Boardand the Governor's Office, if analysis demonstrates that it would benefit Texas. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS There is no significant fiscal impact associated with completing the recommended analysis. Existing HHSCstaff would conduct the analysis to determine whatarrangement would be most beneficial to Texas Medicaidprogram and proceed with the establishment of the multi-state arrangement with approval of the Legislative BudgetBoard and the Governor's Office on the state level and theCMS on the federal level. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a rider authorizing HHSC to use appropriations toconduct the analysis to determine the cost-benefit andfeasibility of establishing or joining a multi-state, drug-purchasing pool. The introduced bill does not include anyother adjustments as a result of these recommendations.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 147EXPAND THE USE OF LESS COSTLY ALTERNATIVES FOR LONG-TERM CARE According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 9.8 percent of the Texas population is 65 years and older. The U.S. Censusalso reports this segment of the Texas population grew by355,956 persons from 1990 to 2000, a 20.7 percentincrease over the course of the decade. Current trendsindicate that aging and disabled Texans choose assistedliving facilities, home-and community-based services, oradult day care facilities over nursing facilities for long-term care. Improved pharmaceuticals and medicaltechnology contribute to the growth in home-based careby allowing individuals more flexibility in managing theirillnesses or disabilities at home. The combination of agrowing aged and disabled population, medical science,and technology improvements are changing the types ofservices and settings that Texans choose for their care. The Medicaid program known as State of Texas Access Reform + PLUS, a managed, long-term-care pilotprogram in Harris County, has been successful in holdingdown costs. The Health and Human Services Commissionreported in September 2004 that, when compared toMedicaid fee-for-service programs in Texas, State ofTexas Access Reform + PLUS saved $23.2 million inGeneral Revenue Funds during the 2004-05 biennium. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe number of clients residing in Texas nursing facilities decreased more than 7 percent from 1999through 2003. Assisted living facility residents in theTexas Medicaid program increased by more than 51percent from 1999 through 2003. \u008bClients receiving adult day-care services increasedin Texas by more than 53 percent from 1999through 2003. \u008bTo meet consumer demand, over 257 new home-and community-based provider agencies opened inTexas from 2001 to 2003. \u008bThe Health and Human Services Commission isplanning an expansion of State of Texas AccessReform + PLUS from one to eight urban areasbeginning in September 2005. The commissionestimates the expansion will save approximately$73.0 million per year in General Revenue Fundsonce the program is fully developed. Assuming aphase-in of the expansion in fiscal year 2006,savings in General Revenue Funds would total anestimated $109.5 million for the 2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bThe Texas long-term care client caseload makes up less than 20 percent of Medicaid recipients butrepresents approximately 59 percent of costs for the entire state Medicaid budget. RECOMMENDATION \u008bExpand the less costly State of Texas Access Reform + PLUS managed long-term care program during the 2006-07 biennium and adjust appropria- tions to the Health and Human Services Commis-sion and the Department of Aging and DisabilityServices for the 2006-07 biennium to reflect a savings of $109.5 million in General Revenue Funds. COMMENTS A June 2004 report from the Texas State Data Center at The University of Texas at San Antonio states that thepopulation of persons 65 years of age or older wasapproximately 2.1 million in 2000 and predicts that it could grow as high as 8.2 million by 2040, an increase of morethan 295 percent. According to U.S. Census data for theyear 2000, persons in Texas age 65 and older made upnearly 10 percent of the state's population. The growth inalternative health care services and the increased demandfor them have forced states to look for solutions and costsavings using nontraditional models. According to the Department of Aging and Disability Services' (DADS) Long-term Care Facilities Report forfiscal year 2003, the number of clients residing in Texasnursing facilities decreased 7 per cent from fiscal years 1999 to 2003, while the number of clients residing in assisted living facilities or receiving adult day care increased 51percent and 53 percent, respectively, during the sameperiod (see Figure 1). The decline in nursing facilitiesoperating in Texas is shown in Figure 2. The number ofnursing facilities decr eased 11 percent from fiscal years 1999 to 2003, while assisted living facilities increased 18percent, and the number of adult day-care f acilities rose 33 percent. Also, in order to meet consumer demand, thenumber of home- and community-based service agenciesincreased from 1,833 agencies in fiscal year 2001 to 2,090agencies in fiscal year 2003.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 148EXPAND THE USE OF LESS COSTLY ALTERNATIVES FOR LONG-TERM CARE FIGURE 1 LONG-TERM CARE OCCUPANT UTILIZATION TREND, FISCAL YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2003 NOTE: Figure reflects percentage increase or decrease in annual occupant utilization.

Long-term-care clients in community-based services increased6.2 percent from fiscal year 2000 through 2004. Figure 4reflects trends in long-term-care caseloads for community-based services. Figure 5 describes the array of servicesavailable in the community. Consumer-directed services were authorized as a Medicaid service in Texas by Senate Bill 1586, passed by the Seventy-sixth Legislature, 1999. Texas entered the era of consumer-directed services in October 2002, after the Centers forMedicare and Medicaid Services approved the state's plan,which allows disabled persons to receive vouchers for home- and community-based services. Services areprovided through six different DADS programs, andfunding is provided by three sources: General RevenueFunds; Federal Medicaid Funds; and Social Services BlockGrant Funds. Figure 6 lists the six programs in Texas thatoffer consumer direction as an option and identifies thefunding mechanisms for each. Prior to the implementation of the consumer-directed services program, the Health and Human Services Com-mission (HHSC) had already started implementation of along-term care reform plan. The plan, called \"PromotingIndependence,\" was originally delivered to the Texas Legislature in January 2001. Phase one required educating nursing home residents about community-based alternativeprograms, collecting basic data on nursing home residents,training department staff, and making the general publicaware of the new community options program. Phase two,implemented from September 2001 to September 2003,included recruiting and training relocation workers,developing an assessment tool and identification system,starting a data tracking system, and developing a commu-nity education program. Phase three provided preadmissionscreening in rehabilitation centers and hospitals to informclients of community-based alternative programs. HHSChas formed a workgroup to evaluate quality of care,utilization, and cost-effectiveness of the program. HHSC isexpected to report the workgroup's findings in fiscal year2005. COSTS FOR PROVIDING LONG-TERM-CARE SERVICES Long-term care has historically been the largest expendi- ture within the Medicaid program. Although the long-termcare population makes up less than 20 percent of the Medicaid caseload, in fiscal year 2003, DADS reported $8.1billion in Medicaid expenditures from All Funds for long-term care, which is approximately 59 percent of the entireMedicaid budget (see Figure 7). The National Associationof State Budget Officers and the National GovernorsThese trends correspond with changing health service requirements of the aged and disabled population in Texasas well as changes in program policy and structure at thestate level. The trends reflect consumer-driven choices by aged and disabled persons who prefer to avoid institution-alization and live as independently as possible for as long aspossible. Healthcare equipment and communicationtechnology have made these options possible and continueto drive demand for consumer-driven alternatives tonursing home care. Several states encourage assisted livingto reduce costs and serve as a substitute for nursing homecare to persons who prefer more independent living. The average cost per person per month is approximately $1,083for assisted living services in the Texas Medicaid program.Figure 3 compares services for various types of long-termcare facilities. HOME- AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES AND CONSUMER-DIRECTED CARE Community care programs provide services in or out of the home to the aged and disabled populations as alterna-tives to institutionalization. Some services have waiting lists,and some are available only in certain parts of the state.DADS manages community-based services for approxi-mately 70.6 percent of long-term-care program clients.Medicaid waiver services, which provide an array of FIGURE 3 SERVICE COMPARISON OF LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES Nursing Facilities Facilities provide diagnosis, treatment and care, room and board.

THE SUCCESS OF STAR+PLUS Among the more successful of Texas' long-term-care programs is the State of Texas Access Reform + PLUSprogram (STAR+PLUS), the state's managed long-termcare program, which is operated by HHSC. Implemented infiscal year 1998, STAR+PL US is a Medicaid pilot project, integrating delivery of acute and long-term-care servicesthrough a managed-care system. In April 2004, HHSC reported the Harris County caseload to be over 59,000members. The program includes all Medicaid medical andsupportive services, paying a fixed amount per person permonth and contracting with commercial managed-careplans. Community-based alternative services are expectedto be incorporated in the plan in the 2006-07 biennium.FIGURE 6 PROGRAMS AT DADS OFFERINGCONSUMER-DIRECTED SERVICES Community-based Alternatives General Revenue Funds and Federal Medicaid Community Living Assistance General Revenue Funds and Federal and Support Services Medicaid Deaf-Blind-Multiple General Revenue Funds and Federal Disability Waiver Medicaid Primary Home Care General Revenue Funds and Federal Medicaid Consumer Managed General Revenue Funds and Federal Personal Assistance Social Services Block Grant In-home and Family General Revenue Funds Support ProgramsPROGRAM FUNDING SOURCE SOURCE : Health and Human Services Commission.

The program requires two waivers from the federal government: \u008bA 1915(b) waiver allows the state to limit clientchoice of providers and to mandate that certainMedicaid clients participate in managed care. Thefederal government also waives the requirement thatstate Medicaid policies apply uniformly to allMedicaid clients in the state. \u008bA 1915(c) waiver allows the state to limit home andcommunity-based services to certain Medicaidclients who would otherwise require nursing homeor other forms of institutionalized care. An independent evaluation of the prog ram's first two years of operation from February 2000 to January 2002 foundcost savings of about $93 per member per month, a 17percent savings when compared to fee-for-service, long- term care. During the Seventy-seventh Legislative Sessionin 2001, a variety of Medicaid workgroup recommenda-tions were introduced to reform Texas Medicaid in Senate Bill 1156. Among the recommendations was a proposal toexpand STAR+PLUS to other areas of the state. The fiscal year 2003 encounter data of STAR+PLUS from participating health plans showed an increased use ofpreventive and support services, including a 32 percentincrease in attendant care and a 38 percent increase in adultday-care. The Institute for Child Health Policy completed astudy of STAR+PLUS in 2003 and reported a 28 percentreduction in hospital admissions, reduced emergency roomvisits, high customer satisfaction levels, and good quality ofcare. This study also showed high ratings in customersatisfaction and quality of care. Members rated their healthmanagement organizations 8.2 on a 10-point scale. In fiscal year 2004, the program's projected average cost per person per month was approximately $183 for personsdually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and $642 perperson per month for disabled and blind persons. HHSCreported in September 2004 that, when compared toSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 153EXPAND THE USE OF LESS COSTLY ALTERNATIVES FOR LONG-TERM CARE Medicaid fee-for-service, long-term-care services, STAR+PLUS saved $23.2 million in General RevenueFunds in the 2003-04 biennium. These cost savings reflecta 6.5 percent savings over Medicaid fee-for-service costs inHarris County. Beginning in fiscal year 2005, HHSC plans to expand STAR+PLUS to seven additional urban areas: Bexar, Dallas, El Paso, Lubbock, Nueces, Tarrant, and Travis.Forecasting assumptions from HHSC indicate that expan-sion of STAR+PLUS will increase its client population byapproximately 214,874 persons in fiscal year 2006 (over 38.2 percent of the eligible long-term-care population).Acute care funds will be combined with funds for commu-nity support services, and a discount of 6 percent will beapplied to guarantee a savings to the state. Based on HHSCestimates, a fiscal analysis of the STAR+PLUS expansionassumes a savings of approximately $73 million per year inGeneral Revenue Funds in a mature program. The Legisla-tive Budget Board estimates savings of $36.5 million infiscal year 2006 and $73.0 million in fiscal year 2007 for atotal of $109.5 million for the biennium. It is recom-mended that appropriations for HHSC and DADS in theintroduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill beadjusted to reflect these projected savings. DEMAND FOR DIRECT SERVICE HEALTHCARE WORKERS A major factor that will impact long-term-care policy and funding in coming years is a shortage of staffing. Accord-ing to a study conducted in 2004 by the Health PolicyInstitute of Georgetown University and the KaiserCommission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, nationalstatistics show that 78 percent of adults receiving long-term care at home rely on unpaid help, 8 percent on paidassistance, and 18 percent on a combination of paid andunpaid help. Families are an important part of any long-term-care program, even when services are purchased.Long-term care is hands-on assistance provided by skilledpersons who assist people who need help with fundamentaldaily activities such as bathing or eating over a significantperiod of time. This type of assistance is labor intensiveand is provided by family, friends, and volunteers, as well ashired personnel. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 39 percent growth in direct service worker occupations over the next10 years. Aging baby boomers are only a part of thereason for this phenomenon. A recent federal programcalled the Demonstration to Improve the Direct ServiceCommunity Workforce provided grant recipients theopportunity to develop and implement pilot programsthat offer strategies for the recruitment and retention ofdirect-care service workers. It will be critical for the stateto work with the public and private sectors to insure thatthe supply of paid and volunteer caregivers meets thedemand. Figure 9 shows a summary of suggestions fromthe demonstration projects provided by the Centers forMedicare and Medicaid Services. WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING Minnesota has one of the most ambitious long-term-care efforts in place. During fiscal years 2002 and 2003 theMinnesota Legislature passed legislation creating a newcomprehensive framework for the state's long-term-caresystem. Reforms established in 2003 include a plan to createhealth insurance options, such as the inclusion of long-termcare in Medicare supplemental plans. Another initiative is afamily care program whereby families receive incentives toprovide care or pay for care through special loans. The Minnesota Legislature appropriated $183 million for long-term-care reforms in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Ofthat amount, $108 million provided cost-of-living increasesfor employees of nursing facilities and continuing careproviders. More than $75 million was invested in expandinghome- and community-based service options. Increasedspending was partially offset by reducing the number ofnursing home beds by 5,100. Maine reformed its long-term care program in fiscal years 2001and 2002 to reduce state costs in acute long-term careand nursing facilities. Clients once fearful of ending up innursing homes enrolled in the new program to receiveservices in their own homes. Demand for the programoutstripped resources, despite a reduction in nursing homebed use. The high demand for consumer-directed andhome-based care caught state officials off guard, and theprogram had to be re-engineered to properly screen client access to care at various levels in the continuum of care. According to the 2000 census, Maine has a small popula- tion of 1.3 million and has one of the fastest growingelderly populations in the country, with 14.4 percent of itspopulation aged 65 and older. Medicaid spending for long-term care in Maine was $411 million in fiscal year 2001,FIGURE 9 RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGIES FOR DIRECT SERVICE CAREGIVERS \u008bHealth insurance for workers \u008bCareer ladder programs or incremental step increases \u008bTraining and education programs \u008bSupervisory training \u008bNormal fringe benefits such as vacation \u008bProviding culturally competent services such as language classes and childcare \u008bAssistance with transportation, especially in rural areas SOURCE : The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 154EXPAND THE USE OF LESS COSTLY ALTERNATIVES FOR LONG-TERM CARE accounting for approximately one-third of all Medicaid spending in the state. Between 1995 and 2001 Maineexpanded its use of Medicaid's home-and community-based waiver program to reduce reliance on institutionalcare. During that time the percentage of public, long-term-care funding devoted to these facilities decreased from 84percent to 61 percent. To gain control on over capacity andcosts, Maine adopted new certificate of need rules onSeptember 1, 2004. These rules place new restrictions onthe certification of hospital swing beds, licensed nursinghome beds, and the construction, development or estab-lishment of any new, expanded, or replaced nursing facility.Hospice programs, assisted living facilities, and homehealthcare programs are exempted from the new rules. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION The STAR+PLUS, long-term care managed-care pilot has demonstrated the ability to contain costs better thantraditional fee-for-service models, reflecting $23.2 millionin General Revenue Fund savings in the 2004-05 biennium.HHSC estimates that $73.0 million per year in GeneralRevenue Funds could be saved in a mature program by expanding STAR+PLUS to other urban areas of the state.This fiscal analysis assumes that the expansion would bephased in during fiscal year 2006 at a rate to achieve $36.5million in General Revenue Fund savings for that fiscalyear (see Figure 10). The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill reflects $109.5 million in General Revenue Fund savingsprovided for by the report recommendation.FIGURE 10 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 155EXPAND THE USE OF THE LONG-TERM CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE Texas, like other states, faces challenges to fund and sustain health programs for the elderly and disabled. Despiterecent implementation of healthcare cost-control strategies, the cost for treatment of the elderly population in long-term care continues to rise. Texas' Medicaid spending in2003 totaled approximately $15 billion. The majority ofMedicaid expenditures provide care for the aged anddisabled population. Medicaid payments for acute care ofthe aged and disabled totaled $2.6 billion in fiscal year2003. Medicaid payments for long-term care of the agedand disabled totaled $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2003, $1.7billion of which consisted of payments to Texas nursingfacilities. Approximately two-thirds of nursing homepatients in Texas are Medicaid recipients, not includingthose patients (known as \"dual-eligib les\") that receive both Medicare and Medicaid. The quality assurance fee is presently assessed on public and private intermediate car e facilities for the mentally retarded. If the assessment is allowed to expire in 2005,approximately $103 million in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds and $155 million in Federal Funds will be lost in the2006-07 biennium, requiring replacement of state revenueto maintain services. Expanding the assessment of the quality assurance fee to include nursing homes and accessing additional federalmatching funds with the new revenue could provide relieffrom the fiscal constraints facing long-term care and theMedicaid program in Texas. Based on a model consideredin 2001, the net biennial revenue estimate from a 6 percentassessment on nursing home gr oss receipts would yield approximately $347.5 million, after taking into account thestate's share of a Medicaid ra te offset. If all of the net nursing home quality assurance fee funds were to be usedas state match, an additional $533.9 million in Federal Funds could be obtained in the 2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe quality assurance fee currently levied on publicand private intermediate care facilities for thementally retarded sunsets on September 1, 2005, andwithout legislative action, will expire on that date. \u008bAt least 33 states currently levy a provider tax onnursing homes. Assessments on nursing homeshave been the most frequently imposed providertax in the pre vious two years. T he number of statesenacting assessments on nursing homes has doubled during that period. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bExpiration of the quality assurance fee assessment in fiscal year 2005 would result in a revenue loss inthe 2006-07 biennium and would require a replace-ment of General Revenue Funds to maintaincurrent services. \u008bTexas does not currently assess the quality assurancefee to nursing homes. Applying the quality assurancefee to nursing homes in Texas at a rate of 6 percentof gross receipts could generate approximately$347.5 million in the 2006-07 biennium, after takinginto account the state's share of a Medicaid rateoffset. Approximately 94 percent of the revenuewould come from assessments on the gross receiptsof nursing homes participating in the Medicaidprogram. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Continue the quality assur- ance fee currently levied on public and privateintermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded.Doing so would require amendment of \u00a7 252.209, Health and Safety Code, relating to legislative reviewand expiration. \u008bRecommendation 2: Consider expanding the quality assurance fee to nursing homes. Such anexpansion would require a statutory change. COMMENTS Texas currently levies a provider tax in the form of thequality assurance fee (QAF) on intermediate care facilitiesfor the mentally retarded (ICF-MRs), including community mental health and mental retardation centers, and facilities administered by the Department of Aging and DisabilityServices (DADS) (state schools). Provisions governing theapplication of the QAF in Texas, first enacted in Senate Bill1839, Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, can be found atSubchapter H, Chapter 252, Health and Safety Code. Keyprovisions of the statute are as follows: \u008brequires the Health and Human Services Commis-sion (HHSC) to set the quality assurance fee forSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 156EXPAND THE USE OF THE LONG-TERM CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE each day in an amount that produces annual revenue less than or equal to 6 percent of a facility's totalannual gross receipts; \u008bprovides that the QAF is an allowable cost forreimbursement under the Medicaid program (Thismeans that providers may report the assessment tothe state as a cost eligible for reimbursement byMedicaid.); \u008bauthorizes HHSC, subject to legislative appropria-tion and state and federal law, to use money in thequality assurance fund, tog ether with any federal money available to match that money; \u008bto offset expenses incurred to administer the QAF; \u008bto increase reimbursement rates paid under theMedicaid program to facilities or waiver pro-grams for persons with mental retardation; or \u008bfor any other health and human services purposeapproved by the governor and Legislative BudgetBoard. \u008bprohibits the increased Medicaid reimbursementpaid to a facility to be based solely on the amount ofthe QAF paid by that facility unless authorized bycertain federal provisions; and \u008brequires the Seventy-ninth Le gislature to review the operation and effectiveness of Subchapter H andprovides that, unless continued by the Seventy-ninthLegislature, the subchapter and the QAF expireSeptember 1, 2005. COST OF QAF EXPIRATION DADS reports that $20.9 million in QAF revenue wascollected in fiscal year 2002, $51.1 million in fiscal year 2003, and $51.9 million in fiscal year 2004. DADS projects QAF revenue in the amount of $54.7 million in fiscal year2005, when collections are pr ojected to exceed appropria- tion by $5.5 million. QAF funds are currently used to finance ICF-MR and state school services. Approximately $98.4 million in QAFrevenue is appropriated to the Texas Department ofMental Health and Mental Retardation for the 2004-05biennium, and $100.9 million is recommended for appro-priation to DADS in the introduced version of the2006-07 General Appropriations Bill. Those funds wouldbe used to draw down $155.0 million in Federal Funds.Expiration of the QAF assessment in 2005 would result ina revenue loss of $258.0 million in All Funds in the2006-07 biennium and would require replacement ofGeneral Revenue Funds to maintain current services.Approximately 99 percent of ICF-MR patients are Medic-aid recipients. A reduction in appropriations for these services could significantly impact ICF-MR providers.Recommendation 1, the continuation of the QAF assess-ment to ICF-MRs and state schools, would have thepositive fiscal impact summarized in Figure 1. APPLYING THE QAF TO NURSING HOMES Assessment of the QAF to nursing homes was contem- plated at the time of the original enactment of the fee inTexas. Several bills considered by the Seventy-seventhLegislature, 2001, provided for the assessment of the QAF to nursing homes. Based on an assessment of 6 percent on the gross receipts reported by nursing facilities (a 6 percent assessment is thethreshold used in the federal hold harmless test and theassessment contemplated in Texas in 2001), estimatedfunds collected from expanding the QAF to nursing homes FIGURE 1 CONTINUATION OF THE ICF/MR AND STATE SCHOOL QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE (QUALITY ASSURANCE)PROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/ (LOSS) TO GENERAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDS (QUALITY ASSURANCE)PROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/(LOSS) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDSFISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 157EXPAND THE USE OF THE LONG-TERM CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE could total approximately $226 million a year. Of those funds, approximately 94 percent of the revenue wouldcome from assessments on the gross receipts of Medicaid-participating nursing homes. For the purpose of estimating the fiscal impact of Recom- mendation 2, it is assumed that the assessment, like thecurrent QAF, would be designated as an allowable cost.Therefore, revenue collected would be reduced by the stateshare of an adjustment to nursing home reimbursementrates to be paid back to providers to cover the cost of thefee associated with Medicaid patients (Medicaid rate offset).Based on that assumption, approximately $132.8 million isreimbursed to Medicaid-participating facilities in fiscal year2006, $52.2 million in state funds, and $80.6 million inFederal Funds. The resulting net biennial revenue estimatefrom the assessment of the QAF to nursing homes isapproximately $347.5 million, after reducing for the state's share of the above Medicaid rate offset. If all of the $347.5 million net nursing home QAF funds were to be used as state match, an additional $533.9 millionin Federal Funds could be gained in the 2006-07 biennium.Recommendation 2, the expansion of the QAF assessmentto nursing homes, would have the positive fiscal impactsummarized in Figure 2. WHAT OPPONENTS AND PROPONENTS SAY At the center of the debate is state establishment of nursing home reimbursement rates for services provided toMedicaid patients. The repeal of the federal Boren Amendment in 1997 removed the requirement that state nursing home reimbursement rates be \"reasonable andadequate\" and instead allowed for a \"public process\"requirement, including publication of proposed rates andcalculating methodologies for review and comment byproviders and beneficiaries. (In Texas, HHSC is grantedbroad authority to set rates in accordance with HHSC rule, applicable state and federal law, economic conditions, andavailable levels of appropriated state and federal funds.) States argued that the prior provision tied their hands, forcing them to spend too much on nursing homes at theexpense of other services. Nursing homes argued thatwithout the requirement, state bu dget pressures, not the cost of care, would be the driving force in determiningreimbursement rates. While states focus on managingdifficult economic conditions, including implementation ofcost-control measures and benefit and eligibility reductions,the nursing home industry faces rising costs due tomandated staff training and ratios, increased salaries andbenefits to hire and retain quality staff, and high liabilityinsurance costs, among other issues. States that have imposed nur sing home provider taxes have generally done so to provide relief to the nursing homeindustry in a time of Medicaid cutbacks. Proponents arguethe following: \u008bThe revenues and enhanced federal matchingassistance are necessary for nursing homes to meetthe actual costs of providing care to Medicaidrecipients. \u008bIncreased funding allows nursing homes to improvethe quality of care they provide through, amongother measures, increased staffing and training tomeet standards set by both state and federalregulations. \u008bEvidence suggests that lower Medicaid paymentrates are associated with poorer nursing homequality and diminished access to nursing home carefor Medicaid recipients. Opponents argue that provider taxes place an unfair burden on nursing homes that serve a small number of FIGURE 2 ASSESSMENT OF QAF TO NURSING REVENUE GAIN/ (LOSS)TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSPROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/(LOSS) TO FEDERAL FUNDS (MEDICAID RATE OFFSET)PROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDS (MEDICAID RATE OFFSET)FISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 158EXPAND THE USE OF THE LONG-TERM CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE Medicaid patients. Arguments asserted by opponents include the following: \u008bPrivate-pay patients and the nursing homes with fewor no Medicaid patients share the burden of the tax,but they argue that little or nothing is returned tothem through increased Medicaid reimbursements. \u008bBurdening patients using personal assets and incometo pay for nursing home care hastens them towardsMedicaid eligibility, thereby increasing the roles ofstate and federally assisted patients. \u008bProvider tax mechanisms, although legal, undulyshift the balance of the financial burden for theMedicaid program to the federal government. THE IMPACT OF DEMOGRAPHICS According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 12 million elderly and disabled people arereceiving Medicaid benefits nationwide . In 2003, there was an average of approximately 90,000 patients in all licensednursing facilities in Texas. Based on recent figures, approxi-mately two-thirds of these patients were Medicaid recipi-ents, not including Medicaid and Medicare dual eligibles.The average number of patients receiving care in the approximately 58 non-Medicaid-participating facilities isestimated at roughly 5,900. Th ese facilities are not required to submit cost reports. Non-Medicaid-participatingfacilities and others serving a small number of Medicaidpatients would not directly benefit from the use ofprovider tax revenue used to increase reimbursement rates. While the population in Texas nursing facilities has decreased in recent years, there has been an increase in thecost of care. In 1999, the average daily cost of care perclient was $83.19. In 2002, the cost increased by 19 percentto $99.25. The cost of providing long-term care to the agedand disabled is projected to continue rising. Demographic data shows that the baby boomers will begin reaching retirement age in 2011. The elderly population inTexas is expected to double in the next 25 years. As thissegment of the population grows, so will the demand forlong-term care. The United States population of people 65and older will grow from 13 to 21 percent by 2030. In2020, baby boomers will be in their mid-80's, an age whenthe elderly population is most likely to need long-term care.In 2000, Texans 85 years or older totaled 237,000. By 2040,this population is expected to increase approximately 249percent to 831,000. This significant change in populationmakeup will have a great impact on the healthcare infra-structure and economy of the state.

In Texas, approxi-mately $15 billion or 25 percent of the budget was spenton Medicaid in 2003. Medicaid payments to Texas nursingfacilities in 2003 totaled $1.7 billion in All Funds. In 2001, national spending for nursing home care was $99 billion, 48 percent of which ($47.5 billion) was paid byMedicaid. In 2003, while the elderly made up only 9percent of the 52.4 million Medicaid recipients, theyaccounted for 26 percent of federal Medicaid expenditures.Inversely, children accounted for 48 percent of theMedicaid population nationwide and accounted for 19percent, or $44.7 billion of Medicaid expenditures. In Texas, 20 percent of Medicaid recipients are aged or disabled, yet they account for over 62 percent of Medicaid expenditures. In contrast, c hildren make up 59 percent of the Medicaid recipients but account for only 25 percent ofMedicaid expenditures. Clients with disabilities, as well asthe aged, generally have greater needs and utilize institu-tional and other long-term care services. (See Figure 4.) FEDERAL PROVIDER TAX PROVISIONS AND STATE ACTION A provider tax, such as the QAF, is a tax, fee, or assessment required of a healthcare provider by a state. States may userevenues from provider taxes, under the limited circum- stances specified in federal law, to pay the state share ofMedicaid spending. Some states seek to combine providertax revenues with state fund appropriations to increase federal matching funds. Federal Medicaid provisions relating to the permissible use of state provider taxes are in the Social Security Act (act) and the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). Statesseeking to implement a provider tax must do so in accor-dance with \u00a7 1903(w) of the act (42 U.S.C. 1396(b)(w)), which sets forth limitations on the use of provider taxes toobtain federal financial participation (FFP) under Medicaid,and with 42 C.F.R 433, Subpart B, the federal regulationspertaining to those provisions of the act. The two primary requirements for the permissible use of provider tax revenue are as follows: \u008bThe tax must be \"broad-based,\" a tax that isimposed with respect to a permissible class of itemsor services on all provider s in that class; and \u008bThe tax must be \"uniform,\" a tax that is imposed with respect to a permissible class of items orservices at the same rate for all providers. For example, a nursing home provider tax cannot specifi- cally exclude certain providers who have only private pay(no Medicaid) clients or charge them a lower tax. To be considered uniform, a provider tax cannot provide for credits, exclusions, or deductions that result in thereturn of a portion of the tax to the provider, with the netresult being that the tax is not generally redistributive andthe amount of the tax is directly correlated to Medicaidpayments. Likewise, a provider tax is not considered to beuniform if it holds taxpayers harmless for the cost of thetax. Taxpayers are considered to be held harmless if any ofthe following apply: \u008bThe state provides for a non-Medicaid payment tothose providers or others paying the tax, and theamount of the payment is positively correlated toeither the amount of the tax or to the differencebetween the Medicaid payment and the total tax cost; \u008bAll or any portion of the Medicaid payment to thetaxpayer varies based only on the amount of thetotal tax payment; or \u008bThe state provides for any payment, offset, or waiver that guarantees to hold taxpayers harmless for all ora portion of the tax.

Federal regulations provide for a hold-harmlesstest on which a state can pass if the tax on each healthcareclass produces revenues less than or equal to 6 percent ofthe taxpayers' revenues. Federal provisions do, however, provide for the opportu- nity to seek a waiver of either or both of the broad-basedand uniformity requirements if the net impact of the tax isfound to be generally redistributive and the amount of thetax is not directly correlated to Medicaid payments. Statesthat receive waiver approv al may levy taxes that are not broad-based or uniform without a reduction in federalfinancial participation (FFP). The provisions for theapplication and approval of waivers from these require- ments consist of several mathematical calculationsdesigned to measure the impact of the assessment levied.If the tests applied to the proposed assessment meet thewaiver calculation requirements and the assessment isfound to be generally redistributive, federal regulationsprovide for automatic approval of waiver requests. While there are no regulations on states' use of provider tax revenues, states seeking to use these funds as stateMedicaid match that fail to meet provider tax requirements suffer a reduction in FFP . The act requires the federalgovernment, for the purposes of determining a state's FFP , to reduce the total amount expended as medical assistance under the state's Medicaid plan by the sum of any revenuesreceived by the state via a provider tax that does not meetfederal requirements. STATES IMPLEMENT NURSING HOME PROVIDER TAXES States first began to implement provider taxes in the mid- 1980s. While the bulk of those early provider taxesinvolved hospitals, other provider types were also involvedincluding ICF-MRs, nursing homes, and physicians. In the past two years, nursing homes have become the fastest growing provider tax assessment imposed by states,with the number doubling in that time. At the beginning offiscal year 2003, 14 of the 21 states with provider taxesincluded assessments on nursing homes. During fiscal years2003 and 2004, states imposed 28 new provider taxes. Asof July 2004, 33 states impose provider taxes on nursinghomes. Several additional sta tes have recently considered enactment of a provider tax on nursing homes, hospitals,and health maintenance organizations. Key distinctions between state enactments of provider taxes include the following: \u008bmethod and rate of the assessment; \u008bestablishment of a defined account to hold providertax revenues;\u008bdedication of the funds or designation of activitieson which revenues can be used; \u008bprohibitions on passing the tax onto clients or fromitemizing the tax in the bill for care; \u008bexemptions from the assessment of the tax; and \u008bdissolution of the assessment under certain circum-stances or expiration of the tax. Generally, states dedicate their provider tax revenues to their overall Medicaid budgets, to provider rate increases,or to cover shortfalls in their overall state budget. While federal regulations provide for the enactment of provider taxes, the federal government scrutinizes providertax structures for adherence to requirements in state planamendments and waiver applications. Several states haveencountered difficulty in seeking f ederal approval of provider tax structures, typically relating to efforts toexempt certain providers. Colorado: Enacted provider tax in 2003. \u008bEnactment exempted providers that do not receive Medicaid payments and that are owned by agovernmental entity, requiring the state to seekfederal approval of a waiver of the broad-basedrequirement. \u008bThe federal government did not approve the waiverbecause it had the effect of holding that exemptedgroup harmless. \u008bColorado repealed the tax in 2004. Georgia: Enacted provider tax in 2003. \u008bGeorgia reportedly began collecting its tax before receiving federal approval. \u008bIn the spring of 2004, Georgia did receive approval for the use of provider tax revenues after the statewithdrew its plan to exempt nursing homes that havefew or no Medicaid patients, a violation of federalregulations. Among the several states tha t have submitted requests for waiver of provider tax requirements, at least two, to date,have been successful: North Carolina and Oregon. North Carolina: Enacted provider tax in 2003. \u008bRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to implement the program according tofederal regulations. \u008bEstablishes a two-tiered assessment based onpatient days.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 161EXPAND THE USE OF THE LONG-TERM CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE FIGURE 5 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT 2006 QUALITY ASSURANCE)PROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/ (LOSS) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS (NURSING HOMES)PROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/(LOSS) TO FEDERAL FUNDS (COMBINED)FISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.\u008bMedicare beds and continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) exempted with waiverapproval. \u008bReceived federal approval of waivers of both the broad-based and uniformity requirements, findingthat the net impact of the tax is generally redistribu-tive and that the amount of the tax is not directly correlated to Medicaid payments. Oregon: Enacted a provider tax in 2003. \u008bSets forth assessments on four provider types, including nursing homes. \u008bRequires the Director of Human Services to set therate to raise an amount equal to six percent of theannual gross revenue of all facilities, excludingrevenue from exempted facilities. \u008bProvides that $12.5 million of the net tax revenuewill be transferred to the general funds during2003-05. \u008bReceived federal approval of waiver for exemptionof CCRCs and a state veterans home. The recent federal approval of waivers in North Carolina and Oregon are significant developments. At the timeTexas enacted its QAF, many believed that the federalgovernment would not approv e application for waivers relating to provider taxes. While provided for in theregulations, approval was considered unachievable and was,for the most part, not pursued by Texas at that time. Several other states currentl y have waiver applications relating to provider taxes pending. Texas' healthcare assistance programs face funding challenges. Continuation of the current QAF assessmenton ICF-MRs provides policymakers a clear step towards cost avoidance. Allowing its expiration will place significantadditional strain on already limited resources. Additionally,the increasing number of nursing home provider taxesenacted and the federal approval of provider tax waivers inNorth Carolina and Oregon illustrate the viable opportu-nity for states to generate additional revenue to assist infunding long-term care. For these reasons, expansion ofTexas' QAF assessment on to nursing homes meritsconsideration. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations 1 and 2 would result in a net gain of $347.5 million in General Revenue Funds and $2.1 millionin General Revenue-Dedicated Funds in the 2006-07biennium. Figures 5 and 6 summariz e the positive fiscal impact of both Recommendations 1 and 2. Combined, therecommendations represent a net gain of $349.6 million inAll Funds for the 2006-07 biennium, not including thepotential to draw down additional Federal Funds if netrevenue is used in Medicaid payments.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 162EXPAND THE USE OF THE LONG-TERM CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE FIGURE 6 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT 2006 QUALITY ASSURANCE FUND)PROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS (NURSING HOME MEDICAID RATE OFFSET)PROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDS (COMBINED)FISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. As previously noted, the fiscal impact of Recommendation 1 has been built into the introduced version of the 2006-07General Appropriations Bill. The estimate of revenue thatwould be collected from the continuation of the assess-ment of the QAF to ICF-MRs and state schools exceedsthe $100.9 million recommended for appropriation in the 2006-07 by $2.1 million. Collectionof ICF-MR and state school QAF funds to support thisappropriation requires a statutory change. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not include any appropriation of funds collected from theassessment of the QAF to nursing homes, as considered byRecommendation 2. Therefore, implementation ofRecommendation 2 via statutory change represents a netpositive fiscal impact of $347.5 million in the 2006-07biennium.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 163IMPROVE COLLECTION OF VENDOR DRUG REBATES All states that provide drug benefits to Medicaid beneficia- ries receive rebates from drug manufacturers on drugs usedby the Medicaid program. In 2003, the Texas StateAuditor's Office reported that the Health and HumanServices Commission had not properly accounted for allthe outstanding prescription drug rebate revenue owed tothe state. The auditors identified $20.7 million of uncol-lected rebates from calendar year 2001 but were unable toquantify outstanding amounts from prior years due toincomplete and inaccurate data in the agency's prescriptiondrug information system. The auditors recommended waysto identify these uncollected amounts. However, the Healthand Human Services Commission has not fully imple-mented these recommendations, and therefore it has notidentified all outstanding balances. Additionally, the Health and Human Services Commission is not collecting rebates for all drugs dispensed in physi-cians' offices to Medicaid clients. The agency could collectan estimated $12 million in All Funds in rebates on thesedrugs in the 2006-07 biennium if the Medicaid informa-tion system were configured to collect the necessary datafrom physicians. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bThe Health and Human Services Commission hasnot determined the amount of outstanding rebatesfor the period from 1991 through first two quartersof calendar year 1995. \u008bAccording to the Health and Human ServicesCommission's data, the agency has not collected$17.3 million in outstanding vendor drug rebates, orrelated interest, for the period from the third quarter of calendar year 1995 through calendar year 2003.Since the agency has not fully implemented the StateAuditor's recommendations for determining theamount of outstanding rebates for that period, theaccuracy of reported outstanding rebate balancescannot be ensured. \u008bThe Health and Human Services Commissionreports that it has collected almost all outstandingrebates for calendar year 2001. However, since theagency has not fully reconciled collections tobillings, some rebates may still be outstanding.\u008bThe Medicaid Management Information Systemdoes not collect information on drugs administeredin physicians' offices, and therefore the Health andHuman Services Commission cannot collect allrebates on these drugs. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: The \"Performance Reporting for the Prescription Drug Rebate Program\" rider forthe Health and Human Services Commission shouldbe amended in the 2006-07 General AppropriationsBill to require the agency to estimate the rebates andinterest owed to the state by drug manufacturers forthe period from 1991 through second quarter ofcalendar year 1995 and report the estimatedbalances no later than August 31, 2006 to theLegislative Budget Board, State Auditor's Office andthe Governor's office. \u008bRecommendation 2: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill that requires the Healthand Human Services Commission to modify theMedicaid Management Information System tocollect the National Drug Code data necessary forthe state to calculate and collect rebates for physi-cian-administered medication in the 2006-07biennium. The agency should consider the cost-benefit of requiring physicians to submit NationalDrug Code data for physician-administered drugsfrom prior years. \u008bRecommendation 3: Reduce the Health and Human Service Commission's General RevenueFund appropriation for Vendor Drug program by$4.7 million for the 2006-07 biennium, and increaseVendor Drug Rebates-Medicaid method of financeby the same amount. Rebates collected on physician-administered drugs should be appropriated forpurposes consistent with the use of the VendorDrug Rebates-Medicaid specified in the GeneralAppropriations Act. COMMENTS The federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990established the Medicaid drug rebate program. Thisprogram enables states tha t provide drug benefits to the Medicaid population to receive a rebate from each drugSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 164IMPROVE COLLECTION OF VENDOR DRUG REBATES manufacturer whose drugs are used in the program. Acting on behalf of the states, the U.S. Center for Medicare andMedicaid Services (CMS) enters into rebate contracts witheach drug manufacturer choosing to participate in theMedicaid program. Approximately 520 pharmaceuticalcompanies participate in the rebate program. As part of thecontract agreement, drug manuf acturers are required to submit to CMS a list of all covered outpatient drugs and toreport average manufacturer price and Medicaid best pricefor each drug. CMS calculates the unit rebate amount basedon the manufacturers' prices and sends this information tothe states. States calculate the rebate owed by the drugmanufacturer based on the unit rebate amount and numberof units for each drug used by the Medicaid program, andbill drug manufacturers on quarterly basis. To ensure thatall rebates are collected, state Medicaid offices needaccurate drug utilization data. Drug manufacturers have 38 days to either pay the invoice sent by the state or to dispute the utilization data if theybelieve that it is inaccurate. While manufacturers are required to pay the undisputed portion of the rebate, theydo not have to pay the disputed portion until the datadiscrepancy issues are resolved. Manufacturers have to provide notification to the sta tes explaining the basis of the dispute. States and manufacturers use dispute resolutionand other mechanisms to resolve disagreements aboutoutstanding rebates. Disputes over rebate amounts owed goback to the beginning of the prog ram, which was estab- lished in 1991. Many states have experienced difficulties incalculating and collecting outstanding rebates. OUTSTANDING DRUG REBATES IN TEXAS' MEDICAID PROGRAM In Texas, the Heath and Human Services Commission (HHSC) is responsible for collecting drug rebates. TheHHSC collects rebates through its Vendor Drug Program.The state share of revenue from drug rebates is appropri-ated to the agency, while the federal share is returned to thefederal government. In the 2004-05 biennium, state shareof the revenue from drug rebates is expected to reach morethan $400 million. In 1995, HHSC established an automated system for drug manufacturers' billing, the Pharmacy Rebate InformationManagement System (PRIMS). Only some records for theperiod prior to the third quarter of calendar year 1995 havebeen recently entered into the system. As a result, theHHSC does not have accurate and complete informationon outstanding rebates. Drug manufacturers will likelycontinue to dispute the agency's claims for outstandingrebates unless HHSC is able to support its assumptions foroutstanding balances with accurate utilization data.OUTSTANDING REBATE BALANCES PRIOR TO 1995 In April 2003, the State Auditor's Office (SAO) reported that, according to the HHSC data, outstanding rebates forthe years before 1995 totaled $9.1 million. The HHSCcould not adequately support this estima te; therefore, the SAO recommended that the agency recreate invoices andreconcile them with payments and credits. The SAOrecommended that the HHSC consider hiring a third partyor temporary staff to complete this work. The HHSC agreed with the recommendation and re- sponded that it would enter all pre-PRIMS payment andinvoice data, complete reconciliation, and correct errors.The agency stated tha t once this payment-posting project was completed, PRIMS should be able to identify alloutstanding rebates. Since June 2004, HHSC hired nine temporary employees, but it later decreased the number to seven. The temporary employees entered approximately 129,000 line items out ofthe approximately one million line items necessary fordetermining the outstanding balances. HHSC staffreviewed 103 invoices associated with the 129,000 lineitems and was able to identify approximately $610,000 inoutstanding rebates, not including interest. The temporary employees worked for five months at a cost of $95,788. The HHSC staff estimates that it would cost an additional $345,000 to complete the data-postingproject. Collection of the outstanding rebates just for the103 invoices tested would cover costs for posting allremaining line items. Posting the remaining line items would not only allow the agency to collect outstanding rebates, but the work wouldalso provide more accurate data in the system used to billfor Vendor Drug and other programs' rebates. As ofOctober 22, 2004 the HHSC system showed $83.8 millionin outstanding rebates for the pre-1995 period. HHSC staffstates that this is a significant overstatement of the actualoutstanding balance. Entering all payment information andcorrecting unit measurements in PRIMS would allow theagency to develop more reliable estimates of outstandingdrug rebates owed to the state. OUTSTANDING REBATE BALANCES AFTER 1995 The SAO report also concluded that HHSC had not properly accounted for all outstanding prescription drugrebate revenue owed to the state after 1995. The auditorsfound that agency's PRIMS contained inaccurate data. The SAO concluded that w hile PRIMS data for outstanding balances was unreliable, there were indications that asignificant amount of rebate revenue remained outstanding. The SAO recreated an outstanding rebate balances in PRIMS for only one of the six years for which the systemSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 165IMPROVE COLLECTION OF VENDOR DRUG REBATES had data. As of May 2002, the auditors reported that $20.7 million in rebates remained uncollected fromcalendar year 2001. Rider 47 of the General Appropriation Act (GAA) for the 2004-05 biennium requires the HHSC to report on aquarterly basis to the Legislati ve Budget Board (LBB) and the Governor's Office outstanding rebate balances for anumber of programs including Medicaid. The riderrequires the HHSC to report outstanding balances,adjustments, interest, and collections for each year forwhich the prescription drug rebates program has collectedrebates and also on a cumulative basis for all years. The HHSC did not submit the report in fiscal year 2004. In October 2005, the HHSC provided LBB staff with updatedrebate data for calendar year 2001. Figure 1 shows howmuch the HHSC reports has been collected and how muchin rebates and interest remains outstanding. The HHSC did not fully implement the SAO recommenda- tion that it produce detailed information for all adjustmentsmade since the initial rebate billings. Without this detailedinformation, it is not possible to determine whether theagency has identified all outstanding rebates for calendaryear 2001. Based on the HHSC data, as of November 22, 2004, outstanding rebates in the Medicaid program for the periodfrom the third quarter of calendar year 1995 throughcalendar year 2003 were $17.3 million. This includes thereported $817,756 from calendar year 2001 but does notinclude interest that has accumulated on outstanding rebatebalances. The HHSC can also collect interest for amountsdue from the date of initial billing. During the 2004-05 biennium, Medicaid benefits were reduced to address the escalating costs of the Medicaidprogram. Collecting vendor drug rebates and ensuring thatthe state has accurate drug utilization data could enable the state to return more reven ue to the Vendor Drug Program.Recommendation 1 would amend the HHSC rider 47 \"Performance Reporting for the Prescription Drug RebateProgram\" from the 2004-05 biennium to require theagency to estimate the rebates and interest owed to thestate by drug manufacturers for the period from 1991through the second quarter of calendar year 1995. Inaddition, the rider would require HHSC to report theestimated balances to the Legislative Budget Board, StateAuditor's Office and the Governor's office no later thanAugust 31, 2006. The amended rider is included in the General Appropria- tions Bill for the 2006-07 biennium: 47 41. Performance Reporting for the Prescription Drug Rebate Program. The Commission shall report on a quarterly basis the following informationto the Legislative Budget Board, the Sta te Auditor' s Office and the Governor's Office: the outstanding prescription drug rebate balances for the Medicaid,CHIP, Kidney Health, and Children with SpecialHealth Care Needs programs. The report shallinclude rebate principal and interest outstanding, ageof receivables, and annual collection rates. Thereports shall specify amounts billed, dollar value ofpricing adjustments, dollar value of utilizationadjustments, and dollars collected. The Commission shall report these data on each year for which the Prescription Drug Rebate program has collectedrebates and also on a cumulative basis for all years. In ad dition, the Commission shall pr ovide no la ter than August 31, 2006 a se parate report to the Legislative Budg et Boar d, State Auditor' s Office and the Go vernor's Of fice detailing the outstanding Medicaid pr escription dr ug rebates and inter est balances for the period from 1991 through the second quar ter of calendar y ear 1995 in the f ormat specif ied above. In order to fully comply with this rider, the Commis- sion should address data integrity issues related tothe calculation of outstanding balance, cited in theState Auditor's Office report number 03-029 AnAudit Report on the Health & Human ServicesCommission Prescription Drug Rebate Program.(HHSC-Rider 47) OBTAINING MEDICAID REBATES FOR PHYSICIAN-ADMINISTERED DRUGS In April 2004, the federal Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices reported that many states are not collecting allrebates on physician-administered drugs.Original Rebate Balance Billed $288,582,302 to Drug Manufacturers Pricing and Utilization Adjustments $14,091,406 Value as of 9/30/04 $302,673,708 Collections through 9/30/04 $301,920,005Outstanding as of 9/8/04 $817,756Outstanding Interest as of 9/8/04 $819,748FIGURE 1 CALENDAR YEAR 2001 OUTSTANDING DRUG REBATES SOURCE : Health and Human Services Commission.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 166IMPROVE COLLECTION OF VENDOR DRUG REBATES To receive rebates, states must identify drugs by their National Drug Codes (NDCs). This practice enables drugmanufacturers to verify utilization of their products byeach state's Medicaid program. Most states, however, useHealthcare Common Procedure Coding System (proce-dure codes) to identify physician-administered drugs andhave not developed crosswalks to match NDCs toprocedure codes. States that established crosswalks as of 2001 requested $23 million in rebates on these drugs. The OIG reportfound that in 2001, Medicaid could have added millionsof dollars to its rebate savings if every state had collectedrebates for all single-source and 40 multiple-source,physician-administered drugs. The majority of savingswas from single-source drugs. As of March 2003, 24states, including Texas, did not collect rebates on anyphysician-administered drugs. T he study indicated that states' savings in a single year could exceed the one-timecosts of implementing system changes needed to collectrebates for these drugs. Single-source drugs in most cases have only one NDC, which enables the states to more easily match it to aprocedure code. Multiple-source drugs are manufacturedby different drug companies under different names,which makes it more difficult to match procedure codes to exact NDCs. The OIG reported that 17 states collected rebates on physician-administered drugs in 2001, and only a few statescollected rebates on all drugs administered in the physi-cians' offices. Medicaid information systems in these statesuse NDCs for physicians' billing, which enables the states to bill drug manufacturers without establishment of acrosswalk from procedure codes to NDCs. According to the numbers included in the OIG report, Texas spent more than $35 million for physician-administered drugs in 2001 and did not collect any rebates. Based on the numbers in the report, Texas couldhave collected rebates of $5,322,837 for single-source,physician-administered drugs in 2001. Additionally, Texas could have collected rebates of $750,305 for selectedmultiple-source, physician-administered drugs. CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TEXAS MEDICAID REBATE BILLING ONPHYSICIAN-ADMINISTERED DRUGS The HHSC does not require physicians to submit NDCs for drugs administered in their offices, even though thisinformation is readily available to the physicians. TheHHSC reports that it started billing drug manufacturers forsingle-source drugs in June 2003. The agency bills forrebates on single-source drugs only because it cannotidentify specific NDCs from procedure codes for multi- source drugs. Based on the HHSC data, in fiscal year 2003 the Medicaid program reimbursed physicians $62.4 million for physician-administered drugs, of whic h approximately $41.7 million was spent on single-source drugs. In fiscal year 2004, the amount reimbursed for medication administered inphysician offices was $73.5 million, of which approximately $23.3 million was for single-source drugs. The decrease inthe expenditures for single-source drugs can be partiallyexplained by the increase in number of drugs for whichpatents expire, which allows other drug manufacturers tointroduce multi-source drugs. The HHSC reports it hascollected $17 million in All Funds in rebates on the single-source drugs used in fiscal years 1991 through 2004. If the agency's MMIS could match all procedure codes with NDCs, it could bill drug manufacturers for rebates onall drugs administered in physicians' offices for an addi-tional $12 million in All Funds for drugs administered bythe physicians in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. The HHSCcan bill drug manufacturers for rebates on drugs utilized inthe past. However, the agency will not have the NDC datafor prior years. If ph ysicians would provide the NDC data for 2003 through 2005, the HHSC could bill drug manufac-turers for $12.1 million more in All Funds. Recommendation 2 would require the HHSC to use up to $500,000 in General Revenue Funds to make the neces-sary changes to MMIS to enable it to receive NDCs to billfor rebates on all physician-administered drugs. Based onthe agency's estimates, it could cost HHSC up to $4million in All Funds to implement program changes toMMIS. The agency also suggests that the estimatedfederal matc hing rate for the system change would be 90 percent and HHSC would have to contribute 10 percentof the project costs. HHSC would also need to change its reporting requirements for the physicians who provide services to the Medicaidpopulation in fee-for-service and primary care case manage- ment models. There may be additional administrative burdenfor physicians to be able to submit NDCs. However, itappears that private organizations are already moving in thisdirection. At least one Health Maintenance Organization(HMO) requires its physicians to submit NDCs necessary forreimbursement determination. Recommendation 3 would reduce HHSC General Revenue Fund appropriation for Vendor Drug program by $4.7million for the 2006-07 biennium, and would increaseVendor Drug Rebates-Medicaid method of finance by thesame amount. In addition, the recommendation specifiesthat rebates collected on physician-administered drugsshould be appropriated for purposes consistent with theSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 167IMPROVE COLLECTION OF VENDOR DRUG REBATES use of the Vendor Drug Rebates-Medicaid specified in the General Appropriations Act. The following rider that requires HHSC to make necessary changes to the system and shows reduction in the appropri-ated funds was included in the introduced 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill. 56. C ollection of Rebates on Physician Adminis- tered Prescription Drugs. From the funds appropriated above in Strategy B.2.2. MedicaidVendor Drug Program, the Health and HumanServices Commission shall use up to $500,000 inGeneral Revenue to make necessary changes to theMedicaid Management Information System tocollect rebates on single-source and multi-sourcephysician administered drugs. The appropriations tothe Commission made above for the MedicaidVendor Drug Program have been reduced by$2,366,092 in General Revenue for fiscal year 2006and $2,378,728 in General Revenue for fiscal year2007 and the method of finance Vendor DrugRebates-Medicaid have been increased by thesesame amounts. Additional rebates collected onphysician-administered drugs are appropriated to theCommission for purposes consistent with the use ofthe Vendor Drug Rebates-Medicaid specified elsewhere in this Act. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 3 would result in a net General Revenue Fund savings of $4.7 million in the 2006-07 biennium.Recommendation 1 requires the HHSC to complete dataentry of rebate billings and collections prior to 1995 andto reconcile PMIS for rebate billings and collectionsafter 1995. While there would be some cost associatedwith hiring temporary employees to assist with thiseffort, the collection of outstanding rebates shouldmore than offset this cost. Until this recommendation isimplemented, the amount of outstanding rebates cannotbe accurately estimated. The fiscal impact in Figure 2 reflects the amount of additional rebates the HHSC can collect once MMIS hasthe capability to accept NDCs for physician-administereddrugs as called for in Recommendation 2. The following assumptions were made to calculate this amount: \u008bThe rebates rate for single-source drugs is 30percent of drug expenditures and 10 percent formultiple-source drugs. These percentages are basedon the federal OIG methodology.\u008bThere is a 20 percent increase in expenditures forphysician-administered drugs between 2004 and2007 that reflects a number of factors includingutilization and price increase. \u008bProportions of single-source and multi-source drugsin fiscal year 2005, 2006 and 2007 are equal toproportions for these drugs in fiscal year 2004. \u008bNo impact of the new Medicare Part D prescriptiondrug benefit effective January 1, 2006 is assumedbecause this report analyzed rebates on drugsadministered by physicians. Visits to physicians forbeneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and Medic-aid programs are already reimbursed by MedicarePart B. Therefore, the Medicaid program reimbursesphysicians for drugs dispensed in their offices forbeneficiaries eligible for Medicaid program only. In addition, the fiscal impact f igure shows the reduction in the General Revenue Funds called for in Recommendation3. The reduced General Revenue Funds amount is equal tothe estimated rebate amount that HHSC will be able tocollect on multi-source drugs. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a rider authorizing HHSC to use up to $500,000 inGeneral Revenue Funds out of appropriated funds for theMedicaid Vendor Drug Program to make changes to theMMIS. The introduced bill also incorporates a $4.7 millionreduction in General Revenue Funds from MedicaidVendor Drug Program that is expected to be offset by theincrease in the state share of the drug rebate revenue.FIGURE 2 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT OF COLLECTINGREBATES GAIN/(LOSS) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS (VENDOR DRUG REBATES REVENUE- STATE SHARE)PROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS (VENDOR DRUG REBATES REVENUE- STATE SHARE) SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 168IMPROVE COLLECTION OF VENDOR DRUG REBATESSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 169IMPROVE COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION SERVICES FUNDING The Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services' Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services program providesservices to survivors of traumatic brain injury and spinalcord injury in Texas. The program is funded solely through General Revenue-Dedicated Funds deposited to theComprehensive Rehabilitation Fund (Account No. 107).The fund was established by Senate Bill 195, Seventy- second Legislature, 1991, which dedicated traffic convic-tion fines to comprehensive r ehabilitation services provided by the Texas Rehabilitation Commission. The Comprehen-sive Rehabilitation Services pr ogram was established by rule, and current rules were adopted in the Texas Registerin 1993. In the 2004-05 biennium, appropriated fundingfrom the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Fund totals $20.8million. This report discusses the history of revenues dedicated to the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services program. Thisreport also makes recommendations regarding subrogationreceipts collected by the agency and reallocation ofComprehensive Rehabilitation Services Funds previouslyused for administration. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe revenue source f or the Comprehensive Reha- bilitation Fund has changed substantially twice sinceits creation. \u008bThe amount of revenue collected for the Compre-hensive Rehabilitation Fund from court-related fines levied on offenders has fluctuated through the 13years the fund has been dedicated to ComprehensiveRehabilitation Services. The appropriation of fundsis capped in a rider, and the agency cannot spendadditional revenue collected. \u008bHouse Bill 2292, Seventy-eighth Legislature, RegularSession, 2003, identified certain circumstances inwhich the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Fund canbe used for general governmental purposes. How-ever, none of the stipulations in House Bill 2292 forthis to occur have been met to date. \u008bSubrogation receipts collected in relation to Com-prehensive Rehabilitation Services cases are cur- rently not appropriated to the ComprehensiveRehabilitation Services program. It is estimated that$50,000 in subrogation receipts is collected annually from reimbursements to the ComprehensiveRehabilitation Services program. \u008bHistorically, some General Revenue-DedicatedFunds have been allocated to the agency's adminis-tration strategies. Shifting the General Revenue-Dedicated Funds to the Comprehensive Rehabilita-tion Services strategy and client services is moreclosely aligned with the intent and dedicated statusof the funds. \u008bAn estimated 225 additional clients can be served inthe 2006-07 biennium, as compared to the numberprojected by the agency to be served in the 2004-05biennium, if all recommendations are implemented. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bSome portion of revenues (generated through courtfees and fines) dedicated to the ComprehensiveRehabilitation Services program and subrogationreceipts collected in relation to ComprehensiveRehabilitation Services cases are not allocated to theComprehensive Rehabilitation Services program.Individuals eligible for services are waiting foravailable funding, and time is of the essence inprocuring services for individuals with traumaticbrain injury and spinal cord injury. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Rider language should be included for the Department of Assistive andRehabilitative Services in the 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill that a ppropriates subrogation receipts from Comprehensive RehabilitationServices cases to the Comprehensive RehabilitationServices program. \u008bRecommendation 2: In the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill, $343,207 in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds otherwise appropriated foradministrative costs at the Department of Assistiveand Rehabilitative Services during each year of the biennium should instead be appropriated forComprehensive Rehabilitation Services in StrategyB.3.4.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 170IMPROVE COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION SERVICES FUNDING \u008bRecommendation 3: The total projected amount of revenue estimated by the agency to be generatedduring the 2006-07 biennium should be appropri-ated to the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Servicesprogram in the 2006-07 General AppropriationsBill. Appropriations should continue to be limited tothe amount of revenue the agency projects will becollected. COMMENTS Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services (CRS) is a programof the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services (DARS). House Bill 2292, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, consolidated four health and humanservices agencies into DARS: the Interagency Council onEarly Childhood Intervention (ECI), the Texas Commis-sion for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (TCDHH), theTexas Commission for the Blind (TCB), and the TexasRehabilitation Commission (TRC). The Texas Rehabilita-tion Commission provided services intended to assistindividuals with disabilities to achieve employment throughprograms such as Vocational Rehabilitation, as well as independent living services for individuals with disabilitiesand comprehensive rehabilita tion services for individuals with spinal cord and traumatic brain injury. Former TRCprograms, including CRS, are now housed in DARSDivision of Rehabilitative Services. Senate Bill 195, Seventy-second Legislature, 1991, created the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Fund. This act dedi-cated a stream of funding, originally from fines assessedfor traffic violations such as not wearing a motorcyclehelmet or driving while intoxicated, to the CRS fund inthe state treasury. The purpose of the ComprehensiveRehabilitation Services progr am is \"to pr ovide payment for an initial period of comprehensive medical rehabilita-tion services for individuals with traumatic spinal cord injuries and/or traumatic brain injuries; outpatientservices for individuals with traumatic spinal cord injuriesand/or traumatic brain injuries; and post-acute servicesfor persons with traumatic brain injury\" (Texas Adminis-trative Code, \u00a7 107.1201), using funding from the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Fund. To qualify for the CRS program, an individual must demonstrate a traumatic spinal cord injury and/or trau-matic brain injury, and a reasonable expectation the CRSprogram will be of benefit in improving functioning in thehome and community. Other eligibility criteria are listed inFigure 1. Eligibility is assessed by vocational rehabilitationcounselors as part of assessment procedures for DARSDivision of Rehabilitative Services (DRS) programs. If,during the course of services, an individual becomeseligible for another DRS program, the sponsorship of thatindividual is to be shifted immediately to that program. The scope of services available is limited to a maximum of the following: 90 days inpatient comprehensive medicalrehabilitation; 120 hours outpatient comprehensiverehabilitation; six months for post-acute brain injuriesservices; and post-closure services on a limited basis. Thereare also limitations on services related to the time of onsetof injury. For inpatient services, no more than one year may have elapsed since the onset of injury at the time of referral to the program. For outpatient services, no morethan two years may have elapsed, and for post-acuteservices, there is no time limitation. For examples ofservices provided through the CRS program, see Figure 1. The number of individuals served through the CRS program is dependent upon available funding. In fiscal year2004, the agency served 458 clients in ComprehensiveRehabilitation Services at an average cost of $18,858 perclient. DARS estimated in September 2004 that 278 FIGURE 1 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND SERVICES PROVIDED FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SERVICES PROVIDED \u008bTraumatic spinal cord and/or brain injury \u008bReasonable expectation of benefit \u008bAt least 16 years of age \u008bCitizen or immigrant alien of United States \u008bResident of Texas for at least six months or family member resident for six month \u008bNot eligible for another DRS program \u008bWilling to accept treatment \u008bMedically stable to participate SOURCE : Texas Administrative Code \u00a7 113.2.

REVENUE SOURCE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY The revenue source for the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Fund has changed substantially twice since its creation.Initially the CRS fund received 100 percent of traffic fees and fines dedicated to it, which was changed throughlegislation to 12.37 percent of court fees and fines forspecial services. The most recent legislative change loweredthe allocation to the CRS fund to 5.3218 percent ofconsolidated court costs (see Figure 2). For the purposes of this report, \"consolidated court costs\" refers to therevenue source composed of consolidated court fees andfines levied upon conviction established by House Bill2424, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003. Dedication of traffic conviction fees and fines to the Comprehensive Reha bilitation Fund was initially codified as Article 102.081 of the Code of Criminal Procedure bySenate Bill 195, Seventy-second Legislature, 1991. Article 102.081 was repealed by House Bill 2272, Seventy- fifth Legislature, 1997. This bill created Article 102.075 ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure requiring individualsconvicted of certain offenses under the Penal Code to pay\"court costs for special services.\" Article 102.075 specifiesthe amounts of fees and fines to be paid depending onthe class of offense and allocates the revenue generatedunder this article to several accounts. The CRS Fund wasallocated 12.37 percent of the revenue collected under Article 102.075. Article 102.075 was repealed by House Bill 2424, Seventy- eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, effective January1, 2004. This bill amended Subtitle C, Title 4, LocalGovernment Code to add Chapter 133. Chapter 133,\u00a7 133.102 consolidates fees and fines paid on conviction to the Comptroller of Public Acc ounts, raising the amounts of the fines and fees assessed as court costs (see Figure 3). House Bill 2424 also added seve ral new funds as beneficia- ries of the revenue and lowered the CRS fund share to noless than 5.3218 percent. The bill also directs the comptrol-ler to allocate the revenue based on historical data so thefunds will receive, \"to the extent practicable,\" the sameamount the fund would have received without the consoli-dation of fees. This provision indicates the amount ofmoney each fund receives should not differ significantlyfrom historical collections, and this appears to be sup-ported by the comptroller's re venue projections for the consolidated court costs (fines and fees). Although the revenue source and percentage of court fees and fines allocated to the CRS fund have changed severaltimes, the actual amount of revenue collected by CRS hascontinued to increase.

Therevenue source, consolidated court costs (fines and fees),has also fluctuated from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004. In addition to legislative changes in the composition of therevenue source, other external factors impacting collectionscould include crime and conviction rates. Rider 6, Fund Dedicated: Comprehen- sive Rehabilitation Revenu e,\" was added to the Texas Rehabilitation Commission bill pattern by the Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, in the General AppropriationsAct for 2002-03. In addition to specifying that the unex-pended balance of the account is included in the methodof finance for the CRS progr am, the rider confirms that the amounts are statutorily dedica ted to CRS and may not be used for any other purposes.The Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, provided an estimated appropriation through Rider 6, General Appro-priations Act (GAA) 2002-03, allowing revenues above theappropriated amounts to be spent on the CRS program.This allowed TRC to e xpend all General Revenue- Dedicated Fund collections, including any accumulated balance. In fiscal year 2002 the agency expended more thanthe estimated appropriation for this strategy under theauthority of Rider 6. In fiscal year 2003, expenditures were lower than the estimated appr opriation in the GAA. There were three reductions to the CRS fund in fiscal year 2003:consolidation related transfers to the Health and HumanServices Commission; a reduction by House Bill 7, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003; and a reduction of almost $300,000 pursuant to Article II Special Provi-sions, Sec. 21, General Appropriations Act, Seventy- seventh Legislature, 2001. Previously, there was no rider forthe CRS program and the appropriations were at timeshigher than the revenue and in other years lower than thecollections (see Figure 4).FIGURE 3 CONSOLIDATED COURT COSTS (FEES AND FINES)1997-2004 SOURCE : Article 102.075, Criminal Code of Procedure (abolished); 133 \u00a7 Local Government Code.$80.00 $40.00 $17.00$83.00 $40.00$133.00 $-$20.00$40.00$60.00$80.00$100.00$120.00$140.00 Felony Class A or Class B misdemeanor Nonjailable misdemeanor 1997-2003 Effective January 1, 2004STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 173IMPROVE COMPREHENSIVE FOR COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION SERVICESFISCAL YEARS 1991-2004 SOURCES : Legislative Budget Board; Comptroller of Public Accounts. The Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, capped the appropriation for the 2004-05 biennium.Amounts collected above the amount specified in Rider 6remain in the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Fund and areonly available for the CRS program (unless the House Bill2292 provision detailed below is applied); however, theagency cannot spend the money unless it is appropriated. HOUSE BILL 2292, SEVENTY-EIGHTH LEGISLATURE, REGULAR SESSION, 2003 Advocates for Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services have recently expressed concern that House Bill 2292removes the dedication from the Comprehensive Reha-bilitation Fund. House Bill 2292, \u00a7 2.117 amends Human \u00a7 111.060, which establishes the Comprehensive Rehabilita- tion Fund in the state treasury, to identify circumstances inwhich funds in the CRS fund, Account No. 107, can beused for general governmental purposes. House Bill 2292, \u00a7 2.117 (d) provisions 1 and 2 refer to the same circumstances necessary for the legislature to make anappropriation from the Economic Stabilization Fund(Rainy Day Fund), identified in the Texas Constitution,Article 3, \u00a7 49.g:1. if the comptroller certifies there is a shortfall in a current biennium (it is our understanding thiscertification is most likely to occur when thecomptroller releases the Biennial Revenue Estimate[BRE]; however, this could also be done at adifferent time); or 2. if the comptroller estimates in the BRE that there will be less revenue for a succeeding biennium thanfor the current biennium. However, the Texas Constitution, Article \u00a7 49.g specifi- cally states that an appr opriation must be made from the Economic Stabilization Fund, whereas House Bill 2292, \u00a7 2.117 (d) provisions 1 and 2 do not specifically require an appropriation. It is our understanding that in either ofthese two circumstances, an appropriation from the CRSfund would have to be made in order for funds to be takenout of Account No. 107 and the balance depleted. Withoutan appropriation, these two provisions appear to beduplicative of Government Code 403.095, Use of Dedi-cated Revenue, which allows the comptroller to use thebalances of the account for the purpose of certification,without actually reducing the balance of the account.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 174IMPROVE COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION SERVICES FUNDING House Bill 2292, \u00a7 2.117 (d) provision 3 states that if the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) determines a state fiscalemergency exists and determines money from the Compre-hensive Rehabilitation Fund is needed for general govern-mental purposes, then the money may be used for generalgovernmental purposes. In this scenario, the LBB wouldspecifically identify the CRS fund as a source of funding;whereas, in the first tw o provisions if the circumstances identified were to occur, the CRS fund would automaticallybecome available for general governmental purposes. Thisauthority is already available to the LBB under GovernmentCode, Chapter 317. If the LBB determination of a state fiscal emergency occurred during a regular legislativesession, an appropriation could be made from the fund foranother purpose. Since none of the three circumstances identified in House Bill 2292 have yet occurred, the funds in Account No. 107 currently remain dedicated to the CRS program. COLLECTION AND APPROPRIATION OF SUBROGATION RECEIPTS Subrogation receipts at DRS (formerly TRC) are collected by the agency through cost-recovery legal action related torehabilitation services provided by the agency. Costs maybe recovered from personal insurance, from another personfor personal injury caused by negligence or wrongdoing, orother sources. Rider 3 in TRC's bill pattern directs all subrogation receipts collected by the agency to be deposited into theVocational Rehabilitation (VR) strategy. This rider for2004-05 is an estimated appropriation. In the agency'slegislative appropriations request for the 2006-07 bien-nium, an additional $1 million above appropriatedamounts in subrogation receipts is shown as estimated forfiscal year 2004. The agency has determined that about 10 percent of the money recovered in subrogation is from CRS cases. Basedon the 10 percent estimate provided by the agency, ofamounts expended or budgeted for fiscal years 2003through 2005, $205,000 may have been collected fromCRS cases. As suggested by Recommendation 1, Rider 3 should be amended to appropriate subrogation receipts collected onbehalf of CRS clients to the CRS program and continue todirect subrogation receipts collected in relation to the VRprogram to the VR strategy. Based on the agency's 2006-07legislative appropriations request, the amount of subroga-tion receipts that could be directed to the CRS program isapproximately $100,000 per biennium. This redirectionwould allow DARS to serve five additional clients in theCRS program in 2006-07.RECOMMENDED RIDER REVISION The following revision to the agency rider appropriating subrogation receipts is incorporated in the introducedappropriations bill for the 2006-07 biennium. Appropria tion: Subrogation Receipts. Included in amounts appropriated above in Strategy A.1.1 B.3.1, Vocational Rehabilitation - Gener al Ser vices B.3.4 Compr ehensi ve Rehabilita tion, eac h fiscal y ear of the biennium, are from subrogation r eceipt bove, in eac h fiscal y ear above the amounts $500,000 appropria ted in eac h strategy in each year are hereby appropriated to the agency forclient services in the V ocational R ehabilita tion program from w hich the subr ogation collections were generated (estimated to be zero). ALLOCATION OF COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION GENERAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDS Historically, some General Revenue-Dedicated Funds have been allocated to the agency's administration strategiesthrough the General Appropriations Act. For fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the agency is requesting appr oximately $326,050 annually in CRS General Revenue-DedicatedFunds for administrative costs (95 percent of the 2004-05base). If these funds were a ppropriated for direct client services, the increased funds allocated to the CRS strategywould allow certain individuals currently waiting forservices to be served with the dedicated funding. As previously mentioned, eligibility is determined for the CRS program through the vocational rehabilitationcounselors. No administrative costs produced by the CRSprogram have been tied to Program Support (Goal D).Administrative costs for this program are covered throughStrategy B.3.1, Vocational Rehabilitation-General. Assuggested in Recommendation 2, the agency's administra-tive strategies should be reduced by $ 343,207 in General Revenue-Dedicated Funds for each year of the 2006-07 biennium, in ad dition to other administrative reductions. Allocating all General Revenue-Dedicated Funds to theComprehensive Rehabilitation strategy and appropria ting 100 percent of the 2004-05 funding level will allow approximately 34 more clients to be served in the 2006-07STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 175IMPROVE COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION SERVICES FUNDING biennium. T his new allocation would align more closely with the dedicated status of the funds. Recommendation 3 further proposes that the strategy be appropriated the full amount of revenue collectionsprojected by the agency for the 2006-07 biennium.Recommendation 2 and 3 are incorporated in the intro- duced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill. The recommended performance target for cost-per-client for the 2006-07 biennium is $20,000, an increase of 6percent from the fiscal year 2004 actual performance.Appropriating the full amount of Comprehensive Rehabili-tation funding estimated to be available, as well as subroga-tion receipts, will enable the agency to serve an estimated1,046 clients in the 2006-07 biennium. This is an increaseof 225 over the 821 clients the agency projects to serveduring the 2004-05 biennium. According to advocates,treatment for traumatic brain and spinal cord injury is likelyto be more effective when it is received in a timely manner. There are no FTEs or administrative objects of expenseassociated with this strategy; all funding is used for clientservices. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS There is no significant fiscal impact from Recommenda- tions 1, 2, and 3. All three recommendations from thisreport are incorporated in the introduced 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill. Recommendations of this report aremade in order to promote efficient use of state funds anddirect dedicated funding to needed services.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 176IMPROVE COMPREHENSIVE REHABILITATION SERVICES FUNDINGSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 177IMPROVE THE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OF TEXAS TRUST FUND AND BENEFITS PLAN The Business Enterprises of Texas program provides and maintains employment opportunities for blind and visuallyimpaired individuals in the field of food service andvending in public and private facilities, and is administeredby the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services.

COMMENTS The Business Enterprises of Texas (BET) program isadministered by the Department of Assistive and Reha-bilitative Services (DARS). House Bill 2292, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, consolidatedfour health and human services agencies into DARS: the Interagency Council on Early Childhood Intervention (ECI), the Texas Commission for the Deaf and Hard ofHearing (TCDHH), the Texas Commission for the Blind(TCB), and the Texas Rehabilitation Commission (TRC).The Commission for the Blind provided services intendedto assist blind and visually impaired individuals to achieveemployment through programs such as VocationalRehabilitation, as well as independent living services,services for blind and visually impaired children, and theBusiness Enterprises of Texas. The federal Randolph Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. Section 107) and state law (Human Resources Code, Title 5,Chapter 94) provide DARS (formerly TCB) with statutoryauthority for BET. The Randolph Sheppard Act givespriority to blind and visually impair ed business managers to operate cafeterias, vending mac hine operations, snack bars, gift shops, and sundry stores on federal property, and statelaw extends this priority in Texas to state property. DARSacts as the state licensing agency in Texas, providingtraining and employment opportunities to eligible individu-als. BET program operations are funded through GeneralRevenue-Dedicated Account No. 492, which collectsrevenue from \"state unmanned vending\" (vending ma-chines not assigned to BET managers and located on stateproperty), and federal V ocational Rehabilitation (VR) funds.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 178IMPROVE THE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OF TEXAS TRUST FUND AND BENEFITS PLAN The Randolph Sheppard Act provides that funds set aside from net proceeds of vending facilities may be used forlimited purposes, including \"retirement or pension funds,health insurance contributions, and provision for paid sickleave and vacation time, if it is determined by a majorityvote of blind licensees.\" The Randolph Sheppard Act doesnot stipulate how such retirement and benefits plans shallbe implemented but allows the state licensing agency (DARS), with the active participation of the State Commit-tee of Blind Vendors, to design the plan. The BET retirement and vacation plan is funded through the BET Trust Fund, General Revenue-DedicatedAccount No. 5043, which was created by House Bill 1400,Seventy-sixth Legislatur e, 1999. The plan currently maintains individual accounts for members and allocatesplan revenues to fund expenses, vacation and retirementbenefits, and individual accounts. Vacation benefits aredistributed annually as a lump-sum payment, and mem-bers can choose between quarterly payments, annuitypayments, or lump-sum payment of account balances forretirement benefits. House Bill 1161, Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, authorized the agency to contract with a professionalmanagement service to manage the trust fund, effectiveJune 15, 2001; however, the agency has yet to contract for plan management. REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES OF BET TRUST FUND Revenue deposited into the BET Trust Fund, General Revenue-Dedicated Account No. 5043, is generated from\"federal unmanned vending.\" T hese revenues are produced from vending machines located on federal propertiesthroughout Texas that ar e not assigned to BET managers and are subcontracted to private entities. The commissionspaid by these private entities are deposited into the BETTrust Fund pursuant to Human Resources Code, Section94.016. Interest that accumulates on the cash balance ofthe trust fund also accrues to the account and fluctuatesdue to timing and interest rates. In fiscal year 2001 theinterest earned was 5.6 percent; in fiscal year 2004 interest totaled 1.5 percent (see Figure 1). Funds deposited to the BET Trust Fund are used for retirement and vacation benefits for BET managers. Thefour allowable uses of these funds identified by statute arethe following: \u008bpayment of quarterly benefit distributions to retireesunder current and prior plans; \u008bpayment of vacation pay benefits to managers;\u008bequalization payments to vendors from competingvending machines as requir ed by the Randolph Sheppard Act; and \u008bpayment for yearly actuarial services related to trustfund balances. Any remaining funds are dedicated to the individual accounts of participants in the current retirement plan. Theagency is required by Rider 9 in the General Appropria-tions Act for the 2004-05 biennium in the bill pattern ofthe Commission for the Blind (now DARS) to reportquarterly to the Legislative Budget Board, the Governor, and the comptroller on revenues and expenditures of theBET Trust Fund. Rider 9 appropriates the agency \"any amounts in addition to the amount identified in Strategy B.1.3 Business Enter-prises of Texas Trust Fund, necessary to make retirementand benefits payments in conformity with the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 USC, \u00a7 107) and Human Resources Code, \u00a7 94.016,\" giving the agency an estimated appropria- tion for this account and the related strategy (see Figure 2). The BET Trust Fund appropriation for each year of the 2002-03 biennium was $360,000. The BET Trust Fundappropriation for each year of the 2004-05 biennium is$410,000. Expenditures exceeded estimated appropriationsin fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The agency uses factors such as historical payments for retiree and manager benefits, projections of retirementeligibility, manager annual incomes and tenure, and reviewof equalization and actuarial payments to forecast expendi-tures for the BET Trust Fund. Ho wever, fund revenues and expenditures do not always correspond. In fiscal years 2003and 2004, expenditures exceeded revenues (see Figure 3);consequently, the agency drew against the trust fundbalance. According to DARS, payment of lump-sumbenefits upon the death of a participant is one example ofan unpredictable factor that can affect the expenditures ofthe agency. As of the end of fiscal year 2004, the cash balance of the BET Trust Fund was almost $3.5 million. Amountsappropriated from the BET Trust Fund above the revenuecollected are appropriated from the cash balance of theaccount. The cash balance rose from fiscal year 2000 tofiscal year 2002 but has declined in subsequent years asexpenditures have exceeded revenues (see Figure 4)accompanied by declining interest, as discussed above(Figure 1). This recent pattern in the revenues and expendi-tures of the BET Trust Fund is identified as a concern bythis report, as the trust fund and benefits plan requiresfiduciary responsibility by the state to be insured.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 179IMPROVE THE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OF TEXAS TRUST FUND AND BENEFITS PLAN 2.04%3.28% 2.06% 1.49%5.55% FY 2004 (est)0.00%1.00%2.00%3.00%4.00%5.00%6.00% Interest on Account Interest % of Cash BalanceFIGURE 1 AMOUNT AND PERCENT INTEREST EARNED ON BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OF TEXAS TRUST FUND FISCAL YEARS 2000-2004 SOURCES : Comptroller of Public Accounts; Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services.

This initiative wasundertaken with the assumption that if a professionalmanagement service managed the retirement fund, it wouldincrease the profit to the fund, thereby providing a moresecure retirement funding source for BET managers. Theagency is not required by the legislation to enter a contract. DARS has yet to contract with a professional management service to administer the BET Trust Fund, a concernidentified in this report. House Bill 1161, Seventy-seventhLegislature, 2001, had an effective date of June 15, 2001.According to the agency, the BET Trust Fund is unique inthat it provides actual retirement benefits to the BETmanagers. The agency reports that other states providingbenefits related to retirement are more likely to issue a cashbenefit to managers for investment in individual retirementaccounts (IRAs) or other retirement savings selected by theindividual managers. According to the agency, the complexaspects of the current benefits plan operations necessitatedworking with a consultant to implement House Bill 1161.In May 2004 the agency awarded a contract to the consult- ing firm Escalade in Austin to develop a request forproposal (RFP) for management services. According to theterms of the contract, Escalade will do the following: \u008bconduct research to explore trust fund administra-tion options in accordance with federal law (90days); \u008bpresent options for management of the fund to theBET managers, who will vote on the options andchoose one (120 days); and \u008bwrite the RFP and related specifications (90 days). According to this timeline the RFP for management services should be finalized by March 2005. The draft report by the consultant highlights significant aspects of the BET benefits plan operations, including the following: \u008bA trend exists that indicates increasing allocation ofvacation benefits as a percentage of contributionrevenue, which may eventually result in fewer dollarsbeing available for retirement savings. \u008bThe Department of Assistive and RehabilitativeServices, as plan Administrator, FY 2004 (est)Revenue ExpendituresFIGURE 3 BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OF TEXAS TRUST FUND REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES FISCAL YEARS 2000-2004 SOURCES : Comptroller of Public Accounts; Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 181IMPROVE THE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OF TEXAS TRUST FUND AND BENEFITS PLAN degree of support of Plan operations\" at no charge to the plan. The draft report states that DARSsupport includes the utilization of DARS personneland absorption of administrative costs by DARS. \u008bAs the assets of the plan increase, support demandswill also increase and require greater work hours andspecialized professional expertise from DARS. Possible changes to the plan proposed in the draft report are as follows: \u008bdistribution of net contribution revenue to planmembers, allowing roll-over of accumulatedindividual balances to tax-advantaged arrangements(IRA or other retirement plan), either through acomplete or partial termination of the plan; and \u008boutsourcing the pension administration require-ments, as authorized by House Bill 1161. As previously stated, the BET managers will vote on the option they prefer after being presented with the differentoptions by the consultant. Potentially, certain optionsunder consideration by the BET managers may conflictwith existing statute. Therefore, Recommendation 1 isthat DARS should work with BET managers to identify anystatutory changes that may be necessary.

These reportsare to include \"deposits to the fund, the recommendationsof the fund manager regarding investments, performanceof investments, and an actuarial analysis of projecteddisbursements.\" The agency reports they are unable toprovide reports on the management of the BET TrustFund until House Bill 1161 is fully implemented and a fundmanager is selected. BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OF TEXAS TRUST FUND ACCOUNT CLASSIFICATION Historically, concerns about the \"cost\" to the General Appropriations Act by a ppropriations from the Business Enterprise Program Trust Fund have been raised duringthe appropriations process. This report attempts to clarifythe classification of the account and if it is used to certifythe budget. According to the Comptroller's Office, Business Enterprise Program Trust, General Revenue-Dedicated Account No.5043, is a trust fund. The BET Trust Fund was establishedthrough House Bill 1400, Seventy-sixth Legislature, 1999,and set up in the state treasury. House Bill 3084, or the\"funds consolidation bill,\" also a product of the Seventy-sixth Legislature, included the Business Enterprise ProgramTrust as an account in the General Revenue Fund ex-empted from loss of dedication, establishing the account asa General Revenue-Dedicated Fund.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 182IMPROVE THE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES OF TEXAS TRUST FUND AND BENEFITS PLAN The balance of this trust fund account is not included in the biennial revenue estimate and is not used for certifica-tion of the budget. The Comptroller's Office compares thisto other General Revenue-Dedicated Fund accounts notused for certification, such as the Compensation to Victimsof Crime account. Appropriating funds to the BusinessEnterprises of Texas Trust Fund strategy (B.1.5) shouldnot be considered a \"cost\" to the General AppropriationsAct. Therefore, Recommendation 2 is to maintain the2004-05 level of funding for the trust fund, as the appro-priation is estimated and the General Revenue-DedicatedFund does not count as a \"cost\" to the General Appropria-tions Act. This recommendation is incorporated in the introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill. The BET Trust Fund, providing a benefit plan for BET managers who are b lind and visually impaired, shows fluctuating revenues, interest earned, and expenditures. Thecash balance of the BET Trust Fund is declining asrevenue and interest earnings have not been sufficient tomeet authorized expenditures in recent years. DARS has not yet contracted with a professional manage- ment service to administer the BET Trust Fund benefitsplan. House Bill 1161, Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001,had an effective date of J une 15, 2001. A consultant report on developing a request for proposal to administer the benefits plan provides relevant insight into current opera- tions of the plan as well as potential future changes. The BET Trust Fund is both a trust fund and a General Revenue-Dedicated account. The balance of this trust fundaccount is not included in the biennial revenue estimate andis not used for certification of the budget. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS There is no significant fiscal impact for Recommenda- tions 1 and 2. Recommendation 2 is incorporated in theintroduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill. Recom-mendations of this report are made in order to promoteefficient use of state funds and direct dedicated fundingto needed services.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 183MONITOR STATE FUNDS USED FOR THE GIVEBACK PROVISION OF THE 2003 FEDERAL MEDICARE ACT The U.S. Congress passed into law the Medicare Prescrip- tion Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003on December 8, 2003. Among other provisions, thelegislation provides outpatient prescription drug coverageto Medicare enrollees. When the federal governmentassumes the cost of these expenditures, state governmentswill be required to contribute towa rd the cost of providing prescription drugs to persons who are eligible for bothMedicaid and Medicare. Texas should monitor theseexpenditures in order to ascertain the effects of thislegislation on the state budget. This paper will examine aspecific provision of the Medicare bill, Sec.103 MedicaidAmendments (b), which contains language describing thisphased-down state contribution. This provision is variouslyknown as the \"giveback,\" \"tak eback\" or \"clawback\" provision. For consistency, \"giveback\" shall be used in allreferences to this provision throughout this analysis. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bMedicaid programs, funded with state GeneralRevenue Funds and Federal Funds, currently pay foroutpatient prescription drugs for recipients who aredually-eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. However,effective January 1, 2006, the Medicare program,funded primarily with Federal Funds, will pay foroutpatient prescription drugs for these dual-eligiblerecipients. \u008bStates will be required by federal law to send General Revenue Funds to the federal MedicarePrescription Drug Account in the form of givebackpayments as a phased-down state contributiontoward the costs of these drugs. \u008bIf a state chooses not to send in required payments,its federal Medicaid matching payments will bereduced by the amount of non-payment, plusinterest. \u008bState savings may be offset by increases in Medicaidenrollment, reduced leverage in negotiating prescrip- tion drug rebates, and the use of 2003 as a base yearto calculate savings, prior to savings realized through the implementation of the preferred drug lists. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Include in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill a strategy, MedicareFederal Giveback Provision, in the bill pattern for the Health and Human Services Commission totrack state General Revenue Fund expenditures forthis provision. \u008bRecommendation 2: Include in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill a new method offinance, Medicare Giveback Provision, to track thesestate General Revenue Fund expenditures apartfrom other Medicaid funds. COMMENTS The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement andModernization Act of 2003 (MMA) provides that beginningin January 2006, the federal government will provideoptional coverage of prescription medications for Medicarerecipients through drug plans. This benefit is known as \"PartD.\" An important piece of the Medicare legislation affectingstate budgets is federal cove rage of the outpatient drug expenditures currently made by state Medicaid programs on behalf of \"full dual-eligible\" enr ollees. The term full dual- eligible refers to people recei ving Medicare who have access to the state's full range of Medicaid benefits. Texas and thefederal government pay for Medicaid benefits according to aroughly 40 percent/60 percent state/federal split. The PartD benefit will result in the federal government assumingsome of the costs of drug e xpenditures that are currently being borne by state governments for dual-eligible recipients.However, states will continue to finance much of theprescription drug costs for dual-eligibles in the form ofpayments to the federal Medicare Prescription DrugAccount. Recommendation 1 suggests including a line itemin the bill to track this expense. Strategy B.2.3, MedicareFederal Give Back Provision has been included in the Healthand Human Services Commission budget structure in theintroduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill to reflect these expenditures. Recommendation 2 specifies that a newmethod of finance, Medicare Giveback, should be includedto track these General Revenue Fund expenditures. Thismethod of finance has been included in the introduced version of the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill, as this will allow for easy reference when calculating all stateexpenditures for the Medicaid program. There are no federal matching funds associated with these state expenditures.These \"giveback\" payments are known in statute as \"phased-down state contributions\" and are discussed in detail below.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 184MONITOR STATE FUNDS USED FOR THE GIVEBACK PROVISION OF THE 2003 FEDERAL MEDICARE ACT DUAL-ELIGIBLE ENROLLEES The term \"full dual-eligible\" refers to enrollees who are eligible for both Medicare and the state's full range ofMedicaid benefits. For a single adult, dual-eligibilitygenerally means his or her income is at or below theMedicaid income limit and that he or she is 65 years orolder, is disabled, or has end stage renal disease. Data show that more than 70 percent of dual-eligibles have annual incomes below $10,000 compared to 13 percent of allother Medicare beneficiaries. In calendar year 2002, dual- eligible enrollees in the United States accounted for 14percent of all federal Medicaid enrollees. However, thisgroup comprised 42 percent of total expenditures.Research shows dual-eligibles are more likely to be in fair or poor health compared to other Medicare beneficiaries.As a result, states paid appr oximately $7 billion for the cost of prescription drugs for dual-eligibles in 2002. Texas had363,000 dual-eligible enrollees in 2002. The estimate ofTexas' drug expenditures in 2002 for this group is $654million. This breaks down to about $150 per recipient per month. In general, it appears that prescription drugs are acost which dual-eligible recipients may not be able tomanage without the financial assistance provided by stateand federal governments. MEDICARE \"GIVEBACK\" PROVISION Under the MMA, states m ust provide a phased-down contribution, or \"giveback,\" toward the federalgovernment's cost of outpatient prescription drugs fordual-eligibles. The calculation of this monthly giveback involves several factors (see Figure 1), including the state share of 2003 per capita e xpenditures (PCE) for covered Part D drugs for full dual-eligibles multiplied by a federally-determined growth factor; the number of dual-eligibles enrolled in a Part D Plan in the month for which paymentis made; and a phased-down percentage for the year,specified in statute (see Figure 2). The Health and Human Services Commission's estimate of the giveback is $175.0 million for fiscal year 2006 and $290.3 million for fiscal year 2007. The significant differ-ence between years results from the rollout of Part Dcoverage starting January 1, 2006. Only eight months areincluded in the first year. POTENTIAL COSTS TO TEXAS There may be additional costs to the state in implementing the MMA. First, ther e may be an increase in the number of persons receiving Medicaid assistance . The MMA specifies that certain Medicare beneficiaries ma y apply for low- income subsidies (financed by Medicare) to help pay the FIGURE 1 CALCULATION OF THE GIVEBACK 1/12th X State share 2003 per capita expenditures, inflated X # Dual-eligibles X Phased Down Percent SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. 90.0% 10 . 0 %88.3% 11. 7 %86.7% 13 23.3%75.0% 25.0% 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Remittance to Federal Government State Savin gs90.0% 10 . 0 %88.3% 11. 7 23.3%75.0% 25.0% 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Remittance to Federal Government State Savin gsFIGURE 2 PHASE-IN OF STATE REMITTANCE RELATED TO DUAL-ELIGIBLES PERCENTAGE SAVINGS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 185MONITOR STATE FUNDS USED FOR THE GIVEBACK PROVISION OF THE 2003 FEDERAL MEDICARE ACT Part D premium, deductible, and cost-sharing obligations. Some people who apply for this subsidy may be determinedeligible for Medicaid benefits such as long-term care, healthservices not covered by Medicare, and the Medicarepremium assistance program. These newly determineddual-eligibles would be an additional cost to Medicaid. Secondly, federal law does not allow states to claim federal Medicaid matching funds for the costs of drugs that couldbe provided to those dual-eligible recipients who are not enrolled in a Part D plan. Furthermore, with some limitedexceptions, states would be responsible for the costs ofdrugs they provide that are not co vered by a dual-eligible's prescription drug plan formulary. Should the state chooseto cover drug costs of dual-eligibles not enrolled in Part D,or to provide coverage for drugs not included on partici- pants' formularies, additional expenditures would berequired. Third, the sta te may incur administrative costs related to outreach and enrollment in a Part D plan,including processing of eligibility for the low-incomesubsidies financed by Medicare available to certain dual-eligibles who enroll in Part D. Fourth, states will receive fewer rebates from prescription drug manufacturers sincetheir overall drug expenditures will be reduced. Finally, theuse of calendar year 2003 as the base year to calculate thegiveback will not fully reflect savings initiatives begun infiscal year 2004, such as the preferred drug list and diseasemanagement. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS The Legislative Budget Board staff 's estimate of the cost of drugs that will now be covered by Medicare is $670.2 million in General Revenue Funds for the 2006-07biennium. Based on the giveback formula, the Health andHuman Services Commission (HHSC) estimates that Texaswill return $465.3 million to the federal government duringthe 2006-07 biennium. The net savings, after adjusting forreduced manufacturer rebates, is approximately $166.0million. The giveback funds reside in Health and HumanServices Commission's Strategy B.2.3, Medicare FederalGive Back Provision in the introduced 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes $3,790.1 million in All Funds for Strategy B.2.2,Medicaid Vendor Drug Program and $465.3 million in AllFunds for Strategy B.2.3, Medicare Federal Give BackProvision, for a total of $4,255.4 million in prescriptiondrug expenditures.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 186MONITOR STATE FUNDS USED FOR THE GIVEBACK PROVISION OF THE 2003 FEDERAL MEDICARE ACTSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 187PREVENT LOSS OF FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE BLOCK GRANT FUNDS There are two main requirements for a state to receive the full federal Substance Abuse Prevention and TreatmentBlock Grant allotment: proof of a maintenance of effortto maintain non-federal funding at the average of theprevious two years, and compliance with Synar Amend-ment provisions that require states to pass and enforce lawsregarding the sale of tobacco products to individuals underthe age of 18. During fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the TexasCommission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse received approxi-mately $137.7 million in Substance Abuse Prevention andTreatment Block Grant Feder al Funds each year. The economic conditions in the state at the time requiredreductions in state agency a ppropriations. Because of the reductions to Texas Commission on Alcohol and DrugAbuse's General Revenue Funds used for the federallyrequired maintenance of effort, the agency and the statewere unable to meet one of the two main requirements forthe Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment BlockGrant. In an effort to prevent this from happening in thefuture, the Department of State Health Services should beencouraged to accurately account for all funds used formaintenance of effort, and the agency should reviewwhether current appropriated funds could be used forSubstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grantrequirements without affecting services. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bFederal law requires states receiving SubstanceAbuse Prevention and Treatment funding tomaintain a certain level of non-federal funding. Thislevel of funding, known as \"maintenance of effort,\"is one of the two main requirements for a state toreceive the full allotment of Substance AbusePrevention and Treatment Block Grant funds. \u008bCompliance with the Synar Amendment, whichrequires states to pass and enforce laws regardingthe sale of tobacco products to individuals underthe age of 18, is also a requirement for receiving thefederal substance abuse block grant. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bTexas did not meet the non-federal funding require-ment for \"maintenance of effort\" for the SubstanceAbuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant infiscal year 2003.\u008bIf a federal waiver is not granted, Texas' allotmentof Substance Abuse Prevention and TreatmentBlock Grant Federal Funds could be reduced byapproximately $10 million in subsequent fiscal years. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill for the Department ofState Health Services requiring the agency toprovide an explanation and accounting of all fundsused for Maintenance of Effort. \u008bRecommendation 2: The Department of State Health Services should review current appropriatedfunds and evaluate if any funds could be usedtoward the maintenance of effort requirement ofthe Substance Abuse Prevention and TreatmentBlock Grant without a reduction in the agency'sservice levels. COMMENTS The Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse(TCADA) was formally merged with the Department ofHealth and the mental health component of the Depart-ment of Mental Health and Mental Retardation to form theDepartment of State Health Services (DSHS) on Septem-ber 1, 2004. Most components of TCADA were placedunder the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Servicesdivision at that time. The new agency was establishedpursuant to House Bill 2292, Seventy-eighth Legislature,Regular Session, 2003, which reorganized all health andhuman service agencies. TCADA had been the principalstate agency designated by the governor to receive Sub-stance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) BlockGrant federal funds. After the establishment of the DSHS,the governor designated DSHS as the principal state agencyfor activities authorized under the federal Public HealthService Act Section 1921. Section 1921 provides for theallocation of funding to states for planning, carrying out,and evaluating activities to prevent and treat substanceabuse and other related activities. There are two main requir ements for a state to receive SAPT block grant funding: (1) maintain average non-federal expenditures over the previous two-year period, acommitment known as maintenance of effort (MOE) and(2) be in compliance with the Synar Amendment provisionsSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 188PREVENT LOSS OF FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE BLOCK GRANT FUNDS pertaining to passage and enfor cement of laws regarding the sale of tobacco products to individuals under the ageof 18. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENT Federal law requires states receiving SAPT funding to maintain prescribed levels of non-federal funding. Thislevel of funding, known as maintenance of effort, is one ofthe two main requirements for a state to receive the fullallotment of Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment(SAPT) Block Grant funds. To meet the MOE requirement of the SAPT Block Grant, a state needs to show maintenance levels of non-federalfunding for the programs outlined under the grant. TheMOE is based on the average non-federal expenditures ofthe previous two years. For example, if a state provides non-federal funding of $27.5 million in fiscal year 2001 and$27.9 million in 2002, the MOE for fiscal year 2003 is $27.7million. A state needs to provide a minimum of $27.7million for the current fiscal year of the block grant(average of the previous two fiscal years) to receive the full allotment and avoid a reduction to the block grant. PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE If a state is found to be in noncompliance with the Section 1930 requirement regarding the average non-federalfunding, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services can grant a waiver of the MOErequirement or reduce the state's SAPT Block Grantallotment dollar for dollar by the amount not maintained bythe state. Due to funding transfers, TCADA had sufficient General Revenue funding to meet the fiscal year 2004 SAPT MOErequirement. However, Texas did not meet the MOErequirement for fiscal year 2003. The state has appealed thefederal decision to deny a one-time waiver of the MOErequirement. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the federalallotment to the state for fiscal year 2005 could be reducedby $9.8 million. This could significantly reduce the numberof Texans provided drug and alcohol services. TCADA, having previously been designated the principal agency for SAPT Block Grants, was appropriated the non-federal funds required under feder al law in the form of General Revenue Funds sho wn in Figure 1. General Revenue funding for employee benefits can also qualify foruse in the MOE requirement. REDUCTION IN 2004-05 FUNDING The economic conditions in Texas in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 resulted in revenue collections that were not adequateto support the previously adopted budgets for fiscal year2003. Consequently, the Seventy-eighth Legislature, RegularSession, 2003, enacted House Bill 7, which reduced fiscalyear 2003 General Revenue and General Revenue- Dedicated appropriations to all state agencies. Thecommission's fiscal year 2003 General Revenue Fundappropriation of $27.3 million was reduced by $9.6 million(Figure 3) with the passage of House Bill 7. The reductionreduced the General Revenue Funds available for thecalculation of the MOE for fi scal year 2004. Targeted client levels at TCADA for fiscal year 2003 were main-tained by using available SAPT federal funds carriedforward from fiscal year 2002. In addition to the reducedlevel of General Revenue Funds available in fiscal year2003, the commission was appropriated $17.2 million inGeneral Revenue Funds for fiscal year 2004, approximately $10.0 million less than in fiscal years 2002 and 2005. The reduction in General Revenue Funds for fiscal year 2003 and the decreased appropriation in fiscal year 2004undermined the state's ability to meet the SAPT MOErequirement for both fiscal years. Any General RevenueFunds amount below the average of the previous two yearscould trigger a dollar for dollar reduction in SAPT federalfunds in subsequent years. Potentially, the SAPT allotmentfor fiscal year 2003 could have been reduced by approxi- mately $9.8 million, and the allotment for fiscal year 2004could have been reduced by $6.5 million for a total of$16.3 million over the two-year period (Figure 2). It wasestimated that the number of clients affected by thereduction would be approximately 6,300 in fiscal year 2003. The Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse and the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)requested a waiver from the MOE requirements for fiscal year 2003 from the U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices Department (USHHS). This request would haveFIGURE 1 TCADA APPROPRIATIONSSAPT BLOCK GRANT AND GENERAL REVENUEGENERAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT 2001 $ 27,256,268 $ 127,289,421 2002 $ 27,299,576 $ 132,649,2262003 $ 17,722,583 $ $ 27,214,474 $ 137,162,139**FISCAL YEARAPPROPRIATED GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSFEDERAL FUND ALLOTMENT * House Bill 7 reduced General Revenue by $9,576,994 (from $27,299,577). ** Estimated appropriation assumed in the GAA.S OURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 189PREVENT LOSS OF FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE BLOCK GRANT FUNDS the effect, if granted by the Secretary of the USHHS, of exempting the state from a reduction in the SAPT BlockGrant for fiscal year 2003. As provided by federal law, the secretary has 120 days to respond after the state makes the waiver request. Additionalinformation on the state's economic condition during fiscalyears 2002 and 2003 was transmitted with the waiverrequest. After additional interaction with staff fromTCADA and the HHSC, the secretary denied the waiverrequest, although the ruling is currently being appealed. To address the lower level of General Revenue Funds at TCADA for fiscal year 2004 as well as the uncertainty ofthe state's request for a waiver of the MOE requirement,HHSC sought a way to mitigate the potential reduction inSAPT Block Grant Funds. The proposed solution was tomove $5.0 million in General Re venue Funds from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2004 and to transfer $1.6 million inGeneral Revenue Funds to TCADA for fiscal year 2004.The HHSC proposal was adopted, and the resultingadjustments are shown in Figure 3.After the adoption of the changes in General Revenue Funds and the denial of the waiver, the only reduction inthe SAPT Block Grant would be related to fiscal year 2003. Although the MOE requirement did not change for fiscal year 2004, the General Revenue Funds available to be usedtoward the MOE requirement increased by $6.6 million infiscal year 2004, as indicated in Figure 4. The increase put the state in compliance with the fiscal year 2004 and 2005MOE requirements.

STATE SYNAR COMPLIANCE In addition to the MOE requirement for the SAPT Block Grant, a state m ust comply with the Synar Amendment. The Synar amendment, Section 1926 of the federal PublicHealth Service Act, was named after the late OklahomaSenator Mike Synar. The amendment requires states to passand enforce laws regarding the sale of tobacco products toindividuals under the age of 18. The Synar amendment requires the f ollowing of each state: \u008bEnforce such laws in a manner that can reasonably be expected to reduce the extent to which tobaccoproducts are available to individuals under the ageof 18; \u008bConduct annual random, unannounced inspectionsto ensure compliance with the law.

Pursuant to the federal Synar requirements, the Seventy- fifth Legislature, 1997, passed Senate Bill 55 (Health and Safety Code 161). Provisions of the senate bill becameeffective on September 1, 1997. TEXAS' COMPLIANCE EFFORTS Senate Bill 55, Seventy-fifth Legislature, 1997, was passed with provisions providing for compliance with federalrequirements. Pursuant to the Synar Amendment underSection 1.01, Subchapter H, Sec. 161.088(e), Health andSafety Code of Senate Bill 55, the Comptroller of PublicAccounts has primary responsibility for administration andenforcement of the state law and preparing informationrequired by section 1926 of the federal Public HealthService Act for submittal by the governor to the Secretaryof the United States Department of Health and HumanServices. The comptroller may enter into interagency contracts with other state agencies, and those agencies may assist thecomptroller in the administration and enforcement of thesubchapter. The comptroller has an interagency contractwith TCADA that outlines each agency's responsibility toensure compliance with the Synar amendment provisions. The TCADA entered into an interagency contract with Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State Univer-sity) to conduct the random unannounced inspections ofretailers selling tobacco products. The comptroller and theDepartment of Health (now the Department of StateSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 191PREVENT LOSS OF FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE BLOCK GRANT FUNDS Health Services) also have contracts with Texas State University for services (Figure 6). Additionally, under\u00a7161.088 the comptroller is directed to make block grants to counties and municipalities to be used by local lawenforcement agencies to enforce the law and shall rely, tothe fullest extent possible, on local law enforcement agencies to enforce the subchapter.FIGURE 5 TIMING OF INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.Conduct reasonable number of random, unannounced inspections 1995 1994 Conduct reasonable number of random, unannounced inspections 1995 1996 Conduct random, unannounced inspections using probability sample 1996 and all subsequent fiscal years1997 and all subsequent fiscal yearsSTATES WHOSE LEGISLATURE MET IN 1993 AND 1994: YEAR FOR IMPLEMENTING REQUIREMENT REQUIREMENTSTATES WHOSE LEGISLATURE DID NOT MEET IN BOTH 1993 AND 1994: YEAR FOR IMPLEMENTING REQUIREMENT FIGURE 6 TEXAS SYNAR INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONSHIPSFEDERAL FISCAL YEAR 2003 TCADATCADATCADATCADATCADA Single State Agency \u008bSynar Inspections \u008bSynar ReportComptroller of Public AccountsComptroller of Public AccountsComptroller of Public AccountsComptroller of Public AccountsComptroller of Public Accounts Texas Department of HealthTexas Department of HealthTexas Department of HealthTexas Department of HealthTexas Department of Health State Tobacco and Health Office \u008bTobacco Prevention and Control \u008bTobacco Awareness Classes Southwest Texas State University/CenterSouthwest Texas State University/CenterSouthwest Texas State University/CenterSouthwest Texas State University/CenterSouthwest Texas State University/Center for Safe Communities and Schoolsfor Safe Communities and Schoolsfor Safe Communities and Schoolsfor Safe Communities and Schoolsfor Safe Communities and SchoolsEnforcement of State Tobacco Access Laws \u008bConduct Synar Inspections \u008bTraining and Technical Assistance\u008bLaw Enforcement Grantees: 1.

Therecommended rider has been included in the introduced2006-07 General Appropriations Bill.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 192PREVENT LOSS OF FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE BLOCK GRANT FUNDSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 193REDUCE THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM Medicaid clients use the emergency room for conditions that could be treated in a primary care setting, such as adoctor's office or clinic. Treatment for these non-emergent conditions in the emergency room costs morethan if this care had been delivered in a primary caresetting. Redirecting clients with non-emergent conditionsfrom the emergency room to the primary care settingcould result in potential cost savings of $82.2 million peryear. In an effort to reduce Medicaid expenditures, theTexas Health and Human Services Commission shouldestablish a pilot program in one of the Primary Care CaseManagement service areas to test implementation ofquality initiatives designed to reduce non-emergent use ofthe emergency room. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bDuring a one-year period, there were 599,798emergency room visits in w hich non-disabled, low- income families, children, and pregnant Medicaidclients in Texas received treatment for non-emergent conditions. \u008bThe total direct cost of treating non-disabled, low-income families, children, and pregnant Medicaidclients with non-emergent conditions in the emer-gency room was $115.9 million during a one-yearperiod. If Medicaid clients who received non-emergent care in the emergency room had insteadbeen seen by their primary care provider, theestimated cost for treating these clients would havebeen $33.7 million. Thus, the potential cost savingsfrom redirecting clients with non-emergent condi-tions from the emergency room to the primary care setting is $82.2 million per year. \u008bMedicaid managed care has implemented strategiesto encourage appropriate utilization of Medicaidservices, including proper use of the emergencyroom. For example, all clients enrolled in managed care receive primary care and obtain referrals tospecialty care from their primary care provider. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bDespite managed care strategies, Medicaid clientscontinue to use the emergency room for non-emergent conditions.RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill authorizing the TexasHealth and Human Services Commission to spendup to $394,250 in General Revenue Funds and anamount of Federal Funds estimated to be $605,750to establish a pilot program in one of the PrimaryCare Case Management service areas to testimplementation of quality initiatives designed toreduce non-emergent use of the emergency room. \u008bRecommendation 2: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill requiring the TexasHealth and Human Services Commission to conducta study to test the effectiveness of a pilot programestablished to reduce non-emergent use of theemergency room and Medicaid costs and submit areport to the Legislative Budget Board and thegovernor by November 1, 2006. COMMENTS Medicaid, financed with both feder al and state funds, is a healthcare program for low-income families, the elderly,and persons with disabilities. Individuals who receiveTemporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) andSupplemental Security Income (SSI) are automaticallyeligible for Medicaid. Texas also provides Medicaidcoverage to the following optional eligible groups: pregnantwomen up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), infants up to 185 percent of the FPL, and childrenand pregnant women whose income exceeds Medicaideligibility limits, but who do not have the resources required to meet their medical expenses. This reportfocuses on services provided to non-disabled, low-incomefamilies, children, and pregnant Medicaid clients. Forpurposes of this report, these clients are referred to asTANF and TANF-related Medicaid clients. Texas Medicaid acute services have historically been delivered through a traditional fee-for-service modelthrough which providers recei ve a fee for services per- formed. House Bill 7 enacted by the Seventy-secondLegislature, 1991, created the first Medicaid managed-care pilot programs in Texas. Currently, Medicaid acute servicesare delivered through fee-for-service and two managed-careSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 194REDUCE THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM models: the fully capitated Health Maintenance Organiza- tion (HMO) model and the Primary Care Case Manage-ment (PCCM) model. While HMOs assume full financialrisk for enrollees, PCCM primar y care providers (PCPs) receive a $3 per member per month case management fee,and claims are paid on a fee-for-service basis. TANF andTANF-related clients participate in Medicaid managed careon a mandatory basis and SSI and SSI-related clients on avoluntary basis. Figure 1 shows the number of TANF andTANF-related clients ever enrolled in each of the Medicaiddelivery models during a one-year period. There is duplica-tion across the model types because clients may haveswitched model types during the time period. The Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, directed the Health and Human Services Commission(HHSC) to provide Medicaid services through the mostcost-effective model(s) of managed care. Upon completing an actuarial assessment of the cost-effectiveness andfeasibility of managed care expansion within the state'sMedicaid program, HHSC is scheduled to expand managed care to all areas of the state during the 2006-07 biennium. USE OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR NON-EMERGENT CONDITIONS Studies show that Medicaid enrollees have a higher rate of emergency room (ER) use than Americans with privateinsurance, the uninsured, and Medicare enrollees. In somecases, Medicaid clients use the ER for non-emergentconditions that could be treated in a primary care setting,such as a doctor's office or clinic. As shown in Figure 2,there were 599,798 ER visits in which TANF and TANF-related Texas Medicaid clients received treatment for non-emergent conditions during a one-year period (December1, 2002 through November 30, 2003).This report defines non-emergent conditions as those conditions that do not require treatment within 24 hours.The diagnostic codes used to indicate a non-emergentcondition were chosen based on a literature review and inconsultation with physicians at the University of Florida'sCollege of Medicine. The list of codes excludes diagnosesin which there were differences of opinion among physi-cians about whether the condition could possibly requiretreatment in less than 24 hours. A typical ER visit may result in physician fee(s), a hospital department fee, and billings for ancillary diagnostic services(e.g., x-rays and la boratory tests). As sh own in Figure 3, the total direct cost of non-emergent ER use for Texas TANFand TANF-related Medicaid clients was $115.9 millionduring a one-year period (December 1, 2002 throughNovember 30, 2003). This cost includes physician fees,hospital fees, and ancillary diagnostic services for non-emergent care in the ER. This cost does not includeprescriptions and return outpatient visits that may beassociated with the ER visit. POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM REDIRECTING CLIENTS WITH NON-EMERGENT CONDITIONS TO THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING Redirecting clients with non-emergent conditions from the emergency room to the primary care setting could result insignificant savings to the state. As shown in Figure 4, ifTANF and TANF-related Medicaid clients who receivednon-emergent care in the ER were diverted to their PCP ,the estimated cost for treating these clients in this settingwould have totaled $33.7 million during a one-year period(December 1, 2002 through Nov ember 30, 2003). This cost estimate includes a physician reimbursement fee and anaverage amount for ancillary diagnostic tests. Physicianreimbursement fees listed in the Texas Medicaid 2004Physician Fee Schedule range from $11.73 to $87.83depending on whether the client is new or established andthe level of the visit. The physician reimbursement fee used FIGURE 1 TANF AND TANF-RELATED CLIENTS BYMEDICAID DELIVERY MODEL (DECEMBER 2002 TO NOVEMBER 2003) MEDICAID DELIVERY MODELNUMBER OF TANF AND TANF-RELATED MEDICAID CLIENTS Fee-for-Service 2,487,751 478,850 Primary Care Case Management Managed Care: 1,086,166 Health Maintenance Organization SOURCE : Health and Human Services Commission.FIGURE 2 NON-EMERGENT USE OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM AMONG TANF AND TANF-RELATED MEDICAID CLIENTS(DECEMBER 2002 TO NOVEMBER 2003) Fee-For-Service 334,100 Managed Care: 103,279 Primary Care Case Management Managed Care: 162,419 Health Maintenance Organization TOTAL 599,798MEDICAID DELIVERY MODELNUMBER OF NON-EMERGENT ER VISITS SOURCE : Health and Human Services Commission.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 195REDUCE THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM for this estimate was $29.52\u2014the median cost for an outpatient visit provided to established patients and themost frequently paid procedure code for outpatientestablished office visits for PCC M and fee-for-service clients. As shown in Figure 4, the estimated potential cost savings from redirecting TANF and TANF-related Medicaid clientswith non-emergent conditions from the ER to their PCPcould total $82.2 million per year. The savings estimate wasdetermined by subtracting the cost of providing care toclients through PCP appointments from the total directcost of non-emergent ER use. If the cost of treatingclients with primary-care treatable urgent conditions (i.e.,treatment is required within 24 hours) in the ER wereincluded, the potential cost savings could be greater. METHODS TO DECREASE NON-EMERGENT USE OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM The primary strategy used to encourage appropriate utilization of Medicaid services is implementation ofmanaged care within the Medicaid program. Studies showthat Medicaid enrollees use the ER for non-emergent carefor various reasons. As shown in Figure 5, Medicaid managed care has implemented several strategies to reducenon-emergent use of the ER not used in the fee-for-servicedelivery model. Increasing access to after-hour appointments in the primary care setting has been identified as a method toreduce non-emergent use of the ER. Yet, access toroutine after-hour appointments in the primary caresetting remains limited across all Medicaid HMOs. Asshown in Figure 6, the percentage of PCPs in HMOs thatoffer routine after-hour appointments ranges from 37.9 percent. Similar data for fee-for-serviceand PCCM PCPs is not available. IMPLEMENT A QUALITY INITIATIVE PILOT PROJECT Despite efforts to encourage appropriate utilization of Medicaid services, Medicaid clients continue to use theemergency room for non-emergent conditions.

HHSC should implement a quality initiative that includes public awareness efforts aimed ateducating Medicaid clients about appropriate ER use and,at a minimum, one of the following strategies: \u008bProvide an additional per member per month quality enhancement fee to primary care providers and/oran administrative entity for the purposes of imple-menting quality initiatives to reduce non-emergentuse of the emergency room. \u008bProvide higher reimbursement to PCPs who extendtheir routine office hours to include evenings andweekends. \u008bContract with urgent care clinics to provide after-hour care. \u008bDevelop a case management program targeted toclients who use the ER for non-emergentconditions. \u008bImplement another option designed to reduce non-emergent ER use determined by HHSC. HHSC should implement the pilot program in a PCCM service area the agency determines is the most feasible. TheSoutheast Region managed care service area, comprised of Liberty, Hardin, Orange, Jefferson, and Chambers counties,STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 197REDUCE THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM is one potential option. The Southeast Region is the only area that currently operates only the PCCM managed-caremodel and is expected to continue to operate only thismodel during the 2006-07 biennium. The HMO deliverymodel was not recommended for the pilot programbecause HMOs assume full financial risk for their enrolleesand thus have an incentive to decrease non-emergent ERuse. The fee-for-service delivery model was not recom-mended for the pilot program because the managed-careexpansion will require all TANF and TANF-related clientscurrently in fee-for-service to enroll in PCCM or HMOdepending on their geographic location. HHSC will need todetermine if a Medicaid State Plan Amendment and/orfederal waiver is needed to implement Recommendation 1. The following rider could be included in the introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill to implementRecommendation 1 and Recommendation 2: Texas Health and Human Services Commission 57.

Out of funds appropriated above in Goal B, Medicaid, theHealth and Human Services Commission is autho-rized to spend up to $394,250 in General RevenueFunds and an amount of Federal Funds estimated tobe $605,750 for the biennium to establish a pilotprogram in one of the Primary Care Case Manage-ment service areas to test implementation of qualityinitiatives designed to reduce non-emergent use ofthe emergency room. The pilot program shallinclude public awareness efforts aimed at educatingMedicaid clients about appropriate use of theemergency room and, at a minimum, one of the following: higher reimbursement to primary careproviders who extend their routine office hours toinclude evenings and weekends; contracts withurgent care clinics to provide after-hour care; a casemanagement program tar geted to clients who use the emergency room for non-emergent conditions;an additional per member per month qualityenhancement fee to primary care providers and/oran administrative entity for the purposes of imple-menting quality initiatives to reduce non-emergentuse of the emergency room; or other optiondesigned to reduce non-emergent use of theemergency room determined by the Commission.The Commission shall submit a workplan bySeptember 1, 2005, to the Legislative Budget Boardand the Governor that details the quality initiative(s)to be implemented by the Commission. TheCommission shall conduct a study to test theeffectiveness of the pilot program at reducing non-emergent use of the emergency room and Medicaidcosts and submit a report to the Legislative Budget Board and the Governor by November 1, 2006. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations 1 and 2 would not impact the General Revenue Fund or the General Revenue-Dedicated Fund inthe 2006-07 biennium. Recommendation 1 directs HHSC to establish a pilot program in one of the PCCM serviceareas to test implementation of quality initiatives designedto reduce non-emergent ER use. This recommendationwould be implemented using up to $394,250 in existingGeneral Revenue Funds and an amount of Federal Fundsestimated to be $605,750 for the 2006-07 biennium. Theestimated FMAP for state fiscal year 2006 (i.e., 60.68) was used to estimate General Revenue Funds and FederalFunds for state fiscal year 2006, and the estimated FMAPfor state fiscal year 2007 (i.e., 60.47) was used for statefiscal year 2007. The estimated cost is based on thefollowing assumptions: \u008bThe amount expended is equivalent to $0.83 permember per month. \u008bThe pilot project is implemented in the SoutheastRegion managed care service area. \u008bThe number of TANF and TANF-related Medicaidclients enrolled in PCCM in the Southeast Region is50,096 (based on enrollment data from December2002 through November 2003). The cost to implement Recommendation 1 may be all or partially offset by potential cost savings from redirectingclients with non-emergent conditions from the ER totheir PCP . Recommendation 2 directs HHSC to conduct a study to test the effectiveness of the pilot program at reducingnon-emergent use of the ER and assess cost savings. It isestimated that this recommendation would have nosignificant fiscal impact because the evaluation of thepilot program could be conducted by HHSC usingexisting resources. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a rider authorizing HHSC to use appropriations toimplement a Medicaid quality initiative pilot project. Theintroduced bill does not include any other adjustments as aresult of these recommendations.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 198REDUCE THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAMSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 199USE LOCAL FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION Graduate Medical Education is a partnership between medical schools and teaching hospitals to train residentphysicians. The direct cost of Graduate Medical Educa-tion includes residents' stipends and benefits, salaries andbenefits of faculty who supervise residents, programadministrative staff, and facility overhead costs. Stateshave the option to support Graduate Medical Educationthrough their Medicaid programs and to receive matchingFederal Funds. Texas has chosen to pay a portion of direct Graduate Medical Education costs by making payments to teachinghospitals through the Medicaid program. Fourteen of the64 teaching hospitals that recei ve Medicaid payments for Graduate Medical Education are public hospitals funded inpart by local, county, or state tax dollars. In addition tofederal and state funds, these hospitals use other funds tocover Graduate Medical Educa tion costs. Federal law allows public hospitals to transfer allowable funds to thestate to be used as the non-federal share for the Medicaidprogram. Using allowable funds from public teachinghospitals as the non-federal share for Medicaid GraduateMedical Education would save $10.0 million per year inGeneral Revenue Funds and generate an additional $46.8 million per year in Federal Funds. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe Texas Medicaid program uses a formula todetermine the amount of Medicaid funds that canbe allocated to Graduate Medical Education. Thisamount, referred to as the Medicaid GraduateMedical Education cost, totaled $102.6 million instate fiscal year 2003 for 64 teaching hospitals. \u008bMedicaid Graduate Medical Education payments toteaching hospitals do not necessarily equal MedicaidGraduate Medical Education costs because pay-ments are restricted by available appropriations.Teaching hospitals receive a percentage of availableappropriations equal to their share of the totalMedicaid Graduate Medical Education cost. \u008bGraduate Medical Education funding in the2004-05 biennium was contingent on the receiptof excess unclaimed lottery proceeds. The comp-troller estimates that approximately $32.0 million inexcess unclaimed lottery proceeds will be availableto draw down federal Medicaid matching funds instate fiscal year 2005. This may result in a distribu- tion of approximately $81.8 million in state andfederal funds to all teaching hospitals in state fiscalyear 2005. \u008bTeaching hospitals use funds that are not dedicatedspecifically to Graduate Medical Education to cover Graduate Medical Education costs. A study from theTexas Higher Education Coordinating Boardestimates that 11 of the 14 public teaching hospitalsspent $275.8 million in non-Graduate MedicalEducation hospital funds in fiscal year 2003. Of thisamount, $99.3 million represents the portion ofdirect costs associated with hospitals' Medicaidpatient load. \u008bWith certain exceptions, federal law allows states touse intergovernmental transfers to obtain allowablefunds from public teaching hospitals for use as thenon-federal share for Medicaid Graduate MedicalEducation. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bPublic teaching hospitals use a significant amount ofhospital funds to support Graduate MedicalEducation that are currently not leveraged withfederal Medicaid matching funds. RECOMMENDATION \u008bAmend the \"Graduate Medical Education\" rider forthe Texas Health and Human Services Commissionin the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill toauthorize the agency to use intergovernmentaltransfers of allowable funds from public teachinghospitals as the non-federal share for the MedicaidGraduate Medical Education program. The ridershould require the agency to develop a payment methodology that allocates funds for MedicaidGraduate Medical Education to all public andprivate teaching hospitals, and mitigates negativefiscal impacts on contributing hospitals and otherstate funding. COMMENTS Graduate Medical Education (GME) is a combined effortamong medical schools, teaching hospitals, and sometimesprivate foundations, to tr ain resident physicians. TeachingSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 200USE LOCAL FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION hospitals and ambulatory clinics provide the patient care opportunities for resident training. The teaching portion ofthe residency program is usually directed by medical schoolfaculty or managed through a consortia arrangement oflocal practicing physicians who serve as faculty for specificresidency programs. Most residency programs in Texas are sponsored by medical schools (416 programs); however, a few programsare sponsored by f oundations or teaching hospitals (52 programs). In the context of a residency program, \"spon- sorship\" is a term rela ted to national accreditation and reflects who maintains the residency program's curricula.Residency programs ar e required to seek and maintain accreditation so their residents may qualify for state licensure and specialty board certification. Regardless of who \"sponsors\" a residency program, medical schools and teaching hospitals both incur GMEcosts. Medical schools and teaching hospitals enter intoagreements with each other that detail how costs will beshared. The details of the agreements vary depending onthe specific medical school and teaching hospital involved.However, in most cases, teaching hospitals compensateresidents while medical schools compensate facultyphysicians. Both types of entities have administrativeexpenses tied to GME. In general, funds are shifted between medical schools and teaching hospitals in order to pay for direct GME costs. A study conducted by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) in August 2004 estimated astatewide expenditure of $925.6 million for GME in fiscalyear 2003 supported by revenues from 25 teachinghospitals and eight medical schools. This figure includesrevenue sources dedicated specifically to GME and non- GME revenue sources, including the following: Medicare,Medicaid, state and local government funds, clinicalpractice plans, patient care revenues, local hospital districttaxes, hospital reserves, private grants, donations, andDisproportionate Share Hospital funds. The data reportedby the 25 teaching hospitals represent expenses related totraining nearly 70 percent of Texas' resident physicians. MEDICAID GME FINANCING Medicaid, financed with both feder al and state funds, is a healthcare program for low-income families, the elderly,and persons with disabilities. The federal governmentmatches each state's Medicaid spending at a set rate thatvaries by state. This rate is called the Federal MedicalAssistance Percentage, or FMAP. Each state's matching rateis determined by a formula set forth in federal law. TheFMAP for Texas is estimated to be 60.68 for state fiscal year 2006 and 60.47 for state fiscal year 2007.States have the option to support GME and to receive matching Federal Funds through the Medicaid program.Most states elect to provide some level of support forGME, primarily through Medicaid payments to teaching hospitals. Since 1986, Texas has chosen to support GMEunder its Medicaid program. The Texas Medicaid program uses a formula similar to Medicare to determine the amount of Medicaid funds thatcan be allocated to GME. The Medicaid GME formula isapplied to each hospital that reports GME expenses andincludes a fixed rate per resident, the number of residents,and the percent of Medicaid patient days excluding nurserydays (i.e., Medicaid patient load). The amount determinedby the formula, referred to as the Medicaid GME cost,totaled $102.6 million in state fiscal year 2003 for 64teaching hospitals. Medicaid GME payments to teaching hospitals do not necessarily equal Medicaid GME costs because paymentsare restricted by the amount of appropriations available tobe used as match. Teaching hospitals receive a percentageof available appropriations equal to their share of the totalMedicaid GME cost. As shown in Figure 1, funding theentire Medicaid cost in state fiscal year 2003 would haverequired a non-federal share of $41.0 million to draw down$61.6 million in federal Medicaid matching funds. Prior to the 2004-05 biennium, the Texas Legislature appropriated General Revenue Funds as the state match forMedicaid GME. However, GME funding in the 2004-05biennium was made contingent upon the receipt ofadditional unclaimed lottery proceeds in excess of whatwas estimated by the comptroller in the Biennial Revenue FIGURE 1 TOTAL MEDICAID GME COST FOR STATE FISCAL YEAR 2003 $41,057,302 $61,611,621 Non-Federal Share (39.99%) Federal Share (60.01%) SOURCE : Texas Health and Human Services Commission.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 201USE LOCAL FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION Estimate. According to the comptroller, $11.3 million in excess unclaimed lottery proceeds is available from statefiscal year 2004, but the Health and Human ServicesCommission (HHSC) has not expended these funds as ofNovember 2004. An estimated $20.7 million is expected tobe available for state fiscal year 2005. These combinedfunds (i.e., $32.0 million) may be used to draw down federalMedicaid matching funds and result in a distribution of$81.8 million in state and federal funds to all teachinghospitals in state fiscal year 2005. However, the Medicaid State Plan as of November 2004 caps Medicaid GME payments for state fiscal year 2005based on $20 million in excess unclaimed lottery proceeds.It is uncertain if HHSC will expend the additional $12million estimated to be available because this action wouldrequire an amendment to the Medicaid State Plan. IfHHSC does not amend the Medicaid State Plan, the $20million may be used to draw down federal Medicaidmatching funds and result in a distribution of $51 millionin state and federal funds to all teaching hospitals in statefiscal year 2005. USE OF LOCAL REVENUE TO FUND MEDICAID GME Teaching hospitals use funds to cover GME costs that are not dedicated specifically to GME (i.e., non-GME hospitalfunding sources). A study from THECB estimates that 11of the 14 public teaching hospitals spent $275.8 million innon-GME hospital funds to support GME in fiscal year2003. These funds may include the following types ofrevenue: \u008blocal district taxes; \u008bhospital reserves; \u008bpatient Share Hospital funds. Of the $275.8 million, Legislati ve Budget Board staff estimated that $99.3 million represents the portion of non-GME hospital funds used to fund GME that are associatedwith the hospitals' Medicaid patient load. This estimate wasdetermined by applying each hospital's Medicaid patientload to the amount of non-GME hospital funds reported by the hospital for fiscal year 2003. Federal law explicitly permits states to derive the non- federal share for Medicaid from public funds other thanstate general revenues. Furthermore, federal law allowsstates to accept intergovernmental transfers (IGTs)\u2014fundexchanges between different levels of government\u2014frompublic teaching hospitals funded in part by local, county,or state tax dollars. At least three states\u2014California,South Carolina, and Utah\u2014use IGTs to help pay forMedicaid GME. There are, however, restrictions on the types of funds that can be transferred from public hospitals and used as thenon-federal share. For example , certain types of provider taxes and donations cannot be used as the non-federalshare of Medicaid expenditures. As a result, some portionof the $99.3 million may include types of ineligiblerevenue. Recommendation 1 would direct HHSC to useIGTs of allowable funds from public teaching hospitals asthe non-federal share for the Medicaid GME program. Based on the 2003 Medicaid GME cost and the estimated FMAPs for 2006 and 2007, the maximum annual amountof funds the state could use to draw down federal matching funds is $40.3 million in 2006 and $40.5 million in 2007 asshown in Figure 2. Assuming that adequate amounts of allowable funds are available, public teaching hospitalscould transfer these amounts to the state as the non-federalshare for Medicaid GME. These funds would generate$62.2 million in 2006 and $62.0 million in 2007 in federalMedicaid matching funds. Assuming a distribution of $51.0million in state and federal funds to all teaching hospitals infiscal year 2005, this recommendation would result in a netgain of $11.2 million in GME payments in fiscal year 2006and $11.0 million in state fiscal year 2007. Increasing Medicaid GME payments to teaching hospitals may have an impact on a hospital's funding from otherprograms such as disproportionate share (DSH) and upperpayment limit funding streams. These concerns, however,relate to the potential for negative effect at the individualhospital level and not at the state level. For example,implementation of Recommendation 1 would not affect, in FIGURE 2 SUMMARY OF PROPOSED MEDICAID GME FUNDING: FISCAL YEARS 2006 AND 2007 Total Annual Medicaid GME Cost (est.) $102.6 million $102.6 million Hospital Funds Used as Non-Federal Share (est.) $40.3 million $40.5 millionFederal Funds Distributed to All Teaching Hospitals (est.) $62.2 million $62.0 millionAggregate Net Gain in GME Payments from 2005 (est.) $11.2 million $11.0 million SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.2006 2007STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 202USE LOCAL FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION the aggregate, the amount of available federal funding for Texas' DSH program because the state's allocation is afixed amount. HHSC should develop a payment methodol-ogy that allocates funds for Medicaid GME to all publicand private teaching hospitals, and mitigates negative fiscalimpacts on contributing hospitals and other state fundingprograms. HHSC may need to amend the Medicaid StatePlan to implement Recommendation 1. The following amended rider would implement the recommendation: Texas Health and Human Services Commission 48 31.

FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION The recommendation would result in a net General Revenue Fund savings of $20 million in the 2006-07biennium. The recommendation proposes using allowablefunds from public teaching hospitals as the non-federalshare for the Medicaid GME program. As shown in Figure3, this recommendation would result in a savings of $10million per year in General Revenue Funds. This probablesavings assumes $20 million in excess unclaimed lotteryproceeds available for Medicaid GME during the 2004-05biennium. The fiscal impact uses the Medicaid GME cost for state fiscal year 2003 (i.e., $102.6 million) as an estimate forannual Medicaid GME costs for state fiscal years 2006through 2010. The estimated FMAP for state fiscal year 2006 (i.e., 60.68) was used to estimate AppropriatedReceipts-Match for Medicaid and Federal Funds for statefiscal years 2006, and the estimated FMAP for state fiscalyear 2007 (i.e., 60.47) was used for state fiscal years 2007through 2010. Based on these assumptions, using allowablefunds from public teaching hospitals as the non-federalshare for the Medicaid GME prog ram in state fiscal years 2006 through 2010 would result in the following: \u008ba revenue gain to Appropriated Receipts-Match forMedicaid when allowable funds are transferred frompublic teaching hospitals to the state; \u008ba cost to Appropriated Receipts-Match for Medicaidwhen Medicaid GME payments are distributed toteaching hospitals; \u008ba revenue gain to Federal Funds when the trans-ferred funds from public teaching hospitals are usedto draw down additional Federal Funds; and \u008ba cost to Federal Funds when Medicaid GMEpayments are distributed to teaching hospitals.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 203USE LOCAL FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a rider authorizing HHSC to use up to $80.9million in Appropriated R eceipts-Match for Medicaid and an amount of Federal Funds estimated to be $124.4 millionfor Medicaid GME. Removing this rider would eliminateappropriations for Medicaid GME.FIGURE 3 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT OF USING LOCAL FUNDS FOR RECEIPTS-MATCH FOR MEDICAIDPROBABLE REVENUE GAIN/(LOSS) SAVINGS/ (COST) TO APPROPRIATED RECEIPTS-MATCH FOR MEDICAIDPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 204USE LOCAL FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATIONSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 205USE SYSTEM BENEFIT FUND REVENUE AS STATE MATCH FOR MEDICAID The Seventy-sixth Legislature, 1999, created the System Benefit Fund to provide a discount on electric bills to low-income customers in deregulated electric-market areas.Through this program, beneficiaries of Medicaid and foodstamps in deregulated electric-mar ket areas automatically receive a credit on their utility bills. In fiscal year 2004, this credit averaged $13.16 per month per customer. Unlike most state expenditures for assistance to low- income individuals, expenditures from the System BenefitFund are not used as match for Federal Funds. The PublicUtility Commission projects a System Benefit Fund balanceof $117.1 million at the end of fiscal year 2005. Thisbalance is expected to increase to $268.1 million by the endof the 2006-07 biennium. By appropriating part or all ofthe System Benefit Fund for the Medicaid program, thestate could draw up to $616.2 million in additional Federal Funds for the 2006-07 biennium or replace up to $400.5million in General Revenue Funds that could be used foranother purpose. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bAnnual expenditures for discounts to low-incomeelectric customers declined from $149.7 million infiscal year 2003 to $60.3 million budgeted for fiscalyear 2005. \u008bDuring fiscal year 2004, the number of low-income customers receiving discounts declinedfrom 792,954 in September 2003 to 302,140 inAugust 2004. \u008bIn April 2004, 58.2 percent of low-income electriccustomers received medical benefits paid byMedicaid. \u008bThe Medicaid program grew from $7.0 billion (AllFunds) in fiscal year 1994 to $15.0 billion in fiscalyear 2003. The average monthly cost of providingMedicaid services (not including prescription drugsor long-term care) rose 31.5 percent from fiscal year1999 to fiscal year 2003. Medicaid caseloads grewfrom 1.8 million in fiscal year 1999 to 2.5 million infiscal year 2003. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bMost state expenditures for assistance programs forlow-income clients are leveraged with Federal Funds.System Benefit Fund expenditures for discounts to low-income electric customers are an exception.Redirecting these funds to the Medicaid programcould generate Federal Funds or free up GeneralRevenue Funds to be available for other purposes. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Consider amending Section 39.903(e) of the Utilities Code to designate medicalassistance for low-income individuals as the firstpriority use of the System Benefit Fund, whichcould replace General Revenue Funds or be used toexpand Medicaid benefits, generating additionalFederal Funds. \u008bRecommendation 2: Consider appropriating $254.1 million from the System Benefit Fundprojected balance for Medicaid programs in the2006-07 General Appropriations Bill, which couldreplace General Revenue Funds or be used toexpand Medicaid benefits, generating additionalFederal Funds. COMMENTS The Seventy-sixth Legislature, 1999, passed Senate Bill 7,which deregulated the electric market in many areas ofTexas and created the System Benefit Fund (SBF). Togenerate revenue for the SBF, Senate Bill 7 directed thePublic Utility Commission (PUC) to set a nonbypassablecollection fee at a rate up to 65 cents per megawatt hour onall customers of retail electric providers, excluding electriccustomers of municipally owned utilities and electriccooperatives. House Bill 3318 and House Bill 3378,Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, modifiedthe SBF from a trust fund in the state treasury to a GeneralRevenue-Dedicated account exempt from post-certification excess balance reduction. This allows the SBFto carry its ending balance forward into the next biennium. Under current state law, the SBF may be used for discounts to low-income electric customers, customer educationprograms, administrative expenses, energy efficiencyprograms targeted to low-income customers, and losses tothe Foundation School Fund attributable to electricrestructuring. In the 2004-05 biennium, SBF was appropri-ated to cover only the low-income electric customerdiscount, customer education programs, and administrativeSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 206USE SYSTEM BENEFIT FUND REVENUE AS STATE MATCH FOR MEDICAID costs. The discount rate tha t low-income customers receive can range from 10 percent to 20 percent. The discount isavailable in deregulated areas, which according to theSunset Advisory Commission's Staff Report on the Public Utility Commission (April 2004) account for 85 percent of demand for electricity in the state. Through this program,beneficiaries of Medicaid and food stamps in deregulatedelectric markets automatically r eceive a credit on their utility bill. The average monthly benefit for SBF recipientsin fiscal year 2004 was $13.16. ELIGIBILITY FOR UTILITY ASSISTANCE Eligible low-income electric customers are those whose income is not more than 125 percent of the FederalPoverty Level (FPL) or those who receive food stamps orMedicaid benefits. In calendar year 2004, 125 percent ofthe FPL equates to an annual income of $19,075 for afamily of three. Low-income electric customers areautomatically enrolled in the program if they are Medicaidor food stamp clients, but they may self-enroll in the program if they are not Medicaid or food stamp recipientsbut fall within 125 percent of FPL. Figure 1 compares thevarious income limits for the low-income discount. The low-income discount administrator, LIDA, which is a third-party vendor, identifies automatic enrollees through tape matches using data from the Health and HumanServices Commission and retail electric providers. LIDAfurther certifies eligibility of self-enrollees. Figure 2 revealsthat in April 2004, 35.3 percent of eligible low-income electric customers were food stamp-only clients, 49.8percent were Medicaid clients, and 8.4 percent were low-income Medicare clients whose out-of-pocket costs foraccessing Medicare benefits are paid by the Medicaidprogram. The remaining 6.5 percent were self-enrolled.Medicaid paid medical benefits for 58.2 percent of low-income electric customers at that time. STATUS OF THE SYSTEM BENEFIT FUND Figure 3 illustrates that the SBF balance is projected to increase to $117.1 million by the end of the 2004-05biennium and climb to $268.1 million by the end of the2006-07 biennium. Disbursements from the SBF for utilitydiscounts have decreased from $149.7 million in fiscal year 2003 to $60.3 million budgeted for fiscal year 2005. There are a number of factors contributing to this decline in disbursements: \u008bIn September 2003, PUC decreased the low-incomediscount rate from 17 percent to 10 percent to avoidexceeding its appropriation. \u008bPrior to fiscal year 2004, the LIDA established client eligibility annually, but now verifies enrollment inMedicaid and food stamps on a monthly basis. \u008bClients who apply for enrollment in the discountprogram based on having income under 125 percentof the FPL must now provide documentation of FIGURE 1 INCOME LIMITS FOR UTILITY ASSISTANCE FISCAL YEAR 2004 SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.125%130% 133% InfantsMedicaid Medically NeedyMedicaid TANFMedicaid SSI Aged & DisabledMedicaid Nursing Homes & WaiversFederal Poverty LevelSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 207USE SYSTEM BENEFIT FUND REVENUE AS STATE MATCH FOR MEDICAID income (rather than simply declaring it), and clients remain eligible for seven months. \u008bIn April 2004, the PUC began enforcing thedefinition of \"customer\" by limiting it to the personin whose name the electric service is billed. Prior tothis time, if any member of a family were a Medic-aid or food stamp recipient, the household receiveda discount. Because there are a significant number of children who are eligible for Medicaid but whoseparents are not, the number of clients receiving thediscount declined further. As the result of these changing conditions and require- ments, Figure 4 shows that over the course of fiscal year2004, the number of customers receiving the discountdeclined from 792,954 in September 2003 to 302,140 inAugust 2004. DEMAND FOR MEDICAID SERVICES As Figure 5 illustrates, over the last decade the budget for Texas' Medicaid program grew from $7 billion in All Fundsin fiscal year 1994 to $15 billion in fiscal year 2003. Thestate share of these costs fluc tuates slightly each year, but in fiscal year 2003 the match rate was 40 percent. Medicaid is an entitlement program, meaning that the state mustprovide medical services to all eligible clients. Figure 6 demonstrates that despite a number of cost control strategies implemented during the last few years,the average monthly cost of providing Medicaid services(not including prescription drugs or long-term care) rosefrom $161.07 in fiscal year 1999 to $192.59 in fiscal year2003. This is a 31.5 percent increase. In addition, prescription drug expenditures for the Medic- aid program increased from $0.9 billion in fiscal year 1999FIGURE 2 ELIGIBILITY CATEGORY OF CUSTOMERS RECEIVING UTILITY DISCOUNTAPRIL 2004 SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.Low-Income Medicare 8.4%Self-enrolled 6.5%Food Stamps Only 35.3% Medicaid 49.8% FIGURE 3 GROWTH OF THE SYSTEM BENEFIT FUND, FISCAL YEARS 2003 TO 2007 SOURCE : Public 2005 Requested 2006 Requested 2007 Receipts Disbursements BalanceIn MillionsSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 208USE SYSTEM BENEFIT FUND REVENUE AS STATE MATCH FOR MEDICAID 302,140 299,009 CUSTOMERS RECEIVING UTILITY DISCOUNT FISCAL YEAR 2004 SOURCE : Public Utility Commission.

Unmatched by federal spending, the SBF buys onlyone dollar of benefit for each dollar spent. If the SBF wereallocated to the Medicaid program, Texas would realize$2.50 in benefits for each dollar spent. However, to realize a gain in Federal Funds, the SBF expenditures would needto be allocated for Medicaid services outside of ongoingMedicaid costs. Recommendation 1 would amend Section 39.903(e), Utilities Code to designate medical assistance for low-income individuals as the first priority in the list ofpurposes for the SBF. Recommendation 1 would furtherappropriate all funding currently designated for the low-income electric customer discount to Medicaid programs.The PUC projects $154.1 million in expenditures from theSBF in biennium, of which $146.4 million isintended for low-income discount program. Theremaining $7.7 million is for PUC administration, Office ofPublic Utility Counsel administration, and customereducation. This recommendation would use the $146.4million to fund medical assistance to low-income individu-als and would continue to fund the remaining $7.7 millionas currently requested. To fund customer education andadministrative and other expenses but not the low-incomediscount program, these expenses would need to be thesecond priority use in the statutory list of SBF purposes. Recommendation 2 would a ppropriate the remaining fund balance in the SBF for Medicaid services. The SBF couldbe used to replace $254.1 million in General RevenueFunds as a match for Medicaid or to expand Medicaidbenefits.

Recommendations 1 and 2 together would appropriate all SBF fees, less those for customer education and adminis-trative and other expenses, to medical assistance for low-income individuals. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS In the 2006-07 biennium, Recommendation 1 would either result in net savings of $146.4 million in General RevenueFunds if used as a match for Medicaid or generate a netrevenue gain of $224.8 million in Federal Funds if used toexpand Medicaid benefits. Recommendation 2 would eitherresult in net savings of $254.1 million in General RevenueFunds if used as a match for Medicaid or generate a netrevenue gain of $391.3 million in Federal Funds if used toexpand Medicaid benefits. Figure 8 shows the additional Federal Funds that would result from implementing Recommendation 1 by fundingMedicaid services outside of ongoing Medicaid costs. Thiswould generate $224.8 million in Federal Funds in the2006-07 biennium. Figure 9 shows the impact of implementing Recommenda- tion 2 by using General Revenue-Dedicated Funds forMedicaid services outside of ongoing Medicaid costs,which would generate an additional $391.3 million inFederal Funds in the 2006-07 biennium. In Figure 9, fiscal year 2006 would start with the higher balance remainingfrom fiscal years 2004-05, but subsequent years would relyon the projected balance for each year. As Figure 10 shows, if Recommendations 1 and 2 together were used for expanding Medicaid benefits, the appropria- tion of this funding would generate $616.1 million inFederal Funds for the 2006-07 biennium. If the legislaturewere to instead replace General Revenue Funds, the savingsto General Revenue Funds would be $400.5 million in the2006-07 biennium. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill doesnot reflect any adjustments as a result of these recommen-dations. Recommendation 1 w ould require a statutory change to use the revenue appropriated to the low-incomediscount from the System Benefit Fund to expand Medic-aid benefits or to replace General Revenue Funds. Thisappropriation in the introduced 2006-07 General Appro-priations Bill is $146.4 million. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not include any appropriation of remaining System BenefitFunds. Recommendation 2 suggests using this balanceeither to replace General Revenue Funds or to expandMedicaid benefits. As with Recommendation 1, theseactions would require a change in current law.FIGURE 9 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT TO ALL FUNDS, RECOMMENDATI0N GENERAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSFISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.

Appr oximately 96 percent of the deposits to this account support a portion of the uncompen-sated trauma care provided by eligible state trauma facilities. Payments sent to eligible state trauma facilities for uncom-pensated trauma care are curr ently allocated in a manner that does not draw down Federal Funds. By accessing Federal Funds through the recommendations described below, payments to hospitals for uncompensatedtrauma care could be increased by $20.9 million, whilepotentially saving the state $138.1 million in GeneralRevenue Funds in the 2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bBecause Designated Trauma Facility and EmergencyMedical Services Account funds are not leveraged todraw down Federal Funds, Texas is missing anopportunity to increase overall payments to hospitalsfor uncompensated trauma care and save GeneralRevenue Funds. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend Chapter 780, Health and Safety Code, to divide the trauma facilityportion of the Designated Trauma Facility andEmergency Medical Services Account into threesub-allocations: a portion to the Department ofState Health Services for payments to hospitals foruncompensated trauma care; a portion to the Healthand Human Services Commission to be used as statematch in Medicaid payments to hospitals foruncompensated trauma care; and a portion to theGeneral Revenue Fund. \u008bRecommendation 2: Direct the Health and Human Services Commission to develop a methodology forpayments to hospitals for uncompensated traumacare so as to mitigate negative fiscal impacts onother state funding, and to ensure these traumafunds are distributed in a manner consistent with thepurposes of the Designated Trauma Facility andEmergency Medical Services Account.COMMENTS As of October 2003, there were 460 acute-care hospitals inTexas. Sixty-four percent of these were located in metro-politan areas, accounting for 84 percent of the 57,000acute-care beds in the state. Medicaid payments to Texashospitals totaled $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2002. The Seventy-first Legislature, 1989, enacted House Bill 18 directing what is now the Department of State HealthServices (DSHS) to develop and implement a statewideemergency services and trauma-care system, designate trauma facilities, and develop a statewide trauma registry.The Texas Board of Health (board) later adopted rules forthe implementation of that system. In doing so, the statewas divided into 22 trauma service areas (TSAs). Theboard's action also provided for the formation of a regionaladvisory council (RAC) for each TSA. RACs are voluntaryentities composed of representatives from hospitals,emergency medical services (EMS) providers, and thegeneral public. Each RAC is responsible for the develop- ment and implementation of a regional trauma plan including injury prevention, communications, pre-hospitaland facility triage criteria, amb ulance and patient diversion policies, and planning for trauma facility designation andthe identification of the lead trauma facility for each TSA. Texas' statewide trauma system is administered by the Bureau of Emergency Management (BEM) at DSHS. Thedesignation of a trauma facility is governed by DSHS rules.The BEM recommends designating a facility as a traumacenter to the commissioner of health based on certaincriteria. Varying levels of designation are based on facilitiesbeing able to provide a certain level of care and their rolein serving the needs of their TSAs. Figure 1 summarizeskey characteristics of each trauma facility designation leveland the number of facilities in Texas at each level, as of September 1, 2003. DESIGNATED TRAUMA FACILITY AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ACCOUNT The Designated Trauma Facility and Emergency Medical Services Account (designated trauma account) wasestablished by House Bill 3588, Seventy-eighth Legisla-ture, Regular Session, 2003, to provide funding for designated trauma facilities, county and regional emer-gency medical services, and trauma-care systems.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 212USE TRAUMA FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS Funds deposited to the designated trauma account come from two revenue sources: the driver responsibilityprogram (DRP), which pr ovides for surcharge assessments for certain or habitual traffic violation convictions; and a$30 state traffic fine relating to traffic offense convictions. Of the funds collected, 49.5 percent of DRP and approxi-mately one-third of $30 state traffic fines are depositedinto the designated trauma account. Figures 2 and 3illustrate deposits made to the designated trauma account. The Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, appropriated $108 million for use during fiscal year 2004 and $161.3 millionfor fiscal year 2005 to DSHS from the designated traumaaccount based on estimates of revenue generated by DRPand $30 state traffic fines. However, due to initial delays incollecting revenues, actual deposits to the designatedtrauma account in fiscal year 2004 totaled only $19.3million, of which $18.2 million was allocated to hospitals inthe first distribution in August 2004. Because both DRP and state traff ic fines are generated from violations and convictions, the rate of collection andresulting available revenue can vary from the estimate ofpotential revenue. Collection rates have a direct impact onthe amount of funds available for appropriation and on theestimate of the fiscal impact of the recommendation. The estimates of designated trauma account deposits shown inFigure 4 are based on a collection rate of 65 percent for$30 state traffic fines and DPS's estimated collection rate of 66 percent for DRP .FIGURE 3 $30 STATE TRAFFIC FINE REVENUE 67 % 33 %5 % 95 % Collecting Entity Administration Other Accounts Designated Trauma Account SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.FIGURE 2 DRIVER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM REVENUE 1 % 49.5 %49.5 % DPS Administration Other Accounts Designated Trauma Account SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.FIGURE 1 TRAUMA FACILITY DESIGNATION LEVELS Basic (level IV) trauma centers provide resuscitation and stabilization and arrange for the transfer of trauma victims to a higher-level trauma facility when medicallynecessary.130 General (level III) trauma centers provide resuscitation, stabilization, and assessment of injury and either treatthe trauma victim or arrange for appropriate transfer to a higher level trauma facility. Level III centers can also serve as the lead trauma facility for a particular TSA.37 Major (level II) trauma centers may provide trauma care for any patient with major trauma injuries but refer to level I centers for certain trauma procedures. Level IIcenters must actively participate on the appropriate RAC and submit data to the state trauma registry.9 Comprehensive (level I) trauma centers provide complete trauma care for every aspect of even the most severe injuries, take the lead in developing prevention strategies, provide educational programs for traumacare providers and the general public, conduct trauma research, and include a teaching facility.

Provisions relating to the collection of $30state traffic fines also expire at that time. While theprovisions in current statute relating to DRP do notexpire, the portion of DRP funds allocated to thedesignated trauma account would not continue because ofthe expiration of Chapter 780. Without amendment ofthese provisions, new revenues collected for deposit tothe designated trauma account will not be available forthe 2008-09 biennium. Figure 4 summarizes the estimatedfunds that would be deposited to the designated traumaaccount under current provisions. CURRENT DISTRIBUTION OF DESIGNATED TRAUMA ACCOUNT FUNDS Current statute distributes the funds deposited to the designated trauma account as follows: an initial $500,000 isset aside for an extraordinary emergency reserve; of theremaining funds, 96 percent is allocated to fund a portionof the uncompensated trauma care provided by designatedtrauma facilities and those hospitals actively pursuingtrauma designation; 2 percent goes to EMS providers; 1percent goes to RACs in the trauma system; and 1 percentis allocated for administrative costs at DSHS. Following the creation of the designated trauma account, DSHS worked with stakeholders to develop administrative rules and policies for the use of account funds. The boardadopted final rules governing the designated traumaaccount on July 1, 2004. Major provisions of the rulesgoverning allocation include the following: \u008bdefinition of uncompensated trauma care and themethodology for determining associated costs; \u008bcalculation of shares of available funds allocated tohospitals;\u008b15 percent shared equally among all eligible applicants up to $50,000 each; \u008b85 percent based on a pro-rata share of total uncompensated trauma care reported by eligiblehospitals; \u008bprovisions for the return of funds if a hospital doesnot maintain designation; \u008bsupport of the development of physician incentiveplans by hospitals; and \u008bspecification of the distribution methodology forthe remaining allocations. Figure 5 illustrates the current distribution from the designated trauma account. In addition to the 188 designated trauma facilities, House Bill 3588 provided eligibility for designated traumaaccount funding to certain hospitals in active pursuit oftrauma designation (actively seeking designation, or ASD).Under this provision, an additional 71 hospitals wereeligible to apply for designated trauma account funds. InJuly 2003, 234 trauma facilities applied and were eligiblefor funding from the designated trauma account. Accord-ing to DSHS, the total cost of the uncompensated traumacare provided in calendar year 2003 by the 234 facilitieswas approximately $222 million. Figure 6 provides abreakdown of the cost of uncompensated trauma careprovided by each designated trauma level and the numberof facilities at each level. Among the funds initially distributed, level I and II designated trauma facilities experienced 73 percent of theuncompensated trauma care costs and received 69 percentof the hospital allocation; level III and IV designatedtrauma facilities experienced 23 percent of the costs andreceived 26 percent of the hospital allocation; and ASD facilities experienced 4 percent of the costs and received 6 percent of the hospital allocation. According to DSHS figures , Parkland Health and Hospital System experienced the highest uncompensated trauma-care cost at approximately $30.4 million or 13.7 percent ofthe total uncompensated trauma-care costs reported.Parkland received a designated trauma account payment ofapproximately $2.3 million. One facility, DeTar Hospital North, reported no uncompensated trauma-care costs andreceived a designated trauma account payment of approxi- mately $11,687, the minimum allocation to any facility thatapplied and was found to be eligible for funds. LEVERAGE FUNDS THROUGH MEDICAID PAYMENTS In the 2004-05 biennium, funds in the designated trauma account were appropriated to DSHS to make payments asFIGURE 4 ESTIMATE OF FUNDS TO BE DEPOSITED TO THEDESIGNATED TRAUMA ACCOUNT 2006 FROM STATE TRAFFIC FINESPROJECTED TOTAL DEPOSITS AVAILABLE FISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 214USE TRAUMA FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS directed by statute. These funds were not leveraged to draw down Federal Funds. If a portion of those funds werechanneled through the Medicaid program, a jointly fundedstate-federal program administered by the Health andHuman Services Commission (HHSC), the designatedtrauma account funds could count as state match and drawdown a federal matching share. The federal share isdetermined by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage(FMAP). The projected FMAP for state fiscal year 2006 is 39.32 percent state share and 60.68 percent federal share.In dollar terms, for every $1 the state spends, the federalmatching share is $1.54. Leveraging state funds to draw down Federal Funds provides an opportunity to reducedependence on General Revenue Funds and to increase funding for uncompensated trauma care. Recommendation 1 would require a portion of designated trauma account funds to be directed to hospitals throughMedicaid payments. Figure 7 outlines the hospital paymentmethodology used in Texas. Recommendation 1 would amend Chapter 780, Health and Safety Code, to channel a por tion of the designated trauma account funds through the Texas Medicaid programadministered by HHSC. This new allocation could then beused as state match so that those funds are leveraged toFIGURE 6 UNCOMPENSATED TRAUMA CARE BY LEVEL OFDESIGNATION, CALENDAR YEAR 2003$222 MILLION SOURCES : Legislative Budget Board; Department of State Health Services.FIGURE 7MEDICAID PAYMENT METHODOLOGYTO TEXAS HOSPITALS Texas reimburses hospitals for inpatient hospital services provided to persons covered by Medicaid using a prospective payment system. A prospective payment system sets payments for hospital inpatient services based on a patient's diagnosis prior to the provision of services.Calculation of hospital payments are derived from three basic elements: the diagnosis related group (DRG), the DRG relative weight, and the standard dollar amount (SDA). \u008bThe DRG system consists of the codes hospitals must use to identify the diagnosis of a patient for billing purposes. \u008bAfter assigning a DRG, a relative weight for the particular DRG is derived by dividing the average of all paid claims for a given DRG by the average of payments for all DRGs. \u008bThe SDA is a factor that approximates the hospital's standardized average cost of treating a Medicaid inpatient admission based on audited cost reports and paid claims data. Components of the SDA include a measure of the severity of patients served by a hospitaland the strain on hospital resources caused by those patients.

Implementing Recommendation 1 would also require a state plan amendment and amend-ment of the Texas Administrative Code. This strategy would require HHSC to adjust the formula used to calculate hospital payments to direct the designatedtrauma account funds toward uncompensated trauma careprovided by hospitals. For example, the hospital-specificSDA could be amended to incorporate a weighted factorfor the amount of uncompensated trauma care provided bya facility. Recommendation 2 would direct HHSC tomitigate negative fiscal impacts on other state funding thatcould result from the reallocation of designated traumaaccount funds, and to ensure funds are distributed in amanner consistent with the purposes of the designatedtrauma account funds. For the purpose of estimating the potential fiscal impact of Recommendation 1, the follo wing allocation of funds is assumed: 30 percent of the trauma facility portion wouldcontinue to be allocated directly to eligible hospitalsthrough DSHS, equally or in proportion to the amount ofuncompensated trauma care provided by each facility; 30 percent would be allocated to HHSC for use as state match in Medicaid payments to hospitals; and the remaining 40percent would be directed to the General Revenue Fund.Figure 8 illustrates this distribution. According to the methodology described above, in the 2006-07 biennium 30 percent or $103.5 million indesignated trauma account funds would be allocated toDSHS. Thirty percent would be allocated to HHSC to beused as state match to draw down Federal Funds. TheHHSC allocation would result in payments to hospitals inthe amount of $262.5 million in All Funds, made up of$103.5 million in designated trauma account funds and$159.0 million in Federal Funds. The remaining 40percent or $138.1 million would be directed to theGeneral Revenue Fund.Based on the example, leveraging a portion of designated trauma account funds through Medicaid payments wouldresult in an increase in payments to hospitals for uncom-pensated trauma care in the amount of $20.9 million inthe 2006-07 biennium compared to the unleveragedallocations in current law, while at the same time savingthe state $138.1 million in General Revenue Funds. Theincrease in hospital payments for uncompensated traumacare corresponds to the difference between the gain inFederal Funds and savings in General Revenue Funds.Figure 9 illustrates this example distribution of thetrauma facility allocation. If Recommendation 1 were to be implemented, desig- nated trauma account funds could be appropriated toHHSC and DSHS via the following contingency rideradded to the Special Provisions Relating to all Health andHuman Services Agencies in the 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill: Sec.

In accordance with Chapter 780,Health and Safety Code, these funds shall be usedin state Medicaid reimbursement rates to fund aportion of uncompensated trauma care providedby certain facilities. HHSC and DSHS have considered several methods of allocation from the designated trauma account that woulddraw down Feder al Funds including:\u008ballocating designated trauma account funds to designated teaching hospitals through Medicaidgraduate medical education; \u008ballocating designated trauma account funds toenhance the payments for certain Medicaid codesthat pay for trauma services; \u008ballocating designated trauma account funds toenhance Medicaid payments to disproportionateshare hospitals (DSH) for trauma services; and \u008ballocating designated trauma account funds to use asstate match for a trauma upper payment limit. HHSC and DSHS report two primary issues relating to implementing a leveraging strategy. First, strategiesconsidered might change the amounts individual hospitalsreceive from the designated trauma account, particularly if the strategy is based on the proportion of Medicaid clientsserved by a facility. If a hospital has a low percentage ofMedicaid clients, an adjustment to its Medicaid rate maynot cover its uncompensated trauma care costs. Therefore,these facilities are more likely to benefit from an allocation to DSHS, which is maintained in Recommendation 1.Facilities with a high percentage of Medicaid clients aremore likely to benefit from an allocation to HHSC. Second, new funding allocations ma y have an impact on a facility's funding from other programs such as DSH andupper payment limit funding streams and may impact thenet distribution of those funds as well. Both of these issues, however, relate to the potential for negative impact at the individual facility level and not atthe state level. For example, implementation of therecommendations would not impact, in the aggregate, theamount of available federal funding for Texas' DSHprogram because the state's allocation is a fixed amount.Uninsured costs at DSH hospitals, which totaled approxi-mately $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2002, far exceed amountsreimbursed by Medicaid. While leveraging strategies may reduce state funds provided to some hospitals, leveraging designated trauma accountFIGURE 9 EXAMPLE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS LEVERAGED THROUGH MEDICAID PAYMENTS FEDERAL FUNDS EXPENDEDGENERAL REVENUE ALLOCATION 40% SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 217USE TRAUMA FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS funds through Medicaid provides an opportunity to increase overall payments to hospitals and to save stateGeneral Revenue Funds. Recommendation 2 would directHHSC to mitigate negative fiscal impacts on other statefunding programs that could r esult from the reallocation of the trauma funds and to ensure that designated traumaaccount funds are distributed in a manner consistent withthe goals of the designated trauma account. Ultimately, theextent of the fiscal impact on facilities is dependent on thepercent of funds in each allocation and on the methodol-ogy used to implement the HHSC allocation. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations 1 and 2 would result in a net gain of $138.1 million in General Revenue Funds in the 2006-07biennium. As described above and illustrated in Figure 9, leveraging a portion of designated trauma account fundsthrough Medicaid payments would result in an increase inpayments to hospitals for uncompensated trauma care inthe amount of $20.9 million in the 2006-07 biennium.Figure 10 summarizes the fiscal impact of Recommenda-tion 1 in relation to the unleveraged allocations in currentlaw. It is assumed that Recommendation 2 could beachieved using current staff resources and would notresult in additional cost. FIGURE 10 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL GENERAL REVENUE- DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) DEDICATED FUNDSPROBABLE GAIN/(LOSS) TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDSFISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a recommended appropriation of $63.6 million indesignated trauma account funds to DSHS for the bien-nium. Based on current estimates of revenue, which exceedthe amounts recommended for a ppropriation above, implementation of Recommendations 1 and 2 wouldincrease the designated trauma account funds directed toDSHS by approximately $55.3 million, for a total of $118.9million for the 2006-07 biennium. The recommendationswould also direct new allocations in the amount of $262.5million in All Funds to HHSC and $138.1 million indesignated trauma account funds to the General RevenueFund for the 2006-07 biennium. As noted previously, the estimates of revenue deposited to the designated trauma account (as shown in Figure 4) arebased on estimated collection rates for both the $30 statetraffic fines and DRP. Estimates of revenue deposited tothe designated trauma account in the Comptroller ofPublic Accounts' Biennial Revenue Estimate (BRE),published January 10, 2005, differ from those used in thisreport. In the BRE, the estimate of revenue deposited tothe designated trauma account is $139.8 million for the2006-07 biennium, approximately 61 percent or $221million less than the estimate of revenue used in thisreport.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 218USE TRAUMA FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 219ALIGN ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAM FUNDING WITH THE PROGRAM'S STATED GOAL Initiated in 1993 by the Seventy-third Legislature to recognize and reward students, teachers, and schools that demonstrate success in achieving the state's educationalgoals, the Texas Advanced Placement/InternationalBaccalaureate (AP/IB) Incentive Program provides fundingthat lowers the cost of student AP and IB examinations,provides teacher training and equipment grants, andrewards secondary school campuses based on studentperformance on AP/IB examinations. A provision in the2004-05 General Appropriations Act states that the goal ofthe AP/IB incentive program is to make such coursesavailable on as many campuses as possible. However, oneof the incentives, campus awards, tends to be granted tothe same campuses each year. This incentive only serves torecognize the same level of achievement each year anddoes not encourage the expansion of advanced placementprograms to new campuses or school districts. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bCampus incentive awards represent an unnecessaryallocation of Advanced Placement Incentive awardfunding because the same campuses tend to receiveincentive awards each year from the Texas Educa-tion Agency. RECOMMENDATION \u008bReduce funding for Advanced Placement/Interna-tional Baccalaureate incentive awards by $6.8 millionin General Revenue Funds. COMMENTS High schools, colleges, universities, and the College Boardcooperate to jointly administer the Advanced Placementprogram, which began in the 1950s. Typically colleges anduniversities award credit for advanced placement examina- tion scores of 3 or above, with a 5 the maximum score.Developed by the International Baccalaureate Organiza-tion, the International Baccalaureate program is a compre-hensive two-year curriculum for high school students ages16-19. Students scoring in the 4-7 range on IB examina-tions typically receive college credit. The Texas Education Agency's (TEA) Advanced Place- ment/International Baccalaureate Incentive (AP/IB)Program began in 1993 to recognize and reward students,teachers, and schools that demonstrate success in achieving the state's educational goals. Under Subchapter C of theTexas Education Code, six diffe rent incentives may be awarded to schools, teachers, and students; however, in thepast the legislature has provided funding for only four ofthem: \u008bTeacher training reimbursements of up to $450 perteacher to attend advanced placement or Interna-tional Baccalaureate staff development courses. \u008bCampus awards of $100 for each student whoqualifies for college credit or advanced placement.This per-student award is typically reduced to matchlegislative funding; for example, it was limited to $60 per student in fiscal year 2000. \u008bExamination subsidies of $30 per eligible student,that reduce the $77 cost per advanced placementexam to $47. In addition, financially needy studentsreceive a combined $42 fee reduction from non-state sources that lowers their exam cost to $5. Aneligible student is one who is recommended by hisor her teacher or principal to take the test. \u008bOne-time $3,000 campus equipment grants forproviding a college-level advanced placement orInternational Baccalaureate course awarded toschools based on student financial need. Legislative appropria tions for the AP/IB Incentive Program increased from the 1996-97 biennium to the2002-03 biennium, but have decreased this biennium. Asindicated in Figure 2, the legislature allocated substantiallymore in the 2002-03 biennium than any other period. Untilthe 2004-05 biennium, the legislature appropriated $2million out of the Gifted and Talented allotment in theFoundation School Program, with the remainder appropri-ated out of the General Revenue Fund. Current appropria-tions come entirely from the General Revenue Fund. The TEA allocates appr opriations for the incentive program in a way that provides for the four separate awardsexplained above plus a variety of activities designed toimprove course instruction and expand access to AP/IBcurriculum. These activities range from special AP/IBcourse textbooks to curriculum for pre-AP/IB courses formiddle school students and outreach to underrepresentedstudent groups.

CAMPUS INCENTIVE AWARDS AND PROGRAM EXPANSION The 2004-05 General Appropriations Act contains a provision related to the Texas Education Agency's appro- priation which states that the goal of the AP/IB incentiveprogram is to make such courses available on as manycampuses as possible. This goal implies that the TEAshould allocate resources in a way that assists schooldistricts so that most of their campuses provide a broadarray of AP/IB courses. However, an analysis of schooldistrict campus awards indicates that the same campusestend to receive campus awards year after year. In fiscal year 2003, of the 602 campuses that the TEA selected forcampus incentive awards, 91 percent had received suchawards in the two prior fiscal years. Conversely, two other funded incentive awards, examina- tion and teacher training subsidies, act as catalysts for new campuses and students to participate in the AP and IBprograms. The examination subsidy makes the two testsaffordable, thereby allowing a growing number of studentsto take them. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2003, thenumber of students taking either the AP or IB examina- tions increased by 55 percent. Teacher training subsidiesalso encourage the spread of advanced placement byallowing educators to attend professional developmentworkshops that impart knowledge regarding AP and IBcurriculum. TEA shifts allocations for teacher trainingamong school districts each year, according to its ownaward data. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2002, only half of the school districts that received teacher training fundshad been awarded such funding in the prior two years. Campus awards, however, represent an unnecessary appropriation because they do not support the goal ofspreading AP and IB programs to the maximum number ofcampuses. Advanced placement programs at these schooldistricts would continue without campus awards becausethey represent a low level of funding, about $6,600 perdistrict, for the 628 districts that received them in fiscalyear 2002. To address this concern, future appropriationsfor the AP/IB Incentive Program should not includefunding for campus awards, but should instead focus onteacher training and examination subsidies. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION The result of the recommendation, as indicated in Figure 4, is to reduce AP/IB incentive funding to the Texas Educa-tion Agency by $6.8 million for the 2006-07 biennium.This is the amount of funding provided by the TexasEducation Agency to campus awards in the 2004-05biennium.School district and student participation in the AP/IB program has shown remarkable growth between school years 2000 and 2003: \u008bThe number of eleventh and twelfth grade students taking AP/IBexams increased from 52,109 to 80,601; \u008bThe number of high school campuses with AP/IB examinees increased from 879 to 1,124 over this three-year period.FIGURE 1 TEXAS ADVANCED PLACEMENT/INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION Board.FIGURE 3 ALLOCATIONS FOR ADVANCED PLACEMENT/INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE INCENTIVES AP/IB FY 2004 SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 221ALIGN ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAM FUNDING WITH THE PROGRAM'S STATED GOAL The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a $6.8 million reduction in General Revenue Fundspursuant to the recommendation.FIGURE 4 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT PROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS FISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.2006 $3,422,000 2007 $3,422,0002008 $3,422,0002009 $3,422,000 2010 $3,422,000STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 222ALIGN ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAM FUNDING WITH THE PROGRAM'S STATED GOALSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 223CONTINUE THE $500 PASS-THROUGH FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION EMPLOYEES The Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, created a compen- sation supplement or pass-through, which public educationemployees can apply towa rds health insurance, healthcare, or direct compensation. The Seventy-eighth Legislature,Regular Session, 2003 reduced the $1,000 pass-through to amaximum of $500 for certain full-time employees. Withoutlegislative action, the maximum amount will revert back to$1,000 annually for the 2006-07 biennium. Estimatesprovided by the Teacher Retirement System indicate that anadditional $650 million in General Revenue Funds over the2004-05 level will be needed to provide a $1,000 pass-through amount in the 2006-07 biennium. If the legislatureis interested in providing a pass-through equal to whatschool district employees typically contribute to theirflexible healthcare spending accounts, a $500 annualmaximum is adequate, and the legislature could save $650million in General Revenue Funds by continuing thecurrent pass-through levels $500 $0 along with a 90-day waiting period for newemployees. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN According to the Teacher Retirement System's legislativeappropriations request for the 2006-07 biennium, provid-ing pass-through to all active employees,without a 90-day waiting period, would cost the stateGeneral Revenue Fund $650 million more than 2004-05expenditures, or a 125 percent increase. RECOMMENDATION \u008bThe Insurance Code should be amended to continuethe 2004-05 no supplement for professional employees, anda 90-day waiting period for new employees. COMMENTS The pass-through, referred to in state statute as \"compen-sation supplementation\" is an appropriation of moneyfrom the state General Revenue Fund to the TeacherRetirement System (TRS). The TRS transfers this money toschool districts, which pass it through to school districtemployees. This transfer of money occurs monthly, butunder state law it could occur more or less frequentlyduring a state fiscal year (e.g . annually, semiannually, or weekly). According to House Bill 3343, Seventy-seventhLegislature, 2001, which created the statewide teacher health insurance program known as \"Active Care\" (TexasInsurance Code, Chapter 1580), if an employee is coveredby a school district's cafeteria plan, then his or her passthrough money must be deposited into that plan. Oncedeposited into the cafeteria plan, the money can be appliedto any combination of (1) a flexible spending account fordiscretionary healthcare expenses permissible under thefederal cafeteria plan law, (2) health insurance coverage, or(3) supplemental compensation. If the employee is notcovered by a cafeteria plan, then the pass-through must bepaid as supplemental compensation, which the TexasInsurance Code indicates is in addition to the compensa-tion the employee would have received or did receive in theprior year. The state Insurance Code defines a \"cafeteriaplan\" as a healthcare plan authorized by Section 125,Internal Revenue Code, and its subsequent amendments(referred to in this report as the federal cafeteria planprovisions). The annual pass-through amount has undergone certain changes since House Bill 3343, the teacher health insurancebill, was enacted. During fiscal year 2003, the first year that pass-through funds were distributed, the pass-throughamount was $1,000 for each active employee of a school district, charter schools, and education service centers.However, during the 2003 regular session, the legislaturepassed an omnibus public education bill, House Bill 3459,which reduced the pass-through to $500 per full-timeemployee, $250 per part-time employee, and eliminated itentirely for professional employees. Under TRS rules, afull-time employee is an active TRS member working 30 ormore hours each w eek; part-time employee is an active TRS member working less than 30 hours each week; andprofessional employees are defined as campus administra-tors and central administrators. House Bill 3459 also established a 90-day waiting period before a new public education employee may receive thepass-through. However, the same bill requires that thepolicy of providing a $1,000 pass-through for all schooldistrict employees without a 90-day waiting period willresume in fiscal year 2006.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 224CONTINUE THE $500 PASS-THROUGH FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION EMPLOYEES SUPPLEMENTAL COMPENSATION FOR HEALTHCARE According to staff at the Texas Association of School Boards, less than half of school district employees cur-rently participate in cafeteria plan healthcare or dependentcare reimbursement accounts authorized under the federalcafeteria plan law. Those employees who do participatetypically deposit somewhere between $300 to $500 a yearto their healthcare reimbursement accounts. House Bill3257, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003,which would have created health savings accounts intowhich the pass-through would have been deposited,indicated legislative inter est in focusing the pass-through on saving for healthcare costs. If the legislature is interested in appropriating a pass-through amount equal to what schooldistrict employees tend to deposit in their flexiblehealthcare accounts, then a $1,000 pass-through is two orthree times the amount public school employees tend tocontribute on their own. Consideration should be given to continuing the 2004-05 pass-through policy. To implement this recommendationboth state law and related appropriations w ould stipulate an annual $500 per full-time, a 90-day waitingperiod for new employees. TRS rider 9 of the 2004-05General Appropriations Act would need to be amended as follows to eliminate aspects of the rider that relate to theminimum effort state subsidy, which did not receive anallocation of funding from TRS in fiscal year 2005; anddeferral of the August 2005 payment of the pass-throughuntil September 2005 (i.e., the next biennium). As thecurrent rider indicates, the le gislature clearly intended to eliminate funding for the minimum effort state subsidy beginning with fiscal year 2005. Deferral of the twenty-fourth monthly payment w as a one-time delay that shifted the August 2005 pass-through payment to September 2005(i.e. the next fiscal biennium). 9.School District Employee Pass-Through. The amounts appropriated in Strategy A.3.1, ActiveHealth, for active school district employee healthbenefits are to be used to provide an annualcompensation supplement (pass-through) of $500for all full-time employees, and $250 for all part-time employees, except that no contributions shallbe provided for the category of employees referredto as \"professional staff \" by the Teacher RetirementSystem. An employee is not eligible to receive thepass-through contribution until the 90th day afterthe date the employee is employed by the entity. T he Teacher R etirement System is authoriz ed to alloca te the last month' s fiscal y ear 2005 pa yment of the pass-thr ough in Se ptember , 2005. Also, out of ear 2004 a ppropria tion in Str ategy A.3.1, Active Health, no mor e than $27,000,000 may be used to pr ovide a minim um ef fort transition subsid y (referred to as \"sta te assistance f or meeting mini- mum ef fort\" in Article 3.50-9, Texas No a ppropria tion is pr ovided f or this purpose in f iscal y ear 2005. The legislature can consider returning the pass-through tothe $1,000 level as part of deliberations on school finance. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION The recommendation to continue the current pass-through amounts of $500 and $250, as well as the 90-day waitingperiod, would save the state General Revenue Fund about$650 million, compared to projected costs for the 2006-07biennium. Implementation of the recommendation wouldrequire changes to current law. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill assumes continuation of the $500 pass-through and the90-day delay in eligibility for new employees. The intro- duced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill places fundingfor the pass-through in the Founda tion School Program at the Texas Education Agency.FIGURE 1 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACTCONTINUE CURRENT PASS-THROUGH POLICY PROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSFISCAL YEAR SOURCE : Legislative Budget $323,200,000 2007 $327,060,0002008 LEGISLA ARD 225EARL Y CARE AND EDUC ATION IN TEXAS Congress is reauthorizing the Head Start Program and may create a demonstration program for state-administered programs, combining funds from Head Start, state-funded preschool, and child-care funds into a uniform early childhood care system with a focus on education. Texas may be selected to participate in the demonstration. This report examines the issues and implications of the federal proposal and provides a comprehensive view of early childhood care and education in Texas. SIGNIFIC ANT FINDINGS uIf selected to participate in the state demonstration program, Texas would be required to coordinate and combine Federal Funds for Early Reading First, Even Start, and Title I, Part A funds used for preschool with state pre-kindergarten programs and Head Start funds ($946.5 million All Funds in fiscal year 2004). Texas would have the option to combine the Child Care and Development Fund ($468 million All Funds in fiscal year 2004) with Head Start funds. uStates would have the option to either meet the Head Start program performance standards for the entire combined program or for each child served in the combined program that is funded with federal Head Start funding. The Head Start program performance standards require medical and dental examinations for all enrolled children. uThe proposed state demonstration project would require participating states to at least maintain state and local funding levels for early childhood education. uThere could be a significant fiscal impact if Texas participated in the state demonstration program and selected the option to meet the Head Start program performance standards for the entire combined program. COMMENTS The 2000 U.S. Census counted 19.2 million children under the age of five throughout the country. Texas had the second largest child population in the United States, with more than 1.6 million children under five years old, which accounts for 8.5 percent of the total U.S. population under the age of five. Of the 1.6 million children, about30 percent are either three- or four-year-olds. Based on the census' population estimates, the number of children under five years old in Texas will have increased to 1.8 million by 2003. According to Census 2000 data, 53 percent of Texas children under age six have both parents working or have a single parent in the workforce. About 45 percent of three- and four-year-olds in Texas were enrolled in school in the year 2000. An August 2004 study by the National Institute for Early Education Research indicates education rather than child care was the primary motivation for parents to send their children to preschool. Texas children can enter kindergarten in public schools if they are five years old as of September 1 of the school year. There is a Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) curriculum for kindergarten. The kindergarten TEKS curriculum identifies the skills and concepts that five-year- olds are expected to master by the completion of the kindergarten year. Although there are no assessments for kindergarten students, the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) is administered annually beginning in grade three. Several federal and state early childhood care and education programs serve children under the age of five. Figure 1 shows number of children participating in federal and state programs that serve children under the age of five. State agencies such as Texas Education Agency (TEA), Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), and Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services (DARS) provide FIGURE 1 NUMBER OF PARTICIP ATING CHILDREN FOR EARL Y CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUC ATION PROGRAMS IN TEXAS, FISC AL YEAR 2003 Head Start/Early Head Start 67,764 TEA Pre-kindergarten 157,498 TEA Even Start 11,020 TEA 40,607 112,015PROGRAM CHILDREN NOTE: Participants in TWC Child Care represent the number of children served per day.

The following section provides a comprehensive review of these programs. HEAD START PROGRAM AND EARLY HEAD START PROGRAM The Head Start program, administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is a federal program that has provided comprehensive early childhood development services to low-income children since 1965. Head Start programs have the overall goal of increasing the school readiness of young children in low- income families. Head Start programs provide preschool classes as well as health, nutritional, social, and other services to improve the conditions of children at risk of not succeeding in later school years. The Head Start program emphasizes the involvement of families and the local community to address specific needs of communi- ties. Parents of enrolled children are provided support services such as parenting education, health education, emergency or crisis intervention, adult education, housing assistance, and transportation. Head Start programs only serve preschool age children (three- and four-year-olds). Children are eligible to partici- pate in Head Start if they are from low-income families as measured by the federal poverty level (FPL). Figure 2 provides the eligibility requirements for Head Start, along with other federal and state early childhood care programs. Children whose families participate in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program or theSupplemental Security Income (SSI) program are automati- cally eligible to enroll in Head Start programs. Head Start programs must offer no less than 10 percent of total enrollments to children with disabilities. Unlike other federal funding for social services that are distributed to states, HHS awards Head Start funds directly to local grantees. HHS reserves a portion of Head Start funds for set-aside provisions mandated by federal legisla- tion. Set-aside provisions reserve funds for transition-to- school grants; research, demonstration, and quality assurance activities; Indian and migrant Head Start programs; and services for children with disabilities. The remaining Head Start funds are allocated to states based on a formula that includes a hold harmless provision that guarantees each state its allocation from fiscal year 1998 (adjusted for inflation), and an allotment based on the number of children under age five living in poverty. When Congress reauthorized the Head Start program in 1994, the Early Head Start program was created to provide comprehensive services to low-income families with children from birth to age three and to pregnant women. Early Head Start services include quality early education; home visits; parent education; parent-child activities; comprehensive health services, including services to women before, during and after pregnancy; nutrition; and case management and peer support groups for parents. Family income is one key factor in determining eligibility. Early Head Start programs may elect to target their services to a particular population to best meet the unique needs of families and children in their community. In addition, Early FIGURE 2 ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR EARL Y CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUC ATION PROGRAMS Head Start 3 to 4 Up to 100% FPL At least 10% of enrollment must target children with disabilities.

Head Start programs served over 900,000 children throughout the country during fiscal year 2003. Texas Head Start programs served over 67,000 children during fiscal year 2003 (7 percent of the national total). Local grantees are provided flexibility to operate Head Start programs, resulting in a variety of program options. Head Start programs operate full and part-time day programs mostly during the school year. In Texas, 73 percent of children enrolled in Head Start attended full-day programs five days a week in fiscal year 2003, compared to 46 percent for all enrolled children in the country. From fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2005, federal funding for Head Start and Early Head Start grew by more than one-third, from $4.4 billion to $6.8 billion. For fiscal year 2005, an estimated $478 million in Head Start and Early Head Start funding will be distributed to Head Start programs in Texas (see Figure 3). In its first year, federal funding nationally for Early Head Start programs totaled $106 million to support 68 programs, which served more than 18,000 children. By fiscal year 2004, over $655.5 million had been allocated to support 708 Early Head Start programs that served more than 62,000 children. Com- pared to other states, Texas receives the second largest allocation of Head Start and Early Head Start funds. Local grantees must provide 20 percent of the total cost of the Head Start program.THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUND The federal Child Care And Development Fund (CCDF) provides assistance to low-income families in need of child care while parents work or attend job training or educa- tional programs. The CCDF is composed of several parts: uDiscretionary funds are allocated to states based on the number of children below the age of five, the number of children receiving assistance through the School Lunch Program, and state per capita income. Texas' award was $206.7 million in fiscal year 2004. There are no match or maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements. uMandatory funds are allocated to states based on historical expenditures for child care in the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Texas' allocation for fiscal year 2004 was $59.8 million. There are no match or MOE requirements. uMatching funds are allocated to states based on the proportion of children under age 13 residing in the state. To be eligible for matching funds, at a mini- mum states must maintain the historical spending level for child care in the former AFDC program. The federal match rate is the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP (60.22 percent in fiscal year 2004). Texas' allocation was $125.1 million in fiscal year 2004. At least 4 percent of the CCDF must be used to improve child-care quality and availability, including activities such as consumer education, resource and referral services, provider grants and loans, monitoring and enforcement of requirements, training and technical assistance, and improved compensation for child-care staff. TWC administers the CCDF and allocates child-care funding to the 28 local workforce development boards. The state meets its MOE and matching requirements through a combination of General Revenue Funds at TWC, state pre- kindergarten expenditures, and local funds. A portion of the CCDF ($31.7 million including estimated employee benefits in fiscal year 2004) funds child-care regulation and child care for children receiving services at the Department of Family and Protective Services. TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides assistance to families with needy children so that children can be cared for in their own homes; promotes job preparation, work, and marriage; strives to reduce and prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and encourages the formation and maintenance of two-parentFIGURE 3 HEAD ST ART AND EARL Y HEAD ST ART PROGRAMS FEDERAL FUNDING TO TEXAS (IN MILLIONS) SOURCE : U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families; Federal Funds Information for States.$361.8$429.1$454.3$465.4 $473.2 $478.0 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Federal Fiscal YearSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA TURE LEGISLA ARD 228EARL CARE AND EDUCA TION IN TEXAS families. TANF is a block grant, based on the historical level of federal spending on related programs. States with high population growth and low benefit levels receive supplemental funds. Bonuses are awarded for achievements in reducing out-of-wedlock births and clients' job entry and success rates. At a minimum, states must maintain spending at 80 percent of state expenditures in fiscal year 1994 on related pro- grams (or 75 percent if the state meets national work participation standards). As a component of the state's TANF MOE, there is a minimum MOE related to child care ($34.7 million per year). States may transfer up to 30 percent of the block grant to the CCDF, minus transfers to the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), which are limited to 10 percent of the TANF grant. In fiscal year 2004, $2 million in TANF transferred to the SSBG was used for child care at TWC. EARLY READING FIRST The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) authorized a new program, Early Reading First. This competitive grant program provides funds to support efforts to enhance the oral language, cognitive, and early reading skills of pre- school-age children\u2014especially those from low-income families\u2014through strategies, materials, and professional development that are grounded in scientifically based reading research. Congress appropriated $74.5 million in fiscal year 2003 to fund Early Reading First projects across the country. Of this amount, a total of $13.9 million was awarded for five Early Reading First projects in Texas. EVEN START The U.S. Department of Education distributes Even Start funds to support local family literacy projects that integrate early childhood education, adult literacy, parenting educa- tion, and interactive parent and child literacy activities for families with parents and their children. Even Start programs operate year-round and provide staff training and support services such as child care and transportation, when unavailable from other sources, to enable participa- tion in education activities. Eligibility for children is from birth through age seven. Teen parents and their children from birth through age seven also are eligible. The parents served through the Even Start program must be eligible for services under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act. Priority is given to families most in need of services. Even Start funds are distributed to states based on each state's relative share of Title I, Part A funds. TEA is responsible for the administration of the Even Start program. Since August 2003, Texas LEARNS, housed in the Harris County Department of Education, has been providing grant management functions, program assistance,and other statewide support services to Texas Even Start providers. Texas' allocation for Even Start was $20 million in fiscal year 2004. INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT PROGRAMS Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding is awarded to state education agencies to meet the excess costs of providing special education and related services to children with disabilities. Part B, Section 619 Preschool Grants provide special education and related services for children with disabilities aged three through five. School districts may provide the following: special instruction, development and implementation of individual education plans, assistive technology devices, audiology, counseling services, early identification and assessment, medical services for diagnosis or evaluation, and therapies. These funds are distributed based on a formula. States receive a base amount (equal to fiscal year 1997 amounts), and of the funds exceeding the base amounts, 85 percent are allocated according to the number of children aged three to five and 15 percent according to the number of children aged three to five living in poverty. Texas' alloca- tion for Part B, Section 619 Preschool Grants was $23.5 million in fiscal year 2004, and an estimated 40,000 preschool children in Texas received special education and related services. Figure 4 shows the growth in federal funding in Part B, Section 619 Preschool and Part C programs since fiscal year 1999. DARS receives Federal Funds for another component of IDEA: Part C, relating to early childhood intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities. The federal regulations regarding Part C of IDEA, as amended in 1997, indicate that the purpose of Part C is to provide financial assistance to states to maintain and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of early childhood intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families. Texas' allocation for Part C program was $36.7 million in fiscal year 2004. IDEA, Part C funds are awarded based on a state's share of children, ages zero to two years in the general population (according to the most recent satisfac- tory data determined by the U.S. Secretary of Education). The Part C program has no matching requirements, but states must meet a MOE requirement. Texas meets its Part C MOE requirement through a combination of General Revenue Funds at DARS ($31.3 million in General Revenue Funds in fiscal year 2004) and Foundation School Funds transferred through an interagency contract from TEA ($12.9 million in fiscal year 2004).

DARS currently supports 62 local programs that provide compre- hensive services such as service coordination, vision services, speech-language therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. DARS provides services directly or offers access to them. Providers include mental health and mental retardation centers, school districts, education service centers, and private nonprofit organizations. DARS also maintains a child find system that identifies eligible infants and toddlers. In fiscal year 2003, a total of 20,286 children in Texas received comprehensive services. TITLE I, PART A SUPPORTED PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS School districts may support preschool programs with their federal allocations of Title I, Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies. Eligibility requirements for pre- school programs funded by Title I, Part A, limit services to children at risk of not meeting challenging state standards, children from birth through five years of age, and children who participated in Head Start or Even Start. Children do not have to be eligible for Head Start to be served by Title I, Part A preschool programs. Texas served 167,822 preschool children with Title I, Part A funds during the 2003-04 school year. Title I, Part A funds may be used for the following activities: (1) creating a new preschool at the district or school level; (2) expanding an existing preschool (e.g. thosefunded by other federal and state programs) by increasing enrollment, time, or services; and (3) improving the quality of existing preschool programs. Title I, Part A funds may also be used to provide preschool participants with comprehensive services. School districts are allowed to use a portion of Title I, Part A funds in a targeted assistance school to address health, nutrition, and other social services of preschool children. However, school districts must complete a comprehensive needs assessment and make certain that funding is not available from other public or private sources. The U.S. Department of Education requires that Title I, Part A preschool programs coordinate with other preschool programs providing educational services. Specifically, a school district's Title I, Part A plan must describe how it will coordinate and integrate services under Title I with other educational services such as Even Start, Head Start, Early Reading First, and other preschool programs, including its plans for the transition of children in those programs to elementary school programs. TEXAS PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM There are 41 states that provide some form of state funding to support pre-kindergarten programs. The Sixty- eighth Legislature, Second Called Special Session, 1984, established the Texas pre-kindergarten program (Pre-K). The purpose of the Pre-K program is to develop the skills necessary for success in the regular curriculum, including language, mathematics, and social skills.

TEA estimates that $64.0 million in 2003-04 FSP funding can be attributed to Pre-K average daily attendance. In addition, state funding is available through the Pre-kindergarten Expansion Grant program. This program is designed to allow school districts and charter schools to apply to TEA for grants to expand existing half-day Pre-K programs to a full day, or establish new Pre-K programs at campuses which previously did not operate such a program. A total of $90 million in General Revenue Funds was awarded to 283 school districts in fiscal year 2004. Figure 5 shows FSP and Pre-kindergarten Expansion Grant funding for the last three school years and estimated funding for the school years 2004-05, 2005-06, and 2006-07. Texas school districts served 157,498 Pre-K students during the 2002-03 school year. According to a study by the National Institute for Early Education Research, Texas has the largest Pre-K program in the U.S. (in terms of the number of children served); in the percentage of all 4-year-olds served (43 percent), it ranks third behind Oklahoma and Georgia.Pre-K programs operate during the school year (nine months). School districts have the option of contracting for services with other community organizations. In 1995, the Texas Legislature prohibited the adoption of TEKS for Pre-K programs. TEA currently provides only voluntary curriculum guidelines and encourages school districts not to exceed a student/teacher ratio of 22:1. Texas Pre-K program teachers must be certified and hold a kindergarten endorsement (coursework in early childhood education). The Seventy-sixth Legislature, 1999, amended the Texas Education Code to permit ineligible children to participate in Pre-K programs if the parents pay tuition. COMPARISON OF TEXAS HEAD START PROGRAMS WITH NATIONAL GUIDELINES All Head Start programs must follow the federal Head Start program performance standards with regards to addressing low-income children's health, social, and educational needs. The Head Start program requires that every enrolled child must be screened for any vision, hearing, behavior, language, social, cognitive, and emotional problems within 45 calendar days of enrollment. In fiscal year 2003, 87 percent of Head Start enrolled children nationally received medical screens; 24 percent of these children were assessed as needing treatment, and 89 percent of these children received follow-up medical treatment. Although 88 percent of enrolled children received medical screens through FIGURE 5 TEXAS ST ATE FUNDING FOR PRE-KINDERG ARTEN PROGRAM (IN MILLIONS) SOURCE School Programs Funds Attributable to Pre-K Average Daily AttendanceSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO TURE LEGISLA ARD 231EARL Y CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCA TION IN TEXAS Texas Head Start programs, only 12 percent of these children were assessed as needing treatment. Head Start programs also must address the dental care of enrolled children. Nationally, 77 percent of Head Start children (preschool only) received a dental exam in fiscal year 2003; 28 percent of these children were diagnosed as needing dental treatment, and 77 percent of children needing dental treatment received treatment. Seventy-nine percent of enrolled children (preschool only) in Texas Head Start programs received a dental exam during this same period of time. Of the Texas Head Start enrolled children examined, 23 percent were diagnosed as needing treatment and 84 percent of this set of children received treatment. Within 90 calendar days of a child's enrollment, Head Start programs must determine whether families have an ongoing source of continuous, accessible healthcare. If a child does not have a source of healthcare, Head Start programs must assist families in securing a source. During fiscal year 2003, 89 percent of children served by Head Start programs had health insurance. Of these children with health insurance, 71 percent were enrolled in the Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) program or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Texas Head Start programs, during this same period, reported that 82 percent of enrolled children had health insurance. The primary insurance for these children was the EPSDT program (72 percent), followed by private insurance (13 percent), and the CHIP program (10 percent). The 1998 Head Start reauthorization required that by September 30, 2003, at least half of all Head Start teachers in center-based programs must have an associate's, bachelor's, or advanced degree in Early Childhood Educa- tion or a degree in a related field, with preschool teaching experience. In fiscal year 2003, 57 percent of Head Start teachers had at least an associate's degree. Texas Head Start programs reported in fiscal year 2003 that almost 84 percent of their teachers met the required qualifications. HEAD START REAUTHORIZATION The president has proposed significant changes to the Head Start program. In the fiscal year 2004 president's budget, the administration proposed that states be allowed to run the Head Start program. States would be able to combine Federal Funds from the Head Start Program, Early Head Start program, Title I, Part A preschool funding, IDEA, Preschool Grants, and the CCDF program with state-funded preschool programs. The president also proposed that the U.S. Department of Education adminis- ter the Head Start program instead of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The fiscal year 2005 president's budget did not include the proposal to havestates manage the Head Start program. However, the president did propose to implement nine pilot programs that would coordinate the Head Start, state preschool programs, and federal child-care-related programs to improve preschool performance. The authorizing legislation for the Head Start program expired at the end of fiscal year 2003. Congress has continued funding for the Head Start program through its annual appropriation process. The U.S. House passed a Head Start reauthorization bill on July 25, 2003. The School Readiness Act of 2003 (House Bill 2210) reautho- rizes the Head Start program through 2008 and amends the program to include components of the president's Head Start proposal. The U.S. House passed a provision that would require 50 percent of Head Start teachers to have a bachelor's degree or advanced degree in early childhood development by the year 2008. In addition, within three years of enactment, House Bill 2210 would require all Head Start teachers hired in center-based programs after enactment have an associate's degree or higher in early childhood education. House Bill 2210 would allow eight states to participate in state demonstration programs. These qualified states would receive allocations of Head Start funding to coordinate Head Start with state early education programs. In order for a state to be qualified, it would need to meet the following criteria: (1) have an existing state-supported public Pre-K program; (2) have its standards for school readiness aligned with kindergarten through 12th grade; (3) have prior year state and local spending on Pre-K programs and Head Start programs at a level of at least 50 percent of Head Start federal funding (excluding Early Head Start); and (4) have an established means of inter- agency coordination and collaboration. Local Head Start grantees in selected states would continue to receive funds from the state for at least three years. States would have to provide a 5 percent match and meet an MOE requirement. House Bill 2210 would require states to combine Early Reading First, Even Start and state Pre-K programs. A state would be allowed to combine Head Start funds with CCDF. Two Head Start reauthorization bills were introduced in the Senate the fall 2003. Only one bill has been reported out of committee, Senate Bill 1940, the Head Start Improvements for School Readiness Act. There are differences between the House Bill 2210 and Senate Bill 1940. The most significant difference is that Senate Bill 1940 does not include the option of states administering Head Start programs. It is likely that the president's budget for fiscal year 2006 will again address the coordination of early childhood care and education. The U.S. Senate might consider Senate Bill 1940 or a different reauthorization bill in the upcoming 109th first session.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO LEGISLA ARD 232EARL Y CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCA TION IN TEXAS FISCAL IMP ACT TO TEXAS House Bill 2210 would require states to meet all of the requirements to be selected as one of the state demonstra- tion programs. Texas might be selected to be one of the eight state demonstration programs. As described earlier, Texas has an existing state-supported system of public Pre-K. Texas would meet the requirement of having state and local funding for preschool programs at least 50 percent of the Head Start funds allocated to the state. State funding alone was $454 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to Texas ' Head Start programs ' fiscal year 2004 allocation of $473.2 million. There would also be a 5 percent ($23.7 million) cash or in-kind match for states selected to be one of the eight state demonstration programs. Texas state and local funding levels for early childhood education programs would have to be maintained. Qualified states must have existing standards for school readiness that are aligned with state kindergarten through twelfth grade. TEA developed curriculum guidelines for preschool programs, but school districts are not required to follow these guidelines. In 1995, the legislature prohibited adoption of TEKS for Pre-K. Texas would be required to meet the teacher qualification standards for the Head Start program proposed by House Bill 2210. Fifty percent of Head Start teachers would have to have a bachelor's degree or advanced degree in early childhood development by 2008. In addition, all Head Start teachers hired in center- based programs after enactment would be required to have an associate's degree or higher in early childhood educa- tion. Texas would have to follow Head Start program requirements regarding maximum class ratios. Participating states in the Head Start demonstration program would have the flexibility to use Head Start funds for any authorized Head Start purpose. Texas would be required to coordinate and combine federal funding for Early Reading First, Even Start, Title I, Part A preschool, with state Pre-K and Head Start funds. Figure 6 shows the amount of funding for these federal and state programs that could be combined with Head Start funds. Texas would also have the option to combine CCDF funding with Head Start funds. One state agency would have to be designated the lead state agency. Currently, these programs are administered by TEA and TWC with different types of providers (school districts and child-care providers). States would have the option to meet the Head Start program performance standards for the entire combined program or for each child served in the combined program that is funded with federal Head Start funding. There would be a significant fiscal impact if Texas were selected and chose to meet the Head Start program performance standards for the entire combinedNOTE: Head Start/Early Head Start awarded directly to local grantees.

As mentioned before, the Head Start program has specific requirements to screen children for vision, hearing, behavior, language, social, cognitive, and emo- tional problems. The upcoming 109th First Session of Congress in January 2005 may reconsider the president's proposal to allow states to combine funds from Head Start, state-funded preschool, and child-care funds into a uniform early childhood care system with a focus on education. Congress may reconsider whether all states would be offered this option or create a demonstration program for select states.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 233ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CLASS-SIZE WAIVER PROCESS In 1984, the Texas Legislature required that class size be limited to 22 students per teacher in kindergarten throughfourth grade (Texas Education Code \u00a7 25.112). The legislature authorized the commissioner of education togrant exceptions, or waivers, to the class-size limitations ifthe commissioner found that the limits created an unduehardship on a school district. Exceptions to class-size limitations are valid f or only one semester at a time, and the commissioner is prohibited from granting exceptions formore than one semester at a time . The class-size limitations do not apply to the last 12 weeks of a school year for most districts or to physical education or fine arts classes.Reporting and data collection governing class-size waiversare not being properly enforced; procedural chang es are in order to correct deficiencies in these areas. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe Texas Education Agency approves a class-size waiver for an entire district, not at the campus orclass level; one district receives one waiver. Due tothis method of granting waivers, class-size waiverdata does not accurately reflect the number ofclassrooms that exceed class-size limitations. \u008bIn 2003, the Legislative Budget Board staff recommended that the Waiver Unit implementInternet-based waiver submission and link theWaiver Unit data to the Public Education Informa-tion Management System database. The WaiverUnit cites denial of funding the reason theserecommendations have not been implemented,estimated at $250,000 in General Revenue Funds toupdate the Waiver Unit's database in order toinstitute these two recommendations. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bThe Waiver Unit's database is outdated and lacks theability to support (1) a link to the Public EducationInformation Management System database, (2) anInternet-based waiver application, and (3) studentdata at the classroom level. \u008bThere are school districts in Texas that have been using class-size waivers for over 20 consecutivesemesters; and while a compliance plan must besubmitted and each campus must show annual gains,districts are not denied waivers and do not sufferany consequences that might motivate the districts to take action on the problem. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill directing the TexasEducation Agency to collect class-size data from each district receiving a class-siz e waiver, update the Waiver Unit's database to support a link with thePublic Education Information System database, andimplement an Internet-based waiver application toreduce data errors and improve efficiency. \u008bRecommendation 2: The Texas Education Agency should adopt rules to ensure that campuses areaddressing the issues cited in their compliance planthat influence their need to request waivers formultiple consecutive semesters. COMMENTS The purpose of the class-size waiver provision of HouseBill 72, Sixty-eighth Legislature, 1983, was to promote ahigher level of student achievement. The supporters ofthis original bill were particularly concerned withnumerous educational studies demonstrating theimportance of smaller class sizes for students in the firstfew grades. Opponents of the original bill were con-cerned that the ratio set was not low enough. However,both supporters and opponents agreed that Texas classesneeded to be smaller. APPLICATION PROCESS AND REASONS FOR CLASS-SIZE WAIVERS To determine compliance with the class size requirements, districts are required to conduct a class enrollment surveyno later than a date specif ied by the commissioner each semester. Districts having classes in excess of the set limitmust submit a class-size waiver request to the Waiver Unitno later than a date specif ied by the commissioner each semester. For a waiver request to be granted, the district must show that the 22-student limit presents an undue hardship on thedistrict. The commissioner of education, by way of theWaiver Unit, then uses the following criteria to determineundue hardship:STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 234ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CLASS-SIZE WAIVER PROCESS (1) The district is unable to employ qualified teachers; (2) The district is unable to provide educational facilities; (3) The district has budgeted for a class-size ratio of 22:1 in kindergarten through grade 4, but one ormore campuses experience enrollment shifts thatresult in no more than one section per grade level,increasing to a maximum of 24:1; or (4) A combination of the above reasons. On the request form, the district must cite one reason for each campus, even through ther e may be multiple grade levels and classrooms utilizing waivers. This makes itdifficult to quantify and identify the actual reason eachgrade level or classroom is in need of a waiver. For spring2003, over 60 percent of campuses cited the reasons thatthey were unable to employ qualified teachers and/or thatthey were unable to provide educational facilities. Regardless of the reason cited by the district, it must document its effort to alleviate the existing hardship andmust submit a compliance plan, including a schedule forcompletion, approved by the local boar d of trustees. In a guidance letter issued October 5, 2004 by the commis-sioner, a new option was outlined that would allow the localschool board to relinquish its oversight of class-size waiverrequests to the superintendent, leading to the board beingbypassed for approval on all future waiver requests by thedistrict. The letter also provided another reason thatdistricts may request class-size waivers. The commissionerwould allow a district to be exempt from class size require-ments for the first 10 percent of the K-4 classes in adistrict if its affected by high student mobility rates (asconfirmed by PEIMS data). While the commissionerwithdrew the October 2004 guidance letter with the twonew options after much opposition by teacher organiza-tions and publicity by the media, the commissioner is nowseeking to employ both of these measures through theformal rule-making process. Under Texas Education Code \u00a7 25.113, a district that is granted an exception from class-size limits must providewritten notice of the exception to the parent or guardianof each student affected by the exception. The Waiver Unitdoes not have a method in place to ensure that thesenotices are delivered to the parents of the students affectedby the granting of the class-size waiver. Underscoring theproblem is the Waiver Unit's current reliance on mediacoverage to alert it to any problems in the class-size waiver system. If the parents of the affected children are not given proper notice of their children's classroom condi-tions, it is less likely that the media, and subsequently TEA,will know of any problems needing to be resolved.WAIVER DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING The Waiver Unit grants class-size waivers at a broad, school district level. By granting waivers at the district level and bymaintaining data at the district and campus levels ratherthan at the class level, ther e is no practical way of knowing how many classrooms are in excess of the 22:1 student-to-teacher ratio. A single class-size waiver granted to a districtcovers every classroom in that district and is only reportedas one waiver. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate compli-ance with a law designed to have an impact at the class levelwhen the Waiver Unit collects and maintains data at thedistrict level. In addition, while the district's accountabilityis considered during the class-size wa iver approval process, individual campus or classroom accountability could besuffering due to overflow classrooms and is not consideredduring the approval process. As a result of waivers being granted at a district level, legislators and other stakeholdersdo not have an accurate account of the impact of class-sizewaivers on actual class sizes in Texas. According to the Waiver Unit, for school year 2003-04 Texas had an average of 1,562 classrooms each semesterwith more than 22 students. However, because the WaiverUnit grants a class-size waiver to a district and not perclassroom, the data is reported as 148 waivers, rather than1,562 classrooms (see Figure 1). 1993-94 115 ** ** ** ** 1994-95 114 2191 26262001-02 22812002-03 145 1753 2003-04 148 465 441 1693 1432FALL FALL SPRING SPRING SCHOOL YEARNUMBER OF DISTRICT WAIVERS APPROVED BY THE STATE WAIVER UNITFIGURE 1 DISTRICT CLASS-SIZE WAIVERS APPROVED CAMPUSES COVERED BY WAIVERS BY SEMESTERTOTAL # OF CLASSROOMS IN EXCESS OF 22:1 RATIO Notes: Total number of districts statewide is 1,261.

Althoughthis shows the number of classrooms in excess of the 22:1ratio, the Waiver Unit data does not accurately report thenumber of children actually affected by waivers. It is asignificant concern that the agency cannot accuratelymonitor the extent to which the class-size waiver isaffecting classroom size. WAIVER UNIT DATABASE OUTDATED In 2001, a TEA internal audit of the State Waiver Unit found numerous data entry errors and waiver applicationsthat were never pr ocessed. The auditor's recommendations include the following: \u008bImplement routine crosschecks for verifyingaccuracy of database input prior filing thewaiver; and \u008bProvide Internet-based data-entry by the schooldistricts to turnaround. Thisstructure would include drop-down boxes toreduce data-entry errors and would require districtsto provide a history of waivers specific to theschool district. A follow-up audit by TEA was completed in December of 2002, and it was reported that all recommendations wereimplemented and considered closed. However, althoughdrop-down boxes were added to assist in verifying accuracy of data, changes did not include the implementation ofInternet-based data entry as recommended by the audit.The Waiver Unit attributes this to the fact that theirdatabase must first be upg raded, and the funding for this initiative has been denied by TEA management. The Waiver Unit enters each district's waiver application information into the Wavier Unit database. An Internet-based application process would reduce duplication ofwork and ensure that the data maintained and used bythe Waiver Unit is the most accurate and current dataavailable. By then linking the Waiver Unit's database tothe Public Education Information Management System(PEIMS), the Waiver Unit would then be able to validatethe data submitted by the school district and facilitatethe unit's ability to detect districts that have failed toapply for a waiver and are in violation of the class-sizewaiver law . It is a significant concern that the databasesare not linked and that the Waiver Unit manually inputseach district's application. CONSECUTIVE WAIVERS According to TEA correspondence with school administra- tors, when a district requests a class-size waiver for two consecutive semesters, the district must \"initiate a public notification\" to ensure that the community is aware of therequests. This notice must describe the steps the district is 47174921 434045205222 0100020003000400050006000 K 1st 2nd 3rd 4th Grade LevelNumber of Overflowing ClassroomsFIGURE 2 WAIVERS GRANTED OVER 10 YEARS BY CLASSROOM, BY GRADE (1994-2004) NOTE: Waivers per semester were averaged to obtain an estimate of the number of classrooms affected each year. SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 236ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CLASS-SIZE WAIVER PROCESS taking to reduce the need for continued class-size waivers. A district requesting a class-size wa iver for a third or subsequent semester is required to hold a meeting forparents and community members at each campus coveredby the waiver request to discuss the continued need for thewaiver and the specific steps that will be taken to bring thedistrict into compliance. For districts that request a class-size waiver for more than four consecutive semesters, commissioner's rules require that student performance beconsidered in the decision to grant a waiver. A districtrequesting a waiver for the fifth or subsequent consecutivesemester must show that all campuses covered by thewaiver achieved annual gains in performance for allstudents, and for each student group on each state assess-ment administered, unless the student group is performingat the \"recognized\" or \"ex emplary\" level on each assess- ment. For a district requesting a class-size waiver for theseventh or subsequent semester at any campus, the localschool board of trustees must hold a public hearingaddressing the continued need for a class-size waiver at one or more campuses. It is unclear how TEA is enforcing these rules. Several districts have been granted class-size waivers for more thantwenty consecutive semesters; even while these districts'accountability ratings either remained the same or declined.It is a significant concern that there are no guidelineswithin statute or the Texas Administrative Code (commis-sioner rules) that address the content of a compliance plan,which the districts must submit with each waiver request, orthe time limit that a school district has to become compli-ant with the class-size limitation guidelines. The agency hasindicated that the commissioner is in the process ofdeveloping new rules and that this issue is part of theplanning process. Figure 3 demonstrates the locations ofdistricts granted waivers for eight to 10 plus consecutivesemesters, and Figure 4 lists the ten districts with thelargest number of classrooms requiring waivers over thepast ten years in Texas. As illustrated in Figure 3, four districts have utilized waivers for over twenty consecutive semesters. In the HoustonIndependent School District (ISD), there is an employeewhose sole responsibility is to monitor the individualschools, develop the compliance plan, and request waiversfrom TEA. The class-size wavier was originally developed as a short-term solution for school districts to give them asemester to address an issue that was prohibiting thedistrict from adhering to the state c lass-size waiver statute. The waiver was not developed to be a part of the ongoingoperations in large school districts. There are no consequences, other than the possibility of receiving negative publicity from the media or teacherorganizations, when a district fails to file for a waiver.Therefore, to avoid having twenty consecutive semesters, some schools do not file for a semester, even though theyhave overflow classrooms, in order to avoid the consecutivesemester guidelines described above. For example, DallasISD has requested waivers for eight consecutive semesters.This does not mean that prior to those eight, all of theirclassrooms were within the 22:1 ratio, but conversely, thatthey failed to appl y for a waiver one semester. In order to hold districts accountable and to ensure that they areaddressing the issues influencing their constant need forclass-size waivers, actions suc h as making class-size waivers part of TEA's Accountability Rating System or publishingthe number of waivers per semester within regional orstatewide reports may be considered. CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1 would include a rider in the General Appropriations Bill directing the TEA to collect class-sizedata from each district receiving a class-size waiver, update the Waiver Unit's database to support a link with thePEIMS database, and implement an Internet-based waiverapplication. By collecting class size student data fromschools and linking the Waiver Unit database to PEIMS, theagency would be able to better estimate how many studentsare being affected by class-size waivers, and the ability tocrosscheck information between the databases and identifynon-compliant districts. The Internet-based waiverapplication would further the eff iciency of the agency and reduce data errors due to manual transfer of information.The rider would be as follows: Out of funds appropriated to Strategy B.3.4, Information Systems - Technology, the agency shallallocate funds as necessary to provide an Internet-based system to allow school districts to submitwaiver requests and related information electroni-cally to the agency. The agency shall collect class-size waiver data at the district, campus and class-room level. The data collected by this system shallbe linked with the Public Education InformationManagement System (PEIMS) to facilitate data accuracy, waiver monitoring and analysis. Recommendation 2 would require TEA to outline the compliance plan and the rules surrounding the multipleconsecutive semesters within the commissioner rules. It iscritical that districts develop a useful compliance plan toprovide a guide for themselves as well as to provide anindicator to the state as to the status of the district andimprovements made each semester. The agency hasindicated that commissioner rules are in the developmentstages, and that this issue is part the planning process.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 237ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CLASS-SIZE WAIVER PROCESS FIGURE 3 INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH MULTIPLE CONSECUTIVE SEMESTERS WITH WAIVERS SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 238ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CLASS-SIZE WAIVER PROCESS FIGURE 4 TOP TEN DISTRICTS IN NUMBER OF CLASSROOMS REQUIRING WAIVERS OVER THE PAST 10 ISD 555CUMULATIVE # OF CLASSROOMS REQUIRING WAIVERS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS SCHOOL DISTRICT SOURCE : Texas Education Agency. The procedures and policies currently in place within TEA's Waiver Unit hinder the proper reporting, enforcement, andoriginal purpose of the class size provision. The datacollection procedures and methodologies provide noaccountability for actual class siz es, which was the original purpose of the law. Because of this, the Waiver Unit isunable to enforce the law or detect existing problems in theapplication of the law. With the implementation of stricter quality controls on data collection and maintenance, the Waiver Unit canprovide more useful information to parents, legislators, and policy makers. By implementing LBB staff recommenda-tions, there would be a reduction in the duplication of dataentry, a possible reduction in Waiver Unit administrativecosts, and the assurance of more accurate and useful data.Once these improvements are implemented, the WaiverUnit can better monitor the application of the class-sizelimitation law that is intended to improve the achievement of all Texas school children. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Neither recommendation, if implemented, would have a significant fiscal impact. The introduced 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill includes a rider, pursuant to Recom- mendation 1, that directs the Texas Education Agency to collect class-size data from eac h district receiving a class- size waiver.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 239ISSUES RELATED TO THE TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY'S PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE PUBLIC EDUCATION MONITORING The Texas Education Agency monitors more than 1,200 local education agencies to ensure proper compliance witheducation laws and regulations throughout the publiceducation system. House Bill 3459, passed by the Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, prompted the Texas EducationAgency to initiate a major overhaul of its local educationagency monitoring system. The bill limited the agency'sresponsibilities for monitoring local education agencies'compliance with state law rega rding education programs and processes. With the exception of special education,federally funded programs, and special accreditationinvestigations, the agency may monitor local educationagencies only as necessary to ensure compliance withfederal law, financial accountability, data integrity, and theassessment and accountability system. Prior to the 2004-05 biennium, the Texas Education Agency's local education agency monitoring centered on anon-site compliance review of every local education agencyapproximately every five to eight years, enhanced by a data-driven risk analysis to identify local education agenciesmost likely to have potential compliance issues. However,over the years the Texas Education Agency embarked onadditional monitoring functions, such as monitoringfinancial management and data quality. These functionsexisted as parallel, but not entirely coordinated, monitoringactivities at the agency. In response to House Bill 3459, the Texas Education Agency undertook a significant r eorganization of its local education agency monitoring function. The agencyestablished a plan to launch a new performance-basedmonitoring system sometime during the 2004-05 schoolyear, with the 2003-04 school year as a transition periodbetween systems. The performance-based monitoringsystem is intended to be a comprehensive, data-drivenmonitoring regime that abides by the mandates of HouseBill 3459 through a focus on student performance and dataquality indicators. This review provides a description of the state's local education agency monitoring efforts prior to House Bill3459 and the agency's new performance-based monitor-ing system. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bPrior to House Bill 3459, the Texas EducationAgency's monitoring functions were not integratedand were labor- and resource-intensive. Monitoring was conducted primarily through costly on-site visitsbased either on a cyclical schedule by which everydistrict would be visited in an eight-year period orthrough identification based on a system of risk-based indicators. Local education agency perfor-mance on student outcome-based indicators was notconsidered in selection for on-site visits. \u008bIn an effort to move from process-based monitoringto results-based monitoring and in response tolimitations imposed by House Bill 3459, the Texas Education Agency is developing a new, less resource-intensive, performance-based monitoring system.This system will rely on a set of data-driven perfor-mance indicators by which all local education agencieswill be evaluated annually in the areas of program effectiveness, financial management, and dataintegrity. Local education ag encies found to be \"at risk\" based on these indicators will be subject to agraduated schedule of intervention, ranging from anenhanced desk audit to on-site visits.

COMMENTS Prior to passage of House Bill 3459, the Texas EducationAgency (TEA) employed a noninte grated, multi-pronged approach to monitoring based primarily on on-site visits.Eleven differ ent divisions of the agency spent $8 million annually to monitor more than 150 different federal andstate programs. During the 2000-01 school year, the agency conducted over 1,000 on-site visits in over 700 districts. The primary focus of the monitoring methodology for program compliance and effectiveness was the DistrictEffectiveness and Compliance (DEC) system of on-sitevisits to districts. Under this system, every local educationagency (LEA) was scheduled for an on-site visit onceduring an eight-year cycle, during which a set of specialstudent programs would undergo a comprehensive review with regard to the LEA's compliance with state and federalrequirements, as well as its decision-making and planningprocess as it relates to the quality of services provided forall students, including those in special programs. Special programs reviewed included bilingual education/ English as a second language, career and technologyeducation, federal title programs, gifted and talented education, optional extended y ear programs, and special education. Requirements f or dyslexia services, prekindergarten notification procedures, and state compen-satory education expenditures were also reviewed. In support of or in lieu of on-site monitoring, TEA conducted risk assessments based on elements aimed atpredicting the likelihood that an LEA would be ineffectiveor noncompliant with state or federal law. These riskassessments relied on two data-driven systems: the ProgramAnalysis System (PAS) and the Special Education DataAnalysis System (DAS). PAS includes elements related tospecial state and federal prog ram areas, including bilingual education, compensatory educa tion, and federal title programs. DAS includes elements related to specialeducation. The PAS/DAS elements are risk-based ratherthan performance-based. The result of these assessmentsdetermined whether further intervention was warranted.Interventions ranged from requests for additional informa-tion to on-site visits.For a given year, an LEA was selected for a DEC visit through one of four possible methods of identification:(1) PAS or DAS Review, (2) special education complaints,(3) adverse special education due process hearing results, or(4) identification based on the eight-year cycle during whichevery district would receive a single visit. While all LEAs inTexas were part of the DEC visit cycle, PAS and DAS werethe primary systems used to identify additional districts forDEC visits. In addition to DEC visits, TEA regularly conducted other forms of on-site monitoring, including Initial OnsiteReviews (IOR) of charter schools, \"Needs Peer Review\" visits to alternative education campuses, reviews ofnonpublic facilities providing special education services ona contract basis, and other special reviews related togovernance, equal employment opportunity, or othercomplaints. Two other divisions within the agency alsoperformed primary monitoring functions: School FinancialAudits and Grants Administration. Other TEA divisionsconducted on-site reviews in program areas such as childnutrition, adult education, and charter schools. HOUSE BILL 3459 MONITORING PROVISIONS House Bill 3459 sharply limited TEA's compliance monitoring activities. With the exceptions of specialeducation, federally required or federally funded pro-grams, and special accreditation investigations, TEA mayno longer monitor education program compliance byschool districts, except with regard to the following: (1) compliance with federal law and regulations;(2) financial accountability, including compliance withgrant requirements; and (3) data integrity of submissionsto the Public Education Information Management System(PEIMS) and the assessment and accountability system. Program areas that no longer fall under traditional compliance monitoring include bilingual education,compensatory education, gifted and talented education,career and technology education, kindergarten/prekindergarten programs, adult education, and disciplin-ary alternative education programs. House Bill 3459makes the board of trustees in each school district andcharter school the primary entities responsible forensuring compliance with all requirements of these andother state education programs. The language of House Bill 3459 only restricts the scope of the agency's monitoring activities. It does not prescribe aperformance-based monitoring system. MONITORING AFTER HOUSE BILL 3459 In the 2004-05 biennium, All Funds appropriations to TEA administration were reduced by 20 percent from theprior biennium. In order to opera te effectively within theseSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 241ISSUES RELATED TO THE TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY'S PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE PUBLIC EDUCATION MONITORING reduced means, the agency underwent a reorganization, reducing their workforce by 25 percent. A major compo-nent of the reorganiza tion was a consolidation of the monitoring function at the agency. The number of divi-sions with monitoring responsibilities was consolidatedfrom eleven to three primary divisions, and positionsworking primarily on monitoring were likewise reduced by79 full-time-equivalent (FTE) positions. In response to both House Bill 3459 and agency budget cuts, TEA began developing a less resource-intensive,performance-based monitoring system to replace theDEC visits. The cyclical DEC-based system, in which 130-165 districts were identified for an on-site visit eac h year, was a labor- and resource-intensive process for both TEA and LEAs.The agency presented a new performance-based monitor- ing system not only as a way to respond to the limitationsof House Bill 3459 but also as an opportunity to adopt anew monitoring philosophy intended to shift the focusfrom process to results. The new system, according toTEA, would have a strong emphasis on data integrity,would focus on a coordinated a pproach to agency monitor- ing, and would feature a more creative application of sanctions and interventions. PERFORMANCE-BASED MONITORING Performance-based Monitoring (PBM) uses data and data analysis\u2014particularly student performance data on theTexas Assessment and Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) tests,dropout/completion data, program participation data, anddata quality\u2014as the basis for the identification of LEAs at-risk of poor program performance. LEAs flagged as at-riskbased on these data are subject to a set of graduated interventions, from an enhanced desk audit to a possibleon-site investigation. PBM aims to integrate data analysis from three different types of indicators into compr ehensive evaluation. The types of indicators are: student performance, programeffectiveness, and data integrity. Figure 3 shows a list ofpossible indicators in each of these areas using LimitedEnglish Proficiency programs as an example. An important feature of this system is that it places no new reporting requirements or burdens on LEAs by using datathat is already collected in various formats. This serves theagency's goal of creating a monitoring system that is lessresource-intensive for both the state and LEAs. Although many data indicators cut acr oss several programs, TEA intends to maintain individual program accountability.Evaluations will be structured to ensure that low perfor-mance in one program cannot be masked by high perfor-mance in another, or vice versa. To this end, the agency hasidentified specific program areas that will be subject toPBM review, listed in Figure 4.FIGURE 3 PERFORMANCE-BASED MONITORING INDICATORSEXAMPLE: LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT (LEP)PROGRAMS Student Performance LEP TAKS passing rate and performance on Reading Proficiency Test in English(RPTE) LEP year-after-exit TAKS passing rate LEP dropout rate Program Effectiveness LEP TAKS participation rate LEP exemptions LEP graduates from the Recommended High School Program Highly-qualified teachers in LEP program Data Integrity Leaver/dropout code use analysis Excessive absences on assessments SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.A \"data-driven model to observe, evaluate, and report on the public education system at the individual student group, campus, district, regional and statewide levels across diverse areas, including: programeffectiveness, compliance with federal and state law and regulations, financial management, and data integrity.\"FIGURE 2 PERFORMANCE-BASED MONITORINGAS DEFINED BY THE TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.Sec.7.027.

Data quality is of critical importance to amonitoring system like PBM that relies so heavily on LEA-reported data. Inaccurate or incomplete data in anyprogram area will undermine the agency's ability to evaluatethat program. As such, TEA plans to fully integrate dataquality analysis into its PBM design. In contrast to the DEC-based monitoring system, which targeted approximatel y one-eighth of LEAs annually according to an established cycle, under PBM the agencyplans to conduct a basic performance review of every LEAeach year. Based on this data analysis, a subset of LEAs will be identified as warranting further review. In addition tothese LEAs, the agency plans to identify a few randomlyselected LEAs for a more thorough review to assess thevalidity of its performance indicators on a continual basis. Under PBM, monitoring activities reflect minimal interven- tions for LEAs that demonstra te strong student perfor- mance and program effectiveness. For LEAs identified asat-risk, other strategies that are more cost-efficient than on-site monitoring are used first. For example, LEAs may be required to submit and adhere to improvement plans basedon the results of the performance analysis. When moreintensive interventions occur, they are designed to empha-size local flexibility and to minimize the burden related tocost and labor for LEAs to the extent possible. Specific levels of interv ention and the performance thresh- olds that trigger them will be fully described when TEAofficially launches the PBM system in the beginning of calendar year 2005.House Bill 3459 took effect September 1, 2003 and effectively prohibited the DEC-based system of monitor-ing. Under that system, approximately 165 LEAs werescheduled to receive an on-site visit in school year2003-04 as part of the eight-year cycle. Instead ofundergoing the scheduled on-site review, these 165 LEAsparticipated only in the special education monitoring planfor school year 2003-04. Of the 165 LEAs, a limitednumber were to be identified for intervention based onrisk levels as reflected in DAS. The Division of SpecialEducation Monitoring implemented special educationinterventions. In January 2004, TEA began developing proposed PBM core indicators. TEA launched the PBM data integritycommittee in March 2004. This committee conducts auditsof dropout records, absences, exemptions from stateassessment, alternative assessments, and disciplinaryalternative education programs (DAEPs). During thesummer of 2004, TEA senior staff reviewed the proposedcore indicators and da ta integrity indicators, and gathered input from stakeholders. Through the fall of 2004, TEAsenior staff and stakeholders revie wed the overall frame- work for agency monitoring. The 2004-05 PBM manualwas released in December 2004. During the 2003-04 school year, TEA was no longer authorized to continue its old monitoring function but it had not yet completed the task of designing a new one. Asa result, the school y ear became a transition period for state monitoring activity. The 165 LEAs scheduled for compre-hensive, on-site DEC visits were instead reviewed remotelyusing a transitional set of performance indicators; \"at risk\"LEAs were then identified for a series of graduatedinterventions. A concern with this transition a pproach is that is seems unnecessarily limited; it is not clear why, sincethe DEC-based monitoring system had ended, the agencylimited its transitional performance data-based review tothose 165 LEAs instead of all of them. Additionally, the PBM system is not scheduled for full implementation until the beginning of calendar year 2005.Another concern is that the timing of the launch of thenew system will result in a diminished monitoring capacityin the 2004-05 school year, which could compound anyadverse implications of the reduced monitoring in the2003-04 transition year. This report has highlighted some of the potential benefits of PBM: specifically, by shifting the monitoring focusfrom process to results, the system promises to be a lessresource-intensive way of identifying areas in which LEAsare not providing adequate services to students. There arepotential drawbacks to PBM as well. For example, thesystem produces an inherent risk that performance-basedFIGURE 4 FOCUS OF PERFORMANCE-BASED MONITORINGIDENTIFICATION \u008bBilingual Education \u008bSpecial Education \u008bCareer & Technology Education \u008bTitle Programs Under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) - Economically Disadvantaged Students (Title I, Part A)- Migrant Students (Title I, Part C) - Teacher Quality (Title II) - Limited English-proficient Students (Title III)- Safe and Drug-free Schools (Title IV) \u008bLeaver/dropout records \u008bAssessments (excessive absences/exemptions) \u008bDiscipline data (rate of disciplinary placements)PROGRAM DATA INTEGRITY SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 243ISSUES RELATED TO THE TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY'S PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE PUBLIC EDUCATION MONITORING measures based on aggregated data or averages could mask areas of noncompliance or ineffectiveness withincampuses or districts. Also, a performance-based monitoring system could produce an incentive for schools or districts to overlooknoncompliant activities that are perceived to have nonegative impact or even a positive impact on measuredobjectives. Finally, there is a danger that a monitoring system based primarily on raw student performance will unfairly target LEAs that have a disproportionate share of hard-to-educate students. LEAs in this category may have well-runprograms, but the socioeconomic status of its students maykeep TAKS passing and graduation rates relatively lowcompared to other LEAs around the state. One way to avoid this problem is to develop performance measures that focus on student progress from year to yearrather than raw test scores and passing rates. TEA hasrecognized this issue and flagged it as a priority for thefuture development of PBM.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 244ISSUES RELATED TO THE TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY'S PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE PUBLIC EDUCATION MONITORINGSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 245School districts receive additional state funding to offer courses in career and technology education. This is a fieldthat teaches occupational skills and knowledge. The\"weighted allotment\" for career and technology education funding is based on the assumption that these courses aremore expensive to teach because they involve smaller classsizes or special equipment and supplies. However, not allcourses that receive career and technology funding actuallyfeature these two factors that would make them cost more than regular education courses. In compliance with a rider in the 2004-05 General Appro- priations Act, the Texas Education Agency eliminatedseven career and technology courses from the list ofcourses that can generate additional weighted funding. The process used by the agency to identify courses for exclusionfrom weighted funding focused primarily on the BusinessEducation subject area and did not review all career andtechnology subject areas. A broad analysis of career andtechnology courses determined that excluding 12 additional courses, from six subject areas, that are taught similarly toregular education courses could sa ve the state General Revenue Fund about $7.1 million annually. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bAt least 12 secondary career and technologyeducation courses are taught in a manner almostidentical to regular education courses and as a resultthey can be excluded from the list of courses thatrequire weighted funding under the career andtechnology allotment. A mor e comprehensive review of career and technology courses would likely identify additional courses that do not requireweighted funding. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Reduce the appropriation for the Texas Education Agency's Foundation SchoolProgram by $7.1 million in General Revenue Fundsfor each year of the 2006-07 biennium. Thisamount corresponds to the savings achieved byexcluding 12 career and technology courses that donot require additional weighted funding. \u008bRecommendation 2: Include a rider in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill tha t requires the Texas Education Agency to conduct a comprehensiveLIMIT CAREER AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION FUNDING TO HIGH-COST COURSES review of all career and technology courses cur- rently eligible for weighted funding, and excludecourses that are taught in a conventional formatfrom receiving additional weighted funding. COMMENTS The mission of career and technology education is toensure that students master the skills and knowledgenecessary for managing the dual roles of family memberand wage earner (Texas Education Code \u00a7 29.181). The Texas Education Agency requires that school districts offera secondary curriculum including career and technologycourses in at least three of the following eight categories:career orientation, agricultural science, trade and industrial,family and consumer, technology education, marketing, health science, or business education (Texas AdministrativeCode \u00a7 74.3(b)(2)(I)). CAREER AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION FUNDING The state provided an estimated $500 million for career and technology education in fi scal year 2003. State funding is provided through two components of the FoundationSchool Program: the Tier 1 weighted allotment of 1.35 foreach full-time-equivalent student, and the Tier 2 guaranteedyield. Funding for a district depends on the number ofstudents taking career and technology courses. A formula is applied that converts career and technology students intofull-time-equivalent students. A full-time-equivalent student(FTE) in this case is a hypothetical student taking 30 hoursof career and technology coursework per week (six hours aday); for example, ten students taking a full year career andtechnology course translate to 1.67 FTEs (10 x (1/6 of a day)). A district's career and technology Tier 1 allotment isdetermined by the following formula: Adjusted basic allotment x Career and Technology full-time equivalents x 1.35 weight Tier 2 funding is also affected by the number of career and technology FTEs because that data influences the numberof students counted in weighted average daily attendance(WADA). A school district's WADA increases as thenumber of career and technology FTEs grows, whichSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 246LIMIT CAREER AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION FUNDING TO HIGH-COST COURSES increases the district's Tier 2 state aid. It is important to note, however, that not all school districts receive state aid through Tier 1 or Tier 2. A district that generates sufficient local funding, because of its property wealth, to meet itsstatutorily determined Tier 1 or Tier 2 funding needs willnot qualify for state funding in the Foundation SchoolProgram. STATE FUNDING AND COURSE COSTS In 2001, a review of career and technology education funding performed by the Legislative Budget Board (LBB)determined that the Texas Education Agency (TEA) haddirectly contributed to the 42 percent growth in Texas'costs for this weighted allotment between fiscal years 1995and 1999 by increasing the number of courses eligible forthe career and technology weight. The report recom-mended that the TEA study the instructional arrangementsof school district career and technology programs toidentify courses that can be taught in a conventionalacademic setting (e.g., business law) and therefore do notrequire additional weighted funding. In response to this recommenda tion, the Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, adopted a rider to theTEA appropriation requiring that the agency identify thosecourses least in need of the career and technology allot-ment and preclude school districts from receiving addi-tional weighted funding associated with those courses. Theagency identified only seven such courses, from a list of more than 400 career and technology courses. Agencycorrespondence indicates that the TEA focused onBusiness Education classes in this elimination processbecause the 2001 LBB review mentioned courses in thatsubject area that did not require weighted funding. TheTEA estimates that reclassifying these courses will save $10million per year in General Revenue Funds. As reflected in Figure 1, the seven courses TEA excluded from allotment eligibility represent only 4 percent of thetotal career and technology student completions (75,960student completions/1,819,600 total students). Also,savings from excluding the courses account for only about2 percent of the total allotment-related state funding, basedon fiscal year 2002 data. TEA staff indicated that theoverall goal of this effort was to focus primarily onbusiness education courses that do not require intensiveinstruction or extensive educational technology. The agencydid not conduct a comprehensive re view of all career and technology courses. 12 COURSES COULD BE EXCLUDED Many of the courses that curr ently receive the career and technology allotment merit the 1.35 weight because oflower student-teacher ratios and higher expenses forequipment and supplies, but others do not. For example,business law courses can use the same instructional arrangement as regular academic classes. A broad analysis of career and technology courses revealed that at least 12 courses should not be included in the list ofeligible classes. School district and TEA staff indicated that these courses are taught without small class sizes orexpensive special equipment or supplies. Figure 2 showsthat these courses are primarily introductions to certainfields, or they give students \"lif e skill\" information that can be provided without low class sizes or costly supplies andmaterials found in courses such as those for medicalscience or electronics. For example , in the business law course, students learn about legal issues facing moderncorporations. However, the course description does notpoint to a need for special materials or small class sizes inorder for the instruction to be effective. It is estimated that excluding these courses from the career and technology weight could save Texas $7.1 million peryear in General Revenue. This is based on calculating thetotal career and technology state allotment cost of thesecourses using the number of students who completed thesecourses in the 2002-03 school year. Excluding these courses from receiving the career and technology allotment would not have a significant affect on the funding received by school districts. These 12 coursesrepresent approximately 4,400 full-time-equivalent students,or 3 percent of total car eer and technology full-time- equivalent students, and 2 percent of estimated state careerFIGURE 1 COURSES EXCLUDED FROM THE CAREER AND TECHNOLOGY ALLOTMENT BY THETEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY STUDENTS COMPLETING COURSE AREA COURSE 1.

To ensure that at least this level of savings occurs, the appro- priation to the Foundation School Program for fiscal years2006 and 2007 would be reduced by $7.1 million each yearin General Revenue Funds (Recommendation 1). Figure 3reflects the annual savings tha t would result from imple- mentation of Recommendation 1. Recommendation 2 would require the TEA to review all career and technology courses currently eligible forweighted funding to identify those that are be taught inwithout the use of high-cost factors such as small class sizeand special equipment. The review should indicate whichcourses would not be eligible for the 1.35 weight under thisstandard. The following rider should be included in the2006-07 General Appropriations Act in order to requirethe agency to implement this recommendation: Career and Technology Education Allotment Programs Eligibility. Funds appropriated above in Strategy A.1.1, FSP-Equalized Operations, for theCareer and Technology Education allotment shallnot be used to provide weighted funding forprograms identified by the Commissioner as least inneed of the additional funding provided by theallotment.

Additionally, it is the intent of the Legislature that no more than 10 percent of each school district'sFoundation School Program Career and TechnologyEducation allotment under the Texas EducationCode \u00a7 42.154 may be expended for indirect costs related to the career and technology educationprograms. In conclusion, implementation of the two recommenda- tions would improve the efficiency of career and technol-ogy funding by focusing the allotment on actual high costcourses. The principle underlying these recommendations isthat vocational courses that are taught in a standard lectureformat should be treated as regular education classes forthe purpose of determining school finance allocations, while courses that require costly supplies, equipment, orinstructional methods should receive additional weightedfunding. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a $14.2 million reduction in General RevenueFunds pursuant to Recommendation 1. The bill alsoincludes the aforementioned rider to implement Recom-mendation 2.SOURCE : Legislative FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACTSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 248LIMIT CAREER AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION FUNDING TO HIGH-COST COURSESSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 249REFORM THE STATE'S PROCESS OF PURCHASING PUBLIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS During the Regular Session of the Seventy-eighth Legisla- ture, 2003, as the state faced a large budgetary shortfall, theTexas Education Agency's funding request for instructionalmaterials was $653 million for the 2004-05 biennium. Thisrequest, the highest ever for Texas, represented an increaseof over 14 percent from the prior biennium and wasdouble the appropriation for textbooks just three bienniaearlier. Ultimately, the legislature decided to provide partial funding for textbooks in the 2004-05 biennium, appropri-ating $404 million, deferring $145 million in purchases ofsome English as a second language and all career andtechnology education textbooks until the 2006-07 bien- nium, and implementing measures to reduce overall costs.This funding solution was a temporary one; while it helpedthe legislature through the 2004-05 budget crisis, it hascompounded the funding demand of instructional materi-als for the 2006-07 biennium. The Texas EducationAgency's funding request for the 2006-07 biennium is $718million, and that amount assumes no purchases of newtextbooks in the second year of the biennium. The legislature's experience of funding textbooks for the current biennium combined with the consistently strongincreases in the demand textbooks have placed on the statebudget in recent years ha ve brought into sharp focus several concerns about the process by which publiceducation textbooks are priced and purchased in Texas. This report identifies and describes these concerns in detailand makes recommendations on ways the process can beimproved and how the cost of instructional materials maybe better managed. SIGNIFICANT FINDING \u008bState funds dedicated for purchases of instructionalmaterials have increased significantly over the last sixbiennia (1994-95 through 2006-07 requested), withaverage biennial increases in excess of 13 percent. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bDecisions on how much the state is expected to payfor textbooks are made and loc ked in two and three years prior to the legislative session during which theappropriations are made. The decision is made bythe elected State Board of Education.\u008bThe State Board's method for establishing a maxi-mum cost\u2014increasing the average catalog price of atextbook by 5 percent for eac h of the three years between proclamation announcement and pur-chase\u2014is flawed and builds in unnecessary andexcessive expense to the state's textbook purchase. \u008bSchool districts have no incentive to select textbookswith costs lower than the established maximum cost,because the state will pay the full amount up to themaximum cost. \u008bWithout a school district incentive for cost contain-ment there is no competitive incentive for textbookpublishers to keep textbook costs low. As one mightexpect, publishers gener ally set their textbook prices at or very near the maximum cost allowed. \u008bA number of other textbook procurement policychanges\u2014from a district distribution system basedon enrollment trends to cooperation with otherstates\u2014also offer the potential to slow the growth inthe cost of instructional materials. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: The textbook procurement process should be overhauled to incorporateincentives for districts to select lower-cost textbooks.Two potential options for creating cost incentivesare (1) to expand the textbook credit pilot programstatewide or (2) to implement a new funding-basedincentive system. \u008bRecommendation 2: The maximum cost calcula- tion should be revised to reflect more reasonableestimates of inflationary pressures. \u008bRecommendation 3: Appropriate steps should be taken that have the potential to contain the cost ofinstructional materials, including the following:negotiating with publishers to purchase the printingrights for consumable materials; purchasing fewerbooks but distributing them more efficiently basedon a 3-year average enrollment trend basis; andfunding Braille and large-type textbooks with federalIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act funds. \u008bRecommendation 4: A cooperative agreement should be established with the State EducationSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 250REFORM THE STATE'S PROCESS OF PURCHASING PUBLIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS Departments of California and Florida to share information and strategies for keeping textbookprices low. COMMENTS The cost of instructional materials has exhibited strong andconsistent growth over the last three biennia. Although thefinal appropriations for the 2004-05 biennium are $404million, the Texas Education Ag ency's (TEA's) initial request of $653 million was double the $326 millionappropriated just six years earlier. Figure 1 shows appropriations for instructional materials since the 1992-93 biennium. With few exceptions, until the2004-05 biennium the legislature appropriated the amountrequested by the TEA. This pa ttern clearly broke during the Seventy-eighth Legislative Session, 2003, when abudgetary shortfall forced both cost-savings measures anda deferral of textbook purchases to the 2006-07 biennium.It should be noted that the Seventy-eighth Legislature alsorequested that the State Board of Education (SBOE) notschedule any textbooks for purchase in fiscal year 2007, towhich the SBOE assented. Had the SBOE kept its prospec-tive textbook adoption schedule, cost demands in theupcoming 2006-07 biennium easily would have exceeded$800 million.COST COMPONENTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS To understand what has been driving these steady increases in instructional materials costs, it helps to know what thestate is purchasing. As Figure 2 illustrates, there are threecategories of costs: new textbooks, continuing contracts,and administration of the textbook division at the TEA. Most discussions of instructional materials funding focus on the purchase of new textbooks which, for the 2006-07biennium, account for over 73 percent of the TEA's budget request. The quantity and cost of the new textbooks in anygiven year is determined by the SBOE's adoption cycle,which schedules textbooks of particular subjects and gradelevels for review, adoption, and purchase every six to nine years. Less frequently discussed is a set of funding obligations collectively referred to as \"continuing contracts,\" whichrepresent over 26 percent of the 2006-07 budgeted cost.The largest among these are consumable materials, whichare the workbooks and other complementary productsdesigned to be used and thrown away at the end of a singleyear. Instructional materials funding also pays for additional copies of textbooks currently in use in school districts thatare needed due to enrollment growth, to replace unusableand worn-out textbooks, and to replace books damaged ordestroyed by natural disasters lik e fire and flood. Also, Braille, large-type, and audio books are purchased forstudents with visual or hearing impairments.

INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS FUNDING Texas is one of only a handful of states in which the state provides a specific appropriation that pays for nearly allschool district instructional materials needs. Under theTexas Constitution, the state is required to provide free textbooks for all children attending Texas public schools(Figure 3). The source of state funding for instructional materials is the State Textbook Fund, which is simply funds from theAvailable School Fund (ASF) in the amount of thetextbook appropriation. The ASF comprises a distribution from the Permanent School Fund and one-quarter of themotor fuels and occupations tax revenue. Although theTexas Constitution speaks of the SBOE setting aside asufficient amount of funds to purchase textbooks, the levelof funding is determined by legislative appropriation.THE ADOPTION PROCESS Texas is one of 22 states with a process by which the state adopts a selected list of approved textbooks that districtsmay purchase with state funds. The Texas Education Code,Chapter 31, provides for the adoption of two separate lists of textbooks. Textbooks on the \"conforming\" list mustmeet manufacturing standards, be fr ee from factual errors, and contain material covering each element of the TexasEssential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) curriculum. The\"nonconforming\" list consists of books that meet manu-facturing standards, are free from factual errors, and coverat least half (but not all) of the TEKS curriculum. Text-books not making either list are r ejected. State funds may be used to purchase any textbook on the conforming andnonconforming lists. The SBOE begins the textbook adoption process by issuing a request for publishers to bid for new materials, called aproclamation . Proclamations identify the subject areas and grade levels scheduled to start the review, adoption, andpurchase cycle, along with the maximum costs per book thestate will pay for each subject area. The journey from theannouncement of a proclamation to the purchase of the textbooks is a long one, generally taking three and one-halfyears. Accordingly, there is a four-year lag between the proclamation year and the sc hool year in which the textbooks are purchased and used, as well as the fiscal year which contains the appropriations tha t pay for them. For example, Proclamation 2002, announced in the spring of2002, identifies a set of textbooks that will make their wayinto schools in the 2005-06 school year and that will bepurchased with fiscal year 2006 appropriations. Figure 4 shows the calendar for Proclamation 2002.FIGURE 2 THE COST OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS: TOTAL 2006-07 BIENNIAL REQUEST - $718 MILLION SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.

The SBOE then makes thefinal decisions as to whether each textbook is adopted andplaced on the conforming, nonconforming, or rejected lists. Local school boards are charged with establishing local policy for selecting new instructional materials. During thespring prior to the start of the school year in which thetextbooks will first be used, school districts transmit bookorders electronically to the TEA via the EducationalMaterials and Textbooks system, an internet-based system.The TEA verifies orders against enrollment data for eachdistrict, then submits them to be filled by the textbookpublishers. The publishers generally wait for these ordersbefore printing the books; the materials are then deliveredto school districts during the summer months prior to thestart of school. Publishers w ho fail to deliver books by the first day of school may be subject to administrative penalties. Finally, in the first few months of the fiscal yearwhich corresponds with the sc hool year, the TEA makes scheduled payments to publisher s for the instructional materials. INCREASING TEXTBOOK COSTS This section examines the textbook adoption and purchase process described above for flaws that may be contributingto the continually increasing cost of instructional materials.However, it is important to recognize possible causes that have little or nothing to do with the way the state of Texasbuys its public education textbooks. External Factors: First, it should be acknowledged that large annual increases in the cost of instructional materialsover the last decade have not been limited to the state ofTexas. Many states are grappling with rising textbook costs,the most recent being California, where the generalassembly passed a bill this year addressing this problem.Nor is the issue limited to the public education realm; thespiraling cost of college textbooks has drawn nationalattention as well. One suggested cause is the consolidation of the educa- tional textbook publishing industry during the 1990s, inwhich the number of providers in the industry shrank froma dozen or so to primarily four: McGraw-Hill, Pearson,Harcourt, and Houghton-Mifflin. It is argued that suchconsolidation has stifled competition, driving up prices. Textbook publishers counter that states have added significantly to the cost of producing textbooks by(1) adopting comprehensive and specific curriculumstandards, (2) including requirements for state-specificinformation, limiting the feasibility of selling those booksto markets in other states, and (3) erecting complicatedand resource-intensive review and adoption procedures.The more complicated and demanding these procedures,the more opportunities a textbook has of running afoulof them, jeopardizing the large developmental costsalready invested into the book. For Texas specifically,publishers point to the adoption of the new curriculumstandards\u2014the TEKS\u2014in 1997. Publishers suggest thatthe costs of developing new textbooks that covered 100percent of the TEKS elements (in order to be considered\"conforming\") was a key driver in higher textbook pricesover the last few years. Certainly these factors help explain the strong increases in textbook costs over the past decade. However, evidencesuggests that during the year s of strong growth in textbook costs in Texas (as well as around the country), the financialimpact on textbook publishers w as not neutral but rather quite positive. Figure 5 illustra tes the operating profit margin of the five primary educational publishers in theindustry over the last dozen years.

Internal Factors: Setting aside these factors, it is clear that there are several characteristics of the state's current systemof pricing and purchasing te xtbooks that appear to be contributing to the escalating cost of instructional materi-als. This report identifies four key problems: 1. The SBOE, rather than the legislature, establishes the expected textbook costs borne by the state in future years.Proclamations, by establishing the number of subject areasand grade levels for whic h textbooks will be purchased and then by setting the maximum costs of these books,establish expected textbook costs for that adoption cycle.As discussed earlier, proclamations are determined andannounced by the SBOE with little, if any, legislative input and are made two and three years prior to the legislativesession during which the textbook appropriations are made. As a result, every session the Texas Legislature, the bodywhich is responsible for balancing the costs of textbooksagainst other budgetary needs, faces textbook fundingdemands that it had little to no say in setting and which aredifficult to change. Past proclamations suggest that cost, w hile a peripheral concern, has not been a major factor in the design of theadoption cycle. Other concerns, such as ensuring thatstudents have access to textbooks that are fully aligned with the TEKS in core curriculum subject areas as quickly aspossible, have taken precedent. Proponents justify this byciting Texas' high-stakes system of testing and accountabil- ity. However, other proclamation practices, such aspurchasing whole subject areas or all grades in a particularsubject area in a single proclamation, do not possess thesame urgency and may warrant reconsideration duringyears of tight state budgets. While the composition of the proclamations certainly drives total annual textbook costs, it is not a sufficientexplanation of the strong and consistent increases in costsof the last decade. A closer look at publisher prices overthe same time period indicate that they have shown strongincreases as well. Figure 6 gives an example: social studiestextbooks for grades one through six were part ofProclamation 1994 and again in Proclamation 2000.During that six-year period, the average maximum costfor those books increased by 41 percent, for an annualgrowth rate of 5.9 percent. 4.0%6.0%8.0%10.0%12.0%14.0%16.0%18.0% 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Average includes Harcourt, Houghton Mifflin, McGraw-Hill, Pearson/Simon & Schuster and John WileyFIGURE 5 EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHERS' OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN SOURCE : Goldman Sachs Research estimates. FIGURE 6SOCIAL STUDIES, GRADES 1-6 INCREASE SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 254REFORM THE STATE'S PROCESS OF PURCHASING PUBLIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS The trend for social studies textbooks appears fairly representative of the overall trend during this time period,and a closer look at the data indicate that the state's policyof setting maximum costs for textbooks may be contribut-ing to these cost increases. 2. The SBOE's method for establishing a maximum cost is flawed. The policy of assigning maximum costs to text- books was adopted into law in 1995 by the Seventy-fourthLegislature in order to give both publishers and thelegislature an idea as to what the state could be expected topay for textbooks. The legislature left it up to the SBOE todetermine the calculation of the maximum cost. The SBOE adopted a calculation that takes the average of the publishers' catalog prices for the textbook in eachsubject area and grade, and increases it by 5 percent foreach of the three years between proclamation announce-ment and purchase. This 5 percent inflation adjustmentapparently was intended to account for increasing publisherproduction costs, particularly in the raw materials of paperand ink. The problem with this methodology, however, is that it has effectively locked in 5 percent as the minimum annual growth in textbook prices, regardless of whether 5 percentis an accurate reflection of una voidable textbook produc- tion cost pressures. Indeed, 5 percent appears to have been an excessive inflationary adjustment over the last decade. This reportanalyzed increases in maximum costs for all textbooks thathave been through two adoptions under the maximum costsystem; specifically, textbooks adopted under Proclama-tions 1994 or 1995 that have been readopted in Proclama-tions 2000 through 2004. Figure 7 shows the averageannual change in the maximum cost for these books andcompares it to an array of items that arguably can be usedas benchmarks of cost pressures. The average annual increase in costs for textbooks over this time period has been 5.45 percent. As the figure shows, thisgreatly exceeds the cost pressur es publishers have faced from increase in the price of the ra w materials, which was a purported driver of the 5 percent maximum cost assump-tion: the producer price index for paper and printing inkincreased only 1.1 percent during the same years. Similarly,a maximum cost inflation adjustment tied to the actualConsumer Price Index (CPI) would have yielded maximumcost increases of less than half of what occurred. Growthrates for broader indicators of public education spend-ing\u2014average teacher salaries and operating expendituresper pupil\u2014are closer but still fall short of textbook costincreases. These data suggest that the SBOE's policy of setting maximum textbook costs by growing publishers' catalogprices by 5 percent a year has built in unnecessary andexcessive expense to the state's textbook purchases. These problems with the maximum cost policy are impor- tant, but only exacerbate a more fundamental flaw in Texas' system of pricing and purchasing textbooks: the lack ofincentives for school districts and publishers to containcosts. 3. School districts have no incentive to select textbooks with costs lower than the established maximum cost. Texas'constitutional guarantee that the sta te will provide free textbooks to all students in its public schools is admirable,but it does contribute to an unintended problem. Since theprinciple of local control, codified in the Texas EducationCode Chapter 31, allows school districts to select whichtextbooks they want to use (albeit from state-approved lists); and because the state is constitutionally required topay for whatever choice they make, districts have no financial incentive to consider cost in their selection.Indeed, since the state will pay up to the maximum cost fora textbook, there may be an incentive to districts to selectbooks at or near the maximum cost under the assumptionthat by doing so the districts would get the most textbook\"bang\" for the state's buck. During the Seventy-seventh Legislative Session, 2001, the legislature recognized this fundamental lack of marketincentives and took a step to remedy it by establishing atextbook credit pilot program, which provides a financialbenefit to districts that select textbooks priced below themaximum cost. However, this pilot program remainslimited to 30 districts. 4. There is no competitive incentive for textbook publishers to keep textbook costs low. Without a school districtincentive to select lower cost textbooks, it is no surprisethat publishers generally set their textbook prices at or very near the maximum cost allowed. Figure 8 compares the average publisher price of textbooks in the last three purchased Pr oclamations (1999, 2000, and FIGURE 7 AVERAGE ANNUAL INCREASE IN TEXTBOOK COSTS\u2014PROCLAMATIONS 1994-1995 TO PROCLAMATIONS 2000-2004, CostTextbooks\u2014Maximum CostTextbooks\u2014Maximum Cost 5.45%5.45%5.45%5.45%5.45% Total District Operating Expenditures per Pupil 4.45%Average Texas Teacher Salary 3.20% Average Annual Inflation Rate (CPI) 2.43% Average Annual Increase Producer Price Index\u2014Paper 1.10% plus Printing Ink SOURCES : Texas Education Agency; National Education Association; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 255REFORM THE STATE'S PROCESS OF PURCHASING PUBLIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS 2001) to the average maximum cost established for those books. Over those three Proclamations, the publisher priceaveraged 97 percent of the maximum cost. In dollar terms,this represents an average publisher price of $45.34 per bookcompared to a $46.73 maximum cost, a difference of $1.39. Because local school districts have little reason to consider cost in their textbook selection decisions, publishers feel nocompetitive pressure to keep the costs of their textbookslow. In fact, this absence of a market incentive has likely driven textbook prices up. Because they need not competeon price, textbook publishers attempt to win schooldistricts as customers with \"free\" ancillary materials; that is,software and CD-ROMs, question sets, quizzes, and othersupplemental materials or services, including teachertraining. Of course, these items are not free, but rather their costs are factored into the price of the studenttextbooks and help to push their prices toward the maxi-mum cost. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORM To address the concerns identified above, this section describes recommendations for reforming the currenttextbook pricing and purchasing system in Texas, in orderof importance. Recommendation 1: The textbook procurement process should be overhauled to incorporate incentives for districtsto select lower cost textbooks. The combination of local control over textbook selection and state obligation to pay for those books has created asystem that provides no benefit to school districts who arefinancially prudent with their textbook choices. The Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, recognized this flaw and passed House Bill 623, which created the TextbookCredit Pilot Project (Texas Education Code \u00a7 31.1011).This pilot awarded credits for textbooks to school districts that purchased textbooks belo w the established maximum cost. For the textbooks falling below the maximum cost,the dollar amount difference between the actual cost of thetextbook and the maximum cost was split evenly betweenthe district and the state. The district could use the creditstoward the purchase of additional bound or electronictextbooks. The state's share of the savings reverts to theState Textbook Fund. This pilot ends after the currentschool year, and the enabling statute requires the TEA todeliver a report on the project to the Seventy-ninthLegislature, 2005. Ten districts participated in the pilot during the 2002-03 school year, with an additional 10 joining in each of thenext two years. The project had a promising start, with the10 districts producing nearly $182,000 in cost savingsbelow the maximum cost, representing a $91,000 savingsto the state. However, in the two subsequent years statesavings dropped to $63,000 despite the addition of 10more districts, and to $7,300 from 30 districts in the finalyear of the project. The pilot districts realized littlesavings in the final two years mainly because they werechoosing textbooks in subject areas in which pricesdiffered little among publishers: they were all at or aroundthe maximum cost. The lesson of the pilot project wasthat school districts would respond well to a financialincentive in their selection of textbooks, even though the pilot was too small to force textbook publishers to price their books more competitively. As a solution, this report recommends that the Textbook Credit Pilot Project drop its pilot status and be expanded toall school districts and charter schools in the state. A clearsignal from the Seventh-ninth Legislature, 2005, on theintent to make this a statewide program could affect theFIGURE 8 PUBLISHER PRICES COMPARED TO MAXIMUM COSTS, PROCLAMATIONS 1999-2001 1999 Science $60.84 $59.86 98.4% 2000 Social Studies, Prekindergarten, Economics $52.75 $53.17 Biology, English as a Second Language, $43.35 $41.39 95.5% Career & uses simple averages, which are not weighted for number of books purchased in each subject area. 2.

While expanding the credit prog ram statewide would be a major advance in instilling market incentives into thetextbook procurement process in Texas, it is not without itsshortcomings. First, districts ma y only spend credits they earn in the program on additional textbooks, which may beless of an incentive for districts to select low-cost text-books than it could be if districts were allowed to use thosecredits on any district need. Second, the program reduces the state's textbook costs by one-half as much as it could,since 50 percent of the cost savings must be shared withdistricts in the form of credits. To address these shortcomings, the state could implement, through a combination of statutory changes and adminis-trative rules, an alternative incentive-based funding system.The following \"90 percent alloca tion\" system is offered as an example: 1. For each Proclamation, the maximum cost for each textbook is calculated and the total cost of eachproclamation is determined. For example, assume Proclamation 2005 will cost $250 million. 2. Prior to school districts selecting which textbooks to purchase, the TEA divides the total proclamationcost among all districts based on expected enroll-ment levels, and an initial textbook allocationamount is calculated for each district. 3. Districts are then directed to select textbooks based on the assumption that the state's textbook appro-priation will be 90 percent of this allocation. Thiswould be a state savings of $25 million. 4. If a district can select enough low-cost textbooks that it does not spend all of its 90 percent allocation,the district may use the remaining funds for anypurpose. 5. If a district's selection of textbooks costs more than the 90 percent allocation, the difference is paid forout of funds the district would receive through theTechnology Allotment (which runs in excess of$120 million each year). Possible benefits to a system like this include the following: \u008bIt provides strong incentives to districts to select low-cost textbooks; districts face a loss of technol-ogy funds if their selection of textbooks exceeds the90 percent allocation but gain all-purpose funds iftheir textbook selection falls below the 90 percentthreshold. These district incentives should in turntranslate into strong incentives for publishers to price their textbooks competitively. \u008bThe state has the power to set a cost-savings target(10 percent in this scenario) and receive the fullbenefit of these cost savings. \u008bThe state can maintain its constitutional obligationto fully fund textbooks by tapping the TechnologyAllotment as an emergency supplemental fundingsource. \u008bBased on the prices submitted by publishers, thecost-savings target can be lessened (if 10 percent isdeemed too punitive) or increased (if it is deemedthat more savings can be achieved). This applies toonly the textbooks purchased in the first year of abiennium. Potential drawbacks include the following: \u008bIf publishers do not respond to the incentive to lower their textbook prices or if the cost-savingstarget is unrealistically high, this system will bepunitive toward districts and achieve textbook costsavings only through a reduction in the TechnologyAllotment. \u008bSignificant percentage point reductions in costcannot be sustained in perpetuity; after one fulladoption cycle of cost savings, expectations forfuture savings may be minimal. Recommendation 2: The SBOE should revise the maxi- mum cost calculation to reflect more reasonable estimatesof inflationary pressures. Regardless of whether the procurement process is changed to include district incentives for selecting lowercost textbooks, the SBOE's calculation of maximum costneeds revision. As discussed in this report, the currentpolicy of increasing publishers' catalog prices by 5percent for each of the three years between proclamationand purchase has overstated inflationary pressures ontextbook costs and has built in unnecessary and excessiveexpense to the state's textbook purchases over the lastdecade. The reliance on publishers' catalog prices as a base for the maximum cost is unfortunate but perhaps necessary absentanother clear starting point. Easier to address is the 5percent calculation; this assumption was based on costincreases in raw materials\u2014primarily paper and ink\u2014at thetime the policy was adopted in the mid-1990s. As thisreport suggests, costs of these raw materials did not sustainthose high rates of increase. Furthermore, it is not clearwhy the inflation adjustment should be based wholly onSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 257REFORM THE STATE'S PROCESS OF PURCHASING PUBLIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS raw material costs that, according to the publishers themselves, account for only around 7 percent of totaltextbook costs. This report recommends that the SBOE abandon this static inflation assumption and instead apply projections of thenational Consumer Price Index (CPI). This would cut theinflation adjustment approximately in half\u2014the CPI hasaveraged 2.43 percent over the last 10 years\u2014and shouldbe updated regularly, fluctua ting with changes in inflation- ary pressures. This could be accomplished through achange in the SBOE's administrative rules. This recommendation should provide a more accurate and reasonable assumption about textbook price increases dueto inflation. For example, had the CPI been used for theProclamation 2002 textbooks sc heduled for purchase in 2006, the maximum cost of those books would have been$351 million, a $27 million (7 percent) decrease from thecurrent $378 million price tag. Recommendation 3: Appropriate measures should be adopted that have the potential to contain the cost ofinstructional materials. Smaller changes can be made to Texas' adoption process that may help contain the cost of instructional materials.The TEA could be directed by rider to enact the followingpotential cost-saving measures: \u008bThe SBOE should seek Legislative Budget Board and the Governorprior to the approval and announcement of eachProclamation regarding the number of textbooksscheduled for adoption and the accompanying totalestimated maximum cost. Because the content ofeach Proclamation effectively establishes thetextbook funding demand the legislature must dealwith three years after the proclamation is an-nounced, improved communication and coordina-tion between the SBOE and the legislature at thetime the proclamations are determined may preventtheir cost from diverging significantly from legisla-tive expectations. \u008bThe TEA should explore the possibility of negotiat-ing with publishers to purchase the printing rightsfor consumable materials. Consumable materials\u2014estimated to cost $94 million in the 2006-07biennium\u2014represent a significant long-term cost tothe state. The TEA should investigate whethersavings could be achieved if the state acquired therights to produce these materials itself. This mayallow the state to use c heaper materials and print only a subset of the items on an as-needed basis.\u008bThe TEA should not distribute surplus textbooksevenly across school districts , but rather according to expected need based on enrollment trends. The2006-07 request for textbook funds represents apurchase of 105 percent of estimated statewideenrollment, with each district slated to receive theadditional 5 percent to cover unanticipated enroll-ment growth. However, fast-growth, flat-growth,and negative growth districts can be predicted usingenrollment trend data; and these surplus books canbe distributed more efficiently based on projectedneed. Under such a distribution system, the statemay be able to lower the number of surplustextbooks purchased, with eac h percentage point drop from the 105 percent assumption representinga $5 million biennial savings. \u008bBraille and large-type textbooks should be fundedwith federal Individuals with Disabilities EducationAct (IDEA) funds. These instructional materials areestimated to cost $8.5 million in the 2006-07biennium but are an allowable expense for IDEAPart B state-level discretionary funds. The TEA isexpected to receive a pproximately $110 million in this type of IDEA Part B funds for the 2006-07biennium. Recommendation 4: The TEA should establish a coopera- tive agreement with California, and Florida to shareinformation and strategies for keeping textbook prices low. The states of Texas, California and Florida are the three largest \"textbook adoption\" states in the country andtogether represent over 27 percent of the nation's publicschool students and thus over one quarter of the nationalpublic education textbook market. As a result, decisions and policies made in these states regarding textbookcontent and pricing essentially dictate textbook content andpricing for the nation. Given this potential market leverage, it is reasonable to assume that with a minimal lev el of communication these states could establish coordinated policies to attempt tocontain textbook costs. However, currently there is verylittle communication and coordination between the stateeducation agencies in these states. A starting point can be the sharing of information regard- ing what publishers are charging each state for similartextbooks. Texas, California, and Florida, along with mostother states, have a \"most favored nation\" clause regardingtextbooks; specifically, publishers may not sell a textbook toTexas for a price higher than they are selling the sametextbook to another state. However, analysis of textbooksand prices across the states are rarely conducted in order toSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 258REFORM THE STATE'S PROCESS OF PURCHASING PUBLIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS see if publishers are follo wing this clause, and an agree- ment between the largest three \"adoption states\" couldfacilitate such analysis. A consequence of the \"most favored nation\" clause is that one state may have a textbook policy which intentionally orunintentionally inflates textbook costs; publishers may then effectively \"export\" these higher costs to other states,because the original state's \"most favored nation\" clauseforbids publishers from charging any other state less fortheir textbooks. Cooperation between Texas, California, and Florida and the sharing of strategies for containing textbook costs mayhelp identify instances where one state's policies are havingnegative nationwide consequences. Also, such coordinationwould give the states the ability to present a more unitedfront to publishers, perhaps ensuring greater success inefforts to curb some expensive trends in public educationinstructional materials, such as the proliferation of the\"free\" ancillary materials tha t accompany textbooks. The TEA could be directed by rider to pursue such a coopera-tive agreement. As the funding demand of instructional materials has grown sharply over the last few years, so has recognitionthat Texas' system of pricing and purchasing textbookspossesses serious flaws that have contributed to theescalating cost. During the current biennium, the TEAhas been forced to enact some cost-savings measures inresponse to a reduced level of textbook appropriations.Interim committees in both chambers of the TexasLegislature are charged with finding ways to improve thestate's delivery of instructional materials to students,including consideration of electronic and web-basedmaterials. Finally, the SBOE has initiated a review of itspolicies regarding the establishment of textbookmaximum costs. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Any overhaul of the current textbook procurement process, including actions specified in the report recom-mendations, would affect at the earliest Pr oclamation 2005 and thus not have a significant fiscal impact until the2008-09 biennium. However, smaller reforms, includingthose identified in this report, may be pursued during theinterim, enabling the state to mo ve toward a more competi- tive and efficient textbook procurement process andpotentially freeing millions of state dollars for other publiceducation funding needs.One cost-saving measure under Recommendation 3, thatBraille and large-type textbooks be purchased with FederalIDEA Funds, has been included in the introduced2006-07 General Appropriations Bill. This yields asavings to General Revenue Funds of $8.5 million for the2006-07 biennium.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 259UPDATE ON THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which is the most current federal reauthorization of the Elementary andSecondary Education Act of 1965, was signed into law twoyears ago. This legislation sets the authorized funding levelsfor the main sources of f ederal aid to public schools. Congress determines the actual funding in the annualappropriation process. For fiscal year 2004, Texas received $1.9 billion in federal funding for programs authorized bythe No Child Left Behind Act. In exchange for increasedfederal funding, states must strengthen the accountabilityframework established after the 1994 reauthorization ofElementary and Secondary Education Act and implementadditional education reforms. This report provides anupdate on the No Child Left Behind Act, with an emphasison teacher quality and adequate yearly progress provisions.This federal law established a number of requirements on both the state and local school districts, driving costs thatare not within the control of the state. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe U.S. Department of Education, as required forthe first time by the No Child Left Behind Act, usedthe most recent census data to distribute fiscal year2004 Title I, Part A Grants to Local EducationalAgencies, to states. Texas' allocation increased by$92.2 million over the previous funding level to $1.1billion in fiscal year 2004. \u008bThe No Child Left Behind Act provides FederalFunds to assist states in the development andimplementation of their assessments; Texas willreceive approximately $22.7 million in each year ofthe 2006-07 biennium for this purpose. Thisamount does not cover the state's total expensesrelated to testing, which are anticipated to reach $61.0 million in fiscal year 2006. \u008bEven though Title I, Part A funds do not flow to allschool districts, all public sc hool teachers of core academic courses must be highly qualified by the2005-06 school year. According to the TexasEducation Agency, survey data indicate that 95.6percent of teachers in Texas public schools met theNo Child Left Behind Act's definition of \"highlyqualified\" in their primary assignment at the end ofthe 2003-04 school year.COMMENTS Congress enacted the Elementary and Secondary Educa-tion Act (ESEA) in 1965 to assist states and school districtsin meeting the educational needs of economically andeducationally disadvantaged c hildren. Title I, Part A of ESEA, authorizes the primary source of federal fundingfor elementary and secondary education. ESEA has beenextended and amended several times since its enactment.Congress made significant changes to Title I, Part A whenit passed a reauthorization of ESEA in 1994 to addressconcerns that increased feder al funding was not signifi- cantly improving the academic achievement of disadvan-taged students. States were required to develop challengingcurriculum content and performance standards, assess-ments aligned with content standards, and accountabilitysystems to assess student achievement. The ESEA setdeadlines for states to comply with these requirements.Texas was one of the 19 states that received approval formeeting the 1994 ESEA requirements by the 2000-01school year deadline. Congress did not eliminate any of the 1994 ESEA require- ments with the passage of the No Child Left Behind(NCLB) Act of 2001. The NCLB Act amended ESEA toadd additional requirements such as increasing studentassessments, collecting and distributing results of studentachievement, ensuring highly qualif ied teachers in every classroom, and guaranteeing that all students are proficientin mathematics and reading by the 2013-14 school year. Inaddition, the NCLB Act specifically describes the actionsstates and local districts must take to aid Title I, Part A schools that fail to make progress in improving studentachievement. FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION The U.S. Department of Education distributes most of the federal funding to states on a formula basis for elementaryand secondary education programs. The departmentdistributes most of the grants to states in July from theappropriation for a f iscal year that started the previous year. For example, the funds appr opriated in the fiscal year 2004 federal appropriations act are meant for the 2004-05school year, or state fiscal y ear 2005. States have 27 months to draw down and expend the Federal Funds.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 260UPDATE ON THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT As a condition of receiving Federal Funds, some of the elementary and secondary education grants prohibit\"supplantation,\" which means states may not supplant orreplace state and/or local spending with Federal Funds.Congress includes these provisions to ensure that Federal Funds will not replace existing state and local funds foractivities allowed by the federal programs. See Figure 1 for more information on supplanting. Most federal programs requir e a state and/or local match. Match refers to cost-sharing requirements that accompanyreceipt of Federal Funds. There are no cost-sharingrequirements for most federal elementary and secondaryeducation programs. However, states and local schooldistricts are subject to maintenance of effort (MOE)requirements for several elementary and secondaryprograms. MOE refers to a minimal level of state and localschool district spending required as a condition of receiv-ing Federal Funds. For example, to receive Title I, Part A funds, a local school district's overall spending (includingstate funds) for public education should not decrease bymore than 10 percent from the preceding year. In fiscal year 2005, Congr ess increased federal funding for elementary and secondary education programs by 2 percent($544.6 million nationally) over the previous funding levelof $35.2 billion. Most of the increase is attributable tofinancial assistance to school districts, allocated on the basisof students living in poverty and students in specialeducation. Texas will recei ve $3.0 billion in federal funding in federal fiscal year 2005 ($79.3 million over the fiscal year2004 funding level). Figure 2 displays the amounts offederal funding to Texas for various categories in federalfiscal year 2005. The categories of Title I Programs andSpecial Education account for 76 percent of the federalfunding to Texas for elementary and secondary education programs. Federal grants awarded on a competitive basisdirectly to Texas school districts are not included in thistotal amount. FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NCLB ACT PROGRAMS Although Congress has increased federal funding nationally for NCLB Act programs by 56.9 percent since the legisla-tion was enacted in 2002, appr opriation levels for NCLB Act programs remain below the amounts authorized by thestatute. For fiscal year 2005, Cong ress appropriated a total of $22.4 billion to NCLB Act programs, which is $8.8billion below the authorized level of $31.2 billion. Three states, California, New York, and Texas, receive over 30percent ($7.0 billion) of the total federal funding for NCLBAct programs. Federal funding for NCLB Act programs distributed on a formula basis to Te xas will be a bout $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2005. This federal funding level will be $ 24.3 million (1 percent) over the fiscal year 2004 funding level. Asignificant amount of the fiscal year 2005 increase can beattributed to Title I, Part A Grants to Local EducationalAgencies. Title I, Part A Grants to Local EducationalAgency will increase by $42.0 million over fiscal year 2004 funding level to $1.2 billion. Amounts for all the Title Iprograms are provided in Figure 3 along with fiscal year2005 amounts for other NCLB Act programs.The U.S. Department of Education presumes supplanting has occurred in the following situations: \u008bThe state education agency or local school district used Federal Funds to provide services that the state education agency or local school district was required to make available under other federal,state, or local laws. \u008bThe state education agency or local school district used FederalFunds to provide services that the state education agency or localschool district provided with non-Federal Funds in the prior year. \u008bThe state education agency or local school district used Title I, Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies or Part C (Migrant Education) funds to provide services for participating children thatthe state education agency or local school district provided with non-Federal Funds for children not served by these funds.FIGURE 1 SUPPLANTATION GUIDANCE SOURCE : U.S. Office of Management and Budget.NOTE: Other includes Language Acquisition State Grants, Education for Homeless Children and Youth, and State Grants for Incarcerated Youth Offenders.

Con-gress has increased federal funding for this program for thepast several years. Figure 4 shows the growth in Title I, PartA funds for school districts in Texas since 1998. The formulas used to distribute Title I, Part A funds are important not only because of the significant amount offederal funding, but also because formulas of other NCLBAct programs are based on Title I, Part A allocations. The 1994 reauthorization of the ESEA provided that Title I,Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies, be distrib-uted based on four formulas (Basic, Concentration, Target,and Education Finance Incentive grants). The law requiredthat any additional funds a ppropriated above 1995 amounts be allocated to school districts under the Target or Educa-tion Finance Incentive (EFI) formulas. Historically,however, Congress has appropriated funds using only twoformulas (Basic and Concentration), which are based primarily on census poverty data and the cost of educationin each state. Beginning with fiscal year 2002 appropria- tions, Congress directed the department to distribute TitleI, Part A funds based on all four formulas. The EFIformula was modified by the NCLB Act to direct funds toschools based on the number of disadvantaged students,rather than the past formula, which was based partly on thestate school-age population. The other three formulas hadminor changes. The NCLB Act also extended previous hold harmless provisions that had only been in place for Title I, Part Afunding distributed with the Basic formula. The holdharmless provisions guarantee a percentage of prior year'sfunding to local school districts depending on the numberof children living in poverty (child formula count). ForBasic, Concentration and EFI grants, school districts withhigher poverty rates get the higher percentages as follows: \u008bninety-five percent of prior year's funds if child formula count makes up at least 30 percent ofenrollment;FIGURE 3 ALLOCATIONS TO TEXAS FOR THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT PROGRAMS(IN MILLIONS) Title I Grants to Local Educational Agency $1,018.5 $1,110.7 $1,152.7 $42.0Reading First Initiative 93.1 57.4 (0.5) Even Start 19.4 20.0 18.2 (1.8) Comprehensive School Reform 18.7 19.5 17.7 (1.8)Neglected and Delinquent 2.6 2.6 2.7 0.1 Language Acquisition State Grants 65.4 74.4 82.9 8.5 Mathematics and Science Partnerships 9.1 14.0 16.7 2.7 21st Century Community Learning Centers 45.5 85.0 87.3 2.3Rural and Low-Income Schools 6.9 6.9 9.0 2.1State Assessments 20.4 21.9 22.7 0.8 Community Service State Grants 4.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities 242.3 241.1 (1.2)Fund for the Improvement of Education 5.8 6.0 0.0 (6.0) Innovative Education Program Strategies 29.2 23.5 15.7 (7.8) Educational Technology State Grants 55.8 59.4 42.9 (16.5) Total SOURCES : Legislative Budget Board; U.S. Department of Education.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 262UPDATE ON THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT \u008bninety percent of prior year's funds if child formula count makes up at least 15 percent of enrollment;and \u008beighty-five percent of prior year's funds if childformula count is less than 15 percent of enrollment. School districts must distribute Title I funds to schools with the highest percentages of children living in poverty.Schools must then focus Title I, Part A funded services onchildren who are failing or most at risk of failing to meetstate academic standards, unless they are implementing aschool-wide program. The NCLB Act lowered the poverty threshold for Title I, Part A school-wide programs from 50percent to 40 percent of poverty. Schools in whichdisadvantaged children make up at least 40 percent of enrollment are now eligible to use Title I funds for school- wide programs that serve all children in the school. The NCLB Act authorized $500 million annually for a new formula grant to states, Assistance for Local SchoolImprovement. Congress has not appropriated funds forthis program. The Reading First Initiative (Title I, Part B, Subpart 1) replaced the Reading Excellence Act program and estab-lished reading programs for all children in kindergartenthrough third grade. Funds are provided to support theapplication of scientifically based reading research and the proven instructional and assessment tools consistent withsuch research for childr en in kindergarten through third grade. Congress appropriated $1.0 billion nationally infiscal year 2005 for Reading First Initiatives; Texas'allocation will be $100.4 million. The NCLB Act also authorized the Early Reading First pr ogram (Title I, Part B, Subpart 2). This competitive grant program helps with earlyidentification and intervention of reading failure amongchildren. In fiscal year 2003, a total of $13.9 million wasawarded for five Early Reading First projects in Texas. Other Title I programs reauthorized by the NCLB Act that impact the Texas state budget include Even Start(Title I, Part B, Subpart 3), Migrant Education (Title I,Part C), the Neglected and Delinquent Children andYouth Program (Title I, Part D), and ComprehensiveSchool Reform Demonstration (Title I, Part F). TheNCLB Act made the most changes to the MigrantEducation program. This legislation added a holdharmless provision to ensure that every state receives abase amount equal to fiscal year 2002 amounts. Beginningin fiscal year 2003, any additional funds above the fiscalyear 2002 appropriation amount will be distributed tostates based on a formula that includes (1) the count ofmigratory children, ages 3-21 years old, residing withinthe state, (2) the count of migratory children, ages 3-21years old, receiving state services in the summer, and(3) each state's per-pupil expenditure. However, Congressfor the past two fiscal years has not appropriated fundingabove the fiscal year 2002 amount for the MigrantEducation program. The department has distributedfunds to states based on fiscal year 2002 amounts. Texaswill receive $57.4 million in fiscal year 2005 to help ensure that migratory children are not penalized in any mannerby disparities among states in curriculum, graduation SOURCE : U.S. Department of Education.FIGURE 4 TITLE I FUNDS TO TEXAS FOR TITLE I, PART A: GRANTS TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES (IN MILLIONS) $630.8$661.7 $677.3 $711.4$862.8$1,152.7 $1,110.7$1,018.5 $0$200$400$600$800$1,000$1,200$1,400 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 263UPDATE ON THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT requirements, state academic content standards, and student academic achievement standards. IMPROVING TEACHER QUALITY The NCLB Act authorized a new state formula grant program, Improving Teacher Quality, which combined theEisenhower Professional De velopment state grants and Class-Size Reduction grants. The Improving TeacherQuality Program funds the preparation, training, andrecruitment of high-quality teachers. Congress appropri-ated $2.9 billion in federal funding nationally in fiscal year2005 for the Improving Teacher Quality Program. Theformula for distributing these funds provides states with abase allocation equal to fiscal year 2001 EisenhowerProfessional Development and Class Size Reduction grants.For additional funds, 35 percent is based on each state's population of children ages 5-17 years old, and 65 percent is based on each state's number of children ages 5-17 fromfamilies with incomes below the federal poverty level.Texas will receive an alloca tion of $241.0 million in fiscal year 2005. School districts are r equired to reserve no less than 5 percent and no more than 10 percent of their TitleI, Part A funds for assisting teachers in meeting the highly qualified definition. SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS The NCLB Act reauthorized other programs to assist states and local school districts in meeting the requirements ofthe legislation. The NCLB Act amended the 21st CCLCProgram. Texas' local school districts used to directly applyto the federal government (approximately $17.7 million in fiscal year 2001 for Texas). No w states receive 21st CCLC funding based on each state's share of Title I Part A funds,and distribute funds to local school districts on a competi-tive basis. The 21st CCLC program funds communitylearning centers that provide academic enrichment oppor-tunities for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools to meet academiccontent standards, to expand enrichment activities that can complement regular academic programs, and to offerliteracy and other educational services to the families ofparticipating children. The 21st CCLC program's allocationto Texas increased to $85.0 million in fiscal year 2004 (anincrease from the $39.5 million distributed in fiscal year2003). Future increases to Texas may not be as significant due to the NCLB Act's complete conversion of all 21stCCLC program funding into a formula grants to states. Forthe past two years, the 21st CCLC formula grants to statesincreased as the portion for competitive grants decreased.Texas' fiscal year 2005 allocation for the 21st CCLC program is estimated to be $87.3 million. The NCLB Act consolidated the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund with several competitive technology grantsinto a formula-based block grant, the Educational Technol- ogy Program. This program promotes innovative state andlocal programs using technology . States receive funds based on each state's current share of Title I, Part A funds. Texas'allocation for the Educational Technology State Grant willbe $42.9 million for fiscal year 2005 (a loss of $16.5 millionover the previous year). The NCLB Act requires that the former Immigrant Education and Bilingual Education Programs be consoli-dated into the Language Acquisition State Grant Program when Congress appropriates $650.0 million or more for thetwo programs. Texas' fiscal year 2005 allocation will be$82.9 million. Prior to the NCLB Act, Texas received Immigrant Education Program funds based on a formula,and school districts were awarded Bilingual EducationProgram funds on a competitive basis from the federalgovernment. Federal funding for the Innovative Education Program will decrease by 33 percent or $98.1 million from the fiscal year2004 funding level of $296.5 million. Texas fiscal year 2005allocation for the Innovative Education Program isestimated to be $15.7 million (a decrease of $7.8 millionfrom the previous year's funding). Congress may consider legislation that could impact the distribution of Title I, Part A funds to Texas. The NCLB Actrequired the department to use the most updated Censusdata, when available, to distrib ute Title I, Part A funds. The department began using 2000 Census data to determine Title I, Part A allocations for fiscal year 2004. Even thoughCongress appropriated an overall increase to Title I, Part Afunds, the department released fiscal year 2004 Title I, Part Aallocations with decreases to 10 states. Congress did notinclude the Senate Appropriations Committee's provision inthe Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appro-priations Act, that would have provided $71.6 million forstates whose Title I allocations were less in fiscal year 2004than in fiscal year 2003. Tex as received $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2004, an increase of $92.2 million over fiscal year 2003. As a result, Texas would not have received any of the fundsto bring states up to their prior year allocations. FLEXIBILITY Authorized as a demonstration program in 1994, the \"Ed- Flex\" program allowed select states to be exempted fromcertain federal requirements in exchange for enhanced accountability for student achievement. Under the demon-stration program, Texas was one of the 12 states grantedEd-Flex authority for five years. The most commonlywaived rules are the pove rty threshold for Title I school- wide programs and rules barring districts from servinglower-poverty schools. T he Ed-Flex Partnership Act of 1999 amended the demonstration program and allowed anySTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 264UPDATE ON THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT state that meets new eligibility criteria to receive waiver authority. In fiscal year 2001, Te xas' Ed-Flex status was extended for an additional five years. The NCLB Act authorized a new flexibility authority, Transferability for State and Local Educational Agencies,that allows states and local educational agencies totransfer a portion of the funds received under certainfederal programs to other specified programs to betteraddress specific needs. Under this new flexibility author-ity, states are allowed to transfer up to 50 percent of non-Title I formula state activity funds not allocated to schooldistricts. School districts are given the flexibility totransfer up to 50 percent of funds from the non-Title Iprograms without state approval. Non-Title I formulagrants include Improving Teacher Quality, EducationalTechnology, Safe and Drug-free Schools, and InnovativeEducation. In addition, states can also transfer stateactivity funds from one other non-Title I program, the21st CCLC Program. A performance pilot project was also authorized for 150 school districts and seven states to participate in perfor-mance agreements to combine 100 percent of non-Title Ifunds (State Flexibility Authority Program and LocalFlexibility Demonstration Agreements). As of this time,only the state of Florida has been approved to participate in the State Flexibility Authority Program. The Seattle Public School District is the fi rst school district to receive approval for participation in the Local Flexibility Demon-stration Agreement. ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS The NCLB Act requires each state to develop and adminis- ter a system of assessments to track student academicachievement on an annual basis. States are allowed todesign their own tests, whic h must be aligned to state- established academic and achievement standards. Starting in the 2004-05 school year, students in grades 3 to 8 must be tested in reading/language arts and mathematics,and once in high school. By the 2007-08 school year,students must be tested in science at least once in elemen-tary (grades 3 to 5), middle (grades 6 to 9), and high school(grades 10 to 12). The NCLB Act directs states to use theresults of these assessments as the basis for a statewideaccountability system. Texas has had little difficulty in meeting the assessment requirements of the NCLB Act. The state's experience with\"high stakes\" testing systems dates back to 1979 and theintroduction of the Texas Assessment of Basic Skills (TABS)tests, which were a precursor of the current array ofassessments called the Texas Assessment of Knowledge andSkills (TAKS). Indeed, the federal law regarding assessmentswas structured in large part on the Texas model.There are, however, two areas in which the state will have to augment its testing to comply with federal law. To meetthe requirement for a middle school science test by the2007-08 school year, the TEA is currently developing an eighth grade TAKS science exam. The agency also isdeveloping a plan to meet the NCLB Act requirement thatlimited- English-proficient (LEP) students must be testedfor English language skills in reading, writing, listening, andspeaking, starting in kindergarten. In exchange for flexibil- ity to choose the method of instruction for these students,schools must test LEP students who have been in the U.S.for three years in English. The department has providedstates the following tw o new policies concerning the assessments of LEP students: \u008bFor up to two years, states are allowed to includeLEP students who have a ttained English proficiency for LEP subgroup accountability measures. \u008bStates have the option to not include in AdequateYearly Progress (AYP) calculations the assessmentresults of LEP students' in their first year ofenrollment in U.S. schools. The NCLB Act provides Federal Funds to assist states in the development and implementation of their assess-ments; Texas will receive approximately $23 million ineach year of the 2006-07 biennium for this purpose. Thisamount does not cover the state's total expenses related totesting, which are anticipated to reach $61 million in fiscalyear 2006. ACCOUNTABILITY\u2014ADEQUATE YEARLY PROGRESS Each state must create a definition of AYP toward a goal of 100 percent of students passing the reading/languagearts and mathematics tests by the 2013-14 school year.Based on initial TAKS field test results from 2002, Texasdetermined the AYP standards for the 2002-03 and2003-04 school years to be 46.8 percent for Reading/Language Arts and 33.4 percent for Mathematics. Thesestandards will gradually increase over the next decade,reaching the goal of 100 percent passing in 2013-14.Figure 5 shows the AYP tar gets for the 2004-05 school year for all students and each student group. All school districts are subject to AYP evaluation. Additionally, all Title I and non-Title I public schoolcampuses, alternative education campuses, and open-enrollment charter schools are evaluated for AYP with afew exceptions; for example, new campuses, juvenilejustice and disciplinary alternative education campuses,and campuses with no students in grades 3 to 8 or 10 arenot subject to AYP.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 265UPDATE ON THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT AYP performance requirements are met if the percent of students passing for all students and each student groupsummed across grades 3 to 8 and 10 in reading/languagearts and mathematics meets or exceeds the AYP standard.Figure 6 shows what student groups are included in AYPevaluation. The NCLB Act also establishes a standard for student participation in the testing system. To meet AYP, 95percent of all students and each student group must betested. This criterion is applied separately for reading/language arts and mathematics. Two other standards mustbe met for all students only: for high school students, agraduation rate of 70 percent, and for elementary andmiddle school students, an attendance rate of 90 percent. Alternatively, a campus may achieve AYP for a student group by meeting an improvement standard. If anystudent group (or all students) does not meet the perfor-mance standard for reading/language arts and mathemat-ics, that student group must show both (1) a 10 percentdecrease in the percent not passing the standards onTAKS from the prior year and (2) any improvement onthe graduation/attendance measure. Although studentgroups are not required to meet the graduation rate or attendance rate standard, they may be required to showimprovement on the graduation rate or attendance rate tomeet the performance gains criteria. In total, campusesand districts must meet up to 29 criteria in order to earnthe \"Meets AYP\" rating. If a school or district fails tomeet even one of these criteria, it earns the \"needsimprovement\" rating and may be subject to a graduatedset of school improvement sanctions. SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT If a campus or district fails to meet AYP on the same performance indicator for two consecutive years, thatcampus is identified for possib le school improvement sanctions. Although all campuses and districts are evaluatedfor AYP, only campuses and districts that receive federal Title I, Part A funds are subject to the sanctions. In the2002-03 school year, 98 percent of Texas school districts,60 percent of regular campuses, and 78 percent of chartercampuses are defined as Title I. In September 2004, theTEA released a list of 170 Title I schools and 29 charterschools that did not meet AYP standards in the sameindicator for a second year. (See Figure 7 for overallratings.) The campus sanctions are as follows: Year 1\u2014School Choice/Transportation. Schools that fail to meet AYP for the same measure for two or moreconsecutive years are in y ear 1 of school improvement. Parents must be notified of the school's status, andstudents must be offered the option of transferring toanother public or charter school that has not been identi-fied as needing improvement. The school district mustprovide transportation, using up to 20 percent of its federal Title I allocation. Also, at least 10 percent of these fundsmust be used for teacher tr aining to directly address the student achievement problems that earned the school the\"needs improvement\" rating. Year 2\u2014Supplemental Services. Schools that fail to meet AYP for the same measure for three or more consecutive years are in year 2. In addition to the year 1 sanctions, theschool must offer free after-school tutoring in the subjectareas in which it failed to meet the AYP standard. Thesupplemental tutoring services may be offered by public orprivate providers, as determined by the student and parents,and the district must use up to 20 percent of its Title Ifunds to pay for the services. Year 3\u2014Corrective Action. One more year of failing to meet AYP earns a school year 3 status in which, in additionto the years 1 and 2 provisions, a school must take correc-tive actions, such as replacing staff, implementing newcurricula, appointing an outside e xpert for consultation, or school internal reorganization.FIGURE 5 ADEQUATE YEARLY PROGRESS TARGETS FOR THE 2004-05 SCHOOL YEAR FOR ALL STUDENTS ANDEACH STUDENT GROUP Percent Passing Reading 53.5 Percent Passing Math 41.7Participation Rate 95.0 Graduation Rate (high school) 70.0 Attendance Rate (elementary 90.0 and middle school\u2014all students only) NOTE: Adequate Yearly Progress target of graduation rate applies only to all student groups.

The final stage of school im- provement involves the fundamental restructuring of aschool, including reopening as a charter school, replacingthe principal and staff, or turning school operation over tothe state or private management company. For schools and districts in School Improvement, meeting AYP for two consecutive years removes the campus fromSchool Improvement status. ONE PERCENT CAP ON SPECIAL EDUCATION ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT Texas is unique among the states with regard to its assess- ment of special education students using the State-Developed Alternative Assessment (SDAA), whichmeasures student performance in terms of growth againstexpectations established by the admission, review, anddismissal (ARD) committee. However, for AYP the U.S. Department of Education ruled that students who are considered AYP proficient byvirtue of either meeting ARD expectations on the SDAAand testing below enrolled grade level or meeting ARDexpectations on a functional-based, locally determinedalternative assessment (LDAA) may together compriseonly 1 percent of the total students within each district.For Texas, however, the SDAA was designed as thepreferred assessment for special education students; thevast majority of those students took the SDAA or LDAAin 2003, and these students represented 9 percent of allstudents tested statewide. To address this issue, the TEA is developing a new version of the SDAA to be administered statewide in 2005. Thisnew test will be more aligned with the TAKS, and theagency hopes to establish a grade-level-equivalent uniformpassing standard that will satisfy the requirements of AYP. HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS By the end of the 2005-06 school y ear, all teachers in core academic subject areas must be \"highl y qualified.\" Figure 8 describes what subject areas the NCLB Act defines as coreacademic subjects. The NCLB Act considers teachers \"highly qualified\" if they ha ve all of the following: \u008bat least a bachelor's degree; \u008bfull and current state certification; and \u008bdemonstrated subject-matter competency in each of the core subjects they teach. Additionally, teachers hired after the start of the 2002-03 school year to teach a core academic subject in a Title Iprogram must be \"highl y qualified\" when hired. With respect to open-enrollment charter schools, the NCLB Act defers to state law regarding teacher certifica-tion. In Texas, charter schools are not required to employcertified teachers unless the teacher is assigned to teach inspecial education or bilingual educations programs, inwhich case the appropriate state certification is required. In Texas, the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) sets state certification standards. SBEC requiresteachers to have a bachelor' s degree that includes education courses, or receive alternative certification from anapproved program, as w ell as pass subject and grade-level exams, to receive a certificate. In 2004, SBEC easedalternative certification for high school teachers by allowingcollege graduates who pass the appropriate subject mattertests to teach grades 8 to 12 for two years without formalFIGURE 8 NCLB CORE ACADEMIC SUBJECT AREAS(REQUIRING HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS) English Civics/government Reading/language arts Economics Mathematics ArtsScience HistoryForeign languages Geography SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.FIGURE 7 ADEQUATE YEARLY PROGRESS RATINGS FOR DISTRICTS, CAMPUSES AND CHARTERS, 2002-03 SCHOOL YEAR Meets Adequate Yearly Progress 1,001 96.3 6,121 81.9 141 54.2 Needs Improvement 37 3.6 498 6.7 65 25.0 Not Evaluated 1 0.1 854 11.4 54 CHARTER CAMPUSES SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 267UPDATE ON THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT certification. School districts are required to train these teachers during this period, after which the district may issue a permanent certificate. Teachers who use this newroute to certification meet the NCLB Act definition of\"highly qualified.\" TEA has developed an extensive system for current teachers to demonstrate subject matter competence. Thissystem, based on the NCLB Act's guidelines for a High,Objective, Uniform Standard of Evaluation, is referred toas HOUSE, and allows teachers to establish competencythrough a combination of classroom experience, collegecoursework, and relevant professional development. According to TEA, survey data indicate that 95.7 percent of teachers in Texas public schools met the NCLB Act'sdefinition of \"highly qualified\" in their primary assignmentat the end of the 2003-04 school year. Despite this highdegree of compliance, there are concerns regarding thefeasibility of meeting the standard of 100 percent ofteachers being \"highly qualified, \" particularly in subject areas in which Texas schools face serious teacher shortages,including mathematics, science, bilingual education, andforeign languages. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Education eased its rules for \"highly qualified\" teachers in several key areas, includ-ing science, rural, or multiple-subject teachers: \u008bTeachers in eligible small, rural, and isolated areas who are \"highly qualified\" in at least one subject willhave until 2007 to become highly qualified in theadditional subjects they teach. \u008bStates may certify teachers in the general field ofscience, allowing teachers to demonstrate subject-matter competency through a \"broad field\" test ormajor, rather than for each specific subject area. \u008bCurrent multiple-subject teachers, particularlyteachers in middle schools or special education, are not required to return to school or get a degree inevery subject they teach but may demonstrate subject-matter competency through the HOUSEoption. The NCLB Act requires all new paraprofessionals hired after January 8, 2002, and wo rking in a program supported with Title I, Part A funds, to have completed at least twoyears of college or otherwise meet a state or local standardof quality. Paraprofessionals hired on or before January 8,2002, must meet this standard by January 8, 2006. Allparaprofessionals, regardless of hiring date, must haveearned a secondary school diploma or its equivalent. Congress continued to raise f ederal funding for Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies to Texas and willmost likely continue increasing assistance to states in meeting the requirements of the NCLB Act. The NCLBAct added additional requirements to Texas, such asexpanding student assessments, collecting and distributingresults of student achievement, ensuring highly qualified teachers in every classroom by the 2005-06 school year,and guaranteeing that all students are proficient in math-ematics and reading by 2014. According to TEA, surveydata indicate that 95.6 percent of teachers in Texas publicschools met the NCLB Act's definition of \"highly quali-fied\" in their primary assignment at the end of the2003-04 school year. Texas has had little difficulty inmeeting the assessment requirements of the NCLB Act.However, there are two areas in which the state will have to expand its testing to comply with the NCLB Act. Thestate's total expenses rela ted to testing are anticipated to reach $61 million in fiscal year 2006.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 268UPDATE ON THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACTSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 269USE STATE HIGHWAY FUNDS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION In the 2002-03 school year, an average of 1.2 million Texas students rode school buses each day, an increase of 2 percent from the previous school year. Through the Foundation School Program, the state shares the cost ofbusing students with local school districts. The FoundationSchool Program is the primary tool for allocating statefinancial assistance to school districts. State law allows that portion of the State Highway Fund not dedicated by the constitution for public roadways to beused for any function performed by the Texas Departmentof Transportation. One of the agency's functions is theprovision of funds to encourage, foster, and assist indeveloping public transportation programs across the state. Transporting students to school falls within many of the statutory definitions of public transportation already in theTransportation Code. However, this expenditure is cur-rently funded from the General Revenue Fund. An annual appropriation of $50 million in State Highway Funds tofund a portion of the public school transportation programwould make $100 million in General Revenue Fundsavailable for other purposes in the 2006-07 biennium. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe district entitlement for the public schooltransportation program during the 2002-03 bien-nium totaled $626.4 million ($307.8 million in 2002and $318.6 million in 2003) from state and localrevenues. The public school transportation entitle-ment for the 2004-05 biennium is estimated to the 2004-05 biennium, the legislature appropri-ated $111.8 million from the State Highway Fund topay for public transportation programs administeredby the Health and Human Services Commission. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bThe State Highway Fund is not being used tosupport legitimate public transportation needs instate public schools. RECOMMENDATION \u008bFor each year of the 2006-07 biennium $50 millionshould be appropriated to the Texas EducationAgency from the non-constitutionally dedicatedrevenue in the State Highway Fund to replace aportion of the Foundation School Program trans- portation allotment. COMMENTS The district entitlement for the public school transportationprogram during the 2002-03 biennium totaled $626.4million ($307.8 million in 2002 and $318.6 million in 2003)from state and local revenues. Public school transportation operating expenditures for the previous four school years (1999-2003) are shown inFigure 1. In the 2002-03 school year, the total transporta-tion operating expenditure w as $812.4 million, which includes the district entitlement for the public schooltransportation program. Over the last three years, thetransportation operating expenditure has increased anaverage of 8 percent annually. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) distributes transporta- tion money to school districts throughout the state. Thedistribution of entitlements to each school is based on alinear density factor determined by dividing the averagenumber of regular eligible students transported daily by theapproved daily route miles traveled. Transportation fundingprovides a mileage reimbursement rate for different linear density groupings. Figure 2 shows the current transporta-tion allotment. The Transportation Code requires the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) to encourage, foster, and assistin the development of public transportation by workingwith local governments.

In addition, Section 456.007 (b) allows the legislature toappropriate money for public transportation purposes from the portion of the State Highway Fund that is not dedi-cated by the constitution. House Bill 2292, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, required TxDOT to assume responsibilitiesfor providing medical public transportation servicespreviously provided by the Health and Human ServicesCommission. The appropriation for the 2004-05 bienniumwas $111.8 million from the non-constitutionally dedicatedportion of the State Highway Fund to operate the program. The appropriation of $50 million per year from the non- constitutionally dedicated revenue in the State HighwayFund to TEA to pay a portion of the state's share of theFSP's Transportation Allotment would make an equalamount of General Revenue Funds available for otherpurposes. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION The recommendation would result in General Revenue Funds savings of $100 million in the 2006-07 biennium.The recommendation that the legislature appropriate $50million annually from the State Highway Fund for thepublic school transportation program is based on acomparable level of funding appropriated to TxDOT for providing medical public transportation service to Healthand Human Services Commission clients.FIGURE 2 PUBLIC SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION ALLOTMENT 2004-05 BIENNIUM 2.40 and above $1.43 1.65 to 2.40 1.25 1.15 to 1.65 1.11 0.90 to 1.15 0.970.65 to 0.90 0.880.40 to 0.65 0.79 up to 0.40 0.68LINEAR DENSITY GROUPINGALLOCATION PER MILE OF APPROVED ROUTE SOURCE : Texas Education Agency.The implicit definition of the transport of students to public school in Section 456.001 (8) of the TransportationCode, coupled with Section 456.007 (b), would allow non- constitutionally dedicated revenue from the State HighwayFund to be applied toward a portion of the state's share ofthe cost by replacing a portion of General Revenue Funds.Figure 3 provides a five-year forecast on the fiscal impact.

Texas couldrealize significant savings by applying proportionality tostate employee health benefit contributions for publiccommunity colleges. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe great majority of Texas public communitycolleges do not apply proportionality when request-ing General Revenue Fund contributions for grouphealth insurance. \u008bThe fiscal year 2003 General Revenue Fund highereducation group insurance appropriation forcommunity colleges was over-funded by approxi-mately 38 percent, or $50 million. \u008bForty-four of the 50 community college districtswere over-funded in excess of at least 15 percent infiscal year 2003, including all of the 10 largestcommunity college districts. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bTexas' public community colleges are the onlyentities receiving significant amounts of GeneralRevenue Fund appropriations that have not histori-cally adhered to state requirements on proportionalcost sharing. \u008bThrough the application of proportional costsharing standards to community colleges, the statewould save an estimated $106 million in GeneralRevenue Funds in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: By requiring community colleges to follow the same standards of propor- tional cost sharing as are required of all otherentities receiving state a ppropriations, reduce community colleges' General Revenue Fundappropriations for group health insurance by $106million in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Billfor higher education group insurance. \u008bRecommendation 2: Revise the Article IX rider language in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Billto include community colleges among the entities subject to proportionality cost-sharing provisions. \u008bRecommendation 3: A rider should be included in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill that directsthe Comptroller of Public Accounts to develop aproportionality reporting framework in collaborationwith the Legislative Budg et Board that addresses community colleges' funding circumstances. \u008bRecommendation 4: A rider should be included in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill that directsthe Legislative Budget Board to determine whetherfurther savings to the General Revenue Fund may berealized by examining the available data on thestate's proportional contributions to communitycollege's optional retirement and teacher's retirementemployee benefits. COMMENTS Prior to and during the Seventy-eighth Legislature, RegularSession, 2003, the issue arose whether the state's employeebenefits contributions to public community colleges werebased on the actual proportional share of salaries atcommunity colleges paid with state funds. The legislature's policy of paying employee benefits costs only for those employees having salaries paid out of the General RevenueFund remains a major cost-limiting factor in determiningstate appropriation lev els. If there is noncompliance with such proportionality requirements, the state may becontributing General Revenue Funds in excess of itsproportional obligation. Two basic issues emerge w hen reviewing the applicability of proportionality to the proportional payments of statebenefits to community colleges. Current rider languagerelating to proportionality in Section 6.11, page IX-35 ofthe 2004-05 General Appropriations Act, reads in part asfollows: Sec. 6.11 Salaries to Be Proportional by Fund. (a) Unless otherwise provided, payment for salaries, wages, and benefits paid from appropriated funds,including \"local funds\" and \"education and generalfunds\" as defined in \u00a7 51.009 (a) and (c), Education Code, shall be proportional to the source of funds.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 272APPLY PROPORTIONALITY TO STATE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS (b) Unless otherwise specifically authorized by this Act, the funds appropriated by this Act out of theGeneral Revenue Fund may not be expended foremployee benefit costs, or other indirect costs,associated with the payment of salaries and wages, ifthe salaries or wages are paid from a source otherthan the General Revenue Fund. COMMUNITY COLLEGES' PERCEPTION OF PROPORTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS The first issue revolves around whether proportionality applies to community colleges. The phrase, \"Unlessotherwise provided,\" in subsection (a) above relates to howcommunity colleges have interpreted state requirementslimiting their use of appropriations from the GeneralRevenue Fund. Education Code \u00a7 130.003(c) states that funds appropri- ated by the state to community colleges, \"... shall be usedexclusively for the purpose of paying salaries of theinstructional and administrative forces of the severalinstitutions and the purchase of supplies and materials forinstructional purposes.\" Furthermore, Public Commu-nity/Junior Colleges Rider 3, Approved Elements ofExpenditure, page III-214 of the General AppropriationsAct, states that General Revenue Fund appropriations tocommunity colleges \"shall be limited to the payment ofthe following elements of cost: instruction, academicsupport, student services, institutional support, organizedactivities, and staff benefits associated with salaries paidfrom General Revenue.\" There is clear intent in statuteand General Appropriations Act language to restrict howcommunity colleges may expend General Revenue Fundappropriations. While statute defines and limits community colleges' use of General Revenue Funds, it is not clear that this samestatute necessarily exempts community colleges from complying with Article IX proportionality requirements.Because statute confines the use of General RevenueFunds for certain instruction and administration-relatedpurposes, this source of funds can bear a disproportionalshare of salaries paid. But statute does not allow for statecontributions to exceed the share of salaries paid throughthe General Revenue Fund. Thus, while communitycolleges' statutory restrictions on the use of GeneralRevenue Funds result in the disproportion of salaries paidto fund sources, such r estrictions do not preclude the proportionality of state funded benefits to state fundedsalaries. The issue then becomes how to determine theactual share of total salaries paid with General RevenueFund appropriations. The above statute and rider language have been interpreted to imply that a given employee's eligibility for GeneralRevenue Fund benefits contributions is determined not by the source of the employee's salary, but whether that givenemployee's job function conforms to one of the above\"elements of cost.\" Under this interpretation, communitycolleges determine eligibility for state funded benefitsaccording to whether an employee performs occupationalfunctions that are legally el igible to be funded by General Revenue Fund appropriations. No Texas entities other than community colleges receiving state appropriations use occupational function as a meansto determine eligibility for state funded employee benefitscontributions. Community colleges have used this methodof reporting eligibility since they joined the EmployeesRetirement System in the early 1990s. FUNDING SOURCES AND STRICT PROPORTIONALITY The second issue to emerge from this review stems from the language in the General Appropriations Act (2004-05Biennium) Article IX, General Provisions, Section 6.11(a)which states that propor tionality applies to \"appropriated funds.\" Of the five funding sources for communitycolleges (General Revenue Fund, tuition and fees, property taxes, Federal Funds, and Other Funds), the GeneralRevenue Fund is the only revenue source appropriated bythe state, unlike the practice for most other institutions ofhigher education, for which tuition and certain fee revenues are also appropriated. Figure 1 shows the three-yearaverage percent share of eac h revenue source as a portion of total funding, based on data collected from eachcommunity college districts' ann ual financial report for fiscal years 2001 to 2003. Tuition & Fees 19.8% Property Taxes 23.0% Federal Funds 17.0%Other Funds 6.3%General Revenue Fund 33.9%FIGURE 1 THREE-YEAR (FY 2001-03) AVERAGE OF ALL FUNDS REVENUE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES (AFR DATA) SOURCE : Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 273APPLY PROPORTIONALITY TO STATE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS The rider language has been interpreted by many community colleges to imply that proportionality require- ments do not apply to those funding sources fallingoutside the state appropriations process. Thus thecombination of determining health benefits fundingeligibility by occupational function and the longstandingview that proportionality does not apply to their non-appropriated funding sources has resulted in levels ofstate support for community college employee benefitsthat are out of proportion to state salary contributions. A major obstacle in applying standards of proportional cost sharing to community colleges has been the lack ofinformation available to the state regarding the use ofcommunity colleges' General Revenue Fund appropria-tions. Such information is indispensable in determining theextent of community colleges' compliance with stateproportionality requirements. F or example, while commu- nity colleges receive only 34 percent of their total fundingfrom the General Reven ue Fund, it does not necessarily follow that community colleges pay only 34 percent oftheir total salaries from that source. Given statutory and rider language restricting community colleges' use of their General Revenue Fund appropriationsfor specific purposes, it may be the case that for practical purposes some community colleges expend all their state funds on salaries. However, prior to this year, community colleges were not required to submit any data to the state that would provide comprehensive information regardingtheir use of General Revenue Fund appropriations. A new rider included in the General Appropriations Act (2004-05 Biennium), Rider 15, pa ge III-216 required community colleges to submit a benefits proportional byfund report to the comptroller. These reports provided thelegislature with a useful means to determine each commu- nity college's total General Revenue Fund income inrelation to its total salary expenditures. FOUR-STEP METHODOLOGY Using data collected from each community college's fiscal year 2003 benefits proportional by fund report, this analysisfollows a four-step methodolo gy. The first step entails determining the relative share of total salaries paid with theGeneral Revenue Fund. This allows observers to know theupper limit of General Revenue Fund contributions thatmay be used to pay employee salaries. For purposes ofsimplicity, this analysis assumes all General Revenue Funddollars go toward paying the salaries of employees inoccupational areas eligible for state contributions from thisfunding source. The second step involves determining the actual state- funded and locally-funded portions of each communitycollege's total group insurance plan (GIP) expenditures.The intent is to isolate what portion state contributions are paying of total GIP expenditures . The third step compares the percent of a community college's total salaries paidwith the General Revenue Fund to its percent of employeeGIP benefits paid with the General Revenue Fund. The fourth step determines the difference between the share of GIP actually paid with the General Revenue Fundand the share of GIP that would be paid with GeneralRevenue Funds if proportionality were to be applied. Weassume that the state's share of employee benefits for eachcommunity college must not exceed the share of totalsalaries paid out of the General Revenue Fund. Forexample, if a community college pays 51 percent of its total salaries with its General Revenue Fund appropriations,only 51 percent of the college's total GIP should be paidfrom that source. Thus, to determine the non-proportional GIP amount for each community college district, this analysis determinedthe difference between each college's total GIP expendi-tures as provided by the Employees Retirement System andthe share of GIP that should be paid by the GeneralRevenue Fund with the application of standards ofproportional cost-sharing normally applied to stateagencies. The methodology thus emphasizes sensitivity tothe variation in specific degrees of overfunding among the individual community college districts. Figure 2 provides revised group health insurance contributions in light ofeach community college's degree of overfunding. IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE FUNDING A state funding concern emerges if it is determined that community colleges over-report their enrollment ofemployees whose salaries are paid with General RevenueFunds. If over one-third of the community colleges'reported enrollment for GIP benefits paid through theGeneral Revenue Fund is not substantiated by the data, thelegislature may realize savings by applying some measure ofproportionality to how the state funds its contributionstoward community college health benefits. The extent of the savings to the General Revenue Fund may vary depending on how the legislature opts to fundhigher education group insurance. For example, assuming adoption of the Legislative Budget Board's recommended funding levels for fiscal y ears 2006 and 2007, the state would reduce its contribution to the community colleges'group health insurance appropria tion by approximately $106.0 million over the biennium. These savings areincorporated into the community college portion of LBBrecommendations for higher education group insurance. Asis shown in Figure 2, were the community college's groupinsurance recommendations calculated without consider-ation of their actual proportional benefits costs, the state'sSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 274APPLY PROPORTIONALITY TO STATE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS Alamo Community College $22,235,238 49.7% $11,190,146 2 COMMUNITY COLLEGES GROUP INSURANCE: LBB STAFF RECOMMENDED AND PROPORTIONAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS 2006-07 GENERAL REVENUE RECOMMENDED (PRIOR TO PROPORTIONALITY)PERCENT OF COLUMN 'A' OVER-FUNDEDREVISED 2006-07 GENERAL REVENUE RECOMMENDED A * BDOLLAR DIFFERENCE A - CAB C D (CONTINUED ON NEXT P(CONTINUED ON NEXT P(CONTINUED ON NEXT P(CONTINUED ON NEXT P(CONTINUED ON NEXT P AGE)AGE)AGE)AGE)AGE)STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 275APPLY PROPORTIONALITY TO STATE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS FIGURE 2 (CONTINUED) COMMUNITY COLLEGES GROUP INSURANCE: LBB ST AFF RECOMMENDED AND PROPORTIONAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS PERCENT OF COLUMN 'A' OVER-FUNDEDREVISED 2006-07 GENERAL REVENUE RECOMMENDED A * BDOLLAR DIFFERENCE A - C Temple Junior is excluded from this analysis because the institution's group insurance appropriation is made to T he University of Texas System. SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. General Revenue Fund contribution would be approxi- mately $281.1 million. Applying proportional cost-sharingto community colleges would reduce this contribution byapproximately 38 percent to $175.2 million for fiscal year 2006-07. IMPLICATIONS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES There is a range of possible responses to proportional state contributions for community colle ges' health insurance benefits. Community colleges ma y opt to decline offering health coverage to certain categories of employees alto-gether. On the other hand, if community colleges prefer tomaintain current employee coverage levels they may opt topay the entire reduced state share using funds other thanGeneral Revenue Fund. Options falling between theseresponses would require a degree of cost sharing betweenthe college and its covered employees. It is possible that some districts may create a separate and less costly healthbenefits plan to parallel the state plan and provide it toemployees determined to be ineligib le to receive state funded health benefits contributions. It is also possible the reduction in state contributions for health benefits to community colleges need not become anabsolute reduction to the amount of General RevenueFund contributions to community colleges. For example,redirecting the savings through the community colleges'funding formula would mitigate the impact of the reduc-tion by raising the state's share of nonrestricted GeneralRevenue Fund appropriations to community colleges.Assuming LBB recommended funding levels for commu-nity colleges, this redirection would increase the share of nonrestricted General Revenue Funds appropriated to community colleges by approximately 7 percent. It should be noted any increase in General Revenue Fund appropriations to the community colleges' funding formulamight result in an increase in the total portion of salariespaid out of the General Revenue Fund. Assuming little orno growth in community colleges' other income sources,this potential shift in General Revenue Fund proportional-ity may increase state costs for future community college group health insurance appropriations. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS The fiscal impact information in Figure 3 shows that an overall savings of $106 million in General Revenue Fundsfor fiscal years 2006 and 2007 would result from the implementation of proportional cost-sharing measuresrecommended in this report (Recommendation 1).AB C D 2006-07 GENERAL REVENUE RECOMMENDED (PRIOR TO PROPORTIONALITY)STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 276APPLY PROPORTIONALITY TO STATE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS FIGURE 3 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACTAPPLY NORMAL STANDARDS OF PROPORTIONAL COST-SHARING TO PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGES' HEALTH INSURANCE APPROPRIATIONS SAVINGS/(COST) TO LOCAL FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.

Althoughthe authorization and issuance of tuition revenue bonds isnot contingent on an appropriation f or related debt service, legislative practice has been to use General Revenue Fundsto reimburse institutions of higher education for the costrelated to debt service. Debt service is the amount ofinterest and principal required to pay a debt over a speci-fied period of time. Debt service appropriations for tuition revenue bonds in the 2002-03 biennium totaled $275.6 million. The Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, changed prior policy by appropri-ating tuition revenue bond debt service for interest only fortuition revenue bonds issued after March 31, 2003. As aresult, debt service appropriations for tuition revenuebonds in the 2004-05 biennium totaled $261.9 million.This change represents a 5 percent decrease from theprevious biennium. By continuing to limit General Revenue Fund appropria- tions for tuition revenue bonds issued after March 31, 2003to interest only, $57.7 million in General Revenue Fundswould be available for other purposes in the 2006-07biennium. Additionally, the unive rsities have requested approximately $3.1 billion in their legislative appropriations requests for new tuition revenue bond authorizations. Thus,savings from limiting bond appropriations to interest onlymay change depending upon the number of universitiesthat receive new tuition revenue bond authorizations. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bUniversities, pursuant to the Education Code, Section 55.17, may pledge all or any part of theirrevenue funds to the repayment of bonds. \u008bFor the 2006-07 biennium, institutions of highereducation have requested $376.6 million in GeneralRevenue Funds to cover debt service on tuitionrevenue bonds issued through the end of fiscal year2005. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bTotal debt service for tuition revenue bonds issuedafter March 31, 2003 will exceed $131.6 million inthe 2006-07 biennium. Although tuition revenuebonds are legally secured by an institution of highereducation's tuition and fees, legislative practice has been to use General Revenue Funds to reimburseinstitutions of higher education for the cost relatedto debt service. RECOMMENDATION \u008bContinue the policy during the 2006-07 biennium established via a rider in the 2004-05 General Appropriations Act that limits General Revenue Fund appropriations for tuition revenue bonds issued after March 31, 2003 to the payment of interestrelated to these bonds. COMMENTS Revenue bonds are legally secured by a specified revenuesource. For example, tuition revenue bonds (TRBs) arelegally secured by an institution of higher education'stuition and fees. TRBs are used to finance projects such asclassroom facilities and other university buildings. UnderSection 6, part 8.(b.) of the Special Provisions RelatingOnly to State Agencies of Higher Education, 2004-05General Appropriations Act, no educational and general funds appropriated to any institution or agency named inArticle III may be expended on auxiliary enterprises, unlessspecifically authorized in the General Appropriations Act.In other words, TRBs cannot be used for dormitories, foodservices, or athletics. TRB AUTHORIZATION AND ISSUANCE In order to issue TRBs, higher education institutions request projects in their legislative appropriations requests.The legislature has to authorize issuance of the bonds inlegislation. Once an authorization is made, and after theuniversity requests project and financing approval from its board of regents, the project is submitted to the TexasHigher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). The THECB reviews the project to determine whether theconstruction, rehabilitation, or repair meets the standards for cost, efficiency, and space use. The Bond Review Board then verifies funds are available to service the debt and thefinancing system is appropriate. Lastl y, the attorney general reviews and approves the issuance of the bonds. All institutions issue their own bonds except for Midwestern State University, Stephen F. Austin University, and TexasSouthern University. The Texas Public Finance AuthoritySTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 278CONTINUE TO LIMIT GENERAL REVENUE APPROPRIATIONS FOR TUITION REVENUE BONDS TO INTEREST ONLY (TPFA) issues bonds for them. Although the authorization and issuance of TRBs is not conting ent on an appropriation for related debt service, legislative practice has been to useGeneral Revenue Funds to reimburse institutions of highereducation for the cost related to debt service. LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE REGARDING TRBS Using General Revenue Funds to reimburse institutions of higher education for the debt service of TRBs has been thepractice since 1971 when TRBs were first authorized in theamount of $185.0 million. In 1973, the Sixty-third Legisla-ture authorized $57.5 million in TRBs. No additionalauthorizations were made between 1973 and 1991. In 1991,as part of the South Texas Bor der Initiative, the legislature authorized $60.0 million in TRBs. All these higher educa-tion institutions received debt ser vice appropriations, even though universities, pursuant to the Education Code,Section 55.17, may pledge all or any part of their revenuefunds to the payment of bonds. TRB DEBT SERVICE Debt service is the amount of interest and principal required to pay a debt over a specified period of time. TheTRB debt service appropriation can only be used forpaying debt service, and the a ppropriation lapses at the end of the biennium if not used for that purpose. Debt serviceappropriations for TRBs in the 2002-03 biennium totaled$275.6 million. The Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, underSection 51 of the Special Provisions Relating Only to StateAgencies of Higher Education, changed prior policy byappropriating TRB de bt service for interest only for TRBs issued after March 31, 2003. As a result, debt service appropriations for TRBs in the 2004-05 biennium totaled$261.9 million. This change represents a 5 percent decreasefrom the previous biennium.For the 2006-07 biennium, institutions of higher education have indicated they will need $376.6 million in debt serviceappropriations for TRBs issued through the end of fiscalyear 2005. Of that amount, $73.9 million is for interest onTRBs issued after March 31, 2003, and $57.7 million is forprincipal. The recommendation would continue the policy established by the Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, and limit General Revenue Fund appropriations for TRBsissued after March 31, 2003 to the payment of interestrelated to these bonds. The following amended rider underSection 51 of the Special Provisions Relating only to StateAgencies of Higher Education, 2004-05 General Appro-priations Act, could be used to implement this recommen-dation: Debt Service Related to Tuition Revenue Bonds. For tuition revenue bonds issued after March 31,2003, it is the intent of the legislature that GeneralRevenue appropriations for the 2004-05 2006-07 biennium to institutions of higher education be usedonly for the payment of interest related to these bonds. It is the intent of the le gislature tha t Gener al Revenue funding f or these tuition r evenue bonds could be used to pa y principal and inter est pa yments made during the 2006-07 biennium. Continuing the policy established last biennium would make $57.7 million in General Revenue Funds available for other purposes in the 2006-07 biennium.

Unlike formula funding and tuition, which generate revenue inproportion to the number of students educated, Institu-tional Enhancement provides generic supplemental supportunrelated to educational workload. Formula funding forgeneral academic institutions\u2014an objective, and equitableworkload-based vehicle f or allocating resources\u2014has been given a declining percentage of total higher educationfunding; while the less equitable Institutional Enhancementsupplement has received an incr easing percentage of total higher education appropriations. Reducing appropriationsfor Institutional Enhancement would tie a greater propor-tion of higher education funding to objective formulas thatare linked to educational workload. It would also make$203.7 million in biennial General Revenue Funds availablefor formula funding or other state services. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bAt the same time that Institutional Enhancementappropriations as a percentage of higher educationtotal funding for general academic institutions haveincreased from 4 percent to 6 percent, appropria-tions for formula funding have decreased from 77percent to 73 percent. \u008bInstitutions are using Institutional Enhancement forgeneral operating costs, even though these costs arefinanced by other income streams, such as stateformula funding and student tuition. \u008bEducational workload determines the income thatinstitutions receive from formula funding andtuition. The total number of semester credit hourstaken at an institution is a major factor in formula-based funding. Institutional Enhancement funding,on the other hand, has no relation to educationalworkload. \u008bLarge institutions can exercise full tuition flexibilityand have access to much greater financial resourcesthan medium and small institutions; therefore, theneed for Institutional Enhancement appropriationsfor large institutions should be examined more critically. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Institutional Enhancement appropriations for the f our largest general academic institutions in terms of enrollment and stateappropriations\u2014the University of Texas at Austin,Texas A&M University, University of Houston(main campus), and Texas Tech University\u2014shouldbe eliminated. \u008bRecommendation 2: Appropriations for all other institutions that received Institutional Enhancementfunding in the 2004-05 biennium should be reducedby half in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill.The legislature should consider reallocating thesesavings, as appropriate, to other formula funding orother state services. COMMENTS Institutions of higher education receive state appropria-tions from two general sources: formula and non-formulafunding. Formula funding allocates state appropriations toinstitutions using objective variables, such as semestercredit hours and predicted square feet of facilities. Non- formula funding is appropriated to Special Items, Institu-tional Enhancement, Capital Funds, staff benefits, IndirectCost Recovery, and other items. About 73 percent of theAll Funds appropriations to the general academic institu-tions comes from formula funding; non-formula fundingmakes up the rest. INSTITUTIONAL ENHANCEMENT FUNDING Institutional Enhancement appropriations represent a growing portion of total higher education state funding forthe general academic institutions, the institutions to whichmost of this type of funding is allocated. The percentageof All Funds appropriations from Institutional Enhance-ment to the general academic institutions grew from 4percent for the 2000-01 biennium to 6 percent for the2004-05 biennium (see Figure 1). Over the six-year period that Institutional Enhancement funding has increased (fiscal 2000 to fiscal year 2005),formula funding as a percent of total state appropriations forthe general academic institutions has decr eased. Figure 2STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 282ELIMINATE OR REDUCE INSTITUTION AL ENHANCEMENT APPROPRIATIONS TO HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS shows that formula funding in the 2000-01 biennium accounted for 77 percent of total All Funds, and thenshrank to 73 percent in the 2004-05 biennium. This declineis, in part, the result of increasing appropriations toInstitutional Enhancement. Institutional Enhancement is the result of an effort to consolidate certain special items that were once funded byformula funding, such as academic/research support. TheSeventy-seventh Legislature, 1999, Regular Session, mergednumerous special items for certain institutions into a newappropriation, Institutional Enhancement. Combined withan additional $2 million for most institutions, the first2000-01 appropriation totaled $237.2 million for allinstitutions in biennial General Revenue Funds. Many institutions received an additional $2 million more in the 2002-03 biennium. The south Texas and borderinstitutions each received $3 million more for the 2002-03 biennium. On the other hand, those institutions thatbenefited significantly from \"e xcellence\" and research funds received no increase. Over all, the legisla ture appro- priated about $66 million more for the 2002-03 bienniumthan it did in the prior biennium. In the subsequent regular session, the legislature distributed about $46.6 million innew money for the 2004-05 biennium based on eachinstitution's share of non-formula funding, with totalfunding equaling about $350 million. Cost data reported through the Legislative Budget Board's online budget system indicates that institutions receivingInstitutional Enhancement funding tend to use thatrevenue and formula funding for the same type of expendi-tures\u2014such as general oper ating costs, including faculty salaries and staff salaries. This overlap in funding is thereason that the legislature first merged various special itemsthat could be supported by formula funding into theInstitutional Enhancement appropriation. ISSUES WITH INSTITUTIONAL ENHANCEMENT It is reasonable to expect that providing funding for something as generic as operating costs would require someconnection with institutional workload or performance.However, in the case of Institutional Enhancementfunding, appropriations can be used for a variety ofoperating costs. In contrast, formula funding and tuition revenue create income for institutions in proportion to their output.Certain funding formulas, such as the Instruction andOperations formula, allocate money equitably to institu-tions based on the number of semester credit hours theyprovide for their students in a given base period. In asimilar manner, institutions generate tuition revenue bycharging students on a semester credit basis. InstitutionalEnhancement, on the other hand, has no connection withsemester credit hours, or any other educational workloadfactor. It no longer has the same justification that otherspecial items have (supporting the unique mission of eachinstitution), so its value to the state is questionable. Under Recommendation 1, Institutional Enhancement funding for the four largest institutions (University ofTexas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Texas TechUniversity, and University of Houston) would be elimi-nated. Under Recommendation 2, funding for the remain-ing institutions would be reduced by half. In light of the ability the four large institutions have to adjust tuition, and their ability to use other sources ofincome (such as research-related funding), these institutionsare better equipped to respond to a loss of appropriationsthan smaller institutions. As indicated in Figure 3, Institu-tional Enhancement appropriations represent less than 5percent of total state appropria tions for each of the four largest institutions.

The 2004-05 General Appropria-tions Act provides for an additional 10 percent to be addedto the funding formula when tenured and tenure-trackfaculty teach undergraduate courses . However, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board's data concerningthe faculty used for undergr aduate courses and recent performance measures from the General AppropriationsAct reporting on tenured and ten ure-track pr ofessors in lower division courses both indica te that the percentage of courses taught by tenured and tenure-track faculty has infact decreased since the supplement was implemented.Because the teaching experience supplement has not hadthe intended impact, the legislature should considereliminating appropriations for it. This would make $70.5 million in biennial General Revenue Funds available forformula funding or other state services. SIGNIFICANT FINDING \u008bTexas Higher Education Coordinating Board showsthe percentage of tenured and tenure-track facultyteaching undergraduate semester credit hoursdecreased from 56 percent in the fall of 1998 to 51percent in the fall of 2003. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bSince the percentage of courses taught by tenuredand tenure-track faculty has decreased since 1998,the teaching experience supplement represents anunnecessary allocation to the higher educationfunding formula because it does not achieve itspurpose of increasing the percentage of under-graduate teaching hours provided by tenured andtenure-track faculty. RECOMMENDATION \u008bThe 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill shouldnot include appropriations for the teaching experi-ence supplement, thus reducing the GeneralRevenue Funds contribution to the higher educationfunding formula by $70.5 million. The legislatureshould consider reallocating these savings, asappropriate, to other formula funding or other stateservices.COMMENTS General academic institutions of higher education areallocated most of their funding through formulas andsupplements. The formulas are the instruction and opera-tions formula and the infrastructure formula. The supple-ments are Teaching Experience Supplement (TES) and thesmall institution supplement. These formulas and supple-ments are direct appropriations from the General RevenueFund and General Revenue-Dedicated Funds. In the2004-05 biennium, approximately $3.1 billion was allocatedto the instruction and operations formula, of which $97.0million was for TES. Approximately $70.5 million of TESappropriations were from the General Revenue Fund andthe remaining appropriations were General Revenue-Dedicated Funds, primarily from tuition and fees collectedby the institutions. The amount of funds appropriated to each institution from the instruction and operations formula is equal tothe product of the number of semester credit hours(SCH), the program or level of a course, and the staterate, as shown in Figure 1. The program or level is aweight assigned to the particular discipline. For example,nursing is weighted more than liberal arts and upperdivision courses are weighted more than lower divisioncourses. The state rate varies depending on the amountappropriated to the instruction and operations formula.TES adds an additional percentage increase to theinstruction and operations formula. For the 2004-05 biennium, TES appropriations were about 3 percent of the total instruction and operations formula. The$70.5 million in General Revenue Funds appropriated toTES is distributed among Texas' 35 general academicinstitutions for the biennium. Figure 2 provides a breakdown of the General Revenue Funds appropriated to each institution for the 2004-05 biennium.

This was predicated on the belief that the mostknowledgeable, thus best qualified, faculty were tenuredand tenure-tracked. Initiall y, TES added a 5 percent increase to the formula, and subsequently in fiscal year2002, the weight was increased to 10 percent. The current weight for TES remains at 10 percent, although the rider provision states tha t the legislative intent is to increase the weight to 50 percent. At the currentweight, THECB data shows no increase in the percentage of tenured and tenure-track faculty teaching undergraduateSCH. As a result, the current reimbursement did not havethe desired effect on the percentage of tenured and tenure-track faculty teaching undergraduate courses. Additional duties of tenured and tenure-track faculty, such as student advising, committee meetings, andresearch, prohibit institutions from increasing thepercentage of undergraduate courses taught by thesefaculty members. As a result, concerns are raised byeducators about increasing the classroom time of tenuredand tenure-track faculty because it will leave less time forthese other functions. THECB's report, Higher Education in Texas: 1998 Status Report , stressed that research is vital for maintaining and increasing the expertise and knowledge of tenured and tenure-track faculty. Non-tenured facultyrarely perform these other duties in addition to theirclassroom instruction. THECB data shows the percentage of tenured and tenure-track faculty teaching undergraduate semestercredit hours decreased from 56 percent in the fall of 1998to 51 percent in the fall of 2003. Furthermore, perfor-mance measures in the General Appropriations Act(GAA) reporting on the percent of tenured and tenure-track faculty used to teach lower division courses show, onaverage, an initial increase in the percentage of coursestaught in 2000. This percentage has steadily declined sincethen (see Figure 3). Consequently, the recommendation isto eliminate TES because it has not achieved its purposeof increasing the percentage of tenured and tenure-trackfaculty teaching undergraduate courses.0%20%40%60% 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Lower Divisions Courses Taught by Tenured and Tenure-Track Undergraduate SCH Taught by Tenured and Tenure-TrackFIGURE 3 PERCENT OF SEMESTER CREDIT HOUR TAUGHT BYTENURED AND TENURE-TRACK FACULTY SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.

Tuition Equaliza-tion Grants' purpose is to maximiz e the use of the state's educational resources and facilities by offering need-basedfinancial assistance to students to attend private institutionsrather than public institutions. Lower-income families areidentified as those eligible for feder al Pell Grants. In fiscal year 2003, $39.5 million of the total annual TuitionEqualization Grant appropriation of $70.7 million wasgiven to Pell Grant recipients. By limiting Tuition Equaliza-tion Grants to Pell Grant recipients exclusively, the state could maintain its current level of contribution to Pell andTuition Equalization Grant recipients and save an estimated$31.2 million in General Revenue Funds annually. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bThe Texas Higher Education Coordinating Boarddoes not award Tuition Equalization Grants solely tostudents with significant financial need. Thelegislature created T uition Equalization Grants to encourage students who otherwise could not affordit to attend private universities and colleges. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend the Tuition Equaliza- tion Grant eligibility requirement in Section 61.225of the Texas Education Code to restrict TuitionEqualization Grant awards to federal Pell Grantrecipients exclusively. \u008bRecommendation 2: The 2006-07 biennial General Revenue Funds appropriation to the TexasHigher Education Coordinating Board for TuitionEqualization Grants should be reduced by $62.4million to provide Tuition Equalization Grantawards exclusively to Pell Grant recipients at itscurrent level of contribution. COMMENTS In 1971, the Sixty-second Legislature created the TuitionEqualization Grants (TEG) progr am to encourage needy students to attend private universities and colleges byhelping them pay the higher tuition. By diverting studentsto private institutions, the state lessens the expense ofexpanding the public college system and spends less moneyfor each student diverted. TEG may not exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of the aver age state appropriation per student to public institutions. In fiscal year 2003, the statepaid an average of $7,306 in All Funds to public institu-tions for each full-time-equivalent (FTE) student and paid amaximum of $3,653 per FTE student for TEG. However,the General Revenue Fund appropriation for an FTEstudent at a public university is $5,255; therefore, TEG isapproximately 70 percent of the state's General RevenueFund appropriations. To be eligible for TEG, a studentmust meet the following qualifications: \u008bbe a Texas resident and/or national merit finalist; \u008benroll on at least one-half time basis; \u008bbe required to pay more tuition than is required at apublic college or university; \u008bestablish financial need; \u008bnot be a recipient of any fo rm of athletic scholarship; \u008bregister for the Selective Service or be exempt from this requirement; and \u008bbe required to pay more tuition than that of a public institution. FINANCIAL NEED CALCULATION TEG assistance is contingent on student financial need. Financial need is determined by subtracting the expectedfamily contribution (EFC) from the cost of attendance.The EFC is obtained when a student/family completesthe Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).The EFC calculation takes into account a family's incomeand assets, but it also considers family size and extraordi-nary expenses, such as having another child in college. Asa result, both middle and upper middle-income familiesmay qualify for some type of need-based financial aid.Financial aid resources can vary greatly, ranging from giftaid to loans, with those having the greatest need qualify-ing for the federal Pell Grant. In addition to financial aid,families may apply for additional student loans that arenot related to need. These loans are subject to the usualloan application process. The cost of attendance is based on a nine-month period and includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, and livingexpenses. Because EFC is subtracted from the cost ofSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 290LIMIT TUITION EQUALIZATION GRANTS TO PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS To bridge this gap, TEG serves to provide more options to lower-income students by offering additional financialassistance so they may have the opportunity to attendprivate colleges. Therefore, in order to meet the goal of the TEG program, which is to maximize the use of existing educational resources by encouraging students to attendprivate institutions who otherwise could not afford it, TEGshould be provided exclusively to those who are eligible for the federal Pell Grant program. Recommendation 1 would restrict the use of the TEG to those students receiving the federal Pell Grant. Section61.225 of the Texas Education Code should be amended tolimit TEG to Pell Grant recipients. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 2 would reduce the 2006-07 biennial General Revenue Fund appropriation to THECB for TEGby $62.4 million as shown in Figure 3. Approximately 48 percent of those who receive TEGs are also awarded Pell Grants. Although the percentage of TEGprovided to Pell Grant recipients fluctuates, the fundingamount of $39.5 million has remained steady for the lasttwo years. The annual TEG appropriation in the 2004-05biennium is approximately $70.7 million, of which $39.5million in TEG funds were awarded to federal Pell Grant recipients. The state could eliminate TEG funds to non-Pell Grant recipients and save $31.2 million annually.Average Cost of Attendance $12,204 $14,379 Average Amount of Available Resources \u00b7 Expected Family Contribution $1,493 $11,669 \u00b7 Waivers and Outside Aid $172 $436 \u00b7 $3,066 $1,863\u00b7 $4,645 $(8,019)STUDENTS RECEIVING AID TO MEETNEEDSTUDENTS RECEIVING LOANS AT LEAST IN PART TO REPLACE FAMILY CONTRIBUTIONFIGURE 2 STUDENTS RECEIVING AID SOURCE : Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.attendance to determine financial need, the more expensive the institution's tuition and fees are, the greater the need.Thus, a student attending a private institution will beeligible for more financial aid than a student attending apublic university if the EFCs of the two students areequivalent. According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB), a family m ust show exceptional financial need to be eligible for a Pell Grant as shown in Figure 1. Since Pell Grant recipients have fewer college options, TEG awards can provide more choices to students byoffering additional assistance. Furthermore, privateinstitutions have additional sources of federal financial aid, such as the Leveraging Educational Assistance Program(LEAP) and the Special Leveraging Educational AssistanceProgram (SLEAP). These programs require the state tomatch federal funding at the rate of either one or twodollars per every feder al dollar. Because TEG is state funded, THECB can use this program as match to leverageadditional federal aid for students who attend privateinstitutions. In contrast, students from families in the middle or greater income range have more choices about where to attendcollege. When such a student attends a private institution, thehigher cost of attendance increases his/her eligibility forfinancial aid. According to THECB, middle-income familiesare more likely to borrow their EFC. THECB data indicatesthat these families have the ability to borrow more than thecost associated with attending a public institution. Though,according to a 2003 THECB financial aid report, \"only 18percent of students from these families attended a privateinstitution. The vast majority of such students were attend-ing public institutions.\" Figure 2 shows the resources available to those receiving aid to meet their financial need and data on those whoreceive loans to replace part of their EFC for the 2002-03academic year. Students receiving aid to meet their need, onaverage, are eligible for Pell Grants and still have unmetneeds of $4,645; whereas, families who borrow the EFC are not eligible for Pell Grants and have approximately $8,000 surplus. The average yearly difference in costbetween a private and public institution is $8,550.The federal Pell Grant is an entitlement for those students who show exceptional financial need. Pell Grants are awarded to undergraduatestudents who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. To qualify, a student's EFC cannot exceed $3,850. The maximum amount of the Pell Grant is adjusted annually, so it varies from year to year.

In essence, the more hoursattempted, the more it will cost the state. Several factorscontribute to an excessive n umber of semester credit hours attempted. Changing majors is reported most frequently asthe reason why students take excessive hours to graduate.Institutional policies requiring additional semester credithours and academic mandates set by the legislature also contribute to the increased number of hours required for a degree. The legislature can curtail the cost associated withexcessive semester credit hours by capping state funding for bachelor's degrees to 15 percent above the degreerequirement and establishing controls to limit excessivedegree requirements without appropriate academicjustification. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bStatutory mandates requiring courses in UnitedStates history and United States and Texas govern-ment (Section 51.301 and 51.302, Texas EducationCode) contribute to a core curriculum lengthranging from 42-48 semester credit hours. Institu-tions with core curricula longer than 42 semestercredit hours correlate with longer minimum degreelengths. In addition, credit transfer problems occurbetween public and private or out-of-state universi- ties as a result of these legislative mandates. \u008bThere is no maximum degr ee length in Texas, which has led to a wide discrepancy in institutionalrequirements. Semester credit hour degree require-ments can vary up to 25 hours for the same degreeacross the state. Several institutions have set theminimum for all degrees above 120 hours regardlessof the discipline. \u008bOn average, 9 percent of any given student cohort will take six years to graduate with an average of 167semester credit hours. As a result, the current statelaw capping bachelor degree funding to 45 semestercredit hours over the degree requirement onlyaffects a small number of students and results in a negligible savings to the state. \u008bMany institutions have implemented programs thatreduce time to degree, which may minimize anexcessive number of semester credit hours. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Section 61.822 of the Texas Education Code should be amended to require allpublic institutions to maintain a core curriculumbetween 36 and 42 semester credit hours. \u008bRecommendation 2: Remove Section 51.301 and 51.302 of the Texas Education Code that requiresall state funded institutions to provide six semestercredit hours of United States history and sixsemester credit hours of United States and Texasgovernment. \u008bRecommendation 3: The Texas Education Code should be amended to set the maximum length for abachelor's degree at 120 semester credit hours anddirect the Texas Higher Education CoordinatingBoard to develop criteria to allow exceptions to this,such as academic best practices with respect toaccreditation, certifications, and industry require-ments. \u008bRecommendation 4: Amend Section 61.0595 of the Texas Education Code to cap state funding for abachelor degree to 15 per cent above the degree requirement. \u008bRecommendation 5: Universities and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board should berequired to report key performance measures tracking semester credit hours to evaluate universities'successes in implementing programs that reducestudents' time to degree completion and semestercredit hours attempted to ensure that students wouldgraduate under a 15 percent funding cap. COMMENTS The Seventy-fifth Legislature, 1997, mandated the TexasHigher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) to adoptrules establishing policies and procedures for the develop-ment, adoption, implementation, and evaluation of theSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 294STREAMLINE COLLEGE DEGREE SEMESTER CREDIT HOUR REQUIREMENTS core curriculum. The core curriculum consists of 42 semester credit hours (SCH) of general education neces-sary to develop the essential basic competencies for alldisciplines. Core courses are required for all students at each public institution regardless of their field of study. Each institution's core curriculum must be designed to achieve the educational objectives specified in five basiccomponent areas. A sixth component, referred to as aninstitution's designated option, allows institutions to includeadditional course work that is not included in the educa-tional objectives of the other components, such as com-puter literacy or health and wellness . The following are the five basic components: \u008bcommunication language/literatureand cultural studies); and \u008bsocial/behavioral sciences (includes legislativelymandated courses). The minimum core curriculum is set at 42 SCH, but each institution can seek approval from THECB to offeradditional courses. According to THECB, institutions havebeen provided a blanket approval to provide up to 48 SCHas long as the institutions do not adopt additional hoursfrom the institution's designated option component. Recommendation 1 states that the core curriculum should be reduced to a range from 36 to 42 SCH. Although thecurrent length is 42 SCH, many schools continue to havea core curriculum of up to 48 SCH. The State of Floridahas mandated its core curriculum to 36 SCH, and theSouthern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS)only requires a minimum core curriculum length of 30SCH. An analysis of institutions with a core curriculumexceeding 42 SCH correlates with minimum degree lengthexceeding 120 SCH. Sections 51.301 and 51.302 of the Texas Education Code require all state-funded institutions to provide six SCH ofUnited States history (may include Texas history), and sixSCH of United States and Texas government. Thesecourses are included in the core curriculum. The UnitedStates history mandate was first enacted in 1955 and wasrecently amended in 1995 to allow students to receivecredit through an advanced placement exam. The U.S. andTexas government mandate was first enacted in 1929 andwas most recently amended in 1995 to also allow studentsto receive credit through advanced placement exams, andalso provided exemptions to this requirement for military personnel. The core curriculum statute requires institutions to transfer a completed core curriculum from one institutionto another. As a result, THECB reports very few com-plaints relating to core course transfers among publicinstitutions. However, transfer problems do exist betweenprivate, out-of-state, and public institutions. For example,in both out-of-state and private institutions, students arenot required to take the legislatively mandated Texasgovernment; therefore, students will sometimes completeother courses in general education required by the privateor out-of-state institution and find they have not met thestatutory requirement when transferring into a publicinstitution in Texas. Recommendation 2 suggests that the legislature consider removing Section 51.301 and 51.302 of the Texas Educa-tion Code requiring all state-funded institutions to providesix SCH of U.S. history and six SCH of U.S. and Texasgovernment. Removing the legislative mandate wouldminimize transfer problems associated with core require-ments between public institutions and private or out-of-state institutions. Furthermore, THECB data show themajority of students in Texas public higher educationinstitutions attended high school in Texas where courses in Texas, United States, and world history, as well as govern- ment are also required (19, TAC, Chapter 74). This resultsin potentially needless repetition. MAXIMUM DEGREE LENGTHS SACS sets a minimum of 120 SCH for all bachelor's degrees. However, there is no such standard for limiting themaximum number of SCH institutions may request for abachelor's degree. Many factors can contribute to therequired hours for a degree, such as required certifications,industry requirements, and national academic accredita-tions. Therefore, the maxim um number of hours required to obtain a degree may vary, but should not be unlimited. In Texas, several institutions have set their minimum degree lengths to be over 120 SCH regardless of thefield of study. For example, Angelo State Universityrequires all students to complete 130 SCH for a degree,and Texas State University requires 128 SCH. A reviewconducted of the top 25 degrees granted in the state ofTexas (which accounted for approximately 60 percent ofthe 2003 graduates) found that the degree lengths variedup to 25 SCH for the same degree. This analysis com-pared the same degree based on the federal standardsprinted in the 2000 edition of Classification Instruc-tional Program.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 295STREAMLINE COLLEGE DEGREE SEMESTER CREDIT HOUR REQUIREMENTS Some states have sought to curtail the differences in the length of bachelor's degrees by setting a maximumstandard. Florida and Georgia set the maximum degreelength at 120 SCH. In order to exceed 120 SCH, aninstitution must seek prior approval from the state. Recommendation 3 would establish a bachelor's degree maximum at 120 SCH with exceptions allowed based oncriteria developed by the THECB. Texas implemented asimilar process when the legislature capped funding fordoctoral students at 99 SCH. Statute directed THECB todevelop criteria for institutions to follow that would allowexceptions to the 99-hour cap. THECB reports that thisprogram has been successful and the number of studentsexceeding the 99-hour cap significantly decreased. FUNDING CAP FOR BACHELOR'S DEGREE In 1997, the legislatur e passed a number of incentive programs to encourage students to graduate more timely,including the B-on-Time Program and Tuition RebateProgram. In addition to these incentives, the legislature alsoplaced funding limits on SCH. For example, the state willnot fund courses taken by students who take more than 45 SCH above the degree requirement, nor will it fund thesame course attempted by a student for a third time. It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of these changes untilan entire cohort passes through the educational system. The standard for measuring student performance is to evaluate a particular cohort from their initial entrance intoschool for up to six years. Based on this methodology,approximately 9 percent of \"full-time entering\" studentstake six years to graduate with an average of 167 SCH.When considering only those in the cohort who graduate,17 percent are taking six years to complete. Furthermore,since similar degree lengths can vary up to 25 SCH, thedata suggest only a small number of students may exceedthe 45 SCH cap. For example, if a student completes a 130SCH degree, the state will pa y up to 175 SCH, which exceeds the average number of SCH completed by studentsin six years. Florida's Office of Program Policy and Analysis and Government Accountability recommended the FloridaLegislature require students who take more than 115percent of the SCH required for their degrees to pay thefull cost of tuition for the additional hours. Therefore,students graduating with a 120 SCH degree would onlybe funded by the state to take up to 18 SCH over thedegree requirement. Florida's data show that only 20percent of students would be affected by such a policy,and the state could save approximately $30 million if itwere implemented.Recommendation 4 would reduce the funding cap for a bachelor's degree to no more than 15 percent above thedegree requirement. Since THECB data suggest only 9percent of the students take six years to graduate with anaverage of 167 SCH, only a small number of studentswould be affected by this change. However, to providestudents opportunities to avoid reaching the cap, programssuch as dual credit courses in high school, credit by exam, remedial courses, and private institution attendance shouldbe exempt from this cap. UNIVERSITY ACCOUNTABILITY Universities should also share the responsibility of reducing the number of SCH attempted with students by imple-menting programs to ensure students can graduate withinthe funding cap. Many institutions have already imple-mented programs that reduce time to degree, which should help minimize the number of SCH. For example, theUniversity of Texas at Austin implemented a flat-ratetuition plan consisting of charging one rate for 14 SCHregardless of how many hours more than 14 that a studentactually takes. Texas Tech guarantees that every classneeded to graduate will be available for the student bycourse substitutions and waivers. The University ofHouston gives tuition discounts to students who take aclass on a Saturday. Recommendation 5 would require universities to report performance in reducing time to degree completion andSCH attempted by students. The Legislative Budget Board(LBB) will monitor university outcomes through keyperformance measures. Currently, the LBB collects six-yeargraduation rates as a key measure in the General Appro-priations Act and will request to collect four-year gradua-tion rates for the 2006-07 biennium. To measure theeffectiveness of universities' use of incentives and theability to advise students through its system, SCH keymeasures should be required of both universities andTHECB in addition to the yearly graduation rates for the 2008-09 biennium. Example measures include tracking thepercentage of students who graduate under the following conditions: \u008bwith 120 SCH or equal to the degree requirement, \u008bwithin 15 percent of the degree requirement, and \u008bexceeding 15 percent of the degree requirement. By implementing performance measures for universities and capping funding for students, both institutions andstudents can share in the responsibility to meet the goal ofreducing both the time and SCH required for degreecompletion.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 296STREAMLINE COLLEGE DEGREE SEMESTER CREDIT HOUR REQUIREMENTS FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS The above recommendations should be implemented with a new cohort of students; ther efore, the savings to the General Revenue Fund cannot be realized until a newcohort completes the six-year cycle. Although there will beno immediate fiscal impact as a result of these changes,future cost avoidance can be estimated in order to appreci-ate the value of curtailing the number of SCH attemptedby students. Each year, approximately 3,940 students take six years to graduate with 167 SCH. Assuming their degree length isnow a 120 SCH and they graduate within 15 percent ofthe degree requirement, the approximate reduction inthe number of hours attempted by each student wouldbe 30 SCH. A full-time-student equivalent (FTSE) is 30SCH and is currently funded at $5,255 in GeneralRevenue Funds. By multiplying the number of studentswith the FTSE appropriation, the potential savings is$20.7 million annually in General Revenue Funds.However, such savings w ould not be r ealized for at least six years; therefore, the immediate fiscal impact cannotbe determined. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any adjustments as a result of therecommendations.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 297FUNDING ISSUES RELATED TO THE VISITING JUDGES PROGRAM In view of budget shortfalls , the Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, determined that cuts to visitingjudge appropriations were more practical than cuts tosalaries and other expenses of elected, active judges and felony prosecutors. Additionally, while prior legislatures hadprovided estimated appr opriation authority for the visiting judge program (i.e., unlimited appropriations), the Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, placed a cap on visiting judgefunding levels. The public, trial courts, appellate courts, and the legislature are all stakeholders in the effective administration ofjustice. Additionally, legislators have historically beensensitive to concerns expressed by the trial or appellate court judges and justices from their districts. Requests forthe Seventy-ninth Legislature, 2005, to restore funding tothe visiting judge program will likely originate from avariety of sources. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bLocal costs for creating and maintaining a newdistrict court vary across the state. Counties provid-ing information for fiscal notes in the regular sessionestimated that maintaining a new district courtwould range between $22,285 (Caldwell County) and$1 million (Collin County) per fiscal year. \u008bMost visiting judges serving district courts areretired judges, whose average compensation is$98,547 annually, or 76 percent of the salary andbenefits of a district judge ($129,365). \u008bFunding for visiting judges serving in district courtsdecreased by 56 percent between 2002-03 biennialexpenditures and 2004-05 biennial appropriations. \u008bPrior to fiscal year 2004, visiting judges serving ahalf-day or less were entitled to a full day's pay.House Bill 3306, Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003,authorized half-day pay for judges serving a half-dayor less, and it is estimated that over the 2004-05biennium this provision will save $0.9 million invisiting judge costs. \u008bFunding for visiting judges serving in appellatecourts decreased by 84 percent between 2002-03biennial expenditures and 2004-05 biennial appro-priations. In the 2004-05 biennium, intermediateappellate court justices have $0.6 million available inGeneral Revenue Funds to pay visiting judges, which is half of the $1.2 million in estimated leave timeneeded to substitute for the absence of activejudges. Appellate justices are seeking $0.8 million inGeneral Revenue Funds for the 2006-07 biennium,which would provide for two weeks annual leave,one week for continuing legal education, and oneweek of sick leave. COMMENTS The Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003,reduced funding levels for visiting judges serving indistrict- and appellate-level courts from $21.9 million forthe 2002-03 biennium to $7.3 million for the 2004-05biennium. This represents a reduction of 67 percentbetween 2002-03 expenditures and 2004-05 biennialappropriations (see Figure 1). Visiting judges are assigned to trial and appellate courts for a variety of reasons, including instances in which an activejudge is disqualified in a case, recused in a case, onextended sick leave, or involved in a lengthy trial. At the trial court level, the presiding judges of the nine administrative judicial regions assign visiting judges (seeFigure 2). Trial court uses for visiting judges includeadjudication of complex multi-district civil cases andmanagement of the regular caseload of trial judges involvedin high-profile capital cases. During the 2002-03 biennium,seven of the nine administrative regions used visiting judgeson a full-time basis to hear drug, tax, foster care, or otherspecialty cases. Specialty courts operating in the sevenregions during the 2002-03 biennium are shown in Figure 3. The Office of Court Administration reports that during fiscal year 2003, visiting judges were paid for a total of26,203 days in the administrative judicial regions. Assuming afull-time active judge is paid for 250 days during a fiscal year,visiting judge service was the equivalent of adding 110 full-time judges to the trial courts during fiscal year 2003. At the intermediate appellate court level, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may assign a visiting judge at therequest of the chief justice of an appellate court to helpcontrol backlogs of cases or to hear special dockets.Additionally, because appellate justices must hear cases inpanels of three, appellate courts employing only threepermanent justices must use a visiting judge when onejustice must be disqualified or is recused from a case.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 298FUNDING ISSUES RELATED TO THE VISITING JUDGES PROGRAM FUNDING FOR VISITING JUDGE PAYMENTS Texas has provided for the payment of visiting judges under the Government Code since 1927. In 1957 thelegislature adopted a provision for compensating visitingjudges similar to the provision in law today. Since the1998-99 biennium, funding for visiting judge payments hasfluctuated from a high of $10.3 million in fiscal year 1999to a low of $8.7 million in fiscal year 2000, a year when 13 new district courts were created (see Figure 4). Betweenfiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 2003, cases pending perelected district court judge grew by 10.5 percent, eventhough visiting judges were emplo yed. By contrast, during the same time period, cases pending per elected intermedi-ate appellate court justice fell by 32.4 percent, in partspurred by a rider and funding provided in the GeneralAppropriations Act for the 2000-01 biennium to reduce abacklog of cases at the Houston and Dallas courts. Visiting judge proponents argue that the use of visiting judges is less expensive than the creation of new trialcourts. A new trial court costs the state $129,365 each yearfor the salary ($101,700) and benefits ($27,665) of eachnew district judge. Local costs for creating and maintaininga new district court vary across the state. Counties provid-ing information for fiscal notes during the regular sessionin 2003 estimated that maintaining a new district courtwould range between $22,285 (Caldwell County) and $1.0million (Collin County) per fiscal year.In contrast, a visiting judge in a district court is compen- sated at 85 percent of the salary of a district judge. Avisiting retired judge is given additional compensation of100 percent of the county supplement paid an activedistrict judge. According to the comptroller, most visitingjudges serving are retired judges, whose average compensa-tion is $98,547, or 76 percent of the salary and benefits ofa district judge. Visiting judges serve in existing courtroomsprovided by local government, which precludes additionallocal expenses for supporting staff and facility overhead. Visiting judges serving appellate courts are compensated at 100 percent of the salary of an active appellate justice. LEGISLATION RELATED TO VISITING JUDGE PAYMENTS House Bill 3296, passed by the Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, authorized payments to retired statutory countyjudges serving as visiting judges in county courts. Anestimated $2.9 million was spent for this purpose in the2002-03 biennium. The Seventy-eighth Legislature, RegularSession, 2003, amended the statute to revoke this Govern-ment Code provision in House Bill 3306 due to budgetshortfalls. Excluding these one-time 2002-03 paymentsfrom the total $18.2 million expended for visiting judges inthe judicial regions results in a reduction of 56 percentbetween 2002-03 expenditures and 2004-05 appropriations(see Figure 4). Additionally, House Bill 3306 provided thatvisiting judges serving for a half day or less are compen-sated at rates equal to one-half the amount the judge would2004-05 APPROPRIATIONS FOR VISITING JUDGES FY 2004 FY 2005 Judges, Former Judges, Appropriated Amounts $7,322,626 FY Retired Judges, Former Judges, Appellate Appellate $1,238,300 $1,493,300 2002-03 Expended Amounts $21,866,025 Percentage reduction between 2004-05 appropriations and 2002-03 expenditures is 67%.FIGURE 1 FUNDING FOR VISITING JUDGES (JUDICIARY SECTION, COMPTROLLER'S DEPARTMENT) SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board; Comptroller of Public Accounts.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 299FUNDING ISSUES RELATED TO THE VISITING JUDGES PROGRAM FIGURE 2 PRESIDING JUDGES AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2004 SOURCE : Office of Court Administration.FIRST John Ovard 133 N.

Main, Rm 204WBrownfield 79316 806/637-1329Section 74.042, Texas Government Code, establishes nine administra- tive judicial regions in the state, with the presiding judge for each region designated by the governor. The duties of a presiding judge include promulgating and implementing regional rules of administration, advising local judges on judicial management, recommending changes to the Supreme Court for the improvement of judicial administration, and acting for local administra-tive judges in their absence. The presiding judge of each region convenes an annual conference of the district and statutory county court judges in the region to discuss theadministration of justice and to adopt regional rules of administration. The presiding judge may assign active, senior, and former district judges and active, retired, and former statutory county court judges residingwithin the region to serve on a court as needed. A presiding judge may request that another presiding judge assign a judge from his region to sit in the region of the requesting judge. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court convenes an annual conference of the nine presiding judges to promote uniform administration of justice in the state. In addition, the Chief Justice is empowered to assign judgesof one administrative regions for service in another region whenever such assignments are necessary for the prompt and efficient administra- tion of justice. STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 300FUNDING ISSUES RELATED TO THE VISITING JUDGES PROGRAM have been paid for a full day. In fiscal years prior to 2004, visiting judges serving a half day or less were entitled to afull day's pay. It is estimated that over the 2004-05 bien-nium this provision will save $0.9 million in visiting judgecosts. 2004-05 GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT RIDERS The 2004-05 General Appropriations Act also includes four riders relating to visiting judge assignments. TheJudiciary Section, Comptroller's Department bill patternincludes Rider 7: Visiting Judges. The appropriations made above to the Judiciary Section, Comptroller's Department forthe use of visiting judges are determined on theassumption that each appellate judge or justice andeach district judge will receive an average of three weeks annual leave and three days sick leave. Out of the amounts appropriated above for visiting judgesin the nine administrative judicial regions, no lessthan $ 39,000 for the biennium has been providedfor the purpose of visiting judge payments in casesfor civil commitment of sexually violent predators.Additionally, out of the amounts appropriated abovefor visiting judges in the nine administrative judicialregions, no less than $1,266,261 for the bienniumhas been provided for the purpose of visiting judgepayments in multi-district civil cases, capital cases,specialty criminal, civil, and family law cases, andother specialty cases as determined by the presidingjudges of the nine administrative judicial regions. The rider states that, except for specialty courts or cases, visiting judge funds should be used to provide personalleave time for elected, activ e judges. Concern that funding cuts would have a greater effect on caseloads in districtcourts than in appellate courts resulted in 2004-05appropriations somewhat different than the leave timeassumptions. The 2004-05 appropriation for visiting judgefunds serving district courts totals $6.7 million, whichexceeds estimated leave time by $1.3 million. In contrast, in2004-05, intermediate appellate court justices have $0.6million available to pay visiting judges, which is half of the$1.2 million in estimated leave time needed to substitute forthe absence of active judges. Funding for visiting judgesserving in appellate courts decreased by 84 percentbetween 2002-03 expenditures and 2004-05 appropria-tions. Appellate justices are seeking $0.8 million for the2006-07 biennium, which would provide for two weeksannual leave, one week for continuing legal education, and one week of sick leave.

Rider 9, Assistance to Presiding Judges of the Nine Administrative Judicial Regions, directs OCA to assist thepresiding judges with seeking other funding sources for thevisiting judge program. Rider 10, Interagency Contract for Assigned Judges for Foster Care Courts, provides that OCA may reimburse the Judiciary Section, Comptroller's Department for visitingjudges serving in Foster Care courts. In fiscal year 2004, OCA provided the comptroller with a $125,000 interagency contract under Rider 10. In fiscal yearSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 302FUNDING ISSUES RELATED TO THE VISITING JUDGES PROGRAM 2005, OCA was reimbursed this same amount in inter- agency contracts from the Department of Family andProtective Services from f ederal funding for State Court Improvement projects. Finally, federal funding through theCriminal Justice Division of the Governor's Office forcriminal-impact courts was considered a possible fundingsource during the legislative session. However, OCAreports that the agency has been unable to secure this typeof funding for visiting judges. Presiding judges and others in the administrative judicial regions have expressed concern that funding reductions forvisiting judges will cause a backlog of cases. For fiscal year 2004, data from the Texas Jail Standards Commissionindicate an increase in the pretrial felony population of 6percent and an increase in the pretrial misdemeanorpopulation of 10 percent. However, the direct cause of theincrease in pretrial populations is difficult to prove and islikely the result of a combination of factors. PREVIOUS REVIEWS OF THE VISITING JUDGE PROGRAM The Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, recently considered the issue of visiting judge use at the trial court level. Rider12 in the General Appropriations Act for the 2002-03biennium directed the Texas Judicial Council to report onvisiting judge use and criteria for determining the need tocreate additional district courts. The resulting report, issued in October 2002, made several recommendations intended to assess the need for visitingjudges and new district courts, including the following: (1) The legislature should address judicial redistricting and consider removing overlapping geographicjudicial districts; (2) The legislature should address concurrent subject matter jurisdiction between district courts andcounty-level courts; and, (3) The legislature should appropriate funding for a \"judicial workload assessment\" (weighted caseloadstudy) for district courts. In November 2002, the Senate Committee on Jurispru- dence submitted an interim report to the Seventy-eighthLegislature, which included recommendations on assessingjudicial workload, judicial redistricting, and the cost-effectiveness of the visiting judge program. The recom-mendations included the following: (1) The legislature should not adopt new judicial districts until there has been an accurate assessmentof judicial workload;(2) The legislature should require the OCA to report additional data on visiting judge use; (3) The senate should adopt rules for creating new district courts; and (4) The legislature should require OCA to submit a report on jurisdictional conflicts between courts. The recommendations in the two reports differ signifi- cantly in one key aspect. The Texas Judicial Council wouldhave the legislature ad dress judicial redistricting before conducting additional studies of judicial workload;however, the Senate Committee on Jurisprudence wouldhave the OCA conduct additional statewide assessments ofjudicial workload before asking the legislature to addressjudicial redistricting. In summer of 2003, the presidingjudges of the nine administrative judicial regions adopted aform to report reasons for visiting judge use to OCA.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 303RESIDENTIAL CONTRACT CARE AT THE TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION This report provides an analysis of residential contract care at the Texas Youth Commission. The agency's facilityexpansions to address population increases are described,and a general overview of residential contract-care servicesis provided. A cost estimate is developed for residentialcontract care funding for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, andcost savings relative to fiscal years 2004 and 2005 arecalculated. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bTexas Youth Commission facility expansions haveprovided more bed space to address increased youthresidential populations between 1995 and 2000.Institutional facility expansions should be completedin fiscal year 2005. \u008bContract-care facilities provide bed space in a timelymanner when youth populations increase overinstitutional bed capacity and provide specializedplacement options for special-need populationswithin the Texas Youth Commission. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bTo address state budget constraints and recentpopulation decreases, contract-care funding can bereduced in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 while stillproviding some secure and non-secure specializedprogram beds. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: In the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill, reduce contract-care appropria-tions to fund an average of 232 beds for fiscal year2006 and 300 beds for fiscal year 2007. \u008bRecommendation 2: Include in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill a rider that requires theTexas Youth Commission to fully utilize its institu-tional capacity before contract-care beds are utilized. COMMENTS Human Resources Code, Section 61.075, authorizes theTexas Youth Commission (TYC) to order a youth'sconfinement under conditions best designed for the youth'swelfare and the interests of the public. To comply with this statutory requirement, TYC currently uses 14 institutionalfacilities, 9 halfway houses, and 23 contract-care facilities tohouse residential youth populations . These facilities provide direct supervision, housing, food, clothing, healthcare, security, education, and correctional treatment of theyouths. TYC's residential bed capacity is made up of twotypes: state-operated beds (institutional facilities andhalfway houses) and contract-care beds. INCREASES IN TYC RESIDENTIAL POPULATIONS The Youth Commission's activities and functions are directly affected by youth populations in the juvenile justice system. In fiscal year 1994, the juvenile justice system started to experience large population increases. Figure 1shows TYC youth end-of-year residential populationsversus state-owned bed capacity fr om fiscal years 1994 to 2004. In 1995, TYC's internal capacity was 1,880 beds, withprivate contractors providing an additional 943 beds. TYCend-of-year populations increased from 3,467 in fiscal year1996 to 4,561 in fiscal year 1997, an increase of 32 percentin one year. Research by the Criminal Justice Policy Council(CJPC) showed increased populations were caused by a risein new commitments to TYC. In reaction to the increasedpopulations, the state began a series of facility expansions. By September 1998, CJPC projected a population of over6,300 youths in TYC during fiscal year 2004. During fiscal year 2000, TYC residential populations peaked. Since fiscal year 2000, fewer youths were sentencedto the juvenile justice system and there was a decrease inyouth crime. During the Seventy-fifth Legislative Session,1997, many modifications were made to the juvenile justicesystem, including the construction of local juvenileresidential centers and increased community programservices. In addition, tougher punishment guidelines wereestablished. The two factors that contribute the most to the overall TYC population are the number of intakes and lengths-of-stay in residential facilities. The total number ofintakes includes new commitments, recommitments,parole revocations, and youths returned to residentialprograms by TYC. Length-of-stay is the amount of time ayouth is required to participate in TYC residentialprograms. Before fiscal year 2000, intakes were increasing,and the length-of-stay decreased. After fiscal year 2000,there was a decrease in intakes and an increase in thelength-of-stay. In fiscal year 2000 the average length-of-stay was 14.8 months, and in fiscal year 2004 the averagelength-of-stay was 17.4 months.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 304RESIDENTIAL CONTRACT CARE AT THE TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION FACILITY EXPANSIONS Since 1995, six facilities have been added to the TYC system to accommodate population increases. This was accom-plished in three ways: ne w construction, donations from the public, and the transfer of facilities from other state agencies.In 1995, the Al Price State Juvenile Correctional Facility wasunder construction, and the Sheffield Boot Camp was givento TYC by the Iraan School District. In 1995 and 1996, theMarlin Orientation and Assessment Unit and the San SabaState School were transferred from the Department ofCriminal Justice (TDCJ). In 1997, the J.W . Hamilton StateSchool was transferred from TDCJ, and the Victory FieldCorrectional Academy was transferred from the Departmentof Mental Health and Mental Retardation (now part of theDepartment of State Health Services). Because of popula-tion increases in TDCJ, the Hamilton facility was returned tothat agency in 2003. In 1998, an expansion of TYC'sSheffield Boot Camp was initiated. Finally in 2000, theMcLennan County State Juvenile Correctional Facility wasunder construction. Figure 2 details all TYC facilitiesincluding the 1995 facility expansions, when the facilitiesopened, and current bed capacity.Facility expansion is a lengthy process (usually four to six years) requiring bond approval, construction, and opera-tional planning. By the end of fiscal year 2005, all of thefacility expansions should be operational. At the beginningof fiscal year 2006, TYC residential bed capacity (institu-tional and halfway houses) will be 4,576. The 1995 bedexpansions totaled over $95 million and added 2,240 bedsto TYC institutional bed capacity. The constructioncompleted during the last 10 years has increased TYC'sinternal capacity to safely house youths, and if fullyutilized, these expansions can limit the state's operationalcosts by reducing the need for contract-care beds. CONTRACT-CARE FACILITIES At the Marlin Orientation and Assessment Unit (MOAU), all youths are assessed for medical, educational, and specializedtreatment needs. Diagnostic tests are performed and riskassessments are completed to determine which youths are atthe greatest risk of recidivism and those who requireparticipation in special programs. After assessment, theCentralized Placement Unit (CPU) reviews each youthaccording to classification, treatment needs, risk levels,gender, age, and special needs. CPU then reviews the priorityratings f or the y ouths and places them in the program thatFIGURE 1 TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION RESIDENTIAL POPULATION, CAPACITY, AND INTAKES SOURCE : Texas greatly exceeded capacity in fiscal years 1994-2001Population decreased after fiscal year 2000 because of decreased intakesSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 305RESIDENTIAL CONTRACT CARE AT THE TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION they are required to complete (institutional or contract care). The average length-of-stay in a contract-care facility is sixmonths. In fiscal year 2004, the average daily population ofcontract care was 608 youths, which is 12.5 percent of TYC'sresidential average daily population of 4,883. Human Resources Code, Section 61.052, establishes a program for monitoring contracts for residential servicesat TYC. Contract-care facilities are a subcategory of TYCresidential bed capacity that provide community-basedprograms in conjunction with governmental entities, suchas counties, or private businesses. Currently, TYC hascontracts with 23 separate entities comprising 14 facilities,7 foster care homes, and 2 independent living programs.Figure 3 shows TYC's contract-care program locations,their security status, and the average daily populations ofeach facility as budgeted for fiscal year 2005. Contract-care facilities provide services to youths with specializedneeds, divert low-risk youth from TYC institutions, andmaintain additional bed capacity when populationsincrease unexpectedly. Contract-care facilities have dif ferent contract requirements depending on the services provided. Several contractprograms are county-owned, and most of their youthresidential population comes from TYC. Some examples of the specialized programs include the mother-baby program, pregnant girls, low-risk offenders, and youths withouthomes. Contract-care beds pro vide levels of security andspecialized treatment services specific to the target population that TYC indicates it cannot provide in its ownfacilities. REDUCTION OF CONTRACT-CARE EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL YEARS2006 AND 2007 TYC facility expansions over the past 10 years were in response to increasing populations and limited internal bedcapacity. The goal of the facility expansions was to increaseinternal capacity. Contract-care funding in fiscal years 2004and 2005 is more than projected population demands infiscal years 2006 and 2007. To address state budgetconstraints and youth r esidential population decreases, Recommendation 1 would reduce contract-care funding forfiscal years 2006 and 2007 while still providing somespecialized program beds. With facility expansions completed in fiscal year 2005, TYC's state-operated bed capacity (institutional and halfwayhouses) will be 4,576. Legislati ve Budget Board population projections from June 2004 indicate a need for an averageof 4,808 beds during fiscal year 2006 and 4,876 beds infiscal year 2007. Comparing the population projections toTYC's bed capacity, an average of 232 beds in fiscal year2006 and 300 beds in fiscal year 2007 are needed incontract care to house the projected youth population thatexceeds state-operated bed capacity.FIGURE 2 TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION SECURE FACILITIES BY OPENING DATE Corsicana Residential Treatment Center 1887 198 Gainesville State School 1916 340Crockett State School 1951 264 West Texas State School (Pyote) 1967 240 Ron Jackson State Juvenile Correctional Complex Unit I 1969 348 (formerly Brownwood State School Unit I) Ron Jackson State Juvenile Correctional Complex Unit II 1969 112 (formerly Brownwood State School Unit II) Giddings State School 1972 376Evins Regional Juvenile Facility (Edinburg) 1990 240 Al Price State Juvenile Correctional Facility (Beaumont - new construction) 1995 312 Marlin Orientation and Assessment Unit 1995 436Sheffield Boot Camp (transferred from Iraan School District) 1995 128San Saba State School (transferred from TDCJ) 1996 356 Victory Field Correctional Academy (Vernon) 1997 336 McLennan County State Juvenile Correctional Facility (Mart - new construction) 2000 672Total TYC Institutional Capacity 4358FACILITY OPENED BED CAPACITY SOURCE : Texas Youth Commission.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA TURE LEGISLA TIVE BUDGET BO ARD 306RESIDENTIAL CONTRACT CARE AT THE TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION These reductions could result in a decrease of federal foster-care funds because of the loss of eligible foster-care beds in contract care. If TYC made reductions to contract- care beds not funded by foster-care dollars, the current estimate of federal foster-care funding would not change. Reductions in contract-care capacity would limit the types of treatment services that are available to TYC youth. Most of the remaining contract-care beds would be non-secure beds for specialized programs like the mother-baby program and transitional movement back into the commu- nity. Some of the services presently provided by contract care could be provided in TYC institutions. The variety of treatment services overall would be limited, but TYC would continue to have some specialized treatment facilities for youth requiring them.UTILIZATION OF TYC'S INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY To implement Recommendation 2 and ensure the maxi- mum utilization of available state residential capacity, the following rider should be included in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill: Utilization of Existing Youth Commission Facilities. It is the intent of the Legislature for the Youth Commission (TYC) to utilize existing TYC facilities to the maximum extent possible without overcrowding. Appropriations included above in Strategy A.1.3, Contracted Capacity, can be used for the purpose of contracting for additional capacity if the agency's residential population is over 100 percent capacity and agreements can be reached that are beneficial to the State.FIGURE 3 TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION FACILITIES BUDGETED FISC AL YEAR 2005 NOTE: ADP = Average Daily Population.

The Texas Youth Commission states that the contract cost per youth per day will increase during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 because the most severe cases will continue to receive contract-care treatment. Because of this, the estimate forthe cost per youth per day f or contract care is estimated to be $98.48 in General Revenue Funds in fiscal years 2006and 2007. Applying this cost per day to the contract-carebed capacity and the days in the year yields an estimate of$8.3 million in General Revenue Funds for an average of232 beds in fiscal year 2006 and $10.8 million in GeneralRevenue Funds for an average of 300 beds in fiscal year2007. Assuming that TYC will still be able to utilize $1.7million in Federal Funds for contracted capacity each fiscal year, total funding in the contract-care strategy would equal$10.0 million for fiscal year 2006 and $12.5 million forfiscal year 2007. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill reduces the Texas Youth Commission appropriations forcontract care by $24.2 million from the 2004-05 appropri-ated amounts, and includes a rider requiring the agency tofully utilize its institutional capacity before contract-carebeds are utilized.FIGURE 4 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT 2006 $13,535,887 2007 SOURCE Board.FISCAL YEARPROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 308RESIDENTIAL CONTRACT CARE AT THE TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSIONSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 309FACILITY REPAIR AND REHABILITATION COSTS AT THE TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION This report provides information on facility repair and rehabilitation costs at the Texas Youth Commission.Facility expansions to address population increases arereviewed. The current sta tus of facility repair and rehabili- tation and Texas Youth Commission estimates for futurefacility repair and rehabilitation are outlined. The TexasYouth Commission future estimates are compared to astandard method of estimating maintenance and repaircosts. Finally, the use of facilities management software forcost-effective facility re pair and rehabilitation decisions is discussed. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bTexas Youth Commission facility expansions haveprovided 2,696 new institutional beds to addressincreased youth residential populations since 1995. \u008bFacilities repair and reha bilitation appropriations have ranged from $45.7 million in All Funds duringfiscal years 1994-99 to $13.3 million during fiscalyears 2000-05. Over the same time period, theagency's residential bed capacity has increased from1,880 to 4,576, a 143 percent increase. \u008bNow that new facility construction is complete, theTexas Youth Commission plans to request $30million in All Funds over the next six years forfacilities repair and rehabilitation. The agency states that repair and rehabilitation needs have beendeferred during facility expansions and new con-struction. \u008bFacilities management software could help theTexas Youth Commission make cost-effectivefacility repair and rehabilitation decisions. Untilcondition assessments are completed for the TexasYouth Commission facilities, the cost effectivenessof facility repair and rehabilitation cannot bedetermined. COMMENTS Human Resources Code, Section 61.075, authorizes theTexas Youth Commission (TYC) to order a youth'sconfinement under conditions designed for the youth'swelfare and the interests of the public. To comply with this statutory requirement, the ag ency currently uses 14 institutional facilities, 9 halfway houses, and 23 contractcare facilities to house the youth residential populations.These residential programs provide direct supervision, housing, food, clothing, healthcar e, security, education, and correctional treatment for the youths. YOUTH RESIDENTIAL POPULATION INCREASES AND FACILITY EXPANSIONS SINCE 1994 The agency's activities and functions are directly affected by populations in the juvenile justice system. In fiscal year 1994, the juvenile justice system started to experience largepopulation increases. Figure 1 shows total TYC end-of-yearresidential populations from fiscal years 1994 to 2004. In1995, TYC's internal capacity was 1,880 beds, with privatecontractors providing an additional 943 beds. TYC end-of- year populations increased from 3,467 in fiscal year 1996 to4,561 in fiscal year 1997, an increase of 32 percent in oneyear. Research by the Criminal Justice Policy Council(CJPC) showed increased populations were caused by a risein new commitments to TYC. To address the projectedpopulation increases, TYC began to expand its residential capacity. In September 1998, CJPC projected that over6,300 youths would be confined in TYC residential facilities by fiscal year 2004. Since 1995, six facilities have been added to the TYC system to accommodate population increases. This wasaccomplished in three ways: new construction, donationsfrom the public, and the transfer of facilities from otherstate agencies. In 1995, the Al Price State Juvenile Correc- tional Facility was constructed, and the Sheffield BootCamp was given to TYC by the Iraan School District. In1995 and 1996, the Marlin Orientation and AssessmentUnit and the San Saba State School were transferred fromthe Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ). In 1997,the J.W . Hamilton State School w as transferred from TDCJ, and the Victory Field Correctional Academy was trans-ferred from the Department of Mental Health and MentalRetardation (now part of the Department of State HealthServices). Because of population increases in TDCJ, theHamilton facility was returned to that agency in 2003. In 1998, an expansion of the TYC Sheffield Boot Camp wasinitiated. Finally in 2000, the McLennan County StateJuvenile Correctional Facility was under construction.Figure 2 details all TYC facilities including the 1995 facilityexpansions, when the facilities opened, and current bedcapacity.

At the beginning of fiscal year 2006,TYC residential bed capacity (institutional and halfwayhouses) will be 4,576. The bed expansions since 1995 costover $95 million and added 2,696 beds to TYC's institu tional bed capacity. The construction completed during the last10 years has added internal capacity to house youths safelyand limited the need for contract-care beds. TYC residen-tial population projections from fiscal years 2006 through2009 show modest population increases, and no additionalfacility expansions are planned at this time. TYC FACILITY REPAIR AND REHABILITATION In addition to the construction of new facilities, TYC's other major facilities' capital expenditur es are for repair and rehabilitation of existing f acilities. Human Resources Code, Section 61.048 gives TYC the authority to design, con-struct, equip, furnish, and maintain building and improve-ments at facilities under their jurisdiction. Repairs andrehabilitations are general repairs, replacements, improve-ments, and upgrades to existing buildings to maintaincurrent building codes, standards, and operational levels.All 14 of TYC's facilities are used 24 hours a day, 7 days aweek, 365 days per year. Seven of the 14 TYC facilitieshave buildings that are over 25 years old. Because of theconstant use of buildings on each campus, repair andrehabilitation of existing facilities are important parts ofTYC's budget.The repair and rehabilitation of existing facilities can be divided into three categories: (1) utility, road, and site work,(2) roof replacements, and (3) rehabilitation of buildingsand systems. Utility, road, and site work includes items suchas natural gas, sewer, and water distribution systems,electrical work, drainage systems, and repairs to roads,parking lots, and sidewalks. Roof replacements includework to roofs, air vents , and gutters. Rehabilitation of buildings and systems includes structural and safetyrenovations, fire alarms, and security systems. TYC received $55.0 million in All Funds for facility expansions from fiscal year 1994 to 1999. During that time, the agency requested $47.9 million for facility repair andrehabilitation costs and received $45.7 million. During the2000-01 biennium, the agency received an additional $40.0million for new construction and requested $9.1 million forrepair and rehabilitation costs. Th ey received all the requested funds for the new construction and wereappropriated $4.8 million for repair and rehabilitation.During the 2002-03 asked for $12.8million costs, and was appro- priated $8.5 million. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, theagency requested $11.7 million for repair and rehabilitationand received no new appropriations for repair and rehabili-tation costs. The appropriated amounts listed above do notinclude unexpended balances from prior biennia.

Increases in youthresidential populations and budget constraints have focusedpast efforts on the construction of new facilities andplaced less emphasis on building repair and rehabilitation.TYC develops its facilities construction and repair andrehabilitation needs under a six-year capital improvementplan. Funding for repair and rehabilitation for the last six-year capital improvement plan (fiscal years 2000-2005)totaled $13.3 million. Funding requests for the next six-yearcapital improvement plan (fiscal years 2006-2011) are estimated at $30 million. TY C's fiscal year 2006-07 legislative appropriations request includes $9.9 million forthe repair and rehabilitation of various facilities. Thisrequest includes $2.5 million in utility, road and site work,$2.8 million in roof repairs and replacements, and $4.6million for rehabilitation of buildings and systems. COMPARISON OF MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR COSTS As a comparison, TYC's facilities repair and rehabilitation requests are compared to the Federal Bureau of Prisons'facility repair and rehabilitation methodology and the TexasDepartment of Criminal Justice's facilities repair andrehabilitation costs. Though the missions of the FederalBureau of Prisons and the Texas Department of CriminalJustice are different from TYC, these adult correctionalagencies also maintain an inventory of secure facilities. The Federal Bureau of Prisons requests an annual appro- priation for maintenance and repairs based on the replace-ment value of its facilities. In 1990, the Federal BuildingResearch Board's Committee on Advanced MaintenanceConcepts for Buildings prepared a report on ownership- maintenance and repairs of public buildings. This reportrecommended 2 percent to 4 percent of the aggregatecurrent replacement value of those facilities (excludingland and major associated infrastructure) as appropriatebudget allocations for routine maintenance. The report alsostated that in the absence of specific information on which to base the maintenance and repair budget, this fundinglevel should be used as an absolute minimum. Whereneglect of maintenance has caused a backlog of neededrepairs to accumulate, spending must exceed this minimumlevel until the backlog has been eliminated. TYC estimates the aggregate current replacement value of its residential buildings and facilities at $370 million. Usingthe Federal Bureau of Prisons' method of estimatingmaintenance and repair costs, TYC's annual maintenanceand repair costs would be between $7 million and $15million. TYC's six-year capital improvement plan totals $30million, an average of $5 million per year. Overall, TYC's capital budget plan falls below the bureau's recommendedmethod for estimating maintenance and repair costs. Parallels exist between the Texas Depar tment of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) and TYC with respect to spending onmaintenance and repair of facilities. First, TDCJ and TYCboth have facilities that are more than 25 years old. Bothagencies have also completed a period in which theyexpanded their facilities and are now requesting increasedfunding for maintenance and repairs. TDCJ has valued itsfacilities at more than $4 billion and has over 50 millionsquare feet in more than 3,200 buildings that vary in age andlife span. Rang ing from brick and mortar facilities to metal buildings, the anticipated life span of TDCJ facilities rangesfrom 20 to 50 years, depending on the type of unit, qualityof construction, intensity of use, climate, and other factors.For the 2004-05 biennium, TDCJ has expended or budgeted$72 million on major repairs to prison units. Spending forthe 2004-05 biennium is higher than spending for majorrepairs to prison units in any previous biennium. Using theFederal Bureau of Prison's methodology and the relativevalues of each agency's facilities, TDCJ's ratio of mainte-nance and repair costs to facility replacement value is at 0.9percent for the 2004-05 biennium. TYC's requested fundingfor the 2006-07 biennium yields a ratio of 1.35 percent.Both agencies are under the Federal Bureau of Prison'srecommendation of 2 percent to 4 percent of the facility replacement value for repair and rehabilitation costs. FACILITY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE Some public agencies such as TDCJ and the Texas Depart- ment of State Health Services ha ve recently started to use facilities planning and management software to managefacilities repair and rehabilitation. The software contains arelational database in which all baseline facilities informa- tion is entered: mechanical, str uctural, electrical, safety code compliance, Americans with Disability Act compli-ance, architectural finishes, site improvements, and relevant infrastructures. This information is used to create quantita-tive benchmarks that allow cost-effective decisions onmaintenance and repair investments. To define targets and crea te benchmarks, a Facility Condi- tion Index (FCI) is used. The FCI is a standard measure ofthe relative condition of a building. The FCI is recom-mended by both the National Association of CollegeBusiness Officers and the Association of University Facility Officers. It is calculated by assessing the total value offacility deficiencies divided by the current replacementvalue of the building. For example, if a building with a replacement value of $1 million has $100,000 of existingdeficiencies, the FCI is $100,000/$1,000,000 or 0.10. Thehigher the cost of fixing the deficiencies of the facility, theSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 313FACILITY REPAIR AND REHABILITATION COSTS AT THE TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSION higher the FCI value. Analysis of the benchmarks allows users to run \"what-if \" scenarios regarding the condition offacilities and the amount of money spent on maintenanceand repairs. TYC should use facility management softwareto determine the amount of funds necessary for existingfacility repairs for the next 10 to 15 years, to calculatewhether facilities are becoming cost prohibitive to operateand repair, and to prevent the temporary closing of unitsdue to structural failings. TYC's facilities have been valued at more than $370 million, and the amount of money spent on maintenanceand repairs has been relatively small. The buildings andinfrastructure that support TYC's daily activities are agingand face growing repair costs. Now that the constructionof facilities has slowed, TYC is in a position to spendmore time and effort on repairing and maintaining itsexisting facilities. Condition assessments have not been completed on TYC's 14 facilities. Little is known about the condition of all ofTYC's facilities. Until TYC completes condition assess-ments on all its facilities and integrates the assessmentinformation into a facility management software system,many questions regarding the repair or replacement ofaging youth facilities will remain unanswered.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 314FACILITY REPAIR AND REHABILITATION COSTS AT THE TEXAS YOUTH COMMISSIONSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 315AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AT THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE Prisons in Texas have existed for 150 years and agricultural operations have been a major part of the Texas prisonsystem since its establishment. Prior to 1991, the TexasDepartment of Criminal Justice operated under a legislativemandate to be as self-sustaining as possible; this mandatewas fulfilled largely by agricultural and livestock operations.However, as Texas' prison population grew, it becameapparent that purchasing certain products outside thesystem would be more cost-effective than producing themin-house. Furthermore, as policies regarding the treatment and rehabilitation of prisoners have changed, inmates nowspend more time in school and vocational training and lesstime working in the fields. Does this mean that the agencyis moving more toward purchasing products from outside producers thus de-emphasizing agricultural and livestockactivities? Are there products that the agency is able toproduce at a cost savings to Texas taxpayers? Additionally,are there less tangible benef its from agricultural and livestock operations that should be considered in decidingthe future of the agency's agricultural and livestockoperations? In order to answer these questions, thefollowing areas are examined: the agency's current agricul-tural and livestoc k production, reasons for and against the agency's involv ement in agricultural and livestock produc- tion, and an analysis of other states that have eliminatedagricultural operations. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice operatesand manages 145,337 acres located in 46 counties.The agency's Agribusiness Division employs over316 full-time employees and utilizes over 5,800offenders on 50 different prison units. The fiscalyear 2004 expenditures for the AgribusinessDivision were nearly $41 million in General RevenueFunds. \u008bThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice producesabout 20 percent of the food that is consumed atagency facilities. \u008bThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice providesproduce and human resources to maintain Texasfood bank operations. The agency is paid a fee ofapproximately $100 per acre for its land, labor, andexpertise to grow edible crops for 19 food banksacross Texas.\u008bDuring the last 37 years, approximately 4,000veterinarians have graduated from Texas A&M, allwith hands-on, clinical experience related to theTexas Department of Criminal Justice's livestockoperations. \u008bThe Internal Audit Division of the Texas Depart-ment of Criminal Justice reported that cost-avoidance estimates reported in past cost analysissummary books might be inaccurate. \u008bFood industry giant Aramark has entered a year-longcontract with the Texas Department of CriminalJustice to provide meals at a single prison unit for adaily cost of $2.43 per prisoner. The average dailycost per meal for the agency was $2.60 for fiscal year2003. \u008bIn fiscal year 2003, inma tes performed over five million hours of labor in agricultural jobs. \u008bThe states of Florida and Kentucky drasticallyreduced prison farmland operations but laterresumed operations. COMMENTS The use of Texas prisoners for agricultural operations inorder to make the prison system more self-sustaining dates back to 1854 when there were enough inmates to justify theconstruction of a cotton mill. Products from the mill weresold to the public, and eventually they were used to aid theConfederacy during the Civil War. In December 1865 theThirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitutionabolished slavery throughout the nation, which created anew demand for inexpensive farm labor. Two monthsfollowing ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, theTexas Legislature enacted le gislation that established the Board of Public Labor and directed its members to securecontracts with private interests for the use of inmate labor.The result was a cheap source of labor for plantation owners. Texas prison inmates worked the large plantationsof East Texas, raising cotton and corn, and tendinglivestock. The prison system, in another move to increasethe prison's ability to be self-sustaining, purchased its firstfarm in 1885; and the number gradually grew to six prisonfarms by 1913.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 316AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AT THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE Currently, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) operates and manages 145,337 acres located in 46 counties in Texas. The TDCJ Agribusiness Divisionemploys over 316 full-time employees and utilizes over5,800 offenders in 50 different prison units. CURRENT TDCJ AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS The agricultural operations of TDCJ include nine varieties of field crops and 36 varieties of edible crops (see Figure 1). For fiscal year 2003, nearly 23 million pounds of ediblecrops were produced and 78.3 million pounds of fieldcrops were produced with field corn and hay grass account-ing for nearly 75 percent of all field crop tonnage. Fieldcrops are grown for feeding TDCJ livestock and anysurplus field crops are sold to generate revenue. TDCJ operates a number of processing plants that preserve raw foodstuffs. These plants include a beefprocessing plant (Potter County), a vegetable canning plant(Brazoria County), two feed mills (Anderson and HoustonCounties), an alfalfa dehydrator (Brazoria County), and two cotton gins (Walker and Brazoria Counties) to producecotton fiber. Cotton grown by TDCJ is used in its textilefactories. Agriculture provides all of the horses and dogsused for securing prison units. The TDCJ AgribusinessDivision also raises swine and cattle. Swine are shipped tothe Michael Meat Packing Plant (Anderson County), where the animals are processed into pork products for prisonconsumption. While TDCJ Agribusiness maintains a largecattle operation, none of the beef is fed to inmates. All beef cattle are sold on the open market and TDCJ pur-chases low-cost beef trim, which it processes into ground beef for consumption. Crop production and livestockproduction are listed for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 in Figure 2. TDCJ also has established a partnership with the Texas Association of Second Harvest Food Banks (TASHFB), anaffiliate of Second Harvest, the largest charitable hungerrelief organization in the United States. TDCJ provides aconsistent source of quality produce and labor to maintainfood bank operations. Of the vegetables sent to food banks from TDCJ, 80 percent are from prison farm operations,and the rest is from prison unit gardens. TDCJ is paid a feeof approximately $100 per acre for its land, labor, andexpertise to grow edible crops for the 19 food banks acrossTexas associated with TASHFB. TDCJ's partnership withTASHFB has allowed offenders in TDCJ and adultprobationers to contribute work to the food banks. REASONS FOR TDCJ'S INVOLVEMENT IN AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS TDCJ's original reason for agricultural and livestock operations was an attempt to achieve self-sufficiency. Until1991, TDCJ operated under a legislative mandate to be asself-sustaining as possible (See former Section 491.002,Government Code, which was derived from V .A.C.S. Art.6166a, and which was repealed in 1991 by Ch. 16, \u00a7 10.01(a), Acts of the 72nd Legislature). In order to achievethat mandate, TDCJ made its o wn peanut butter, roasted its own coffee, and produced its own pancake syrup andcheese. In 1991, TDCJ had a population of 49,000 inmates,which has since grown by 101,000 inmates. In order forTDCJ to remain as self-sustaining today as it was prior to1991, agricultural and livestock operations need to triple.Rather than take part in a massive agricultural expansionproject as well as a massive prison construction project, thelegislature removed the self-sufficiency mandate.Alfalfa Meal Apricots Sweet Corn Okra Irish Potatoes Swine Corn Green Beans Cucumbers Onions Sweet Potatoes Poultry Cotton Beets Eggplant Peaches Pumpkins Cattle Hay-Alfalfa Blackberries Garlic Hay-Grass Broccoli Collard Greens Peas Yellow Squash Hay-Wheat Cabbage Mustard Greens Pecans Zucchini Squash Maize Cantaloupe Spinach Greens Hot Peppers Tomatoes Oats Carrots Lettuce Turnips Wheat Cauliflower Nectarines Plums WatermelonsFIGURE 1 TDCJ AGRIBUSINESS PRODUCTION LIST FIELD CROPS EDIBLE CROPS LIVESTOCK SOURCE : Texas Department of Criminal Justice.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 317AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AT THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE Experience has shown that purchasing certain products from outside producers is more cost-effective thanproducing the products in-house. It is currently estimatedthat TDCJ's Agribusiness Division produces about 20percent of the total food consumed in Texas prisons. Inorder to feed all inmates, TDCJ purchased $89 million infood products for its prison system in fiscal year 2003according to the Comptroller of Public Accounts. Self-sufficiency is no longer an attainable goal for TDCJ;however, there are still a number of viable reasons for maintaining agricultural and livestock operations at TDCJ.TDCJ MAY PRODUCE FOOD CHEAPER THAN PURCHASING FOOD AT MARKET PRICES TDCJ is required by statute (V .T.C.A., Government Code \u00a7 497.112) to review its agriculture operations annually. The review must include a cost-effectiveness analysis ofall agriculture programs and a determination as towhether it would be more economical to purchaseagricultural products than to produce them. TDCJ hasdemonstrated for many years that the market value of theproducts produced by its Agribusiness Division is higherthan the cost to the agency to produce the products.

SOURCE : Texas Department of Criminal Justice.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 318AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AT THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE Agriculture Cost Analysis Summary for calendar years 2002 and 2003 indicated a cost avoidance of $4.5 millionand $19.8 million respectively (see Figure 3). The marketvalues of products are based on weekly prices publishedby the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).Products that are not priced by the USDA are comparedto the prices of wholesale distributors for comparablebulk amounts. However, the TDCJ Internal Audit Division's 2002 Report on the Agribusiness Field Crops Program noted thatAgribusiness did not keep adequate records, lacked formalpolicies and procedures, and did not reconcile the totalexpenditures and revenues reported in the Cost AnalysisSummary Book to expenditures and revenues recorded inthe TDCJ Business and Finance Division's LonestarsAccounting System. As a result, in the opinion of theInternal Audit Division, the reported cost avoidance in pastCost Analysis Summary Books may be inaccurate. In July of 2004, the Internal Audit Division performed a follow-up audit of Agribusiness' recording of expendituresand revenues and found that expenditures and revenuesstill did not reconcile with the Lonestars AccountingSystem. TDCJ's Business and Finance Division is currentlyworking with Agribusiness so that expenditures andrevenues will reconcile with its Lonestars Accounting System. Revised figures for a cost-effectiveness analysis of all agriculture programs are expected in the near future but are not available at the time of this report. TDCJ hasagreed to take remedial action in its cost accounting reportsby December 31, 2004. Staff members of TDCJ havestated that inaccuracies cited in the internal audit are mainly the result of Agribusiness using an accounting system thatis customized for agricultural and livestock operations,which is difficult to use in conjunction with the LonestarsAccounting System. TDCJ INCURS LITTLE DIRECT MONETARY COST FOR EMPLOYING INMATES Inmates must be guarded no matter where they are. Employing inmates in agricultural activities does notrequire TDCJ to incur significant additional security costs. There are also benefits derived from inmates working.Agricultural employment provides inmates with thepotential for skills development, and an improved workethic. Having inmates occupied lessens security tension inthe cellblocks. Offenders are assigned specific tasks andare trained by agency staff members on specific jobassignments. Training varies depending on the assignedjob classification. Also, an offender's successful participa-tion in the program hinges on a cooperative relationshipbetween the TDCJ Agribusiness Division and TDCJsecurity operations. Of the 5,800 inmates that arereported to work in agricultural operations, 2,529 areemployed full time. In Figure 4, statistics are provided toshow agriculture-related hours worked by offenders forfiscal years 2001 through 2003. Inmates in Texas are not paid for their labor, so stating a dollar value for inmate agriculture labor is speculative.However, based on the federal minimum wage rate of$5.15 per hour, TDCJ inmates performed labor in agricul-ture jobs valued at $25.9 million in fiscal year 2003. TDCJ AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS BENEFIT TEXAS FOOD BANKS TDCJ serves as a partner to ten certified food banks and the partnerships have been beneficial to all parties involved.The food banks rely on TDCJ for manpower and crops.TDCJ estimates that in calendar year 2003, 965,502 poundsof vegetables were produced by TDCJ and sold to foodbanks for the cost of seed, fertilizer, and chemicals,resulting in a savings of $157,887 to Texas food banks. Inits review of the TDCJ-food bank partnership, TDCJ'sResearch, Evaluation and Development (RED) Unitindicated that state jail offender s working in the partnership benefit by graduating to diffe rent levels of responsibility and to more highly skilled positions. Offenders start withthe product recovery line, which consists of sorting foodthat is donated to the food bank. Later they can move up to more highly skilled positions such as forklift operator,inventory clerk, and doc k coordinator. Some food banks are reliant on TDCJ manpower for their basic operations.

TDCJ BENEFITS TEXAS A&M STUDY PROGRAMS TDCJ and Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine have had a mutually beneficial relationship in agriculturaland livestock production for 37 years through an inter- agency contract. TDCJ benefit s from having access to the professional expertise of three full-time veterinaryprofessors and approximately 20 faculty members in theDepartment of Large Animal Clinical Sciences. TexasA&M professors are able to provide TDCJ with livestockand production management expertise. The expertiseprovided by Texas A&M enables TDCJ to have a safe,consistent, and reliable food supply. TDCJ is able to helpTexas A&M provide experience for entry-level veterinar-ians. Approximately 4,000 veterinarians have graduatedfrom Texas A&M during the period of the interagencycontract, all with hands-on clinical experience related toTDCJ's livestock operations. TDCJ livestock operations,unlike private livestock operations, allow Texas A&M toconduct research in the areas of antibiotic resistance, bio-safety, preventative veterinary medicine, epidemiology,and reproduction. TDCJ's operations are widely distrib-uted throughout the state which allows Texas A&M tostudy the effects of different environments on livestockproduction, knowledge that ultimately benefits all ofTexas producers. The relationship also enables TexasA&M to procure extra grant money from the USDA. Thearrangement between TDCJ and Texas A&M is the onlyone of its kind in the nation, and it has benefits thatextend beyond the participating institutions. OTHER STATES DRASTICALLY REDUCED PRISON AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS BUT SUBSEQUENTLY DECIDED TO RESTORE THEM The states of Florida and K entucky nearly eliminated their prison agricultural and livestock operations in the 1980s.Both states subsequently reinstated their agricultural andlivestock operations and now seek to expand them. Florida\u2014The Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) parallels TDCJ in many ways. Both correctional systems arelarge. Texas has the second largest prison population inAmerica, and Florida ranks fourth. Both correctionalsystems date back to the Civil War, and both tried toremain self-sufficient through agricultural and livestockoperations. Unlike Texas, the Florida DOC began todiscontinue the use of thousands of acres of prison farmsin the late 1970s and early 1980s. Florida became muchmore involved in job training and producing goods and services needed by government agencies. The new pro-grams required the land that had been used for prisonfarming. However, in the mid 1990s Florida reversed this trend and decided to restore its prison agricultural opera-tions. Two reasons were cited for the return to prisonagriculture. (1) The work results in increased discipline,control, diminished tension, and greater safety in theinstitutions. (2) Increased agricultural production lowers thecost of providing meals to inmates. Kentucky\u2014In 1989, under the direction of Governor Wallace Wilkinson, Kentucky's Department of Corrections(DOC) ended all prison agriculture and livestock opera-tions. Machinery was sold, and the farmland sat idle for two years until 1991, when the new governor, Brereton C.Jones, reinstated the operations. From 1991 until thepresent day, the Kentucky DOC has been in the process ofrebuilding its agriculture and livestock operations. Afterselling off much of its equipment in 1989, the KentuckyDOC is still short on machinery for agriculture, canning,slaughtering, and dairy operations; but it is graduallyacquiring more machinery as well as eliminating less cost-efficient operations. Officials with the Kentucky DOC state that it is difficult to assess how much cost avoidance isachieved through agricultural and livestock operations.Nevertheless, they see great value in occupying the time ofinmates with work. TDCJ AGRIBUSINESS BENEFITS SECURITY OPERATIONS TDCJ breeds, raises, and trains its own security dogs and horses that help provide security to all of TDCJ's prisonunits. It is unlikely that an y private entity could step in and assume operations regarding security dogs and horses on a 24 hour a day 7 day a week basis. Additionally, TDCJ allowsits security dogs to be used by other law enforcemententities in the apprehension of escaped fugitives. Duringfiscal year 2004, TDCJ provided security dogs for trackingassistance on eighty-six (86) occasions to the TexasRangers, the Texas Department of Public Safety, variouscounty sheriff departments, local police departments, andthe United States Border Patrol. REASONS FOR REDUCED TDCJ INVOLVEMENT IN AGRICULTURALAND LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS TDCJ's Agribusiness Division lost $6.5 million through budget cuts in fiscal year 2004, resulting in the shutdownof farming operations at five prison units across the stateand the curtailing of operations at another prison unit.TDCJ was able to compensate for the loss of farming landby leasing the 11,000-acre Buffalo Ranch near the commu-nity of Snook from the Texas General Land Office (GLO).Without the Buffalo Ranch, TDCJ would not have beenable to produce the grain necessary for its livestockoperations. However, according to TDCJ, future budgetSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 320AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AT THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE cuts or even the elimination of agricultural operations could be imposed on TDCJ because of market factors,TDCJ's rehabilitation efforts, and correctional officerstaffing levels. LOSS OF FARM LAND DUE TO EXPLOSIVE SUBURBAN GROWTH The Texas General Land Office (GLO) has been able to purchase land from state agencies, get it rezoned fordevelopment, and then either sell or lease the land todevelopers for much more than the purchase price to theGLO. TDCJ has ten prison units in the sprawling suburbanarea south of Houston (specifically Brazoria and Fort Bendcounties). Fort Bend County is among the fastest growingcounties in the United States, with a 57 percent growth ratefrom 1990 to 2000 according to the 2000 U.S. Census.Brazoria County, which lies further from Houston (seeFigure 5), grew by 26.1 percent from 1990 to 2000. Land inboth Fort Bend County and Brazoria County has becomemuch more valuable for residential areas than it is forprison farmland. In order to maximiz e the state's return on land in the Sugar Land area, starting in September 2003 theGLO announced the sale of 2,000 acres from one of theprisons in the area. As of today, 86 percent of TDCJ'soriginal farmland south of Houston has been sold. The sale of prison farmland south of Houston begs the question whether it would be more cost efficient for TDCJto sell other parcels of prison farmland rather thancontinue agricultural operations. According to the GLO, of all farmland owned by TDCJ, currently the only land ofvalue to developers is the land in Fort Bend and Brazoriacounties. Fort Bend County farmland is especially valuable.However, little prison farmland remains for development inthe area south of Houston. Only 400 acres of prisonfarmland remains near Sugar Land, and it is necessary toserve as a buffer zone between the residents of Sugar Landand TDCJ's four prison units there. One-thousand acres ofprison farmland remain in Brazoria County, but the GLOhas said that it will take at least 10 years for BrazoriaCounty to develop the 1,000 acres of prison farmland thatit recently acquired from the GLO. CHEAPER FOOD SERVICE FROM OUTSIDE PROVIDERS Food-industry giant Aramark has entered a year-long contract with TDCJ to provide meals at a single prison unitfor a daily cost of $2.43 per prisoner. The average dailyfood cost per prisoner for TDCJ in fiscal year 2003 was$2.60. It is important to note that TDCJ's fiscal year 2003daily cost of $2.60 includes about five cents in fixed coststhat would be paid by TDCJ regardless of who providesthe meals. It is also important to note that TDCJ's averagedaily cost per meal in fiscal year 2003 was higher than whatthe cost will likely be for f iscal year 2004 because reduced amounts of food were served to inmates in 2004 and theinmate population was larger that year. At the time thisreport was produced, the average daily cost per meal wasnot available for 2004; however, in 2004 TDCJ imple-mented a new meal plan that eliminated desserts forinmates and reduced the amount of food served in meals.Also, the average inmate population for TDCJ in fiscal year2004 was almost 1,400 higher than in fiscal year 2003. Incalculating an average daily cost for food service, a smalleramount of food served in a year divided by a higherpopulation will result in a decreased daily cost per prisoner. The year-long contract is a trial arrangement between Aramark and TDCJ. Aramark currently provides food services for inmates in Kansas, New Mexico, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Florida. In 2001, the state of Floridaprivatized its food service operations, and since that time Aramark has provided food to 120 Florida correctionallocations. The average daily cost of meals provided toFlorida inmates by Aramark was $2.55 in 2002-2003. Alarge private food provider can offer cost advantages when providing meals because it is able to purchase food in largequantities at very low prices. Aramark reports that itpurchases $6 billion of food a year and is able to pay lessper hamburger bun than McDonalds. As mentioned earlier,Florida also has prison agriculture and livestock operations.Florida also has inmates who work in food preparation.Aramark and the Florida DOC have arranged a five-yearcontract in which Florida inmates are able to lower foodcost both by producing food and by preparing food atfacilities. Cost-effectiveness is a major factor to be considered when deciding to outsource food ser vice, but security should also be considered. The food preparation and serving areas ofprisons are potential locations for prison violence becausefor most inmates, mealtime is the highlight of their day.Poor food and poor delivery of food can result in inmateunrest and an unstable prison f acility. For example, in Kansas, Aramark had to replace a private food providerthat had problems in delivering food to prison inmates. AGRICULTURAL SKILLS OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE IN PROVIDING JOB SKILLS TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AFTER RELEASE The state of Texas has become increasingly urban and less rural since the early 1900s. According to the U.S. Census,the Texas population became primarily urban between 1940and 1950, and 83 percent of Te xans lived in urban areas as of the year 2000. The TDCJ inmate population is evenmore urban than the Texas population. Fiscal year 2002data indicates that 91 percent of inmates released to paroleSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 321AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AT THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE FIGURE 5 LOCATION OF TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE UNITS WITH SIGNIFICANT AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS SOURCE : Texas Department of Criminal Justice. STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 322AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AT THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE supervision were from urban counties, with nearly one in four parole releases to Harris County and nearly one in sixto Dallas County. Training in agricultural operations is ofquestionable value in providing inmates with work skills touse when released. Nevertheless , the percentage of inmates working in full-time agricultural operations is similar to thepercentage of people with the same occupation in thestatewide workforce. On a regular basis 2,529 (1.7 percent)of TDCJ's offenders ar e directly assigned to agricultural operations. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 2.7 percentof Texas' employed civilian population 16 years of age andolder works in the agriculture-related industry. Little dataexists on the post-prison success of offenders employed inTDCJ agricultural operations. CORRECTIONAL OFFICER STAFFING VACANCIES MAKE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS UNRELIABLE For the purpose of this report, correctional officer vacancies are defined as the number of correctional officerpositions filled compared to the number of positionsneeded for ideal security levels as determined by TDCJ. Inevery month since June of 2000, TDCJ has had more than2,000 vacant correctional officer positions. TDCJ hasmaintained necessary security levels, even when the numberof correctional officer vacancies peaked at 3,407 inOctober of 2001. The shortage of correctional officers canhave a negative impact on agricultural production. Whenunits are understaffed, the offenders cannot work in thefields because field officers are used to cover officershortages in the prison buildings. This substitution hascaused vegetables not to be harvested at optimal times,negatively impacting production. To try to compensate,TDCJ's agribusiness and security operations are dealingwith correctional officer vacancies by utilizing trustysquads, employees, and increased mechanical harvesting.Despite these provisions, a future downturn in correctionalofficer staffing levels would likely result in difficulties infuture harvests. DIFFERENT EMPHASIS ON TIME SERVED FOR TDCJ INMATES As recently as the 1970s, inmates at TDCJ spent the first six months of their prison term working in the fields aspart of a line force. Once the inmates completed their sixmonths in the fields, they were then able to take classes,receive training, and undergo treatment. Today, the progression by inmates is much different. An inmate firstspends from four to six weeks in a diagnostic facility before being transferred to a unit. Once in a unit, the inmate mustwait several weeks before unit classification assigns theinmate to a particular task. In addition, inmates have toundergo counseling prior to release, which also removesthem from participation in agricultural activities. Under thepresent system, inmates no longer work in the field to earn the right to receive training or treatment. They are nowimmediately eligible to take classes , receive training, or undergo treatment. As a r esult, TDCJ agriculture opera- tions do not have the large, steady pool of workers it oncehad. Workers with short sentences are often eligible forrelease by the time they are trained and capable of contrib-uting to agricultural operations. SUMMARY When Texas added 100,000 prison beds in the 1990s, a corresponding increase was not made in agriculturaloperations, making TDCJ's past legislative self-suffi-ciency mandate much more out of reach. TDCJ nowgrows only about 20 percent of its own food, whichnecessitates the purchase of approximately $89 millionof food per year to meet the system's needs. Conse-quently, TDCJ to a large extent has already outsourced alarge part of its food production to outside providers.The question now is whether it is cost-effective tocontinue TDCJ agribusiness functions. The reasons against continued agricultural operations include: land may be more valuable for purposes other thanfarming, food service may be more cost efficient fromoutside providers, agricultural skills are of questionablevalue to releasees, and correctional officer vacanciescoupled with TDCJ's evolving emphasis on how inmatesserve their time do not meet the needs of traditional prisonagricultural operations. However, it appears that TDCJ has already sold its land with development potential. It alsoappears that TDCJ produces food at long-term economicallevels. Additionally, it appear s that the number of inmates in full-time agricultural operations parallels the percentageof the Texas workforce in agriculture. Also, beneficial relationships exist among TDCJ Agribusiness and Texas food banks and Texas A&MUniversity. Texas food banks and Texas A&M would benegatively impacted by future decreases in TDCJ agricul- tural and livestock operations. TDCJ raises and trains itsown security horses and dogs and it is unlikely that anyprivate entity could assume operations regarding securitydogs and horses. Finally, the states of Florida and Kentuckydecided to eliminate their agricultural operations and arenow in the process of restoring agricultural operations.Reasons stated for restoring agricultural operations forthese states are: the work results in increased discipline andcontrol, diminished tension, and greater safety in theinstitutions; and increased agricultural production lowersthe cost of providing meals to inmates. The experiences ofFlorida and Kentucky also indicate that when a state makes the decision to get out of agriculture, it is a difficultdecision to reverse.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 323IMPACT OF PRISON AND POPULATION DENSITY ON CORRECTIONAL OFFICER VACANCY RATES Starting in February 2002, staffing levels for Texas Depart- ment of Criminal Justice correctional officers have improved. The agency attributes the improvement in correctional officer staffing to its officer recruitment andretention efforts and to an expanded career ladder forcorrectional officers with funds appropriated by the Seventy-sixth (1999) and Seventy-seventh (2001) Legisla- tures. However, a few areas in the state have been slower in showing improvement in correctional officer staffing levels,which is the focus of this review. This review examines the relationship between the Texas Department of Criminal Justice correctional officer jobvacancies and population density within commutingdistance of prison units. First, the relationship between prison and population density and correctional officervacancies is examined for the five-county area surroundingthe cities of Huntsville and Palestine. To examine the area'sstaffing patterns in greater detail, population and correc-tional officer vacancies are e xamined for four of the units that have had continual dif ficulties in correctional officer staffing for the last three years. Next, other areas of Texaswith a large number of prison units are contrasted with the Huntsville/Palestine area to isolate the effect of prison andpopulation density on correctional officer vacancies. For purposes of this report, prison unit staffing percent- ages and references to correctional officer vacancies aredefined as the number of correctional officer positionsfilled compared to the number of positions needed forideal security levels as determined by the Texas Depart-ment of Criminal Justice. The agency reports that all prison units have maintained necessary security levels, even when the number of correctional officer vacancies peaked in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. For an analysis of past correc-tional officer staffing levels at the agency, turnover rates forcorrectional officers, and an examination of what has beendone to improve correctional officer staffing levels, see\"Retention of Experienced Correctional Officers\" in theStaff Performance Report to the 78th Legislature. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe presence of a large population within 25 miles of a prison unit appears to reduce correctionalofficer vacancies. In the context of four units withcorrectional officer staffing problems in the Huntsville/Palestine area, the largest population within a radius of 25 miles is only 75,803. Con-versely, for all of Texas' prison units the averagenumber of persons living within a radius of 25 milesof each unit is 338,675, ov er four times larger than the Huntsville/Palestine area. \u008bThe prison units identified in the five-county area around Huntsville and Palestine hold a combinedprison population of 33,530 inmates, which is largerthan 41 of the nation's individual state prison systems. \u008bAccording to a recent Texas Department of Criminal Justice staffing report, Brazoria County units are able to fill 89 percent to 93 percent of theirauthorized correctional officer positions whileCoryell County units are able to fill 90 percent to 95percent of their authorized positions. In contrast, 8of the 12 Huntsville/Palestine area prison units arestaffed below 90 percent with one unit staffed at 75 percent of authorized correctional officer positions. COMMENTS The number of correctional officer vacancies in Texas' prison units has decreased considerably in the last three years, with the number of vacancies decreasing from a high of 3,407 in October 2001 to a two-year low of 2,072vacancies in March 2004. The number of vacancies peakedwhen many Texas correctional officers in the militaryreserves were called into active duty after the World TradeCenter attack on September 11, 2001. Challenges to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) associated with a shortage of correctional officers include reducedinmate and officer safety, reduced work by inmates causedby staffing-related unit loc kdowns, and budget issues caused by the need to pay overtime wages to correctionalofficers. In its Audit Report on Correctional Officer Staffing at the Department of Criminal Justice, the State Auditor's Office (SAO) reported that in several of theprison units that they visited anecdotal evidence wasprovided that shake-downs and strip searches were notperformed as prescribed by policy because of the shortageof correctional officers. TDCJ has employed a variety ofSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 324IMPACT OF PRISON AND POPULATION DENSITY ON CORRECTIONAL OFFICER VACANCY RATES techniques to improve correctional officer retention and recruitment in an effort to reduce the shortage of correc-tional officers. Knowledge about the causes of the shortage of correc- tional officers is important in order to understand futurestaffing levels of Texas' correctional system. The reasonsbehind the number of vacancies are complex and difficultto quantify. TDCJ officials often cite Texas' strongeconomy and low unemployment ra te as a factor in driving up TDCJ's correctional officer attrition rate as well as cutting into the pool of applicants for correctional officerpositions. In addition, the fact that being a TDCJ correc-tional officer is a dangerous and stressful occupationcontributes to TDCJ's problem in keeping so manycorrectional officer positions filled. Unfortunately, the impact of the economy, the dangers involved in being a correctional officer, as well as professional suitability forthe job are difficult to analyze empirically because of thelack of data related to specific reasons for people leavingTDCJ. The SAO collects agency turnover data, andincluded in the data is the reason for termination from the job. However, analysis of SAO data for TDCJ correctional officers indicates that the \"catch-all\" category of \"PersonalReasons not Related to J ob\" has been the dominant reason for leaving employment since fiscal year 1998, making theanalysis of specific reasons impossible. Although system-wide staffing lev els for TDCJ correctional officers have improved markedly over the last year, severalareas have lagged behind the rest of the state in filling vacant positions, with the Huntsville/Palestine area beingthe most significant and the focus of this report because ofits influence on the entire system. Although the Huntsville/ Palestine area only accounts f or 1 percent of Texas' population, it accounts for 25 percent of Texas' full-timeauthorized correctional officers, and 32 percent of TDCJ'scorrectional officer vacancies (see Figure 1). LOCATION OF PRISON UNITS IN A FIVE-COUNTY AREA OF EAST TEXAS The five-county area of East Texas bounded by Cherokee County to the north and Walker County to the south is thehub of Texas' correctional system. Most of Texas' oldestprison units and TDCJ's headquarters are located in this area. In its Inmate Monthly Report for the period ending July 31, 2004, TDCJ reported that the prison units identi-fied in Figure 2 hold a combined prison population of33,530 inmates. Figures from the Bureau of JusticeStatistics indicate this regional population is larger than 41of the nation's individual state prison populations. Popula- tion growth in the five-county area has lagged behind thestate's population growth in the 1990s. U.S. Census Bureau data shows that Texas grew by 23 percent in the 1990s, but the five counties highlighted in Figure 2 grew by only 16percent from 172,296 in 1990 to 199,651 in 2000. PRISON UNITS WITH LARGEST NUMBER OF UNFILLED CORRECTIONAL OFFICER POSITIONS Many of the units that have had the most vacant correc- tional officer positions are units that are located in the five-county area of East Texas identified in Figure 2. Theseunits share two factors that contribute to the number ofvacancies: (1) the units are located in an area where there is a heavy concentration of prison units; and (2) the units are located in an area wher e there is a relatively low population. The result is a local labor force that has been slower infilling correctional officer vacancies than other areas of thestate that are larger in population and have fewer prisonunits. In Figure 3, data for the 2000 U.S. census is used to determine the number of persons living within a 25-mileradius of four TDCJ units located in the five-county areaof East Texas that have had comparatively large numbersof vacant correctional officer positions for the last severalyears. A radius of 25 miles is used because it approximates a reasonable commuting distance to each of the units. Of the four units shown in Figure 3, the average populationwithin a radius of 25 miles is only 75,803. For all of Texas'prison units, the average number of persons living within aradius of 25 miles of each unit is 338,675. This average isaffected by units in large urban areas, but even as an average it is considerably higher than the number of people living near the units in the five-county area of East Texas. PRISON UNITS IN AREAS WITH A HEAVY CONCENTRATION OF CORRECTIONAL POPULATIONS The Huntsville/Palestine area of Texas is not the only area of Texas with a heavy concentration of prison units.Coryell County (Gatesville) contains six prison units with apopulation of 8,124 inmates, and Brazoria County containsfive prison units with an inmate population of 6,867.However, reports from TDCJ indicate that prison units in Coryell and Brazoria counties have not experienced the staffing vacancies that have been apparent in the Hunts-ville/Palestine area. According to a recent TDCJ staffingreport, Brazoria County units are able to fill 89 percent to93 percent of their authorized positions while CoryellSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 325IMPACT OF PRISON AND POPULATION DENSITY ON CORRECTIONAL OFFICER VACANCY RATES FIGURE 1 CORRECTIONAL OFFICER STAFFING AND VACANCIES, JULY 31, 2004 El Paso|| Lubbock | |Amarillo Fort Stockton | |San Antonio Brownsville| | AustinDallas/Fort Worth Corpus Christi||Houston *Estimated vacant positions before counting part-time correctional officers and unit-based training officers.

In contrast, 8 of the 12 Hunts-ville/Palestine area prison units are staffed below 90percent with one unit staffed at 75 percent of authorizedcorrectional officer positions. Again, a critical difference inthese three areas is the size of the population surrounding the prison units. As demonstrated in Figure 4, the Hughes Unit (Coryell County) has nearly 200,000 people livingwithin a 25-mile radius, and the Darrington Unit (BrazoriaCounty) has over 2 million people residing within a 25-mileradius.STAFFING IMPROVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES The problem of correctional officer vacancies is lessening as a result of various efforts by TDCJ and the legislature.TDCJ's officer recruitment and retention efforts, alongwith an expanded career ladder for correctional officersapproved by the Seventy-sixth (1999) and Seventy-seventh (2001) Legislatures, have been responsible for improved correctional officer staffing. Ho wever, not all areas of the state have shown the same amount of improvement incorrectional officer staffing. The Huntsville/Palestine area,where nearly 1,000 of TDCJ's correctional officer vacanciesoccur, lags behind other areas in the state in correctionalFIGURE 2 LOCATION OF PRISON UNITS IN A FIVE-COUNTY AREA OF EAST TEXAS 1 Ellis Unit 2 Estelle Unit 3 Goree Unit 4 Byrd Unit 5 Wynne Unit 6 Huntsville Unit 7 Holliday Unit 8 Coffield Unit 9 Beto I Unit 10 Powledge Unit 11 Gurney Unit 12 Michael Unit 13 Ferguson Unit 14 Hodge Unit 15 Skyview Unit 16 Eastham Unit14, 1511 9, 12 10 1613 1 2 4 NOTE: Prison unit locations are approximate.

Prison units in the Huntsville area (Walker County units) have improved staffing rates from 78 percentto 90 percent in the last two fiscal years, but for the same time period, staffing rates for the five units in the Palestine area (Anderson County) have only improved from 78percent to 82 percent. The relationship of population to prison units is not anticipated to change significantly in future years. Popula-tion projections for the Huntsville/Palestine area indicate low growth rates when compared to other areas of Texasand the state as a whole. While correctional officer staffing rates for the Huntsville/Palestine area have improved in the last two years, the area still lags behind other parts of thestate in correctional officer staffing. Since the Huntsville/Palestine area is such a dominant segment of TDCJ, itsstaffing rate will have a significant impact on TDCJ's staffing figures as a whole.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 328IMPACT OF PRISON AND POPULATION DENSITY ON CORRECTIONAL OFFICER VACANCY RATES Population within radius: 119,135 Inmates within radius: 18,432Inmates UNIT, Inmates within radius: 8,951Inmates Hughes Unit: vacancies Population WHARTONFORT BEND GALVESTONHOUSTON MADISON WALKER NOTE: Prison unit locations are approximate.

Because some inmates'offenses are violent, not all offenders who are permanently incapacitated may be considered for medically recom-mended intensive supervision. Government Code, Section 508.146 should be amended to allow sex offenders who are permanently incapacitated(physically and/or mentally) to be considered for medi-cally recommended intensive supervision. These offend-ers do not constitute a continuing threat to public safety.Allowing them to be released on medically recommendedintensive supervision would reduce the state's share ofproviding for their medical care. For additional costsavings, the Texas Correctional Office on Offenders withMental and Medical Impairments should considerimproving its referral and screening process to identify agreater number of offenders eligible for medicallyrecommended intensive supervision and to expedite thescreening process. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bAs of August 2004, the Texas Department ofCriminal Justice had 150,714 incarcerated offenders,second only to the state of California. \u008bThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice Correc-tional Managed Health Care reports that the mostseriously ill offenders were hospitalized for anaverage of 107 days in fiscal year 2003. The averagecost for this care was $1,020 per day. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bSex offenders are not eligible for medically recom-mended intensive supervision. In fiscal year 2004,the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Correc-tional Managed Health Care reports that in its mostextreme case it cost $1.5 million to care for a singlesex offender who was permanently incapacitated. \u008bThe medically recommended intensive supervisionreferral process is cumbersome. The University ofTexas Medical Branch at Galveston and the TexasTech University Health Sciences Center use one setof codes to track offenders' medical diagnosis whilethe Texas Department of Criminal Justice uses another to identify medically recommendedintensive supervision candidates. As a result, someeligible cases may not be referred for medicallyrecommended intensive supervision consideration,leaving eligible offenders incarcerated. \u008bThe goal of the Texas Correctional Office onOffenders with Mental and Medical Impairments isto complete the medically recommended intensivesupervision screening process within 30 days of anoffender's referral. A Legislative Budget Board staffanalysis found that the screening process took anaverage of 46 days in fiscal year 2004. \u008bThe Texas Correctional Office on Offenders withMental and Medical Impairments does not requestan offender's board file (which is a compilation ofinmate records used to determine parole eligibility)until after an interview with the offender is com-pleted. This increases the time it takes to screenoffenders for medically recommended intensivesupervision release by 13 days on average. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend Government Code, Section 508.146 to allow sex offenders who arepermanently incapacitated (physically and/ormentally) to be considered for medically recom-mended intensive supervision. The Texas Depart-ment of Criminal Justice should be required to havea physician certify that the offender meets thiseligibility requirement. \u008bRecommendation 2: The Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Mental and MedicalImpairments should develop an automated reportfor identifying offenders eligible for medicallyrecommended intensive supervision. The agencyshould work with the University of Texas MedicalBranch at Galveston and Texas Tech UniversityHealth Science Center to develop uniform diagnosiscodes to identify offenders who may be eligible forrelease for medical reasons. \u008bRecommendation 3: To shorten the time required to recommend offenders for medically recom-mended intensive supervision release, the TexasSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 330INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INMATES ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICALLY RECOMMENDED INTENSIVE SUPERVISION Correctional Office on Offenders with Mental and Medical Impairments should request the offenders'board file at the same time it assigns a caseworker tocomplete an interview of the offender. COMMENTS Between fiscal years 1998 and 2004, the Texas inmate population grew by 5 percent. According to LegislativeBudget Board (LBB) staff projections, Texas' prisonpopulation will be 153,823 by the end of fiscal year 2007and will exceed the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's(TDCJ) current operating capacity. A January 1999 LBB Staff Repor t indicated that offenders are at high risk for poor health. Man y offenders have never had regular checkups or pr oper treatment for medical conditions prior to incarceration. TDCJ CorrectionalManaged Health Care (CMHC) is constitutionally requiredto provide access to healthcare f or all inmates, access to a licensed medical professional, and the right to care asprescribed by a licensed medical professional. Offendersare not eligible for Medicar e or Medicaid while incarcer- ated; and private insurance usuall y does not cover incarcer- ated individuals, which means the state pays the full cost of treatment for all illnesses. Many offenders require restricteddiets and have special medical needs, such as kidneydialysis. All of these factors result in high healthcare costsfor offenders. MEDICALLY RECOMMENDED INTENSIVE SUPERVISION ELIGIBILITY In 1991, the Seventy-second Legislature established the Special Needs Parole program for prisoners who no longerconstituted a threat to public safety due to a medicalcondition. This legislation facilitated their release fromprison, upon approval by the Board of Pardons and Paroles(BPP), to a more cost-effective and appropria te treatment alternative. House Bill 772, Seventy-seventh Legislature,2001, changed the program name to Medically Recom-mended Intensive Supervision (MRIS). The bill also addedthe option for the BPP to require offenders to submit toelectronic monitoring and super-intensive supervision.Then House Bill 1670, enacted during the Seventy-eighthLegislative Session, 2003, ex cluded sex offenders and those offenders serving a sentence of death from MRIS consid-eration. The bill added offenders with aggravated convic-tions who have been diagnosed as terminally ill and/orrequire long-term care to the pool of MRIS candidates.Figure 1 lists the aggravated offenses currently eligible forMRIS consideration. Except as noted above, offenders whoare elderly, physically handicapped, mentally ill, terminallyill, mentally retarded, or who require long-term care arecurrently eligible for MRIS release.As stated previously, statute prohibits sex offenders from MRIS consideration; and as a result, in fiscal year 2004,TDCJ CMHC reports that Texas spent $1.5 million to carefor a single sex offender who was permanently incapaci-tated. Recommendation 1 would include sex offenders whoare permanently incapacitated (ph ysically and/or mentally) to the pool of eligible inmates for MRIS consideration.TDCJ would also be required to have a physician certifythat the offender is debilitated or incapacitated and isseverely restricted in the ability to self-ambulate and care for him/herself. Few sex offenders would meet these requirements. LBB staff project that approxima tely 12 terminally ill sex offenders would be eligible for MRIS considerationannually during fiscal years 2006 to 2010. This projection isbased on the average number of terminally ill sex offenders referred for MRIS consideration prior to the enactment ofHouse Bill 1670. Due to their medical condition, these sexoffenders would no longer pose a threat to public safety. Releasing these offenders from prison would reduce the cost to the University of Texas Medical Branch atGalveston (UTMB) and Texas Tech University HealthScience Center (TTUHSC) for inmate healthcare. Thesehealthcare costs include the following: \u008bHospitalization\u2014TDCJ CMHC reports that themost seriously ill offenders were hospitalized for an average of 107 days in fiscal year 2003. The averagecost for this care was $1,020 per day. \u008bOutpatient Care\u2014TDCJ CMHC projects the fiscalyear 2006 medical care costs for offenders age 55 orolder to be $28.07 per day. Costs are assumed toincrease at about 7 percent per year, reaching $37.48per day in fiscal year 2010. The cost savings in Figure 2 assume that UTMB/TTUHSC would avoid one year of medical treatment costs for theSOURCE : Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Chapters 42 and 62.FIGURE 1 MRIS ELIGIBLE AGGRAVATED OFFENSES The following aggravated offenses are eligible for MRIS consideration if the offender is terminally ill or requires long term care: MurderCapital MurderAggravated kidnapping Aggravated robbery Offenders serving a sentence of death cannot be considered for MRIS release.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 331INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INMATES ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICALLY RECOMMENDED INTENSIVE SUPERVISION sex offenders released on MRIS, and that this cost avoid- ance would include 54 days of hospitalization (half thenumber of hospital days of a seriously ill offender) plus311 days of daily outpatient care per inmate. The savingsestimate also assumes that these offenders would be eligiblefor Medicaid. The projected federal government portion ofnursing home costs for Medicaid beneficiaries is 60.68percent, and the state's portion is 39.32 percent for state fiscal year 2006. For sta te fiscal years 2007 to 2010, the projected federal government portion for nursing homecosts is 60.47 percent, and the state's portion is 39.53percent. As of May 2004, the average daily costs fornursing home care were $75.98. The Blind and DisabledPremium is estimated at $542.07 per month for fiscal years2006 to 2010 and the Prescription Drug cost is estimated at$382.57 per month for fiscal years 2006 to 2010. Figure 2 shows the medical costs avoided by the state by releasing permanently incapacitated sex offenders and thestate's share of nursing home costs resulted in a net costsavings of $1.2 million in General Revenue Funds for the2006-07 biennium. To realize the cost savings sho wn above, the appropriations to TDCJ Correctional Managed Health Care would bereduced by the estimated costs for these offenders'healthcare. The appropriations to the Texas Department ofAging and Disability Services (DADS) would be increasedto pay the state's share of Medicaid. Federal Funds wouldincrease to pay for the federal government's share ofnursing home costs. IMPROVE THE MRIS REFERRAL PROCESS Some ineligible cases may be referred to MRIS for screen- ing, while some eligible cases may not be referred. Offend- ers are referred to the Texas Correctional Office onOffenders with Mental and Medical Impairments(TCOOMMI, formerly the Texas Council on Offenderswith Mental Impairments) for MRIS scr eening from severalsources including prison medical staff, daily hospital census reports, family members, other offenders, or attorneys/ advocates. Figure 3 shows tha t a majority of offenders who are referred do not meet eligibility requirements. To helpTCOOMMI identify eligible cases for MRIS release, TDCJdeveloped an automated report of offenders who havebeen diagnosed with certain medical conditions that couldmeet MRIS criteria. However, this report does not provide enough information to determine if an offender's medical condition meetsMRIS eligibility criteria. For example, the report may list an offender as having AIDS, which is a terminal illness; butthe report does not distinguish between the end stage ofAIDS and the early stage of AIDS. While an offender withend stage AIDS may be bedrid den, an offender with early stage AIDS may still be ambulatory. As a result,TCOOMMI must request an offender's medical summaryto determine whether the offender meets MRIS eligibilitycriteria. A 2002 TDCJ internal audit report also cited shortcomings in TDCJ's automated report. The internal auditors foundthat not all medical codes that might meet MRIS eligibilitycategories were included in TDCJ's automated report.Additionally, different codesfrom TDCJ to track offenders' medical diagnoses. Thismakes it difficult to screen offenders for eligibility usingFIGURE 2 COST SAVINGS TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS (DADS)PROBABLE NET SAVINGS/(COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSPROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO FEDERAL FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board. FIGURE 3 MRIS CASES REFERRED Many offenders referred do not meet MRIS eligibility criteria. For example, in fiscal year 2004, 2,821 offenders were referred toTCOOMMI. Only 16 percent or 453 offenders met eligibility require- ments and were presented to the BPP for parole consideration.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 332INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INMATES ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICALLY RECOMMENDED INTENSIVE SUPERVISION automated reports. As a result, TCOOMMI staff continues to review daily census reports and critical lists to identifyoffenders who might qualify for MRIS release. Thisincreases the risk that some potentially eligible offendersmay never be considered for MRIS release. TDCJ's internal auditors sampled 209 offenders from TDCJ's automated report and f ound that only 22 percent of the potentially eligible candidates listed on TDCJ'sautomated report for MRIS release consideration had beenscreened by TCOOMMI. In f iscal year 2004, 15 percent of offenders approved for MRIS release were referred toTCOOMMI for consideration from parties outside theTCOOMMI process, such as family members and others. Recommendation 2 would require TCOOMMI to develop an improved automated report to assist them in effectively identifying MRIS eligible offenders and to identify diagno-sis codes to signal offenders eligib le for release on MRIS. EXPEDITE THE MRIS SCREENING PROCESS Once an offender is referred, TCOOMMI staff must review the offender's board file to ensure he/she meetseligibility criteria and is not a threat to public safety. Figure4 shows the TCOOMMI screening process. TCOOMMI's goal is to recommend eligible offenders to the BPP within 30 days of receiving a referral. LBB staffanalysis found that for fiscal y ear 2004, the average overall time for screening was 46 days. Moreover, in fiscal year 2004 (through April 20, 2004) 100 offenders died while they were being reviewed for MRIS. LBB staff found that an offender's board file (which is acompilation of inmate records used to determine paroleeligibility) is not requested until after an interview with theoffender is completed. TCOOMMI reports that theprimary reason for this practice has been refusals byoffenders to be considered for MRIS. For this reason,TCOOMMI does not request offenders' board files untilthey have been interviewed and agree to be considered forMRIS. LBB staff analysis found that, on average, thislengthened the amount of time it takes TCOOMMI toscreen offenders for MRIS release by 13 days. Pursuant to Recommendation 3, TCOOMMI should request the offender's board file at the same time as itOffender ReferredMedical Summary Requested and ReceivedCaseworker Assigned and Completes InterviewOffender Board File Requested and ReceivedMRIS Packet Presented to BPPBPP VoteFIGURE 4 TCOOMMI SCREENING PROCESS SOURCE : Texas Department of Criminal Justice. assigns a caseworker to complete an interview of the offender, if possible. This would reduce the MRIS screen-ing time and expedite the MRIS process. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Amending Government Code, Section 508.146 to allow sex offenders who are permanently incapacitated (physi-cally and/or mentally) to be considered for medicallyrecommended intensive supervision would save $1.2 million in General Revenue Funds in the 2006-07 bien-nium. Figure 5 shows the medical costs avoided by the state from releasing permanently incapacitated sexoffenders. The cost savings in Figure 5 assume thatUTMB/TTUHSC would avoid one year of medicaltreatment costs for the sex offenders released on MRIS,and that this cost avoidance would include 54 days ofhospitalization (half the number of hospital days of aseriously ill offender) plus 311 days of daily outpatientcare per inmate. The savings estimate also assumes thatthese offenders would be eligible for Medicaid. Thus, thesavings have been reduced by the state's share of Medicaidcosts. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not reflect any adjustments as a result of theserecommendations.FIGURE 5 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT PROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDSFISCAL YEAR SOURCE : FUNDSSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 333IMPROVE MONITORING OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM During the last half century, the United States has under- gone a shift in both mental health and criminal justicepolicy. The mental health system, once based primarily oninstitutional care, has shifted its emphasis to community-based treatment and support. Many mental health patients,through the aid of effecti ve medications and rehabilitation models, have succeeded in living normal lives in thecommunity. However, many people with mental illness arenot receiving adequate care. In addition to limited re-sources resulting in a shortage of community mentalhealthcare services, many are unable to make and keepappointments at mental health centers. Various other issues,such as the lack of affordable housing for individuals withmental illness, co-occurring substance abuse problems, thestigma associated with mental illness, and the lack of stableemployment contribute to the dif ficulties in providing effective community-based mental healthcare to all thosewho need it. As a result, many people with mental illness end up homeless, cut off from services and likely to \"decompen-sate,\" meaning to deteriorate mentally, and commit crime.To compound the issue, changes in criminal justice policyover the past two decades have increased the frequency,duration, and severity of the involvement of such individu- als with the criminal justice system. Increased lengths ofprison sentences for substance abuse crimes, as well as\"zero tolerance\" and \"three strikes\" laws, have all contrib-uted to the growing nexus between mental illness andcriminal justice nationwide. Consequently, individuals withmental illness are overrepresented in United States prisons.According to the United States Department of Justice, 16percent of the U.S. prison and jail population has a mentalillness, compared with 5 percent of the overall U.S.population. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bMany mentally ill offenders within the TexasDepartment of Criminal Justice are not beingidentified in county jails as mentally ill and as aresult are not receiving appropriate treatment. \u008bOf the estimated 17,000 offenders in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice being treated formental illness, approximately 14,000 receive sometype of psychotropic medication. Medicationnoncompliance as a result of side effects of oldermedications may cause the symptoms of theoffender's mental illness to reappear. When an offender's mental health deteriorates, so does hisability to function in a correctional setting. Behav-ioral issues can lead to disciplinary actions andadministrative segregation. When a mentally illoffender is placed in segregation, he may furtherdecompensate, making it more difficult for him toleave segregation. This compounding effect may mean more time in administrative segregation;greater loss of and inability to accrue good time;and subsequently, a longer time served\u2014all ofwhich are at a greater cost to the state. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Every county jail, during its intake process, should be r equired to check each offender against the Department of State HealthServices CARE system to determine if the offenderhas a history of mental health treatment, to reportthat finding on both the initial intake screening formand the Texas Uniform Health Status Update Form(if sentenced), and to transfer those forms with theoffender if sentenced he or she is to the Depart-ment of Criminal Justice. \u008bRecommendation 2: The mental health screening instrument should be amended and standardized toinclude information on whether the CARE systemwas checked; any relevant mental health informationshould be included with the Uniform Health StatusUpdate Form and transferred with the offender; andthe rules and procedures of the Commission on JailStandards should be amended to require theCommission on Jail Standards to include in itsannual inspection of each jail a determination ofeach jail's compliance with the database check. \u008bRecommendation 3: A rider should be included in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill to requirethat the Department of State Health Servicesrequire local mental healthcare centers performdatabase matches for offenders in county jails. \u008bRecommendation 4: The Department of Criminal Justice should be appropriated $1.1 million each yearof the 2006-07 biennium to conduct a pilotprogram of the Texas Medication AlgorithmProject, including purchasing the prescribedSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 334IMPROVE MONITORING OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM treatment regimens for appr oximately 350 offenders; tracking and making outcome measurements todetermine the efficacy of adopting the TexasMedication Algorithm Project for a correctionalpopulation; and per rider reporting to the legislature;the Legislative Budget Board; and the Governor'sOffice of Budget, Planning and Policy the results ofthe project. COMMENTS The first step in addressing the dilemma presented byincarcerating mentally ill offenders is to identify thoseoffenders as soon as they enter the criminal justicesystem. Early identification is essential for many reasons.Providing an early assessment for mental illness canprovide valuable information about an offender, such aswhether he has suicidal tendencies; whether he is takingpsychotropic medication; and whether he poses a threat tohimself, other offenders, or staff. It can minimize theoccurrence of assaults on other offenders and correc-tional officers and hospitalization. Avoiding thesepotential difficulties can avoid costs in hospitalization andmore intensive mental healthcare, as well as indirect costssuch as lost personnel time and workers' compensationpayments when correctional officers are injured. Addi-tionally, it will aid the justice system in identifying thoseoffenders who may not be competent for trial andprovide valuable information for sentencing decisions will and probation caseload determinations. For offenders entering the criminal justice system, this process should begin in the county jails. To better identifyoffenders with mental illness, each county jail should berequired to screen each offender for mental illness as acomponent of its intake process. Since a majority ofoffenders with mental illness also have a dual diagnosis ofmental illness and substance abuse, staff should screen forboth issues at the initial screening. After the initial screen-ing, offenders should continue to be monitored forsymptoms of mental illness, as the effects of substanceabuse can mask the presence of mental illness. Although an initial mental health screening should be required, it should not be relied upon as the sole means ofidentifying offenders with mental illness. Screening tends torely heavily on self-reports, which because of associatedstigmas and altered mental states, may not provide the mostaccurate or comprehensive pictur e of an offender's mental health. To augment the screening process, staff shouldobtain and review all available healthcare records. Healthand Safety Code, Section 614.017 complies with the federalregulations of the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act (HIPAA) and allows the sharing ofmental health information of special needs offenders among health- and criminal justice-related agencies. In Texas, the offenders' mental healthcare records are maintained in the Texas Department of State HealthServices CARE database (formerly within the Departmentof Mental Health and Mental Retardation). Currentlycorrectional managed healthcare, which provides themental healthcare to offenders within correctional institu-tions in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ),provides mental healthcare to an average of 17,123offenders with mental illness. However, when the TexasCorrectional Office on Offenders with Medical and MentalImpairments (TCOOMMI) matched the records of all theincarcerated offenders against the CARE system, 33,012 offenders were found to be current or former state mentalhealth clients. TCOOMMI also completed another recentstudy in which it reviewed, at random, 100 Texas Uniform Health Status Update Forms submitted by local jails atthree different units within the correctional institutionsdivision in TDCJ. These forms provide information on theoffenders' physical and mental health and are required bythe Commission on Jail Standards to be submitted forevery offender sentenced to TDCJ. Of the 100 recordsreviewed, 15 had a mental health diagnosis noted (10 ofthese records had the same dia gnosis that was found in the CARE system). The records were then checked against theCARE system which revealed tha t of the remaining 85, 29 additional offenders or 34 percent were found on theCARE system as former or current clients of the statemental healthcare system but had no mental healthnotation by the jail or the correctional institutions division.Of the offenders whose r ecords were examined in this study, 44 percent had previously received state mentalhealth services; whereas approximately 11 percent werereceiving treatment for mental illness. The PULHES system of medical classification, used by TDCJ and available for analysis by the Legislative BudgetBoard, classifies offenders on a four-point scale. Those with moderate mental disorders, including depression andschizophrenia are classified as a three and those whorequire continuous psychiatric supervision are classified asa four. Using the PULHES variables of three and four, atthe end of fiscal year 2004, TDCJ had 10,303 mentally illoffenders. However, because correctional healthcareprovided care to over 17,000 offenders, and over 33,000had previously accessed state mental health resources, thePULHES variables appear to underestimate the number ofmentally ill offenders in TDCJ. To maximize early identification efforts and potential cost avoidance, each county jail, during the intake process,should be required to check each offender against theCARE system to determine if the offender has a historySTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 335IMPROVE MONITORING OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM of mental health treatment (R ecommendation 1). The mental health screening instrument should be amended and standardiz ed to include information on w hether the CARE system was checked; any relevant mental healthinformation should be included with the Uniform HealthStatus Update Form and transferred with the offender toTDCJ; the Commission on Jail Standards should includein its annual inspection of each local jail a determinationof the jail's compliance (R ecommendation 2); and local mental health centers should be required, by rider, toperform database matches for local jails (R ecommenda- tion 3). Curr ently, every contract that TCOOMMI has with local mental healthcare centers requires that theagency perform CARE database matches. IDENTIFICATION OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE The identification process, however, does not end with the county jails. During the intake pr ocess, trained staff in TDCJ's correctional institutions division look for observ-able signs of mental health problems; and all offenders,excluding those on death row, are screened using a mentalhealth evaluation questionnaire. Results of the question-naire are evaluated by a supervising psychologist todetermine if further evaluation is needed. Also, medicalpersonnel at the receiving unit review medical information and any medications sent to them by the county jails, andthey observe the offenders to determine if any are in needof immediate referrals. Offenders who are determined tohave psychological issues are referred to an associateclinical psychologist for further evaluation. A referral can also be triggered by either a sociological or medical referralthrough the normal intake process. The TDCJ classificationdivision is notified of those offenders requiring mentalhealth treatment, and the offender's diagnostic assessmentbecomes part of the offender's file to be used by unitclassification staff and the mental health service providersat the offender's receiving unit. When determining an offender's classification, correctional staff should consider an offender's psychiatric condition aswell as his concurrent non-psychiatric medical conditions.There are costs and benefits to both housing mentally illoffenders at specialized units and housing them in thegeneral population. Housing mentally ill offenders who can safely be included in the general population, so-called\"mainstreaming,\" can aid in reducing the stigma of mentalillness and provide corrections officials with greateradministrative flexibility; but administrators should provide separate residential services for those with severe mentalillness and a continuum of outpatient services for thosewho are housed in the general population. Mentally illoffenders within the general population, especially if theirillness is undiagnosed or untreated, can decompensate more quickly than mentally ill offenders housed separately.When mentally ill offenders within the general populationdo decompensate, they are more likely to incur disciplinaryinfractions that lead to administrative segregation andsubsequently, they decompensate even further and morequickly. Because of this potential and the changing needsof offenders with mental illness, staff should routinelyreevaluate the housing assignments to ensure that the needsof each offender, whether in the general population or inan inpatient setting, are being met. TDCJ considers the offender's mental health diagnosis when determining his unit, housing, and job assignments.This classification process is meant to ensure that eachoffender is placed in the appropriate institutional setting inwhich he can receive the appropriate super vision, treat- ment, education, and work opportunities consistent withthe safety of the offender , the general population of offenders, agency staff, and the public at large. WithinTDCJ, 74 facilities offer outpatient mental health servicesand four facilities offer inpatient services. Offenders are assigned to specific units based on their individual treat-ment, custody, education, and work needs as well as bedavailability. Once an offender is identified as having a mental illness, mental healthcare staff should dev elop a treatment plan for each offender. This plan should consider the offender'sindividual needs. In TDCJ, the offenders who have beendetermined to have psychological problems are referred toan associate clinical psychologist for an in-depth evaluation.The psychologists conduct c linical interviews, observe behavioral manifestations, conduct psychometric testing,and obtain medical information from other sources. Aftercompleting the investigation, the psychologists complete adiagnostic report and make recommendations for bothlong-term, routine care and services as well as any immedi-ate psychiatric referrals. Depending upon the psychologists'recommendations, the offender may be referred to mentalhealth treatment providers. Unfortunately, offenders may not exhibit symptoms of mental illness until they have been incarcerated for a while. Also, anoffender's mental illness status may change dramatically duringincarceration. The incarceration experience itself, including theisolation, separation from family, and sometimes intimidationand victimization, can lead to severe depression or possiblyeven suicidal tendencies. It is also common for offenders'behavior to change as a result of new or different medicationsand withdrawal from drugs and alcohol. Offenders should beallowed to self-refer themselves for a psychiatric assessment.The staff needs to be aware of the symptoms of mentalillness and have an effective referral process to ensure theoffender's needs are addressed.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 336IMPROVE MONITORING OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM Within TDCJ, offenders are screened for mental illness with each unit change. Offender s who are in administrative segregation are evaluated by a mental health clinician afterthe first 30 days and every 90 days thereafter. Also,offenders in administrative segr egation are evaluated five days a week by a nurse or mental health staff. Offendersreturning from inpatient or special treatment facilities are evaluated within 72 hours of arrival at their receiving unit.Additionally, offenders may request an evaluation bysubmitting a sick-call request. Of fenders may also be referred by medical or security staff, family members,advocates, or other offenders. When an offender is assessedto be critical, he is evalua ted immediately, monitored through constant supervision, or moved to an inpatientfacility if necessary. To warrant a transfer to one of the1,570 inpatient psychiatric facility beds, the offender must exhibit symptoms of acute mental illness, such as psychoticsymptoms, be at imminent risk of suicide, or be unable tofunction independently in the outpatient setting. Otherwise,an offender is seen by a mental health or medical clinicianwithin 72 hours of referral. At most facilities, this initialevaluation is conducted by a mental health clinician. Atsome facilities the offender is triaged by nursing staff. Ifthe initial examiner determines that a further evaluation iswarranted, a referral is made to a psychotherapist, psychia- trist, psychiatric physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner. Follow-up appointments, usually held in an office settingbut occasionally conducted at cell side, must be conductedwithin 14 days of referral. PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION In conjunction with other components of treatment, psychotropic medication can play an important role in theoffender's treatment plan. Of the estimated 17,000offenders in TDCJ being treated for mental illness,approximately 14,000 receive some type of psychotropic medication. Psychotropic medications include mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and others.During fiscal year 2003, nearly three-quarters of the 96,480prescriptions for antipsychotics were for typical antipsy-chotic agents, such as Haldol. These medications may causeside effects, as tardive of muscle groups) aswell as hypotension (low blood pressure), tremors, andrigidity resembling Parkinson's disease, changes in thebreath and heart rate, w eight gain, insomnia, anxiety, and drowsiness. As a result of the side effects, an offender may refuse to take the medication. Medication compliance is an issue in any mental health setting, and patients have the right to refuse any part oftheir mental health treatment, including medication. WithinTDCJ, medication compliance is monitored by the treating mental health staff, and offenders are counseled to take themedication prescribed. With frequent noncompliance, thesymptoms of the offender's mental illness may reappear, ora relapse may occur. When an offender's mental healthdeteriorates, so does his ability to function in a correctionalsetting. Behavioral issues can lead to disciplinary actionsand administrative segregation. When a mentally illoffender is placed in segreg ation, he may further decom- pensate, making it more difficult for him to leave segrega-tion. The compounding effect may mean more time inadministrative segregation; greater loss of and inability to accrue good time; and subsequently, a longer time served\u2014all of which are at a greater cost to the state. However, newer generation medications, commonly known as \"new gen meds,\" can be used to treat mental illnesswithout most of the side effects of the typical agents.These medications are used less frequently in correctionalsettings than they are in the g eneral community as a result of their higher costs. At TDCJ, only a quarter of antipsy-chotic medications prescribed are atypical or \"new genmeds.\" The new gen meds included on the formulary aremedications that may be prescribed if specific clinicalcriteria are met. According to the Consensus Project,coordinated by the Council of State Governments and inpartnership with the Bureau of Justice Assistance andNational Institute of Corrections, among other institutions,clinical evidence has shown that widespread availability ofthese medications produces the benefits of greatercompliance with the patient's treatment plan and fewerhospitalizations. When applied to a correctional setting, thewidespread use of new gen meds has the potential toproduce significant long-term savings. The state couldavoid the cost of hospitalizations and crisis managementinterventions while the offender is in custody, the cost ofhousing the offender in more costly segregation units, thecost of incarcerating the offender for larger percentages ofhis sentence, and the cost of medication and relatedmedical expenses incurred during the offender's longersentence length. Discharging an offender after havingserved his entire sentence, possibly even from administra-tive segregation, releases the offender with no supervisionat all. Without supervision, there is no viable way to ensurethat the offender receives treatment in the community, takes his medication, and avoids substance abuse and othercriminal behavior. While a public safety concern, this lackof supervision also creates greater potential for recidivismand possible additional incarcera tion costs to the state. Senate Bill 636, Seventy-seventh Legislature, 2001, required the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation(MHMR, now part of DSHS) to review the costs andSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 337IMPROVE MONITORING OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM benefits associated with adopting the medication regimen, a specific formulary comprised of newer generation medica-tions set out in MHMR's Texas Medication Algorithm PilotProject (TMAP). Preliminary results of the study indicatethat while costs can be appr oximated to a reasonable degree, a formalized pilot program is needed to betterquantify the benefits that w ould result from adopting the TMAP regimen in a correctional setting. At the time of thestudy, it was estimated that to fully fund the TMAPprogram within TDCJ, an additional $16 million per yearwould be needed for additional prescription drug costs.Mental healthcare of offenders is often complicated by adual diagnosis of substance abuse and mental illness. Sincethis dual diagnosis affects a large portion of the mentally illoffenders and previous medication studies have not yetvalidated the effectiveness or long-term benefits of thealgorithm on this diagnosis, a pilot project is needed todetermine the value that the algorithm would provide tothis particular subpopulation. To determine the effect that widespread use of new gen meds would have in a correctional setting, TDCJ should beappropriated $1.1 million each year of the 2006-07biennium to conduct a pilot of the TMAP project (Recom-mendation 4). The project w ould provide funding for both purchasing the TMAP prescribed treatment regimens forapproximately 350 off enders and the necessary tracking and outcome measurements to determine the efficacy ofadopting TMAP for a correctional population. MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION Another issue particular to the corrections setting is the use of administrative segrega tion with mentally ill offenders. The Correctional Managed Healthcare Committee reportsthat more than 2,000 offenders with a mental illnessdiagnosis are in either high security confinement oradministrative segregation within TDCJ. This numberrepresents 12 percent of the incarcerated mentally illoffender population currently receiving treatment formental illness whereas 7 percent of the general populationis confined in administrative segregation. Using TDCJ's PULHES system of classification, at the end of fiscal year 2004, 946 mentally ill offenders or 9 percentof the total number of mentally ill offenders were housedin administrative segregation. While this is comparable to the 7 percent of the general population in administrativesegregation, the number and percentage are lower thanthose provided by the Correctional Managed HealthcareCommittee. Data constraints prevent determining thelengths of stay in administrative segregation and theresulting good time loss for mentally ill offenders, both ofwhich contribute to longer times served and higher costsper day for time served in administrative segregation. During fiscal year 2003, 444 offenders or 29 percent ofoffenders qualifying as mentally ill (using the PULHESvariables) were discharged after having served their entiresentence. Out of this number, 44 were discharged directlyfrom administrative segregation, creating not only a publicsafety concern but also a considerable cost to the state. Ofthe offenders released during fiscal year 2003, those with aPULHES mental illness indicator served 10 percent moreof their respective sentence than those without a mentalillness indicator. Even though the PULHES system greatlyunderrepresents the number of offenders with mentalillness, over $16 million in incarceration costs per yearcould be avoided if those offenders with mental illnessscores of three and four served the same percentage oftheir sentences as those without mental illness indicators.Also, because offenders released on parole can qualify forMedicaid, the state could avoid the cost of psychotropicmedication for those offenders. Offenders in administrative segregation are reviewed by a mental health clinician after the first 30 days and every 90days thereafter. In addition, a psychologist from the TDCJhealth services division audits every segregation unit twicea year. The psychologist physically observes everyoffender confined in administrative segregation, inter-views unit mental health and security staff for referrals ofoffenders, and interviews a sample of offenders inadministrative segregation. Treatment f or mentally ill offenders confined in adminis- trative segregation may differ from the treatment they would receive in the general population because of additional security restrictions for offenders who haveexhibited violence toward the treatment staff. Theseoffenders are usually excluded from group therapy.However, the offenders do have more frequent contactwith mental health staff than their counterparts in thegeneral population. Mental health staff perform weeklycell side rounds on all mentally ill offenders in administra-tive segregation. Also, the University of Texas MedicalBranch (UTMB), which provides the medical and mentalhealthcare to the majority of incarcerated offendersthrough correctional managed healthcare, has an Admin-istrative Segregation Intermediate Care Program (ASICP)to offer intensive outpatient mental health services tooffenders who have had repeated admissions to theinpatient psychiatric facilities as a result of noncompli-ance with psychotropic medications. The program is aneffort to aid these offenders in complying with prescribedtreatment and in developing skills and behaviors requiredto function safely in the general population. The effect of administrative segregation on mentally ill offenders varies. Some offenders' functioning may remainSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 338IMPROVE MONITORING OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM static, some may improve, and some may decompensate. To avoid decompensation, the offenders may be assigned tothe Program for the Aggr essive Mentally Ill Offender (PAMIO). This 450-bed program at TDCJ's Clements Unitin Amarillo has two components: the primary PAMIOprogram, which focuses on reducing hostile aggression andself-injury for offenders in administrative segregationthrough medication, psychological treatment (counseling,group therapy, and behavior modification), and socialtreatment (in-cell activities, therapeutic group activities, andstress management); and the administrative step-down unit,which provides treatment to offenders with a history of frequent crisis interventions. Offenders in any TDCJ facility statewide can be referred by mental health staff to the program. Acceptance to theprogram is based on the offender's administrative segrega-tion custody level; presence of mental health disorders; andhistory of assaultive, predatory, or self-directed aggression.When an offender arrives at the primary PAMIO program,he undergoes a diagnostic evaluation from which atreatment plan is developed. His treatment is based on asystem of behavioral levels in which each level has its ownset of expectations and privileges. As an offender demon-strates compliance with treatment and medication plansand exhibits socially acceptable behavior, he moves up tothe next level until he \"graduates\" from the program.Successful completion of the program generally takes 18months. The goal of the program is to improve theoffender's behavior so tha t he can be released from administrative segregation status. Of the 450 beds in the program, 75 are dedicated to the step-down program, which is intended for offenders whoare not seriously mentally ill but who are subject tofrequent crisis interventions as a result of manipulativebehavior or self-harm. Transfer to this program is notvoluntary and is made by both mental health and TDCJclassification staff because of a history of crisis manage-ment issues with the offender. The unit has access to crisisintervention on site which reduces the need to move theoffender. Therapeutic activities, such as aggression control,anger management, stress management, problem-solving,and coping skills, are provided to aid the offender inmanaging anger and impulsive or destructive behavior. MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING Another challenge in adapting the correctional system to meet the needs of mentally ill offenders is providingadequate training to affected staff. Training for correc-tions staff should be designed to enable the staff toidentify offenders with mental illness problems; under-stand when it is appropriate to refer an offender for amental health evaluation; improve the staff 's ability toeffectively communicate r ules and procedures to offend- ers with mental illness; and provide basic information onrelated topics, such as the relationship between mentalillness and violence, dual diagnoses, and psychotropicmedication and its side effects. The training should alsoprovide practical applications, such as suicide prevention,de-escalation techniques, and officer safety. TDCJ currentlyprovides its correctional officers with one and one-halfhours of pre-service training in mental health issues, twohours of training in suicide prevention, and one hour of in-service training in mental health issues/suicide prevention.The performance objectives of these trainings are to knowhow offenders access mental health services and how torefer them; to identify the types of treatment available andwhere the programs are located; and to identify characteris-tics of mental illness. Training should be provided for parole board members and parole officers as well. Because parole board memberscome from a range of ba ckgrounds and experiences, some may have experience with mental illness and others may not. It is important that each parole board memberunderstands, in particular, the stigma of mental illness andthe common association between offenders with mentalillness and violence, which may cause the members to behesitant to parole mentally ill offender s. Parole officers also come from a variety of backgrounds and have varyingdegrees of experience with mental illness. In addition totraining similar to what the parole board members receive,parole officers should be aware of the availability ofcommunity mental health resources and alternatives torevocation. Parole officers should be able to identify whenan offender is decompensating and when he is not comply-ing with the terms of parole as a result of his inability toaccess mental health services. It is particularly important that members of the parole board have sufficient knowledge and understanding of mental illness, the availability of community health servicesfor parolees with mental illness, and adequate and reliableinformation regarding the history and treatment of eachoffender. Determining the risk level of an offender iscentral to the decision of whether the parole board releasesan offender. Many releasing authorities, including the TexasBoard of Pardons and Paroles, use parole release guidelinesto steer and standardize the decision-making process.However, these guidelines typically address the generaloffender population without recognizing the special needsof mentally ill offenders. As an example, the Texas Boardof Pardons and Paroles includes education and vocationaland on-the-job training as factors to improve an offender'slikelihood of release, b ut mentally ill offenders may be unable to participate in such activities. Even in states that do not utilize a system of discretionary parole, many use aSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 339IMPROVE MONITORING OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM validated risk assessment tool to assess risk levels, yet no known risk assessment tool has been empirically validatedto show the connection between mental illness and risk.Releasing authorities should be given access to theoffender's mental health history and treatment plan andreceive adequate training to ensur e that a mentally ill offender's individual cir cumstances are taken into account when making the release decision. RELEASE OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS Additionally, conditions of release must be reasonable, realistic, enforceable, and tailored to the individualoffender's risks and needs. T he parole board must ensure that the resources will be available in the community beforemaking certain treatments and programs conditions ofrelease. In Texas, the Board of Pardons and Paroles has theoption of releasing the offender onto Medically Recom-mended Intensive Supervision (MRIS). A special mentalhealth parole panel of three members considers specialrelease conditions for qualifying offenders. To qualify, theoffender cannot be convicted of a sex offense, and theboard must determine that his mental illness played a rolein his instant offense or his illness will adversely affect hisability to succeed after release. If a pproved, the offender is placed on a specialized caseload, and conditions of hisrelease may include participation in a psychiatric/psycho- logical evaluation, participation in mental health treatment,and compliance with medication. During fiscal year 2003,four mentally ill offenders we re approved through MRIS. The parole board may also release an offender with mentalillness to a specialized caseload through the regular paroleor discretionary mandatory supervision process. However,of the more than 12,000 parolees w ho have received state mental health services, approximately 800 are on a special-ized mental health caseload. Another factor in the parole board's decision is its confi- dence in access to community-based mental healthcareresources. The Texas Corr ectional Office on Offenders with Medical and Mental Impairments (TCOOMMI)provides pre- and post-release care for special needsoffenders released from institutions within TDCJ. Whenboth the offenders and the appropriate community servicesare identified prior to release, and treatment and medica-tion are made a condition of release a mentally illoffender's chance of r eintegrating into society is increased. TCOOMMI has organized a regional continuity of caresystem in which offenders are immediately enrolled inservices in the community to which they are paroled, thus,avoiding a break in service or medication. Offenders with mental illness are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. Identifying, adequately treating, andproviding effective medication for offenders with mentalillness can improve and stabilize their lives, reduce recidi-vism, and avoid considerable long-term cost to the state. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS The fiscal impact of the recommendations is $1.1 million in General Revenue Funds per year for fiscal years 2006and 2007 to conduct a pilot program of the Texas Medica-tion Algorithm Project (TMAP) to determine its effective-ness in a correctional setting. The pilot program wouldprovide treatment regimens for approximately 350 offend-ers and the necessary tracking and outcome measurementsto determine the efficacy of the program. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not include funding for this recommendation.FISCAL YEAR 2006 ($1,100,000) 2007 ($1,100,000) 2008 $0 2009 $02010 $0FIGURE 1 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT PROBABLE SAVINGS/ (COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 340IMPROVE MONITORING OF MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IN THE TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 341THE MILITARY IN TEXAS The military in Texas consists of both state and federal military forces. The Texas Army National Guard, the TexasAir Force National Guard, and the Texas State Guardcomprise the state military force, collectively known as theTexas Military Forces. The Texas National Guard serves adual role and may be called into federal active service bythe president, or state service , usually related to disaster relief, by the governor. Additionally, with 17 active militaryinstallations, over 113,000 active military personnel, and37,000 civilian personnel, Texas has a strong federalmilitary presence. Texas ranks third, behind California and Virginia, respectively, in the total number of federal active service and civilian personnel. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe Texas Military Forces contribute to the state ofTexas through many activities: such as, state activeduty assistance, often in the form of natural disasterrelief; assisting the federal government in homelandsecurity; actively participating in the war on terrorthrough worldwide deployments; training students inspecialized youth education programs; and providingcommunity assistance through the Texas StateGuard. \u008bThe federal military continues to have a strongpresence in Texas. With 17 active military installa-tions and over 113,000 active military servicepersonnel, the U.S. Armed Services contribute to theeconomy and to local communities. Facing a newround of the federal Base Realignment and Closuresprocess, the Seventy-eighth Legislature, RegularSession, 2003, passed legislation to better Texas'position to retain federal military installations. COMMENTS The Texas National Guard, as all state national guards,serves a dual role. The United States Constitution specifiesthat the president is commander-in-chief of the statemilitia when called into actual service of the United Statesand the governor of Texas serves as the commander-in-chief when the guard is called to state active duty. STATE MILITARY PRESENCE The guard is a first-line reserve component of the U.S. Army and Air Force and in that role may be called intoactive federal service by the president to provide militarypersonnel for war, national emer gencies, and at other times, if national security requires augmentation of active forces. The Texas National Guard air component also has thepeacetime mission of supporting U.S. Air Force operationsand airlift missions around the world as required. The size and structure of the national guard are established by theU.S. Congress; its composition and organization aredetermined by the Secretaries of the Army and the AirForce; and allocation of authorized number ofguardspersons and federal funds is made to Texas by thefederal National Guard Bureau. The Texas Constitution makes the governor commander- in-chief at all times when the guard is not in active federal service. The guard may be ordered to active duty by thegovernor to provide trained and equipped military person-nel to assist civil authorities in the protection of life andproperty and the preservation of law, order, and public safety in Texas. The governor appoints, with the advice andconsent of the senate, the adjutant general. The adjutantgeneral is the head of the Adjutant General's Department,the state agency that over sees the state activities of the Texas Military Forces. He is subordinate only to thegovernor in matters pertaining to the state military forces.The Texas Military Forces are comprised of the TexasArmy National Guard, the Texas Air National Guard andthe volunteer Texas State Guard. During fiscal year 2004, the Texas National Guard had approximately 16,800members in the Texas Army National Guard and 3,200members in the Texas Air National Guard. In addition to the funds appropriated to the Adjutant General's Department through Texas' General Appropria-tions Act, the department recei ves funds directly from the federal government. During state fiscal year 2004, the department received $416.5 million in federal direct funds. This funding is used not only to pay the salaries of themembers of the national gua rd but also to support various federal operations such as airport security after September 11, 2001. In addition to members of the Texas National Guard, the department also oversees the activities of the 1,600members of the all-volunteer state reserve force, the TexasState Guard. The Texas State Guard provides trained andequipped individuals to supplement the Texas NationalGuard and replaces the Texas National Guard when that force is called into active service.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 342THE MILITARY IN TEXAS The Adjutant General's Department headquarters is located on Camp Mabry in A ustin. The de partment rents state-owned national guar d armories and other facilities statewide (see Figure 1) from the Texas Military FacilitiesCommission (TMFC). TMFC provides construction,maintenance, and repair of military facilities owned by thestate and located on state proper ty. The national guard uses 89 armories, 25 organizational maintenance shops, 19training site facilities, and numerous other state-ownedfacilities (see Figure 2). The Adjutant General's Depart-ment also owns property and various federal armoriesthroughout the state and is responsible for the mainte-nance, repair, and renovation of these facilities. Although itreceives state a ppropriations each biennium for repairs offederal facilities, the feder al and state share (ranging between 70/30 and 85/15) for building repair costs isdetermined by a master cooperative agreement betweenTexas and the federal National Guard Bureau. The mission of the Adjutant General's Department is to provide mission-ready forces responsive to the community,state, and nation. As part of its state mission, the Texas National Guard participates in state active duty missions.These missions provide the state with assistance duringtimes of emergencies, disasters, and special needs. Duringthe past several years, the Texas National Guard hasprovided emergency response to numerous hurricanes andtropical storms on the Gulf Coast, floods in central and FIGURE 1 LOCATIONS OF TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD ARMORIES SOURCE : Texas Military Facilities Commission.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 343THE MILITARY IN TEXAS south Texas, snowstorms in north Texas, and wildfires across the state. In addition to natural disasters, the guardhas also responded in times of specific need\u2014providingadditional security at the 2004 Superbowl in Houston andaiding in the Columbia shuttle recovery operation. TheAdjutant General's Department is appropriated $1 millioneach fiscal year to perform state active duty missions asthey occur. However, many missions, including manynatural disaster-related ones and tasks such as the Columbiashuttle recovery operation, are reimbursed by the FederalEmergency Management Agency. In addition to its primary state function of state active duty, the Adjutant General's Department also has severalcommunity-based functions. The Texas State Guardprovides assistance to communities statewide throughservices such as security for local events, traffic and crowdcontrol, searches for missing children, color and honor guards, and training support. The department also overseestwo community-based education programs for at-riskstudents. The Starbase program, located at Ellington Fieldin Houston, teaches weeklong classes in practical math andscience skills in a mentored environment. While attendingthe program, the elementary school students meet potentialrole models, such as astronauts , fighter pilots, and various members of the national guard. The Adjutant General's Department also operates the Texas Seaborne ChalleNGe Prog ram in Galveston. Each year this program provides six months of residential and 12months of non-residential academic training for 200 highschool students at risk of dropping out. In addition toobtaining a high school equivalent education, the studentslearn life skills, discipline, and motivation. The program is funded through a mix (65/35) of federal and state funding. Following the September 11, 2001 tragedy, the Texas Military Forces have experienced a shift in mission. Fromimmediate responses, such as a fighter escort of Air ForceOne and search, security, and rescue at Ground Zero tocombat air patrols over major cities and security of 26airports statewide, the Texas Military Forces' role inhomeland security has expanded. Additional activities nowinclude assisting the Federal Bureau of Investigation in thereview of flight manifests, augmenting border patrol andcustoms services along the Mexican border and interceptormissions against unidentified aircraft entering U.S. airspace. In addition the Texas National Guard has become more involved in the global war on terror. The Texas NationalGuard, as a reserve component of the U.S. Army and AirForce, may be called into active federal service by thepresident to provide military personnel for war, nationalemergencies, and at other times, if national securityrequires augmentation of active forces. The guard hasbeen mobilized and deployed in support of the war onterror to 195 locations within the U.S., on coalition navalvessels, and in 38 countries, including Afghanistan andIraq. Since September 11, 2001, over 10,000 Texasguardspersons have been mobilized. As of October 2004, over 4,000 have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan (500 are currently serving there) and 3,000 more arepreparing for deployment. Texas National Guard dutiesinclude assisting in the training of the new AfghanNational Army and flying night missions in Iraq. To meet the demands of the growing involvement with both homeland security and the global war on terror, theTexas Military Forces are transforming their operations.The various state headquarters have been merged into a single, joint state headquarters to fuse the Texas Army andAir National Guards into one interdependent structurewith consolidated functions and processes. Also, the veryfunctions of the guard are being transformed. The 49thArmored Division of the Texas Army National Guard wasrecently reflagged as the 36th Infantry Division to providea more agile, versatile, and deployable unit. Also, the TexasAir National Guard is putting new emphasis on informa-tion operations and an ev entual transition to follow-on aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicles. Finally, the Texas State Guard is transitioning into a trained joint forceof specialists focused on homeland security, able to step infor the Texas National Guard as they are deployed. FEDERAL MILITARY PRESENCE In addition to the Texas Military Forces (Texas Army National Guard, Texas Air Na tional Guard, and Texas State Guard), there is a strong f ederal military presence in Texas.

BASE REALIGNMENTS AND CLOSURES During the 1980s the U.S. Congress implemented the Base Realignment and Closures (BRAC) process as ameans to increase the efficiency of the U.S. military. TheBase Realignment and Closures Commission was formedto review recommendations from the U.S. Department ofDefense. The commission is not required to accept all ofthe department's recommendations, but most basesrecommended for closure are closed. The first BRACround in 1988 mostly realigned bases. However, subse-quent rounds of BRAC, in 1991, 1993, and 1995 involvedthe closing of many large bases within each service area.Since 1988 three major Texas military installations havebeen realigned, and seven, including Kelly and BergstromAir Force Bases, have been closed. Texas has lost about14,600 jobs, military and civilian, as a result of previousBRAC rounds. The process begins with the finalization of the criteria the commission will use to guide their BRAC decisions. Since abase closure will have a significant impact on the localeconomy, the criteria are designed to balance this negativeeffect with the needs of the military. In May 2005 theSecretary of Defense will submit recommendations foradditional base realignments and closures to both thecommission and Congress. In November 2005 the presi-dent must approve or disappr ove of the final list of recommendations. If he does approve, the recommenda-tions become legally binding and the actual process of baserealignment and closures will begin with the 2006 federalfiscal year. To improve Texas' posture for the 2005 BRAC process, Texas' Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003,passed the following legislation: \u008bSenate Bill 652 combined the Office of DefenseAffairs and the Texas Strategic Military PlanningCommission into the Texas Military PreparednessCommission. The nine-member commissionappointed by the governor was established to assistboth existing defense-dependent communities in theprevention of base realignments and closures andthose communities that have been already affected by BRAC. The commission also grants loans tocommunities for projects assessed to add militaryvalue to installations;\u008bSenate Joint Resolution 55 created the Texas MilitaryValue Revolving Loan Account and permitted thesale of bonds for projects that benefit defense-related communities (the bonds were subsequentlyapproved by voters in September 2003); and \u008bHouse Bill 591 mandated the Texas EducationAgency to pursue reciprocity with other states tofacilitate the transfer of military personnel and theirdependents. The military presence in Texas is strong. Both the Texas Military Forces and the federal military installations create apositive impact on the Texas economy and the localcommunities they serve.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 346THE MILITARY IN TEXASSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 347ACHIEVE SAVINGS IN GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS BY EXPANDING THE USE OF WATER-RELATED FUNDS The Water Development Board presently uses General Revenue Funds to pay for the cost of certain projects that could otherwise be financed with category-specific revenuefrom accounts in Other Funds. Furthermore, the agencypresently has the ability to initiate new projects withoutsanction of the legislature and to continue projectsconceived by legislatures many years in the past. Savings ofup to $14.2 million in General Revenue Funds could beachieved during the 2006-07 biennium by replacingGeneral Revenue Funds with these Other Funds. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bThe brush control program of the Soil and WaterConservation Board and debt service for brushcontrol projects and the saltcedar eradicationprogram, currently paid with General RevenueFunds, could be paid using Other Funds from theAgricultural Water Conservation Account. \u008bGeneral Revenue Funds ar e being expended by the Water Development Board for costs that could befinanced through the Water Assistance Fund (OtherFunds). \u008bThe Water Development Board presently has theability to initiate new projects and to continuepossibly outdated projects without the approval or guidance of the legislature. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: For the 2006-07 biennium, use funds in the Agricultural Water ConservationAccount to pay for the brush control program at theSoil and Water Conservation Board and to repaydebt service on Agricultural Water Conservationbonds issued for brush control projects andsaltcedar eradication programs in fiscal year 2003. \u008bRecommendation 2: For the 2006-07 biennium, use balances and revenues in the Water AssistanceFund to cover costs that would otherwise be paidusing General Revenue Funds. \u008bRecommendation 3: Require the Water Develop- ment Board to request permission from the legisla-ture to initiate new projects and to pursue only thoseprojects initiated by previous legislatures that theSeventy-ninth Legislature, 2005, determines to remain priorities of Texas. COMMENTS Of the Water Development Board's 2006-07 LegislativeAppropriations Request (LAR) of $72.0 million for theagency, $35.8 million, or 49.8 percent, is from GeneralRevenue Funds (GR). The remaining $36.2 million isfrom non-GR from the WaterAssistance Fund. The agency's 2006-07 LAR for Debt Service Payments for Non-self-supporting General Obligation Water Bondsincludes a total request of $52.2 million, $38.2 million ofwhich is from General Revenue Funds. Other Fundsaccount for the remaining debt service funding, including$5.0 million out of the Economically Distressed AreasBond Payment Account and $9.0 million out of the StateParticipation Program Bond Payment Account. Outside of the State Treasury, the Water Development Board operates several dif ferent accounts, the largest of which are the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF)and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF).These accounts consist of state and federal contributionsas well as repayments from local governments for the loanportions of these accounts. In addition, the agency hasaccess to the funds from the Texas Water ResourcesFinance Authority (TWRFA), which derive from bond salesand refinancings. There are also several statutorily dedi-cated accounts inside the state treasury but outside of theGeneral Revenue Fund, including the Agricultural WaterConservation Account and the Water Assistance Fund. Because the agency has access to various accounts other than General Revenue Funds and those commonly used by otherstate agencies (e.g., Interagency Contracts and AppropriatedReceipts), there is the potential to use some of these agency-specific funding sources to offset General Revenue Fundexpenditures. Although each of these agency-specificaccounts has statutory and/or constitutional designations forits use, there appear to be opportunities to use two of theseaccounts in ways that General Revenue Fund spendingwould otherwise be used during 2006-07.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 348ACHIEVE SAVINGS IN GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS BY EXPANDING THE USE OF WATER-RELATED FUNDS POTENTIAL SAVINGS TO THE GENERAL REVENUE FUND FROM THE AGRICULTURAL WATER CONSERVATION FUND In its 2006-07 LAR, the agency projects a balance of $16.2 million in the Agricultural Water Conservation Fund onAugust 31, 2005, with an additional $2.5 million in revenuesfrom loan repayments accruing to the account during2006-07. The majority of these funds were in the Agricul-tural Trust Fund (also \"Other Funds\") prior to September1, 2003, until Senate Bill 1053, Seventy-eighth Legislature,Regular Session, 2003, consolidated that account and theGeneral Revenue-Dedicated Agricultural Soil and WaterConservation Account into the Agricultural Water Conser-vation Account. Water Code, Section 18.899 specifies theuse of funds in the Agricultural Water ConservationAccount. These uses include grants and loans for conserva-tion projects, agency costs in administering the agriculturalwater conservation program, and the repayment of debtservice on bonds. With over $16.0 million in balances in the Agricultural Water Conservation Account (Other Funds), there would be atleast enough to cover the $5.4 million the agency projectswould otherwise be spent in General Revenue Funds duringthe 2006-07 biennium to repay Agricultural Water Conserva-tion Bonds. $16.0 million in General Obligation Bonds wasissued pursuant to action by the Seventy-seventh Legislature,2001, for brush control projects at the Soil and WaterConservation Board and saltcedar eradication projects at theDepartment of Agriculture. The Soil and Water Conservation Board's LAR includes a request for $3.7 million for brush control projects in theagency's Water Conservation and Enhancement strategy.The vast majority of this money would be used to providecost-share grants to landowners. These costs could also bepaid using funds in the Agricultural Water ConservationAccount, thereby saving an additional $3.7 million inGeneral Revenue Funds. Using the Agricultural WaterConservation Account for both debt service on bondsissued for brush control and to pay ongoing costs of theBrush Control Program at the Soil and Water ConservationBoard would result in a total General Revenue Fundsavings of $9.1 million in the 2006-07 biennium (Recom-mendation 1). POTENTIAL SAVINGS TO THE GENERAL REVENUE FUND FROMTHE WATER ASSISTANCE FUND The Water Assistance Fund (WAF) was created by the Sixty-seventh Legislature in 1981. Initially, $40 million wastransferred to the WAF from the General Revenue Fundfor water loan assistance, storage acquisition, research, andplanning. Since the fund's inception, the legislature hasdirected additional funds, inc luding General RevenueFunds and TWRFA proceeds, to the WAF for specific purposes and projects. The agency has maintained fullaccess to funds in the WAF through riders in the GeneralAppropriations Act (GAA) since the WAF's inception. Revenues to the WAF have accrued from various sources over the years. The legisla ture has directed the agency to transfer balances from the TWRFA and from the GeneralRevenue Fund on various occasions. One example of this,begun as a result of Senate Bill 1, Seventy-fifth Legislature,1997, and the beginning of regional water planningactivities, is the transfer of regional water planning fundsfrom the General Revenue Fund to the WAF. Since theSeventy-sixth Legislature, 1999, between $7.0 million and $18.0 million each biennium has been transferred to theWAF, and another $7.4 million is requested for the 2006-07biennium. Because such funds were originally appropriatedout of the General Revenue Fund, such funds are subjectto lapse. In other cases, revenues accrue to the WAF in the form of repayments for specific loans authorized by the legislature.Examples of this include a $1.0 million loan to Fort BendCounty and a $2.5 million loan to the Bexar MetropolitanWater District during the 1996-97 biennium and a for the Hueco-Bolson desalination projectduring the 2002-03 biennium. In these cases, General Revenue Funds were appropriated to make the loans; thus the funds were subject to lapse in the initial biennium inwhich they were appropriated. However, repayments accrueto the WAF where they become available for expenditurefor any purpose the board deems necessary, as long as itcomplies with statutory restrictions for the WAF . Thesefunds generally are not subject to lapse because the agencyhas always had appropriations authority to spend balancesin the WAF through Rider 4, General Appropriations Act, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003. Through the various loans that have been made from the WAF, the agency expects to receive a total of $1.8 millionin loan repayments deposited back to the credit of theWAF during fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2007. Theagency reports that virtually all of these funds have been\"committed\" to by the board, which means one of threethings: a contract exists for the funds, the funds have beencommitted to by board resolution, or the funds have been\"designated\" for certain other projects. According to theagency, of the $30.7 million in cash in the WAF on July 31,2004, $11.3 million in WAF funds were for \"committed\"projects still having no signed contract. Of this amount,$5.1 million is not expected to be under contract before theend of fiscal year 2005. Figure 1 provides a breakdown offunds in the WAF that are not yet encumbered but are expected to be spent prior to the end of fiscal year 2005.Figure 2 provides a breakdown of funds not anticipated toSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 349ACHIEVE SAVINGS IN GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS BY EXPANDING THE USE OF WATER-RELATED FUNDS be spent during 2005, although the agency has designated the majority of the funds for specific uses. The legislature may direct the agency to use unencumbered funds in the WAF for any purpose it deems appropriate, aslong as the use is authorized by st atute. Allowable uses of WAF funding are generally limited to projects involving theprovision of financial assistance to communities. However,there currently are e xpenditures the agency makes using General Revenue Funds that could be considered financialassistance and could thus be paid using the WAF. Oneexample is the regional water planning activity. The agencyis requesting $6.7 million in General Revenue Funds forthis purpose during the 2006-07 biennium, but these costs could be paid using WAF proceeds instead, if the legisla-ture determined that this use was a higher priority thanprojects otherwise receiving WAF \"designation.\" At aminimum, the $655,715 in undesignated funds in the WAFcould be used to reduce General Revenue Fund spendingtoward regional planning. If all funds which are notexpected to be spent during fiscal year 2005 were redi-rected towards such expenses, a total of $5.1 million in General Revenue Fund savings could be realized (Recom-mendation 2).These funds are part of an overall $7.4 million General Revenue appropria- tion for Regional Planning Grants. This amount is reserved by the Board as acontingency amount to cover cost overruns at regional planning districts. If the funds do not get spent by the end of fiscal year 2005, they would become available in the WAF Account 480 in fiscal year 2006. The agency reports that these funds were designated for the Sand Branch community in Dallas County. The agency reports that negotiations continuewith Dallas County, but no contract has been signed. If these funds are not spent by the end of fiscal year 2005, they would remain available in Account 480. Board resolutions have been passed for several projects for Border Water- works and Rensselaerville Institute, and contracts are expected to be in place by 8/31/05. If contracts are not in place, these funds would remain available in Account 480. A total of $275,000 was originally allocated to Playa Lakes (GAA, 78th Leg., Rider 12), of which $50,000 is already under contract. A Board resolution has been approved for a contract with the University of Texas for an additional$50,000. The agency expects to execute that contract, and encumber the remaining $175,000, during fiscal year 2005. Small Community Hardship Assistance is a new program with demand exceeding funds available. The agency reports that all funds are expected to be encumbered prior to the end of fiscal year 2005. The Board has approved resolutions for the following projects: Brazos River Authority, $50,000; Hamline University, $75,000; The University of Texas,$60,000 and $75,000; Texas A&M University-Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, $75,000; Texas Tech, $50,000; Alan Plummer Association, $75,000; GDS Associates Inc., $60,000; U.S. Geological Survey $29,700;and Jefferson County $239,350. An additional $40,000 is not designated for a specific project, but rather for agency program use. The agency expects to use these funds to cover costs in the Research and Planning Division that resulted from a shortfall in the amount of funds available to transfer from TWRFA in fiscal year 2005.Research and Planning, GAA, 78th Leg., Rider 2 Financial Assistance to Unincorporated Communities, GAA, 76th Leg, Rider GAA, 71st Leg, Rider 5 TWRFA-Playa Lakes, Board Resolution Small Community Hardship Assistance, Board Resolution TWRFA-Research and Facility Planning-Studies, Board Resolution Research & Facility Planning- Studies, GAA, 78th Leg., RegularAppropriations TOTAL, WAF Balance Not Under Contract But Expected To 8/31/05$200,000 $400,000 $217,708 (BOARD RESOLUTION ORDESIGNATED) AMOUNT COMMENTSFIGURE 1 FUNDS CURRENTLY NOT UNDER CONTRACT BUT EXPECTED TO BE ENCUMBERED PRIOR TO 8/31/05STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 350ACHIEVE SAVINGS IN GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS BY EXPANDING THE USE OF WATER-RELATED FUNDS ENHANCED SCRUTINY OF THE WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD'SUSE OF OTHER FUNDS Many of the designations for funding in the WAF are relatively old, dating as far back as the Seventy-first Legisla-ture, 1989. Further, it a ppears that the agency does not systematically rescind its designation to projects no matterhow long they are delayed. It is possible that funds could sitin the account waiting to be used for 10 to 20 years whileother priorities of the state and agency go unmet. Inaddition, the agency essentially maintains full control offunds that accrue to the Water Assistance Fund from sourcessuch as loan repayments, even though the original source ofthe money is often General Revenue Funds. The Water Development Board, through Rider 6, General Appropriations Act, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Re gular Session, 2003, was gr anted authority to spend any funds in the Agricultural Water Conservation Account with virtuallyno scrutiny from the legisla ture. Because these funds are also outside the General Revenue Fund, they also are not subjectto lapse. The agency has budgeted $10 million in f iscal year 2005 out of the Ag ricultural Water Conservation Account for a new program known as the Agricultural Water Conserva-tion Demonstration Initiative Grant program. Accordingto the agency's Web site, the program is intended to \"expedite transfer of available technology to the farmsand to develop comprehensive data, utilizing large-scaledemonstration sites, to assess the cost-effectiveness ofselected technologies, evaluate and determine the impactof implementation on crop productivity, impacts onreductions of irrigation water use, and impacts onavailable water supplies.\" Although the decision to initiate and fund this new program is within the board's authority, the agency did notseek legislative approval or ask the legislature if it hadanother priority use for these funds. For instance, absentthe agency's decision to use this $10 million for thedemonstration initiative, the legislature could decide that these additional balances be used to fund brush controlcosts, including debt service, in 2008-09 and beyond. Appropriations authority to the Water Development Board for funds in the Water Assistance Fund and the Agricul-tural Water Conservation Account should be providedthrough rider only for specif ic, identified projects during a given biennium (Recommendation 3). The agency wouldthen need to request permission from the legislature tobegin new projects, contin ue ongoing projects, and continue with projects initiated by previous legislaturesThese funds have been designated for Economically Distressed Areas Program (EDAP) by the Board, but they remain unencumbered. The funds were earmarked for facility planning, but the agency reports that until additional EDAP construction funding (agency LAR exceptional item request #1), no newfacility plans will move forward. These funds have been designated for use as emergency loans by the Board. However, demand has been less than expected for this program. The agency reports that the applicant pool for these loans is finding its needs are better met through the Rural Water Assistance Fund program. Agency staff currently is evaluating whether to consolidate these funds into another program serving rural and disadvantaged communities. The agency reports that these funds have been set aside by the Board to allow for increases to commitments and contracts already in existence and to fundother critical projects that arise.

This would hold the agency more accountable for its spending and provide an opportunity toredirect funding based on legislative priorities rather thanthose of the agency. The language to be added to theappropriate rider providing appropriations authority foreach respective account could resemble the following: The Water Development Board may only use funds in the Water Assistance Fund No. 480 on thefollowing projects not to exceed the amounts listedduring the 2006-07 biennium. A listing of projects would follow with the names of the project and the estimated project cost. Funds associatedwith projects not continued would then be freed up fornew projects or to pay ongoing agency costs. Moreover,implementation of recommendation three would result infunds in the WAF being treated similar to other state funds,which are subject to lapse and greater scrutiny by thelegislature. To cover emergencies and unforeseen needs, alimited amount of funds from the WAF could be appropri-ated for such discretionary purposes each biennium. Although the TWRFA, the CWSRF, the DWSRF, and the State Participation Program were all reviewed to determinewhether balances were available for the legislature toconsider for expenditure or limitation on expenditure, theonly significant unencumbered balances offering opportu-nities for General Revenue Fund savings appear to occurwith the Water Assistance Fund and the Agricultural WaterConservation Account. As progr ams change at the state and federal level, additional funding mechanisms outsidethe General Revenue Fund will continue to be monitoredfor additional opportunities. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS As Figure 3 illustrates, implementation of the recommen- dations contained in this report could result in a savings inGeneral Revenue Funds of $14.2 million during the2006-07 biennium. This savings would be achieved bysubstituting $5.1 million in expected General RevenueFund spending on regional planning activities with balancesand revenues in the Water Assistance Fund. An additional$5.4 million could be saved by using funds in the Agricul-tural Water Conservation Account to pay debt service onbrush control bonds instead of using General RevenueFunds. Finally, $3.7 million in General Revenue Fundscould be saved by using funds in the Agricultural WaterConservation Account to pay costs of the brush controlprogram at the Soil and Water Conservation Board ratherthan General Revenue Funds.FIGURE 3 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL FUNDSFISCAL YEARPROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO OTHER FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.

From fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 2004, the federal government distributed an estimated $1.1 billion in federal funding for beach erosion projects. The distribution to four states (New Jersey, Florida, New York, and Illinois) accounts for 68 percent or $758.5 million of the federal funding. Texas has received a total of $2.4 million for beach erosion projects. Additional funding is needed to protect the Texas coastline and maximizing federal funding should be explored. SIGNIFIC ANT FINDINGS uA review of the various federal agencies that fund coastal zone related programs determined that the U.S. Corps of Engineers' Continuing Authorities Program and projects specifically authorized by Congress are the primary source of federal funding available to states for beach nourishment projects that address coastal erosion. The U.S. Corps of Engineers is authorized to fund periodic beach nourishment projects beyond the initial construction for up to 50 years. uThe process to draw down federal funding to address beach erosion differs from most federal grant programs. The U.S. Corps of Engineers is authorized to partner with grantees through the Continuing Authorities Program and by federal legislation that specifically authorizes beach erosion control projects. uThe Corps of Engineers and Shore Protection: History, Projects and Costs study, completed by the Corps in May 2003, lists the 71 specifically autho- rized shoreline protection projects as of June 2002. According to this report, only two shoreline projects have been completed in Texas since the Corps first started them in 1950. SIGNIFIC ANT CONCERN uThe current funding source for Coastal Erosion Planning and Response Program projects is primarily dedicated for another purpose, and its use does not comply with current state statute.RECOMMENDA TIONS uRecommendation 1: Congress should be petitioned by the Texas Legislature to consider small beach nourishment projects as eligible projects for Pre- Disaster Mitigation grant funds. uRecommendation 2: The General Land Office should examine strategies to maximize federal funding through the U.S. Corps of Engineers' Continuing Authorities Program. uRecommendation 3: The General Land Office should seek legislation to amend the current statute to modify the interest cap and/or provide another dedicated revenue source to fund coastal erosion projects and contribute required state matches to maximize Federal Funds. uRecommendation 4: The General Land Office should utilize the Coastal 2020 report to petition Congress to specifically authorize and fund beach erosion control studies and construction projects in Texas. COMMENTS In states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, large areas of coastal land have been eroded as a result of natural processes and human activities. According to a U.S. Geological Survey report published in 2004, about half of Texas beaches have been eroding at an average rate of 5.9 feet a year. Beach erosion is concentrated between Sabine Pass and High Island, southwest of the Galveston Island seawall, and along the peninsula. A growing coastal population, increased tourism activity, and land develop- ment on the Texas coast will continue to be pressures on Texas beaches and wetlands. DEMOGRAPHICS AND ECONOMY OF TEXAS COASTAL AREAS The Texas coastline stretches 624 miles along the Gulf of Mexico, from Orange County to Cameron County. For this report, the 18 counties falling under the jurisdiction of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) are considered coastal (see Figure 1). Coastal zone counties include the following: Aransas, Brazoria, Calhoun, Cameron, Chambers, Galveston, Harris, Nueces, Orange, Refugio, San Patricio, Victoria, and Willacy. According to TO LEGISLA TURE LEGISLA TIVE BUDGET BO ARD 354MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TEXAS BEACHES FIGURE 1 TEXAS COAST AL COUNTIES SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA TURE LEGISLA TIVE BUDGET BO ARD 355MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TEXAS BEACHES Census, 25 percent of Texas' population (5.2 million) lives in the coastal zone counties. Texas coastal counties' population grew by 16 percent over the 1990 Census count and is estimated to increase to about 6 million by 2010. Tourism is a major industry in Texas and contributes to the economic development of coastal zone counties. Texas is one of the most visited states in the country (third to California and Florida). Tourism on the Texas coast has a significant impact on the Texas economy. In 2003, visitor spending in coastal zone counties accounted for 26.3 percent of the $33.5 billion spent by visitors to Texas. The coast's travel and tourism industry employed more than 126,000 people in 2003 and generated an estimated $193.5 million in local and $571.8 million in state tax revenues, for a total of $765.3 million. BEACHES AND BARRIER ISLANDS Texas has the third longest coastline in the country measuring 634 miles, about 480 miles of which are beach. Parallel to the beaches on the coastline are long, narrow strips of land called barrier islands. Barrier islands are mounds of sand deposited by waves and wind over a long period of time. There are 17 barrier islands that total 191,762 acres stretching along the coastline. Texas is similar to Alabama and Florida in that its sandy barrier islands are also close to the coastline. These landforms serve as a first line of defense against hurricanes and tropical storms. BEACH NOURISHMENT Several coastal states have implemented different types of projects under the overall categories of beach nourishment efforts to restore an eroding or lost beach or to create a new shoreline. Structural approaches to addressing beach erosion include construction of sea walls (wave resistant structures), revetments (wave protection structures placed on an existing sloping embankment), and jetties. Another approach to beach nourishment involves using large amounts of sand to widen beaches. This also provides anelevation to protect the upland area. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, beach nourishment is becoming the most frequently used method to address coastal erosion. COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The passage of CZMA marked the first significant federal role in managing coastal areas. Congress authorized the Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) to ensure the protection and management of coastal areas. The CZMP is a voluntary program that provides federal funding and technical assistance (Sections 306 and 306a) to coastal states to prepare and implement state coastal management. The Seventy-second Legislature, 1991, passed the Coastal Coordination Act, which created the Coastal Coordination Council (CCC) and provided the framework for developing Texas' CZMP plan for federal approval. The Texas Coastal Management Program (CMP) received Section 305 Federal Funds to develop its CZMP plan and continues to receive Section 306 and 306a funds to assist in managing and implementing the CZMP. Other CZMA programs include the Coastal Zone Enhancement Grants (Section 309) and the Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Program (Section 6217). CZARA established the Section 309 program to encourage states to develop programs in one or more of the following nine coastal zone enhance- ment areas: wetlands, public access, coastal hazards, cumulative and secondary impacts, energy and government facility siting, marine debris, ocean resources, special area management plans, and aquaculture. Figure 2 provides the matching requirements and the fiscal year 2004 federal awards for all CZMP programs. Beginning in 1999, the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) has interpreted congres- sional language to mean that projects funded with CZMP funds may not be capital-intensive and that Section 306a funds cannot be used to finance large-scale, erosion- prevention structures. OCRM's guidance policy for these FIGURE 2 COAST AL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT PROGRAMS 306 and 306a Coastal Zone Management Program Administration 50 percent $2.0 million and Implementation 309 Program improvements to coastal programs in any of None $0.5 million nine areas of national significance. 6217 Nonpoint Pollution Control Program Administration and 50 percent $0.3 million ImplementationSECTION PURPOSEMATCH REQUIREMENTSFEDERAL AW ARD FISC AL YEAR 2004 SOURCE : National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA TURE LEGISLA TIVE BUDGET BO ARD 356MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TEXAS BEACHES funds indicates that beach nourishment or hard structure erosion control projects cannot be funded with Section 306a funds. However, OCRM does allow states to spend Section 306a funds for planning beach nourishment projects in certain limited instances. Small-scale shoreline stabilization structures are allowed for the redevelopment of deteriorating or underutilized urban waterfronts or ports to provide for increased public use and access. OCRM may approve planning activities for a beach nourishment project or nonstructural erosion control project if the project is on public land and the state CZMP can show there is a substantial public benefit related to the project , these benefits substantially out- weigh the costs , there is a reasonable expectation that the project will last for a reasonable amount of time , the project is minor in scope and not capital -intensive , and the project meets other Section 306a requirements. COASTAL IMPACT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Congress appropriated $150.0 million for the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) in fiscal year 2001. This one-time appropriation was allocated to seven states to lessen the impacts of oil and gas production on the outercontinental shelf and to protect coastal resources. Texas' allocation was a total of $26.4 million, with 35 percent ($9.2 million) flowing to local counties directly from the federal government. The General Land Office (GLO) and CCC managed the portion of funds retained by the state ($17.1 million). The GLO, CCC, and coastal counties funded 80 projects with CIAP funds and spent approxi- mately 15 percent of these funds on erosion control and stabilization. Figure 3 displays the percent of CIAP funds spent by project type. About 15 percent of these funds were spent on erosion control and shore stabilization. Coastal beach associations have petitioned Congress to appropriate these funds in subsequent years. However, Congress has not appropriated funds for the CIAP program since fiscal year 2001. BEACH MONITORING AND NOTIFICATION PROGRAM Congress passed the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act (BEACH Act) in October 2000. This BEACH Act authorized federal funding to states to develop and implement beach water quality monitoring and notification programs at recreational waters near beaches.

The distribution of these funds to the 38 eligible states is based on a formula, which considers three factors: (1) beach season length, (2) beach miles, and (3) beach use. Congress appropriated $2.0 million for fiscal year 2001 Beach Monitoring and Notification Program Implementation Grants, and increased the appropriation to $10.0 million in subsequent years. Texas has received about $0.4 million each year since fiscal year 2002 in BEACH Act funds. The Environmental Protection Agency requested that states report the total number of beaches and the number of beaches being monitored. Beaches are defined as discrete coastal recreation waters adjacent to a shore or similar points of access that are used by the public. GLO reported that 30 percent, or 50 of the 166 beaches in Texas are monitored. The GLO has used BEACH Act funds to expand the Texas Beach Watch Program that was sup- ported with CMP funds. HAZARD MITIGATION Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Pre- Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grants support planning and projects to address natural hazards. FEMA reports that these plans and projects reduce overall risks to populations and structure and reduce reliance on funding from actual disaster declarations. For fiscal year 2003, Congress made $150.0 million available to fund the PDM grants. Each state receives approximately $0.2 million in PDM planning grant funds. FEMA distributes the remaining PDM funds on a competitive basis to eligible applicants, such as state emergency management agencies or similar state offices. Federal funding per project is limited to a maximum of $3.0 million. FEMA will contribute up to 75 percent of the total amount approved under the grant award to implement projects. At least 25 percent of the total eligible costs must be provided from a nonfederal source. Texas received a total of $10.0 million in PDM funds in fiscal year 2003 (see Figure 4). Currently, PDM funds are available for minor structural hazard control or protection projects that may include vegetation management, storm water management, or shoreline/landslide stabilization. Congress may consider legislation that would allow small beach nourishment projects to be eligible for PDM grants. During the 108th Congress, House Bill 3804, The Beach Nourishment as Pre-Disaster Mitigation Act, was introduced to allow small beach nourishment or renourishment projects to be eligible for the PDM Grant funds. Recommendation 1 suggests that the Texas Legislature petition Congress to consider small beach nourishment or renourishment projects as eligible projects for PDM Grant funds.BEACH EROSION CONTROL PROJECTS The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) assists states with planning, designing , and managing water resource projects. The Corps is authorized to partner with states and local governments to protect coastal areas, including beaches and wetlands, from hurricanes and coastal storm damage. In the past, the Corps addressed beach erosion by implementing shoreline protection structures such as sea walls and revetments. Today the Corps focuses more on beach nourishment projects to replenish sand on beaches. The process to draw down federal funding to address beach erosion differs from most federal grant programs. The Corps is authorized to partner with grantees (referred to as sponsors) through two separate processes: (1) the Continuing Authorities Program (CAP) and (2) by federal legislation that specifically authorizes beach erosion control projects. CONTINUING AUTHORITIES PROGRAM The CAP authorizes the Corps to construct small beach restoration and protection projects not specifically autho- rized by Congress. CAP projects have specific criteria and cost-sharing requirements, and must follow the same project development phases as specifically authorized projects. Each project has a maximum federal share of costs ($2.0 million) and must not be dependent on addi- tional improvements for successful operation. In fiscal year 2004 the state received $1.4 million in CAP funding to complete four coastal erosion projects. Recommendation 2 proposes that the GLO continue to explore strategies to maximize federal funding through CAP for small projects with the Corps.FIGURE 4 PRE-DISASTER MITIG ATION GRANTS AWARDED TO TEXAS FISCAL YEAR 2003 (IN MILLIONS) City of Jersey Village Home Residential Elevations $1.5 Harris County Flood Residential Acquisitions 7.1 Control District City of Conroe Residential Acquisitions 0.9 Governor's Division of Texas Multihazard Mitigation 0.2 Emergency Management Plan Governor's Division of Management Costs and 0.3 Emergency Management Technical Assistance Total $10.0GRANTEE PROJECT TYPEFEDERAL SHARE AMOUNT SOURCE : Federal Emergency Management Agency.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA TURE LEGISLA TIVE BUDGET BO ARD 358MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TEXAS BEACHES SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED PROJECTS The process for specifically authorizing projects involves sponsors requesting Congress to authorize and appropriate federal funding for two project development phases: (1) a needs assessment, and (2) project construction. The needs assessment component includes two studies: an initial reconnaissance study to determine if a feasible solution is likely, followed by a feasibility study to examine alternatives and to select the project that best meets national and local needs. The costs of the initial reconnaissance up to $0.1 million are completely funded by the federal government. Most feasibility studies' costs are shared equally between the federal government and the sponsor. Congress must appropriate funds for these studies in order for the Corps to complete the needs assessment. If the feasibility study determines that a Corps project should be completed, Congress must first authorize the project and then appropriate funds. Congress authorizes selected projects with the passage of the Water Resources Development Act every two years. These projects have a cost-sharing requirement of 35 percent. The Corps may then either operate and maintain the completed project or turn it over to a state or local partner. With beach nourish- ment projects, the cost-sharing agreement includes a federal commitment to share the ongoing costs of periodic renourishment, often over a period of 50 years. Congress appropriated nationally an estimated $93.1 million in fiscal year 2005 for shoreline erosion projects and studies in 16 states. Florida, Illinois, and New Jerseywere appropriated $66.9 million, or 72 percent of the total (see Figure 5). Congress earmarked about $0.4 million in federal funding in order to continue one feasibility study in Texas: the Sabine Pass to San Luis Pass project. The federal government and sponsors will share the $4.3 million cost of the feasibility study equally. The sponsors of this project are the GLO, Galveston County, and Jefferson County. Prior to this feasibility study, the Corps completed a reconnaissance study at a cost of $0.9 million for this project. The Corps has indicated that its fiscal year 2006 budget will request funding for a Texas statewide feasibility study. The Corps of Engineers and Shore Protection: History, Projects and Costs study, completed by the Corps in May 2003, lists the 71 shoreline protection/coastal erosion projects specifically authorized by Congress as of June 2002. This study did not include the numerous small projects that fall under CAP. According to this report, only two shoreline projects have been completed in Texas since the Corps first started in 1950. The Galveston Seawall Structural project was completed in 1963 and cost an estimated $9.3 million. The Corpus Christi Beach project was completed in 1978 at a cost of $2.4 million. The president's budget for fiscal year 2005 proposed to eliminate the federal contribution for periodic renourishment projects, work on beaches beyond initial beach nourishment. The Corps had notified states this new policy will be implemented in fiscal year 2005, unless Congress directs them otherwise. However, recently the FIGURE 5 FEDERAL FUNDING FOR BEACH EROSION CONTROL PROJECTS FEDERAL FISC AL YEAR 2005 (IN MILLIONS) SOURCE : Marlowe and Company.$0$5$10$15$20$25$30 ArkansasCalifornia DelawareFloridaGeorgia Hawaii TIVE BUDGET BO ARD 359MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TEXAS BEACHES Corps has issued a notice that the new policy will not be implemented without congressional agreement. COASTAL EROSION PLANNING AND RESPONSE ACT To address erosion concerns along the Texas coast and provide funding for erosion control projects, the Seventy- sixth Legislature, 1999, enacted the Texas Coastal Erosion Planning and Response Act (CEPRA) with the passage of Senate Bill 1960. CEPRA is a coordinated effort of state, federal, and local entities to conduct beach nourishment, shoreline protection, and dune restoration projects and related studies. The GLO is the state agency that adminis- ters CEPRA. Funding for CEPRA projects is a mix of state and local funds. Project partners must provide at least a 25 percent match for beach nourishment projects and a 40 percent match for shoreline protection and marsh restoration projects; however, one large-scale beach nourishment project can be conducted each biennium, using up to one- third of the biennial funding without a match requirement. A potential project partner may be any local government, state or federal agency, institution of higher education, or other public or private entity that submits a proposal to finance, study, design, install, or maintain an erosion response project. Projects are selected on criteria laid out in the original CEPRA legislation. Based on these scores the agency comes up with a priority list of projects. Most proposed projects range in scope from $0.5 million to $3.0 million. Figure 6 provides information on the first three cycles of CEPRA projects. CEPRA funding was decreased by more than half for the 2004-05 biennium. LEVERAGING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR CEPRA PROJECTS To date, the CEPRA program and the GLO have been somewhat successful at leveraging Federal Funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps CAP Pro-gram. The state has not, however, been able to access the level of Federal Funds achieved by Florida and New Jersey. Unlike these other states, which have entered into many specifically authorized projects with the Corps, since the inception of CEPRA Texas has only entered into one such project\u2014the Sabine Pass to San Luis Pass study. So far CEPRA has provided $600,000 to the project to offset the local share of study costs. When this study is complete, the state should be able to leverage $10.0 million to $15.0 million in Federal Funds for beach erosion control projects associated with this study. In order to leverage these funds, however, the project partners will have to be able to provide the required 35 percent state match of approxi- mately $3.5 million to $5.3 million. According to GLO staff, the primary reason the state has not entered into more specifically authorized projects with the Corps is that state matching funds have not been available to qualify for major Corps projects. The GLO anticipates needing at least $10.0 million per biennium in CEPRA appropriations to be able to provide the necessary matching funds for new, specifically authorized projects in addition to other CEPRA projects. Appropriations for CEPRA projects have been decreasing since fiscal year 1999 and are currently $7.3 million for the 2004-05 biennium. There is the possibility that Congress will not provide funds in federal fiscal year 2005 for new, specifically authorized projects, but it is anticipated that the funding for these projects will be available in the coming fiscal years. To provide the neces- sary matching funds for projects associated with the Sabine Pass to San Luis Pass study and any future specifically authorized projects, which in turn could leverage millions in Federal Funds, the state needs a long-term, stable revenue source. STATE REVENUE SOURCE From fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2003, the revenue source for CEPRA projects was a $12.6 million biennial appropriation out of the General Revenue Fund and a $2.4 FIGURE 6 COAST AL EROSION PL ANNING AND RESPONSE ACT (CEPRA) FUNDING CY PROTECTION ACCOUNT NO. 027AMOUNTS APPROPRIA TED (IN MILLIONS) SOURCES : General Land Office and Veterans' Land Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO LEGISLA TIVE BUDGET BO ARD 360MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TEXAS BEACHES million biennial appropriation out of General Revenue- Dedicated Coastal Protection Account No. 027. The Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, appropriated $7.3 million in General Revenue-Dedicated Coastal Protection Account funds and did not appropriate any General Revenue Funds for the 2004-05 biennium based on a proposal from the GLO substituting its General Revenue by General Revenue-Dedicated Coastal Protection Account funds as a means to comply with required budget reductions. The primary revenue stream for the General Revenue-Dedicated Coastal Protection Account is a two- cent-per-barrel fee on crude oil loaded or unloaded in Texas ports. This revenue stream was created primarily to fund oil spill prevention and response efforts ; and according to statute , the General Revenue-Dedicated Coastal Protection Account appropriations for coastal erosion projects should not exceed the annual amount of interest income earned within this account. The GLO estimates the interest earnings to be $1.1 million for the 2004-05 biennium. The current appropriation for the 2004-05 biennium out of this account does not comply with statute. To comply with statute, future appropriations for coastal erosion projects would have to be drastically reduced. These projects would have to be funded out of the General Revenue Fund; statute would have to be amended modifying the interest cap; and/or another dedicated revenue source would have to be identified to fund these projects. The House Committee on Land and Resource Manage- ment was charged to evaluate the need and possible strategies for alternative funding sources for coastal erosion and coastal hazard mitigation and report back to the Seventy-ninth Legislature. The committee held a hearing in August 2004 and has held several meetings since then with stakeholders, government relations staff, and representa- tives from industry to discuss various sources to fund current CEPRA projects and provide the state match for future specifically authorized projects. The following are several options for alternative revenue streams identified in testimony to the committee: ua two-cent assessment on oil and gas produced in coastal communities; ua dockage fee; ua fee on fuels and lubricants on ships; ua fee on cruise ship departures; uan additional surcharge on hotels and motels in coastal areas; and ua fee on real estate transactions in coastal communities.Recommendation 3 suggests that the GLO seek legislation that amends the current statute to modify the interest cap and/or provides another dedicated revenue source to fund current coastal erosion projects and to provide the state match necessary to maximize Federal Funds. Five coastal states have a dedicated source of state revenue that funds beach erosion programs. Florida's program has been successful in drawing down Federal Funds to address beach erosion control due to its implementation of a source of state funding in 1964 to help offset local communities' share of project costs. The State of Florida's Beach Control Program is financed by a documentary stamp tax paid by individuals who record deeds or other instruments transferring interest in real property in the state. Over the past 10 years, 91 beach nourishment projects in Florida have been completed or are underway, involving 51 different local governments. According to the Florida Shore and Beach Preservation Association, funding for Florida beaches during 1992 through 2002 totaled $326 million ($122 million in federal funds, $90 million in local funds, and $114 million in state funds). COASTAL TEXAS 2020 In order to address coastal issues, the GLO has developed \"Coastal Texas 2020,\" an initiative to create a strategic plan, which will lay out strategies to address the environmental and economic challenges facing the Texas coast, provide suggestions for legislative changes, and propose funding mechanisms to address coastal erosion. To facilitate the work of Coastal Texas 2020, the coast has been organized into five regions, with an advisory committee for each region. These regional advisory committees will provide an avenue for input and feedback from all interested parties including recreational and resource user groups, homeowners associations, coastal land owners and develop- ers, non-profit and public policy organizations, chambers of commerce, and convention and visitors bureaus for the Coastal Texas 2020 final report. Lists from the five regional groups will be compiled into one document and then based on cost estimates and project timeframes, the projects will be prioritized, and the data will be included in the final Coastal Texas 2020 report, which will be submitted to the Seventy-ninth Legislature in January 2005. Recommenda- tion 4 suggests that the GLO should utilize the Coastal Texas 2020 report to petition Congress to specifically authorize and fund beach erosion control studies and construction projects in Texas. Texas will continue to face coastal beach erosion due to natural hazards, growing coastal population, increased tourism activity, and land development on the Texas coast. Texas' funding source for Coastal Erosion Planning and Response Program projects is not stable and has beenSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPOR T TO THE 79TH LEGISLA TURE LEGISLA TIVE BUDGET BO ARD 361MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TEXAS BEACHES decreased by more than half. Additional federal funding is needed to address coastal beach erosion. The Corps CAP program and projects specifically authorized by Congress are the primary source of federal funding available to states and local governments for beach nourishment projects. The recommendations proposed in this review suggest that the GLO continue to partner with the Corps through the CAP program and pursue specifically authorized beach erosion control projects according to the findings in the Coastal Texas 2020 report. In order to fund these future studies and projects, it is recommended that the GLO continue to explore alternative revenue streams to fund coastal erosion projects and contribute state matches for maximizing Federal Funds. FISCAL IMP ACT OF THE RECOMMENDA TIONS If needs assessments for specifically authorized Corps projects in the state are completed, Congress authorizes funding for these projects, and funding is available to contribute the required state match, the General Land Office could draw down additional Federal Funds\u2014for example, $10 million to $15 million in Federal Funds for the Sabine Pass to San Luis Pass Project. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill includes a contingency appropriation out of the General Revenue-Dedicated Coastal Protection Account for erosion projects in excess of the interest cap contingent upon the Seventy-ninth Legislature adopting legislation modifying the present cap and revenue to the General Revenue-Dedicated Coastal Protection Account exceeding the Comptroller's revenue estimate.STAFF T TO LEGISLA BUDGET BO ARD 362MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TEXAS BEACHESSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 363ENHANCE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE TEXAS ENTERPRISE FUND The Seventy-eighth Legislature, 2003, capitalized the Texas Enterprise Fund for the 2004-05 biennium, with a $285million appropriation from the Economic StabilizationFund. The statutory purpose of the Texas Enterprise Fundis to promote economic development, job training pro-grams, and business incentives. The fund is a deal-closingprogram intended to make sure that selected economicdevelopment or business projects occur in Texas and not ina competing state. Although the fund is relatively new, the Office of the Governor (which administers the fund on behalf of theGovernor, Lieutenant Governor, and the Speaker of theHouse of Representatives) has established procedures andcontrols for proposal evaluation and contract compliance.Ensuring that all future agreements require the full return of the state's investment would strengthen accountabilityand help to ensure the fund is used to effectively promoteeconomic development and job creation in Texas. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS \u008bThe Texas Enterprise Fund has controls to ensurefund recipients meet their performance targets.However, two agreements awarded in fiscal year2004 could have included stronger provisions tohold recipients accountable for meeting job creationand investment goals. \u008bState law does not require the Office of the Gover-nor to produce a report on the Texas EnterpriseFund's grant allocations, activities, or performance.As a result, the legislatur e and public do not have sufficient information to assess the performance ofthe activities financed by the fund. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: Amend Government Code, Section 481.078, to require that future TexasEnterprise Fund agreements withhold a reasonablepercentage of the overall grant until certain perfor-mance targets are met. \u008bRecommendation 2: Amend Government Code, Section 481.078, to require that all future agree-ments include a provision that ensures the fullreturn of the state's money when major goals, suchas job creation and private investment, are not met by fund recipients.\u008bRecommendation 3: Amend Government Code, Section 481.078, to require that the Governor submit a Texas Enterprise Fund annual report thatidentifies all grant allocations, activities, and granteeperformance. COMMENTS The Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003,created the Texas Enterprise Fund to promote economicdevelopment, job training programs, and business incen-tives. For the 2004-05 biennium, the legislature appropri-ated $285 million from the Economic Stabilization Fund tothe Texas Enterprise Fund, a dedicated account within thestate's General Revenue Fund. The fund is administered bythe Office of the Governor, Economic Development andTourism division. This is a \"deal-closing\" fund, in the sensethat state grants are ne gotiated and awarded to companies and other entities as an incentive to ensure that an eco-nomic development project will take place in Texas.According to the fund's enabling legislation, GovernmentCode, Section 481.078, the Governor is authorized tonegotiate and award grant money appropriated to the fundafter obtaining permission from the Lieutenant Governorand the Speaker of the House of Representatives. As shown in Figure 1, the Governor awarded $205.6 million in Texas Enterprise Fund Grants as of January 3,2005, to 17 economic development projects. These projectsare expected to create a combined total of 22,846 jobs. Thetotal private investment is projected to be about $6.2billion. GRANT AWARD AND MONITORING PROCESS The Economic Development and Tourism division of the Office of the Governor manages the process for determin-ing whether a particular economic development projectshould receive a Texas Enterprise Fund grant. Figure 2shows the overall award pr ocess. If division staff decide that a project may be worthy of a grant from the fund, itperforms a preliminary analysis of the project. After thepotential grantee has submitted an application, a moreformal analysis is performed. Staff evaluates the projectusing various criteria: the ability to develop a Texas-basedindustry that functions effectively in the internationalmarket place, the impact of job creation on the localeconomy, the number of jobs created, the level of privateinvestment, the level of ca pital improvements, the level ofSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 364ENHANCE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE TEXAS ENTERPRISE FUND Baylor College of Medicine-Bovine Agriculture Houston $2.0 million N/A $51.0 Gene Sequencing of million 1,000 billion UT Dallas 3,000 million Sematech High-tech Consortium Austin $40.0 million 4,000 $190.0 million Texas Energy Center Energy Clust er Sugarland $3.6 million 1,500 $20.0 million Home Depot Austin/ $8.5 million 843 $809.0 million New Braunfels UT MD Anderson Biomedical Houston $25.0 million 2,252 $55.0 million Maxim Integrated Products Semi-Conductor San Antonio $1.5 million 500 $90.0 million Citgo Petroleum Oil Refinery Houston/ $5.0 million 820 $828.0 million Corpus Christi Cabela's Sporting Goods Fort Worth & $600,000 600 $70.0 million Buda Koyo Steering Systems Manufacturing Ennis $333,000 200 $30.0 million Auto Parts Superior Essex Communication Telecommunications Brownwood $250,000 50 $7.6 million LEARN million 326 Port Neches Lee Container Manufacturing Nacogdoches $300,000 105 $5.6 million Countrywide Financial Corporation Financial Services Richardson $20.0 million 7,500 $200.0 million BP Chemical Petrochemicals League City $750,000 150 $5.7 million Totals $205.6 million 22,846 $6.2 billionFIGURE 1 TEXAS ENTERPRISE FUND GRANT ALLOCATIONS AND GOALS AS OF JANUARY 3, 2005 COMPANYBUSINESS SECTOR LOCATIONENTERPRISE FUND GRANTDIRECT JOB CREATION GOALPRIVATE INVESTMENT GOAL SOURCE : Office of the Governor.

In addition, the division performs a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether state and local tax revenueover the life of the grant agreement is greater than thegrant amount itself. The Governor's office staff presents information and recommendations regarding a proposed TEF project to the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Speaker of the Houseof Representatives. T hese three officials decide which applicants will receive TEF awards, the amount of theawards, and the terms of each award agreement. During negotiations with the a pplicant, staff develops a grant agreement that def ines performance targets and penalties for non-attainment of these targets. Performancetargets include the projected number of jobs created andthe level of investment that must be attained within aspecific time period. Specific penalties f or failure to achieve these targets are also stipulated in the agreement. After a decision to grant an award has been announced and an agreement between the state and the grantee has beensigned, the Office of the Governor monitors the grantrecipient's compliance with the agreement. The Governor'soffice staff periodically verifies that the grantee is spendingstate funds appropriately and is reaching the targets and goals stipulated in the agreement. Contract monitoringincludes both site visits and review of certain financialdocuments, such as invoices for purchasing capital goodsthat contribute to the de velopment of the project. COMPARISON OF MAJOR STATE DEAL-CLOSING FUNDS According to a fifty-state survey of deal-closing funds performed by the Texas Legislative Council in March, 2004,Texas is among eight states that have created deal-closingfunds financed with state appropriations: Florida, Georgia,Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas,and Virginia. One state, Georgia, uses tobacco settlementproceeds to finance its fund, whil e the others receive General Fund appropriations for this purpose. One statelegislature, Maryland, did not appropriate money to its fundin 2004. Distinguishing characteristics of these deal-closing funds include the following: \u008bThere is competition with another state for theproject; \u008bGrants are awarded to businesses, local governmentsor development authorities, or public institutionssuch as universities; and \u008bGrants are used to finance a variety of projects,including facility development, project infrastruc-ture, research, or other technology development projects. Figure 3 provides information about the five state deal- closing funds with the grea test appropria tions: Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. PERFORMANCE/EXPENDITURE MONITORING AND VERIFICATION OF GOALS Under the performance evaluation systems in the five states, grant recipients must file annual or semi-annualreports indicating progress to wards major goals such as creating jobs and achieving projected investment levels.North Carolina verifies job creation data from grantrecipients reports by accessing data from the state's employment agency. Other states require recipients tocertify the accuracy of information through signedaffidavits. In addition to using a compliance system, the Texas Governor's office also requires recipients to maintainsegregated accounting records and documentation associ-ated with grant funds, and submit annual complianceverification reports and/or year-end audited financialstatements. JOB CREATION TIMEFRAME REQUIREMENTS The four major state deal-closing funds outside of Texas generally require companies to reach their job creation targets within three years or less. Georgia's Economic,Development, Growth, and Expansion (EDGE) Fundrecipients are usually requir ed through negotiations to produce a certain number of jobs within twelve months,while North Carolina generally requires recipients to meet their job creation targets within thr ee years. The Pennsylva- nia fund sometimes allows large stable companies up tofive years to reach their job creation targets. The Texas Governor's office bases its job creation timeframe requirements on a variety of factors, including the stability of the company and the specific development aspects of the project. Timeframe requirements for existingprojects vary from the target to create 1,500 jobs withinfour years by the Texas Energy Center, a start-up project awarded a $3.6 million grant, to a target to create 14,000indirect jobs within ten years by the Sematech high- technology consortium that was awarded $40 million. Flexibility in establishing the appropriate time period for compliance with Texas' job creation targets allows thegovernor's office to match the goal to the specifics of theproject. However, long time periods with no interveningjob creation milestone to gauge performance and address potential problems are a concern. Recommendation 1 would amend state law to require future agreements towithhold a reasonable percentage of the overall grant until certain performance targets are met.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 366ENHANCE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE TEXAS ENTERPRISE FUND EDGE Fund (Economic Development, Growth, and Expansion)Fund Name One North Carolina FundOpportunity Grant ProgramTexas Enterprise FundGovernor's Opportunity Fund (GOF) Administrating AgencyOne Georgia Authority Dept. of Commerce Dept. of Community and Economic DevelopmentOffice of the Governor, EconomicDevelopment and TourismVirginia Economic Development Partnership Fund Created 2000 1993 2003 1993 Funding $20 million annual $25 million annual $50 million annual $285 million biennial$12 million annual Published Guidelines or Internal Guidelines (notpublic)Public Guidelines- Administrative RulesPublic Guidelines, not Administrative RulesPublic Guidelines Internal Guidelines Internal Guidelines Content of PublicGuidelinesFund purpose, eligible recipients; eligible uses ofgrant; review of applica- tions, awarding of funds, statement of fundingconditionsFund purpose, eligible recipients; eligible uses ofgrant; procedures for commitment, award, disbursement of funds,recipient reporting requirements, review procedure; award criteria;contract terms; disburse- ment evaluationcriteria.Not applicable Not applicable Project Review PolicyUse a cost-benefit analysis, taking intoaccount state & local tax revenue as benefit; community support; jobcreation, private investment; wage levels of new jobs, economiccondition of community (economically disadvan- taged sites receive priorityranking), and other factors.Use a cost-benefit analysis only for grants over $1million, taking into account state tax revenue only; must meet minimumjob creation and private investment levels that vary depending on locality'spopulation; wage levels of new jobs, economic condition of locality (fiscalstress of locality reduces local match requirement), and other factors.Proposal evaluation takes into account jobcreation and private investment targets; wage levels of new jobs,economic condition of locality, and other factors.Use a cost-benefit analysis, taking intoaccount state & local tax revenue as benefit; communitysupport; job creation, private investment; wage levels of newjobs, and other factors.Use a cost-benefit analysis, taking into account statetax revenue only; must meet minimum job creation and privateinvestment levels that vary depending on locality's population; wage levels ofnew jobs, economic condition of locality (fiscal stress of locality reduceslocal match requirement), and other factors.

PENALTIES FOR NOT ATTAINING GOALS All five states identified in Figure 3 require a penalty, alsoknown as a \"clawback,\" for grant recipients who do notreach the major goals of the grant agreement. NorthCarolina requires localities to include penalties for non-attainment of job creation targets and other major commit-ments. Pennsylvania guidelines indicate a penalty of up to110 percent of the full grant amount for not operating at the project site for five years, or failure to create or retain the promised number of jobs or the promised level ofprivate investment.

Recommendation 2 would require all future agreements to provide for full recovery of grant awards, plus anyadditional penalties the Office of the Governor deemsappropriate. PUBLIC REPORTS ON FUND ACTIVITIES Only one of the four surveyed states has legal require- ments for reports to document the use of grant money\u2014North Carolina. North Carolina's governor is required tofile a report on the One North Carolina Fund quarterly tothe Joint Legislative Commission on GovernmentalOperations. The legislation creating the Texas Enterprise Fund, House Bill 7, Seventy-eighth Legislature, Regular Session, 2003,did not include any requirement for a report on the fundsactivities or performance. Recommendation 3 proposes toamend state law to require an annual report that would inform the legisla ture and the public about Texas Enter- prise Fund operations, allocations, number of projectedand actual jobs created, and projected and actual privateinvestment leveraged by the fund. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Actual performance or the results achieved by the entities awarded Texas Enterprise Fund grants cannot be reportedyet because the fund only began operations in September2003 and disbursed its first grant in March 2004. How-ever, the Office of the Governor has established a systemfor evaluating, neg otiating, and monitoring its grant proposals and agreements. Implementing the recommen-dations would provide stronger accountability for itsperformance. It is assumed that the Office of theGovernor could implement these recommendations usingavailable resources. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill does not change the fiscal impact of the recommendations.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 369IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING BY THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION The size of the budget of the Texas Department of Transportation coupled with the significant new financialauthority granted to the agency during the Seventy-eighthLegislative Session argue for improvements to the agency'sfinancial reporting methods. Improvements are in order inthree particular areas: (1) documentation of the cause andeffect of current and anticipated fluctuations in the cashbalance of the State Highway Fund, (2) notification ofadditional State Highway Fund receipts above thoseestimated in the General Appropriations Act, and(3) disclosure of capital budget projects for transportationitems and acquisition of capital equipment and items. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS \u008bThe State Auditor's Office has recommended improvements to the Texas Department ofTransportation's current cash forecasting system toimprove the accuracy of the forecasts and thepresentation of this information to the legislatureand the general public. \u008bIn fiscal year 2004, the Texas Department ofTransportation expects that $687.7 million more willbe available in the State Highway Fund than wasestimated in the 2004-05 General AppropriationsAct. \u008bThe Texas Department of capitalbudget for the 2004-05 biennium is more than $105million per year and is broken into only six generalcategories in the General Appropriations Act, withinwhich the agency reports 79 separate projects. Atpresent, the agency can transfer funds among theseprojects without notifying the Legislative BudgetBoard and the governor. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bIf improvements in the Texas Department ofTransportation's financial reporting are not made,the existence of significant and valuable resources may not be known to the legislature at times whencritical budget decisions are made. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: The Texas Department of Transportation's rider entitled, \"Reporting Require-ments,\" in the 2004-05 General Appropriations Actshould be amended in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill to r equire detailed information in the monthly cash forecast of the State HighwayFund on the cause and effects of current andanticipated fluctuations in the cash balance. Therider should also require expenditure information tobe reported at the same level as the agency'sappropriation bill pattern strategies. \u008bRecommendation 2: A rider should be included in the 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill requiringthe Texas Department of Transportation to notifythe Legislative Budget Board and the Governor ofadditional State Highway Fund receipts above thoseestimated for the 2006-07 biennium. The ridershould require the agency to wait before expendingthe funds, giving either office a chance to deny useof the funds or specify an alternate use. \u008bRecommendation 3: The capital budget rider for the Texas Department of Transportation in the2006-07 General Appropriations Bill should beamended to include a list of all projects with at leasta $2 million appropriation in one year under theheading, \"Acquisition of Capital Equipment andItems.\" In addition, provide additional detail underthe heading, \"Transportation Items.\" COMMENTS The vast majority of the Texas Department ofTransportation's (TxDOT) expenditures are from constitu-tionally dedicated revenue sour ces, both state and federal. However, the agency also has appropriations from thestate's General Revenue Fund, from a General Revenue-Dedicated account, and several other sources. All of thesefund sources are subject to the state's biennial appropria-tion process. Discussing TxDOT's appropriation in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee on May 12, 2004, theagency's executive director noted that the legislature has given the agency \"an unprecedented array of tools toaddress the growing demand and monetary constraintsinherent in today's fiscal reality .\" The following are among those tools: \u008bthe Texas Mobility Fund, which is a revolving fundthat will be used to provide a method of financingfor the state highway system; andSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 370IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING BY THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION \u008bthe Highway Tax and Revenue Anticipation Note Fund, which will hold proceeds from the sale ofnotes issued to make up temporary shortfalls in theState Highway Fund. In September 2003, Texas v oters approved a constitutional amendment to allow the legislature to authorize TxDOT toissue notes or borrow money from any source to carry out its functions. The borrowing is limited to a period of twoyears and was intended to give the agency flexibility to dealwith short-term cash flow problems. The legislationauthorizing this activity limits the borrowing to amountsthat do not exceed the average monthly revenue deposits tothe State Highway Fund for the previous 12 months. As aresult of the same amendment, TxDOT was given author-ity to issue bonds to pay for highway improvement projects. Implementing legislation limited those issuances to $1billion per year and capped total issuances at $3 billion.These new authorities represent significant additionalfinancial resources for TxDOT to finance its operations;and, as a result, the need for accurate and useful financialreporting on the fiscal health of the State Highway Fund isincreased in proportion. STATE HIGHWAY FUND CASH BALANCES Recommendation 1 would ame nd TxDOT's \"Repor ting Requirements\" rider contained in the 2004-05 General Appropriations Act (GAA). This rider requires the agencyto submit a monthly revenue report to the LegislativeBudget Board (LBB) and the Governor on state andfederal funds received in the State Highway Fund.TxDOT issues a monthly Cash Forecast of the StateHighway Fund No. 006 to meet this requirement. Thereport provides information about the fund's revenuesand expenditures, although expenditures are summarizedand are not reported at the level of TxDOT's appropria-tion bill pattern strategies. A March 2003 audit by the State Auditor's Office (SAO) (Report Number 03-021) recommended several improve-ments to TxDOT's current cash forecasting system toimprove both the accuracy of the forecasts and thepresentation of this information to the legislature and thegeneral public. Since TxDOT's construction and mainte-nance planning process relies on the cash forecast, theseimprovements would also help maximize funds availablefor transportation projects. Following are the SAO's findings: \u008bTxDOT does not formally document its forecast- ing method to estimate future cash balances in theState Highway Fund. This increases the risk thatforecasts will be inconsistent over time and thatTxDOT may utilize incorrect methodologies whenpreparing the forecast.\u008bTxDOT does not formally document adjustmentsmade to data used to forecast cash balances. Thismakes it difficult to determine whether the adjust-ments are appropriate or adequate. \u008bTxDOT has improved the format of the monthlycash forecast by including additional information,such as a reconciliation of the cash balances andinformation contained in the Uniform StatewideAccounting System. However, SAO recommendedthat information be included in the cash forecastthat allows readers to understand the cause andeffects of current and anticipated fluctuations in thecash balance. TxDOT generally agreed with these findings and commit- ted to making improvements suggested in the SAO report.As a result of the recommendation about format, TxDOTadded a small narrative text box to its summary chart ofthe cash forecast. However, it only allows for one general statement about past trends and one statement about futuretrends. Specific information about large construction ormaintenance projects is not provided in detail, nor isdetailed information about flu ctuations in funding patterns. For example, TxDOT has r ecently started using a new reimbursement method known as \"tapered match\" on projects they jointly fund with the federal government. TxDOT is now allowed to expen d the federal share of a project's funding first and then spend the state portion nearthe end of the project, w hich has a significant impact on the cash balance. However, detail on how much this willaffect the balance over time, or in what amount, is notcurrently provided in the forecast. Another concern about the presentation of financial reporting for the State Highway Fund in the monthly cashforecast is that not enough information is presented aboutthe expenditure assumptions used to prepare the forecast.Since expenditure information is presented in a summarymanner, it is not possible to discern which of TxDOT's 18appropriation strategies are affected by increases anddecreases in projected spending. Including this level ofdetail would allow readers of the forecast to betterunderstand TxDOT's assumptions and relate them tospecific spending patterns over time. Recommendation 1 would amend the \"Reporting Require- ments\" rider in the 2004-05 General Appropriations Act torequire improved reporting on these two points: Reporting R equir ements .

In addition, the monthly cash forecast shall report expenditur e information a t the same le vel as the Texas De partment of Transpor tation's appro- priation bill pa ttern strategies. ESTIMATING STATE HIGHWAY FUND RECEIPTS TxDOT's appropriation in the GAA includes an estimation of the expenditures that will be made for its highwayconstruction activities. This fea ture is included so that if revenues become available for this strategy\u2014above the $2.8billion already appropriated each year\u2014the agency couldexpend those funds in a timely manner. According toTxDOT, $687.7 million in additional State Highway Fundrevenues are estimated to be available for expenditure in2004 using this authority. TxDOT believes this appropria-tion authority is critical. In particular, TxDOT argues that itavoids a situation in which additional funds are availablebut cannot be spent because the year's appropriation forhighway construction and maintenance activities hasalready been exhausted. In general, an agency's authority to transfer appropriations from one strategy to another is limited to 25 percent of thefunds appropriated to the item fr om which the transfer is made (Section 6.08 of Article IX of the 2004-05 GAA).However, Rider No. 2 of TxDOT's bill pattern allows theagency to transfer as much money as it deems necessary between its contracted maintenance, right-of-way acquisi-tion, and highway construction strategies. TxDOT is generally prohibited from mo ving money from any of these strategies into its other 15 strategies. (The oneexception to this rule allows TxDOT to transfer an amountinto its plan/design/manage strategy so long as it does notexceed 10 percent of that strat egy. This transfer requires approval from the LBB and the governor.) In this way, therider and the estimated appropriation feature work togetherto allow TxDOT to expend money that it receives above what was originally estimated, but only for contracted maintenance, right-of-way acquisition, and highwayconstruction. According to TxDOT's 2006-07 Legislative Appropriations Request, an additional $391.3 million in Federal Funds wasmade available to the agency in 2003. This money wasappropriated to the agency in accordance with Article IX,Section 8.02, Federal Funds/Block Grants, of the 2002-03GAA. The agency expects to use the same authority in2004 to make an additional $382.8 million available forexpenditure. In the 2004-05 biennium, other agencies arerequired to notify the LBB and the governor of the receiptof the funds, provide a written plan outlining the use ofthe funds, and wait 14 da ys before expending these funds in order to allow either of the tw o offices to disapprove the use of the funds. In contrast to this requirement, TxDOT's Rider No. 35 does not provide the LBB or the Governor the opportunityto amend TxDOT's planned use of funds. Recommenda-tion 2 would include a rider in the 2006-07 GeneralAppropriations Bill that would alert the legislature of theavailability of additional funds and would provide anapproval process for the use of funds. Additional Funds. Except during an emergency as defined by the Governor, no appropriation ofadditional State Highway Funds may be expended bythe Texas Department of Transportation unless: a. the Texas Department of Transportation submits a separate report within forty-five (45)days of the end of the second quarter of eachfiscal year to the Legislative Budget Board andthe Governor outlining any additional fundsavailable above amounts estimated for the2006-07 biennium, their anticipated uses andprojected impacts; and b. the Legislative Budg et Board and the Governor issue a written approval or specify an alternateuse for the additional funds.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 372IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING BY THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CAPITAL BUDGET INFORMATION AVAILABILITY The GAA currently includes limited information about TxDOT's capital budget projects. Since TxDOT's capitalbudget is estimated at $211.3 million for the 2004-05biennium, additional detail would lead to greater account-ability and allow increased oversight. The GAA lists sixcategories within which TxDOT is limited to transferringcapital budget funds during the biennium: \u008bacquisition of land and other real property; \u008bconstruction of buildings and facilities; \u008brepair or rehabilitation of and facilities; \u008bacquisition of information resource technologies; \u008btransportation items; and \u008bacquisition of capital equipment and items. The average appropriation for each of the six categories is $17.6 million per year. Agencies are generally given authority in the 2004-05 GAA to move up to 25 percent of a particular capital budgetitem's appropriation to another capital budget item withoutnotifying the LBB or the governor. This authority is limitedso that the capital budget project receiving the additional funding may not increase by more than 25 percent of its appropriation. However, rider language in the 2004-05GAA does not allow TxDOT to transfer additionalappropriated funds to capital budget items without priorapproval of the LBB or the governor. TxDOT does report more detailed information to the LBB for its capital budget than what is included in the GAA. Forexample, the agency reports that 79 ongoing and futureprojects will be funded within the six categories. While theaverage appropriation for each project is $1.3 million peryear, some individual projects have an appropriation as highas $15.9 million in one year. Within the acquisition ofcapital equipment and items category, the agency reports 35projects. These include the acquisition of particular typesof equipment used by the agency in highway maintenanceand construction, such as dump trucks, motor graders,loaders, and asphalt maintenance equipment. The GAA could include more details for capital budget projects exceeding certain dollar thresholds. Besidesproviding more information about these projects, including more detail would limit the amounts of funds TxDOTcould transfer among projects. For example, if projects with at least $2 million in expendi- tures in at least one year of the biennium were listed in theGAA, 29 entries would be included in TxDOT's 2004-05capital budget. This would include one \"roll-up\" entry ineach category that represents the costs for all projects in the category under $2 million. The average appropriation for each of these entries would be $3.6 million. Approximately 45 percent of TxDOT's entire $100 million annual capital budget can be traced to the final category,acquisition of capital equipment and items. Applying the $2million threshold methodology used above just to this lastcategory, and outlining transportation items and lea ving all projects in the first four cate gories \"rolled-up,\" would mean that 16 entries would appear in TxDOT's bill pattern.Recommendation 3 would include detail in the capital budgetrider to look like this: 2004 2005 a. Acquisition of Land and $1,350,000 $2,845,000 Other Real Property b. Construction of Buildings and $5,170,330 $9,428,501 Facilities c.

No other adjustments to the bill have been made.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 374IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING BY THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATIONSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 375REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO SHARE HALF THE COST OF SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FUND JOB TRAINING The Skills Development Fund was created by the Seventy- fourth Legislature, Regular Session, 1995, to providecustomized job training to Texas employers. According tothe Texas Workforce Commission, employers see the fundas a way of improving the productivity of their workforce.The job training grants from the fund flow to communitycolleges, which allows these colleges to become integral parts of their communities by working with local busi-nesses. For the 2004-05 biennium, the legislatur e appropri- ated the Texas Workforce Commission $25 million inGeneral Revenue Funds to operate the Skills DevelopmentFund job training program. Although this program does not require employers to share the cost of job training, many other states expect them tomake a contribution\u2014either in-kind or with cash. Requir-ing a cash contribution would give employers a greaterstake in the outcome of job training and improve theprogram's cost-effectiveness by creating a public-privatecost-sharing arrangement. Requiring a 50 percent matchwould save $12.5 million in General Revenue Funds for the2006-07 biennium compared to 2004-05 appropriations. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bEmployers benefiting from the state-subsidizedSkills Development Fund job training program arenot expected to share the cost of this training.However, 14 out of 20 states providing some of thelargest state appropriations for job training require employers to share a portion of the cost. Twelve of these states require employers to share half or more of the job training cost, either with cash or in-kindcontributions. RECOMMENDATION \u008bAmend the Texas Labor Code to require all employ-ers benefiting from Skills Development Fund jobtraining to pay for 50 percent of the cost of thisservice in cash. Employers would remit the requiredcash payment to the local community college, whichacts as the fiscal agent for funds from the state. COMMENTS The Skills Development Fund (SDF) finances customizedjob training for businesses that partner with a communitycollege to design programs for the creation of new jobs orto enhance the skills of current employees. The SDF was created by the Seventy-four th Legislature, Regular Session, 1995, as part of House Bill 1863, the legislation thatcreated the Texas Workforce Commission. The disbursement and management of SDF grants are based on the following process. Pa rtnerships are formed between a community college and one business or aconsortium of two or more businesses from variousindustry clusters. The community college alerts the localWorkforce Development Board of the grant proposal andthen forwards the proposal to the Texas WorkforceCommission (TWC). Once received, reviewed, andapproved, grants are awarded, and contracts are written.The TWC then enters into a contract with the college.Under the contract, the college must serve as the fiscal agent, administer the contract, and submit periodicfinancial and performance reports to the agency. For the 2004-05 biennium, the le gislature a ppropriated $25.0 million to the Texas Workforce Commission tofinance the SDF grant program. The volume of requestsfor training funds typically exceeds appropriations. In fiscal year 2003, the agency received requests from businessestotaling over $50.9 million. The agency's legislative appro-priation request for the 2006-07 biennium includes $25.0million based on 2004-05 appropriations plus an excep-tional item request for $25.0 million in General RevenueFunds and one for $9.3 million in Other Funds. Thebudget recommendation appropriates $20.7 million for thisprogram for the 2006-07 biennium, which is a reduction of$4.3 million from 2004-05 appropriations. EMPLOYER MATCHING The 20 states surveyed were chosen based on a March 2003 Texas Legislative Council survey. Since Texas provides oneof the largest appropriations for this type of job training program, the states with the larger appropriations werechosen to survey for a better comparison. As indicated byFigure 1, of the 20 states tha t appropriate the greatest funding to their job training programs, 14 require employ-ers to share the cost of such training with either an in-kindor cash contribution. Cost-sharing requirements range from25 percent for Iowa to 75 percent for Arizona. The typical payment arrangement among 12 of these states is for theemployer to pay for training costs up front and then obtainreimbursement from the state for actual costs.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 376REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO SHARE HALF THE COST OF SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FUND JOB TRAINING Alaska State Training $5.6 Million Unemployment No N/A Yes and Employment Program Insurance tax Arizona Job Training $7 Million Complementary tax to Yes\u201450-75% Cash or In-kind Yes Program unemployment (50% for existing workers; insurance tax 75% for new hires) California $27.6 Million Complementary tax Yes\u201450% Cash or In-kind Yes; payment begins 90 Employment Training to unemployment days after training Panel insurance tax completed Georgia Quick $14 Million General Fund No N/A No; costs are generally Start Program not incurred by employers Illinois $14.8 Million General Fund Yes\u2014 50% Cash 50% in advance, 50% Employment Training upon completion Investment Program Indiana Skills $16 Million General Fund Yes\u201450% Cash or In-kind Yes; paid in quarterly Enhancement Fund (SEF) installments Iowa Industrial New $28.2 Million Bonds No N/A Jobs Training (260E) Iowa Jobs Training $4 Million Bonds Yes\u201425% Cash Program (260F) Kansas Industrial $3.2 Million Lottery fund Yes\u201450% Cash Yes Retraining Program (KIR) (Shares funds with KIT) Kansas Industrial $3.2 Million Lottery fund No N/A Yes Training Program (KIT) (Shares funds with KIR) Kansas Investments in $11.2 Million Bonds No N/A No Major Projects and Comprehensive Training (IMPACT) Louisiana Incumbent $50 Million Portion of No N/A Yes Worker Training Program unemployment insurance tax Massachusetts $21 Million Complementary tax Yes\u201450% Cash or In-kind 25% in advance; Workforce Training Fund to unemployment 50% in intervals during insurance tax training; 25% upon final report Michigan Economic $10 Million General Fund Yes\u201430% Cash or In-kind Yes Development Job Training (Employer contribution 30% for existing workers;0% for new hires) Mississippi Workforce $18 Million General Fund Negotiated but N/A Yes Education Program generally no Missouri Customized $8.5 Million General Fund Yes\u201450% (Though Cash or In-kind Yes Job Training Program 50% match required, average award is$50,000) Missouri Job Estimated to be Bonds Yes Cash No Training Retention funded atProgram (starts 7/1/05) $6 Million for the FY 2005-06FIGURE 1 COMPARISON OF KEY INFORMATION ON 20 STATES WITH THE HIGHEST FUNDING FOR JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS STATE PROGRAM2005 FUNDING (IN MILLIONS) FUNDING SOURCEEMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONTYPE OF CONTRIBUTIONCOSTS REIMBURSED DURING OR AFTER TRAINING PERFORMED?

SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board; Agencies in other states as listed.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 378REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO SHARE HALF THE COST OF SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FUND JOB TRAINING Twelve states (or 60 percent of those states surveyed) require employers to share half or more of the job trainingcosts through cash or in-kind contributions. Given thistrend, requiring a 50 per cent contribution from employers is appropriate. In-kind cost sharing typically involvesproviding training facilities and/or compensation duringtraining. Of these 12 states, 4 states require a 50 percent contribution payable in cash only. These four states cite two reasons to justify employer matching. First, it allows companies to show good faiththrough a tangible investment in the state's workforce.Second, a direct contribution mak es these programs more efficient through public-private cost sharing. The Skills Development Fund does not, however, require employers to share the cost of job training. Employersmay provide in-kind matching, which usually takes theform of compensation for new or current employeesduring their training period, and/or the provision of job- training facilities. In f iscal year 2004, 38 of the 165 employers that benefited from SDF-financed training didnot provide a contribution for this service. The list of companies benefiting from SDF training in fiscal year 2004 includes large, well-established firms that could afford to share job training costs with the state.Twenty-six companies are listed on the Russell 1000, anequity index of 1,000 highly capitalized corporations; 26companies are listed on the Forbes 2000, an inventory ofthe 2,000 largest U.S. corporations; and nine companies arelisted on the comptroller's \"Texas 100,\" consisting of the100 largest publicly traded employers in the state (deter- mined by their average number of workers). Thirty-onepercent of the companies receiving SDF grants have 500 ormore employees. The recommendation addresses this concern by proposing to amend the Texas Labor Code to require all employersbenefiting from Skills Development Fund job training toprovide 50 percent of the cost of this training in cash.Exceptions or waivers to the matching requirement couldbe made for small businesses. In the instances where anemployer provides the training rather than the communitycollege, employe rs should finance the training up front and then obtain reimbursement from the state for actualcosts. Ad ding this r equirement w ould give employers a greater stake in the outcome of the training, and it wouldimprove the cost-effectiveness of the program. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATION Implementing the recommendation of requiring an employer match of 50 percent would result in an esti-mated savings of $12.5 million in General Revenue Fundscompared to 2004-05 appropriations. The recommenda- tion would have no impact on General Revenue-DedicatedFunds during the 2006-07 biennium. The introduced 2006-07 General Appropriations Bill appropriates $20.7 million of General Revenue Funds forthe Skills Development Fund. T herefore, the additional savings from implementing this recommendation is $10.3million in General Revenue Funds for the 2006-07biennium.FIGURE 2 REQUIRE 50 PERCENT COST SHARINGFIVE YEAR FISCAL IMPACT 2006 $6,250,000 2007 $6,250,0002008 $6,250,000 2009 $6,250,000 2010 $6,250,000FISCAL YEARPROBABLE SAVINGS/(COST) TO GENERAL REVENUE FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 379USE ADDITIONAL DONATED FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR CHILD-CARE SERVICES Federal laws allow states to use privately donated funds as state match for federally supported child-care programs.Donated funds are not required to be transferred to the state. Instead, donating entities can certify eligible expendi-tures to the state and federal government, and the state canreport these expenditures as its matc h for federal programs. The Texas Workforce Commission is the primary state agency responsible for making sure that families eligible forchild-care assistance receive it though various providers. Texas already uses donated funds certified by the TexasWorkforce Commission and identified through localworkforce boards as match for the federal Child Care andDevelopment Fund. However, the Texas WorkforceCommission could use additional private funds certified byother non-state entities as a state match for Federal Funds.For example, the Texas Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubsreports that its 275 clubs spent approximately $46.4 millionin calendar year 2003 for child-care programs. Of this, the alliance estimates that at least $11.9 million was spent onchildren who meet eligibility requirements of the ChildCare and Development Fund. By using additional donated funds towa rds federal match- ing requirement, the Texas Workforce Commission'sGeneral Revenue Fund appropriation for the 2006-07biennium could be reduced up to $15.7 million. The agencycould also draw down an additional $17.1 million ofavailable Federal Funds. SIGNIFICANT CONCERN \u008bTexas is one of 13 states that already use donated funds as match for accessing federal Child Care andDevelopment Funds. Some states use more sourcesof donated funds, and Texas could use additionaldonated funds to maximize federal assistance forchild-care. RECOMMENDATIONS \u008bRecommendation 1: The Texas Workforce Commission should determine whether enteringinto an agreement with a private entity, such as theTexas Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubs, to usecertified private funds on terms acceptable to bothparties complies with all federal and state regula-tions governing the use of privately donated fundsas state match for federally supported child-careprograms. The Texas Workforce Commissionshould report the results of its research to the legislature and the Legislative Budget Board byFebruary 11, 2005. \u008bRecommendation 2: Contingent on the outcome of the determination made by the Texas WorkforceCommission, the Texas Workforce Commissionshould enter into an agreement with the entity orentities selected to provide additional donated funds,which the state could then use as a portion of thestate match requirements for the federal Child Care and Development Fund. \u008bRecommendation 3: If at least $23.8 million in certified private funds is available, reduce the TexasWorkforce Commission's General Revenue Fundappropriations used to match Federal Funds forchild-care by $15.7 million from 2004-05 appropria-tion levels in the 2006-07 General AppropriationsBill, and direct the Texas Workforce Commission touse the donated funds to access Federal Funds. COMMENTS The federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)regulations allow states to use certified donated funds tomeet state matching and maintenance of effort (MOE)requirements. CCDF is the primary source of Federal Funds for child- care services for low-income families. CCDF consists ofthree sources of federal funds: mandatory funds, discre- tionary funds, and matching funds. Mandatory anddiscretionary funds have no matching requirements, whilefederal matching funds are available at the Federal MedicalAssistance Percentage (FMAP). In fiscal year 2006, the FMAP for Texas is 60.68 percent. States can leverageallowable expenditures for c hild care with federal matching funds at the FMAP rate. Allowa ble state expenditures may include local and public funds, private donations, orcertified private funds. Figure 1 shows federal requirements for use of public and donated private funds. To receive matching funds, the state must obligate manda- tory funds by the end of the fiscal year and expend itsrequired MOE. The state's MOE has to be at least equal tothe amount of the state's share of expenditures for fiscal year 1994 or 1995, whichever was greater. Each state has aSTAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 380USE ADDITIONAL DONATED FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR CHILD-CARE SERVICES defined MOE amount, and for Texas it is $34.7 million each year. Texas uses pr e-kindergarten expenditures made by the Texas Education Agency for 20 percent of therequired state MOE amount. CHILD-CARE PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE TEXAS WORKFORCE COMMISSION The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), the lead agency for the CCDF, funds child-care services provided toparents who meet local workforce development boards'(local boards) eligibility requirements for CCDF. Fundingof child care, after school, and summer programs enableslow-income parents and parents receiving TemporaryAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) to work or toparticipate in the education or training programs they needin order to work. TWC does not directly contract with child-care facilities. Instead, TWC contracts with 28 localboards, which ar e responsible for planning, overseeing, and evaluating the delivery of all workforce training and services, including child-care services. TWC allocates child-care funding Child-care, FamiliesWorking or Training for Work (Transitional child-care), andAt-Risk for Working or Training forWork TANF Choices Child-carefunding is provided to the recipients, who oftenneed child-care services to fulfill federal requirementsregarding work participation. When TANF participantsbecome employed, they can still receive child-care assis-tance for 12 months through Transitional child-care funding. Child-care services are provided through At-Riskchild-care funding to low-income working families thatreceive little or no public assistance. In the 2004-05 biennium, TWC budgeted $139.8 million in General Revenue Funds for child-care services, whichdraws $268.2 million in Federal Funds for child care. Inaddition, TWC relies on local boards to come up withlocal funds to use as match to leverage Federal Funds.Local match can be in the form of cash donations;however, 90 percent of local funds are in the form ofcertified donated funds. Dependence on local match has increased in the last several years. In fiscal year 2003, local match was $13 million, andit increased to $19.6 million in fiscal year 2004. If localboards were unable to identify local match, the TWC wouldnot be able to draw down Federal Funds. OTHER STATES' EXPERIENCE Federal law allows states to designate a single entity, state or non-state, to receive donated funds. The law specifies thatdonated funds from private entities do not have to betransferred to the state. Instead, the designated entity cancertify that the expenditures took place for children that metcriteria established in federal regu lations. States develop their own methodologies for this certification process. Several states have already established partnerships with private, non-profit organizations to certify private funds formatching purposes. This is a new approach, and not all states know how to implement it. In fiscal years 2002 and2003, only five states, including Texas, were using donatedfunds to assist with matching dollars. In fiscal years 2004and 2005, 13 states indicated their use of donated funds.For example, Nevada and Mississippi have designated non-state entities to receive donated funds. Mississippi has designated Barksdale Reading Institute, which is a privatelyfunded non-profit foundation, to r eceive privately donated funds for CCDF match. A portion of funds expended bythe institute for child-care ser vices is utilized for CCDF match. Nevada has designated the Alliance of Boys andGirls Clubs to receive private funds. Even though thealliance certifies funds without receiving assurance that itwill receive child-care funds from the state, Nevadaestablished separate contracts with the Boys and GirlsClubs for child-care services. USE OF DONATED FUNDS FOR MATCHING PURPOSES Texas is one of a few states that have already been using private donations for matching purposes. Texas hasestablished a slightly different approach than other states. Instead of designating a separate entity, TWC designatedFIGURE 1 FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FORPUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDS Public FundsPublic FundsPublic FundsPublic FundsPublic Funds expended for child-care may be claimed as state expenditures when funds are: \u008bAppropriated directly to or transferred from another public agency to the lead agency, or certified by the contributing public agency as representing expenditures eligible for Federal match; \u008bNot used to match other Federal Funds; \u008bNot Federal Funds, or are authorized by federal law to be used tomatch other Federal Funds.

In addition toexisting contracts with 28 local boards, TWC could enterinto agreements with additional non-state entities, such asthe Texas Alliance for Boys and Girls Clubs, to expand theuse of the donated funds. Figure 2 provides informationabout the alliance's programs. The alliance estimates that its 275 Texas Boys and Girls clubs could certify at minimum $11.9 million annually inCCDF-eligible expenditures that could be used formatching purposes or CCDF MOE. In each year of the 2004-05 biennium, TWC is appropri- ated $42.1 million in General Revenue Funds for CCDFmatching funds. Each year TWC is also appropriated $27.7million in General Revenue Funds for CCDF maintenanceof effort. In its legislative appropriations request (LAR) for the 2006-07 biennium, TWC requested $17.8 million inGeneral Revenue Funds for the following exceptionalitems: \u008b$5.9 million to maintain 2004-05 funding levels forchild-care services, and \u008b$11.7 million to draw down matching Federal Fundsthat would not be accessed during the 2006-07biennium without additional matching funds. In lieu of receiving General Revenue Funds for these exceptional items, TWC could use additional donated fundsto maintain the 2004-05 biennial funding level and accessFederal Funds available to the state. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERALAND STATE REQUIREMENTS The alliance is requesting that $2.7 million of child-care funds be made accessible to its clubs across the state inexchange for certifying donated funds.The alliance's proposal to make its expenditures accessible to the state for federal matching purposes could potentially increase the administrative burden on the alliance fortracking CCDF eligibility requirements. Nevertheless, thealliance proposes a five-year period for state and alliancecooperation in accessing Federal Funds. TWC needs to determine whether providing $2.7 million to the alliance complies with federal and state regulations.Federal regulations do not allow donated funds to revert tothe donor's facility or use. It is possible the provision of the$2.7 million to the alliance would meet this requirement aslong as the alliance does not certify the $2.7 million asdonated funds to be used f or federal match. Based on federal and state re gulations, if states contract with the entities that meet the description of center-based,group home, or family child-care providers, these providers have to be licensed and regulated by the applicable stateentity. In Texas, the Department of Family and ProtectiveServices licenses and regulates child-car e providers. Only 16 out of 275 boys and girls clubs are currently licensed bythe department. All other boys and girls clubs are exemptfrom licensing under \"Neighborhood Recreation Program\"status. Provisions of this exemption, including that the services are not structured to provide after-school childcare, that the program does not collect compensation, and that children are free to join and leave the program at will may potentially contradict the description of the child-careservices specified in federal regulations. In addition, if TWC c hooses to make a payment to the entity selected to certify additional donated funds, TWCshould make sure that that the selection of the entity andthe payment meet the state's contracting practices andprovide the best value to the state. Therefore, TWC shouldconsider using a competitive process to select a non-profitentity or entities to ensure that the selected entity repre-sents the best interest of the state. Recommendation 1 would require TWC to research whether contracting with a private entity, such as thealliance, for child-care services complies with federal regulations and state contracting practices. TWC shouldreport the results of its research to the legislature and theLegislative Budget Board by February 11, 2005. Should theTWC determine that such an agreement is feasible, TWCshould, as stated in the Recommendation 2, enter into anagreement with the appropriate entity or entities to usecertified funds for matching purposes. ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO USE DONATED FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE By entering into an agreement with an entity that could certify funds for matching purposes, TWC would be able toaccess all Federal Funds even if the General Revenue Fund FIGURE 2 TEXAS ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS Mission\u2014Mission\u2014Mission\u2014Mission\u2014Mission\u2014to inspire all young people, especially those from disadvan- taged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. \u008b93 Boys and Girls Club corporations in Texas \u008bOver 275 club sites in Texas \u008bAverage attendance in Texas clubs\u201446,221 young people per day \u008b2003 clubs collective expenses\u2014 $46,436,000 Core club programs Core club programs Core club programs Core club programs Core club programs include: character and leadership development, the arts, education and career development, health and life skills, sports, fitness, and recreation.

Recommendation 3 would reduce TWC's2006-07 General Revenue Fund appropriations for child-care programs by $15.7 million compared to the 2004-05biennium. This would require TWC to use at least $23.8million in certified private funds as state match in the2006-07 biennium. The alliance estimates that the minimum annual amount for child care that could meet CCDF requirements is $11.9million out of $46.4 million of the alliance's annualexpenditures in 2003. The actual amount of qualifiedexpenditures could be higher than $11.9 million, and thealliance reports it will start determining qualifying expendi-tures once the state indicates tha t cooperation is plausible. There are also other optio ns that would allow the state to use additional donated funds. The recommended optiondiscussed in more detail in the fiscal impact section of thispaper funds TWC's child-care programs (funded withGeneral Revenue Funds for the Child Care and Develop-ment Funds and corresponding Federal Funds) at the2004-05 service level. However, the state could use adifferent amount of donated funds and make a smallerreduction in the General Revenue Fund appropriation. Thiswould allow the state to access more Federal Funds in the 2006-07 biennium and increase the number of children receiving services through the At-Risk child-care program. In addition, there may be other pr ograms where privately donated funds could be used to leverage Federal Funds.For example, of the $46.4 million expended by the alliancein 2003 for child-care ser vices, only an estimated $11.9 million meets CCDF requirements. Other programs mayhave different eligibility requirements, and funds excludedfrom the CCDF certification could be eligible to becounted as match in these programs. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS The recommendations would result in General Revenue Funds savings of $15.7 million in the 2006-07 biennium.The alliance estimates that the minimum annual amount forchild care that could meet CCDF requirements is $11.9million out of $46.4 million of the alliance's annualexpenditures in 2003. This estimate is based on theeligibility requirements set forth in the federal regulationsin Section 98.20 of Title 45 of the Code of FederalRegulation. Children must meet the following criteria tomeet CCDF eligibility requirements: \u008bbe under 13 years of age\u2014approximately 72 percentof children served by the alliance in Texas meet thisrequirement;\u008breside with a family whose income is at or below 85percent of state median income\u2014approximately 70percent of children served by the alliance meet thisrequirement; and \u008breside with a parent or parents who are working orattending a job training or educational program\u2014approximately 80 percent of children served by thealliance meet this requirement. The fiscal impact in Figure 3 assumes no increase in federal matching funds from f iscal years 2006 thr ough 2010, but does assume using $22.9 million of additionalFederal Funds that are currently available to the state.Once used, these funds would not be available in futureyears. The use of donated funds in future years could beexpanded, should the federal government provideadditional funds for child-care services. This recommendation assumes a reduction in TWC General Revenue Fund appropriations used for matchingfederal funds for child-care programs in the amount of$15.7 million in 2006-07 biennium compared to the2004-05 funding levels. If TWC uses $23.8 million ofcertified private funds, it can draw down approximately$46 million in Federal Funds. This reduction and the useof the certified donated funds would result in the samefunding level for the child-care programs funded byGeneral Reven ue Funds for the Child Care and Develop- ment Funds and corresponding Federal Funds in the2006-07 biennium as in the 2004-05 biennium. Inaddition, the TWC would still have access to $5.9 millionin Federal Funds, which could be used in the 2008-09biennium. To maintain the same level of services in the2008-09 biennium as in the 2004-05 and 2006-07 bienniafor the child-care programs funded by General RevenueFunds for the state match for the Child Care and Develop- ment Funds and corresponding Federal Funds, TWCwould need $9.9 million in additional General RevenueFund appropriations compared to the 2006-07 biennium.This is $5.9 million less than the amount in GeneralRevenue Funds appropriated to TWC for child-careservices in the 2004-05 biennium. The fiscal impact does not assume any payment to the entity or entities thatwould certify funds for matching purposes. Any amountpaid to the certifying entity could decrease GeneralRevenue Fund savings.STAFF PERFORMANCE REPORT TO THE 79TH LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD 383USE ADDITIONAL DONATED FUNDS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR CHILD-CARE SERVICES FIGURE 3 FIVE-YEAR FISCAL IMPACT 2006 $7,873,544 TO FEDERAL FUNDSPROBABLE GAIN/(LOSS) TO FEDERAL FUNDS FROM USING CERTIFIED DONATED FUNDS SOURCE : Legislative Budget Board.
