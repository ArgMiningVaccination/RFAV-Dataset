Inhaled vaporized odor molecules can bring back a flood of memories, influence people's moods, and even affect their work behavior. Smell can call up memories and powerful responses almost instantaneously. The reason for this is that the olfactory bulb is part of the brain's limbic system - an area so closely associated with memory and feeling, that it is also called the \"primitive\" or \"emotional brain.\" This system is a network of connected structures near the middle of the brain linked with the central nervous system that includes the adrenals, the pituitary gland, and the hypothalamus, which regulate the body's heart rate, blood pressure, stress, and breathing.
