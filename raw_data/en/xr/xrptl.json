Nagisa was so thorough and gentle with my extractions. She explained every step along the way and made my experience feel very special. The spa itself provides a calming retreat from the city.\" \u2014 Veronica N. \" Ihad a prenatal massage today with Marcus and he was amazing. He really listened to my requests (I'm really picky with massages and masseuses FYI!) The spa is relaxing, immaculate, and all staff members were helpful and wonderful to interact with.\" \u2014 K.M \"This is a five star spa experience that I thought you could only get at a fancy resort. The facilities are gorgeous, they offer you tea/water immediately upon entering, and you have access to private dressing rooms with everything you could need. If you're in NYC, I would highly recommend booking your treatments here.\" \u2014 Becca \"From the moment I stepped into the facility I was set at the ease, what a sanctuary! Karen, the esthetician I had for my facial, was lovely. Her energy was nurturing and calm, and her assessment of my skin was expert. Exactly what I would expect from a luxury spa.\" \u2014 C.A.
