While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to bipolar treatment, many people find relief from natural treatments. In this comprehensive guide, we will discuss the different types of natural bipolar treatments and how they can help you manage your condition. We will also provide tips for finding the right treatment plan for you! Contents What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder, also known as [manic](https://mantracare.org/therapy/issues/manic/)-depressive disorder, is a mental illness that causes extreme mood swings. People with bipolar disorder experience periods of mania, followed by periods of [depression](https://mantracare.org/counseling/depression/). The exact cause of the bipolar disorder is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The most effective treatment for bipolar disorder is a combination of medication and psychotherapy. However, there are natural treatments that can also help manage the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Here are five natural treatments for bipolar disorder: Symptoms The symptoms of bipolar disorder can be divided into two categories: manic and depressive. [Manic symptoms](https://mantracare.org/therapy/issues/manic-symptoms/)include feeling excessively happy or excited, having lots of energy, being easily distracted, talking very fast, and acting impulsively. - Depressive symptoms, on the other hand, include feeling down or hopeless, having low energy levels, trouble concentrating, changes in appetite or weight, and thoughts of [suicide](https://mantracare.org/therapy/negative-feelings/suicide/)or death. People with bipolar disorder often experience alternating periods of mania and depression. However, it is also possible to experience both manic and depressive symptoms at the same time (known as a mixed state). In some cases, people with bipolar disorder may also experience psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions. Natural Treatments Fortunately, natural treatments are also available for treating BPD. Therefore, besides prescription, you can take the aid of these natural remedies as well. These may include some lifestyle and dietary changes that are certainly in line with regular treatment and improved recovery. None of these solutions replace professional advice and medicine. Instead, these practices can work in conjunction with the treatment of a [psychiatrist](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/psychiatrist/). Healthy Lifestyle Choices These include inculcating some positive lifestyle habits which may help overcome the symptoms of Bipolar disorder. Some suggestions in this regard are: Follow A Regular Schedule And Routine A regular schedule and routine can help people with bipolar disorder by providing structure and stability. This can help to reduce the frequency and severity of manic episodes. Another reason is that a regular schedule helps regulate [sleep](https://mantracare.org/therapy/sleep/sleep/) patterns, which is important for overall [mental health](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/mental-health/). Finally, a fixed routine can help to reduce [stress](https://mantracare.org/counseling/stress/) levels, which may trigger manic episodes otherwise. Exercise Regularly To Keep Your Mood Up Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that is characterized by extreme mood swings. These swings can range from feeling extremely happy and energetic to feeling very sad and depressed. People with bipolar disorder often experience these swings in a cycle, with periods of highs followed by periods of lows. Exercise has been shown to be an effective natural treatment for bipolar disorder. Studies have found that regular exercise can help to stabilize mood, improve sleep, and reduce [stress and anxiety](https://mantracare.org/therapy/stress/stress-and-anxiety/). Exercise is helpful in reducing the risk of relapse for people with bipolar disorder. Sleep For 7-8 Hours Each Night Sleep is crucial for people with bipolar disorder. It helps to regulate mood, energy levels, and overall wellbeing. Getting enough sleep can be a challenge for people with bipolar disorder, as they may experience difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. However, there are natural treatments that can help. One natural treatment for [insomnia](https://mantracare.org/therapy/sleep/insomnia-types-causes-treatment/) is chamomile tea. Chamomile tea has been shown to improve sleep quality and reduce the time it takes to fall asleep. It is also safe for long-term use. Another natural treatment for insomnia is valerian root. Valerian root is a herb that has been used for centuries to treat insomnia and other sleep disorders. It works by increasing levels of the neurotransmitter [GABA](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/gaba/), which promotes relaxation. Get More Sunlight During Depressive Episodes There are a few different ways that natural bipolar treatment can be approached. For example, some people may find that getting more sunlight during depressive episodes helps them to manage their disorder. This is because sunlight can help to improve mood and energy levels. Additionally, spending time outdoors in nature has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels. Furthermore, exercise is another important element of natural bipolar treatment, as it can help to regulate mood and sleep patterns. Finally, a healthy diet and lifestyle are also crucial for managing bipolar disorder. Avoid Alcohol And Non-Prescription Drugs It's no secret that [substance abuse](https://mantracare.org/therapy/addiction/substance-abuse/) can lead to all sorts of problems. Not only their consumption can worsen the symptoms of bipolar disorder, but it can also trigger manic or depressive episodes. That's why avoiding alcohol and non-prescription drugs is an important part of managing bipolar disorder. Record Your Daily Condition On A Mood Chart A mood chart is a way of tracking your moods and symptoms over time. This can help you to identify patterns and [triggers](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/triggers/) for your bipolar disorder. It can also be used to track the effectiveness of treatment. There are many different ways to create a mood chart. You can use paper and pencil, or there are various online tools that you can use. Whichever method you choose, make sure that it is something that you will be able to stick with. To get started, decide how often you want to record your moods. This could be daily, weekly, or even monthly. Then, choose what information you want to include on your chart. Some common things to track include Date, Time, Mood rating (on a scale from 0 to 100), Symptoms, Medications, Sleep patterns, Exercise, and Diet. Once you have decided on the information you want to include, start tracking your moods and symptoms. It can be helpful to set aside some time each day to fill out your chart. For example, you could do it first thing in the morning or before bed. Make sure to be as consistent as possible with your entries. Positive Dietary Changes This remedy includes having some healthy changes in diet. You can follow these suggestions very easily by bringing the desired change and staying consistent with a diet. Some of the tips are as follows: Practice A Healthy And Balanced Diet There are some specific things that people with bipolar disorder should keep in mind when choosing their foods. First, it is important to eat regular meals and snacks throughout the day. Skipping meals can cause blood [sugar](https://mantracare.org/diabetes/overview/sugar/) to drop, which can lead to feelings of anxiety or irritability. Second, you should try to eat a variety of foods from all the food groups. This will help ensure that you are getting all the nutrients your body needs. A few key nutrients that are particularly important for people with bipolar disorder are omega-three fatty acids, magnesium, and vitamin D. Eat Your Meals On A Consistent Schedule The most important natural bipolar treatment is to eat your meals on a consistent schedule. This means eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same time every day. It's also important to snack regularly throughout the day so that you don't get too hungry. When you're well-fed, your mood stabilizes and you're less likely to experience extreme highs and lows. Another reason is that when you're hungry, your blood sugar drops and this can trigger a [manic episode](https://mantracare.org/therapy/bipolar-disorder/manic-episode/). Do Avoid Sugar Crashes Sugar crashes can cause a lot of problems for people suffering from bipolar disorder. When you crash, your [blood sugar levels](https://mantracare.org/diabetes/overview/blood-sugar-levels/) drop suddenly and you can feel weak, tired, and irritable. You may also have trouble concentrating clearly. Sugar crashes can trigger manic episodes or make them worse. Avoiding sugar crashes is one of the most important things you can do to recover from bipolar disorder. There are a few different ways to avoid sugar crashes: - Eat small meals often throughout the day instead of three large meals. This will help keep your blood sugar levels more stable. - Include protein in every meal. Protein helps slow down the release of sugar into your bloodstream, which prevents sugar crashes. - Avoid processed foods and eat more whole foods. Processed foods are full of sugar and other simple [carbohydrates](https://mantracare.org/diabetes/diet/carbohydrates/)that can cause sugar crashes. Eating more whole foods will help you avoid these problem ingredients. Following these tips can help you avoid sugar crashes and recover from bipolar disorder. Sugar crashes can be a major trigger for manic episodes, so it's important to do everything you can to avoid them. With proper treatment, you can recover from bipolar disorder and lead a healthy, happy life. Increase Your Omega-3 Intake Your body needs omega-three fatty acids for many reasons. They help keep your heart healthy and your joints lubricated. They also play a role in maintaining brain function. Omega-three fatty acids are found in fish, nuts, and seeds. They have been shown to help with symptoms of depression. Magnesium is found in leafy green vegetables, beans, and whole grains. It can help with sleep problems and anxiety. Vitamin D is found in fortified milk and oily fish. It has been linked to a lower risk of developing bipolar disorder. Clinical studies have shown that people with bipolar disorder who take omega-three supplements have fewer symptoms than those who don't. Omega-three supplements seem to be most effective when taken with standard bipolar medications. There are several possible explanations for why omega-threes might help treat bipolar disorder. Omega-three fatty acids play a role in inflammation, and some studies have suggested that inflammation may be involved in bipolar disorder. Omega-threes also affect brain function, and some research suggests that abnormalities in certain brain regions may be involved in bipolar disorder. Replace Simple Carbohydrates With Complex Ones A natural bipolar treatment is one that helps to recover bipolar disorder without the use of medication. There are many different natural treatments for bipolar disorder, but one of the most effective is changing your diet. You can change your diet to help treat bipolar disorder by replacing simple carbohydrates with complex ones. Simple carbohydrate beverages are found in foods like candy, cake, and cookies. Complex carbohydrates are found in foods like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Studies have shown that eating complex [carbs](https://mantracare.org/diabetes/diet/carbs/) can help stabilize mood swings in people with bipolar disorder. Complex carbs help because they take longer to digest than simple carbs. This means that they provide a slow and steady release of energy, rather than a quick burst followed by a crash. Alternative treatments These are some miscellaneous solutions that may help you overcome your bipolar disorder. Some natural treatments in this regard are: Practice Mindfulness Meditation Everyday [Mindfulness](https://mantracare.org/therapy/meditation/mindfulness/) meditation is a natural bipolar treatment that has been proven to be effective in helping people recover from bipolar disorder. This practice can help reduce the frequency and severity of manic episodes in people with bipolar disorder. People who practice mindfulness meditation experience fewer manic episodes than those who do not meditate. Mindfulness meditation also improves cognitive function in people with bipolar disorder. Those who practice it regularly have better working memory and executive function. It also helps reduce stress and improve sleep quality in people with bipolar disorder. Given all of these benefits, it is no wonder that mindfulness meditation is an effective natural bipolar treatment. If you are looking for a natural way to treat your bipolar disorder, consider adding mindfulness meditation to your daily routine This technique involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. Thus individuals become more aware of their thoughts and feelings, and eventually learn to control them. Take St. John's Wort During Depressive Episodes St. John's Wort is a natural antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in treating mild to moderate depression. It is thought to work by inhibiting the reuptake of [serotonin](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/serotonin/), norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain. St. John's Wort may also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. St. John's Wort is a natural treatment for bipolar disorder that has been used for centuries. The plant contains chemicals that can help to balance mood and provide relief from depression. Taking St. John's Wort during depressive episodes can help to reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten the duration of the episode. In some cases, it may even prevent hospitalization. While there is no cure for bipolar disorder, natural treatments like St. John's Wort can help to manage the condition and improve quality of life. If you are considering taking St. John's Wort for bipolar disorder, be sure to speak with your doctor first to discuss the potential risks and benefits. Acupuncture [Acupuncture](https://mantracare.org/physiotherapy/acupuncture/) is one of the natural bipolar treatments that can help you manage your condition. This ancient Chinese practice involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. Acupuncture is thought to stimulate the release of neurotransmitters and increase blood flow, which can help improve mood and relieve symptoms. It works by correcting imbalances in the body that may be causing your symptoms. Acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for bipolar disorder. It has few side effects and can be used alongside other treatments, such as medication and [therapy](https://mantracare.org/therapy/therapist/therapy/). Reaching out for support If you think you need support regarding this disorder, you may take the aid of following suggestions: Talk To Your Friends And Family About Your Condition The natural bipolar treatment approach also involves talking to your friends and family about your condition. This helps you to better understand your condition and how it affects your [relationships](https://mantracare.org/therapy/relationship/relationships/). In some cases, talking to friends and family may even help to improve your symptoms. For example, people with bipolar disorder who had supportive family relationships were more likely than those without supportive family relationships to experience remission of their symptoms. Also, people with bipolar disorder who had high levels of social support were more likely to have fewer relapses than those with low levels of social support. Talking to your friends and family about your condition can be a difficult thing to do. However, it is important to remember that they want to help you and that they are likely to be more understanding than you think. Join A Support Group To Connect With Other People When people are first diagnosed with bipolar disorder, they may feel isolated and alone. Joining a support group can help them connect with other people who understand what they are going through. In a support group, people can share their experiences and offer each other advice on how to cope with the symptoms of bipolar disorder. [Support groups](https://mantracare.org/therapy/care/support-groups-near-me/) can also provide a sense of community and belonging. For many people with bipolar disorder, feeling like they have others who understand them is an important part of recovery. Support groups can help people feel less alone in their experience of bipolar disorder. There are many different types of support groups for people with bipolar disorder. Some groups focus on education, while others focus on peer support. Some groups meet in person, while others meet online. There are even support groups specifically for loved ones of people with bipolar disorder. Conclusion In the end, it is concluded that natural bipolar treatment is the best way to go about it.
