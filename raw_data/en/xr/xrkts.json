The costs associated with investing in an aroma- therapy program can be signicant so it's imper- ative to set speci c guide- lines for what you hope to achieve. Perhaps your goal is to have the most comprehensive program in town in order to o er something your competitors might not provide. If so, then you'll want to establish as many innovative uses of the essential oils as possible. That will necessarily raise costs since you'll need a higher number of potentially expensive essential oils and a wide variety of supplies - carrier oils, lotions or creams, spray bottles and jars, inhalers, nebulizers and/or di users, mixing utensils and bowls, and labels. For me, the major obstacle to overcome was the need to \"prove\" the program's worth to sta skeptics. If that is so for you, you'll want to start in a small and focused way to keep expenses reasonable and outcomes measurable. In a society where every grocery store item with a smell, whether called \"ocean breeze\" or \"sunny day,\" is labeled 'aromatherapy' why would they simply believe you when you tell them essential oils have physiological eects on the body? A nurse at my facility loved to tell patients and families (but only if I happened to be present) what a wonderful thing it was to have aromatherapy. Shortly thereafter, in one of our interdisciplinary group meetings attended by representatives from nursing, pharmacy, physicians, social work, volunteer services, spiritual care and complementary therapies, the discussion focused on a patient's symptoms and how the pharmaceuticals had not provided the expected relief. When I suggested adding a blend of essential oils to the treatment, she responded, \"If our stu hasn't worked, yours isn't likely to.\" That negativity can be pervasive so I would suggest that a good way to squash doubts is to start with sta complaints and o er to treat their headaches, backaches, stu y noses, etc. Nothing is more convincing than a successful resolution and you will need sta support to work e ectively. Another thing that will give your program credence is to learn to speak their language. You'll never assuage cynicism by speaking about concepts clinicians view as New Age flu - auras, chakras and crystals. You'll nd that many will profess to believe in \"those things,\" just not for use with their patients. I would advise saving those discussions for a time when you've rmly established yourself and then they might begin to listen and to take them seriously. Learning their language means knowing common hospice diagnoses, the associated symptoms and whether essential oils might be likely to help. Keep in mind that therapeutic essential oils are not appropriate for every symptom; you must know the diagnosis to determine the feasibility of treatment. For instance, hearing \"constipation\" is not enough information. If the diagnosis is colon cancer with a complete bowel obstruction, a constipation lotion would be contraindicated. Likewise, if a patient is complaining of a constant headache, check the diagnosis. If you hear \"glioblastoma,\" you might want to hold your vasodilators and instead opt for something to help him relax. Increased circulation to the brain would not be helpful for a growing tumor. Another e ective communication tool is being able to provide double-blind/placebo or case studies. Keep several handy that you can cite or hand out because if you can't hold your own with science-based clinicians, your program will quickly be seen as nice but unnecessary.

The results showed that Melissa is an e ective treatment and that an added bene t was that quality of life indices also improved signi cantly. I cite this study frequently with clinicians who are skeptical of the bene ts of our Agitation/Anxiety blend and it has made a di erence in their acceptance. More and more studies are also being done on the antiviral, antifungal, antiinfectious properties of essential oils and that's great for those of us in hospice. One such case study by Irene Gilliland, RN, CNS, ACHPN, recently published in the September/October 2009 Journal of Hospice and Palliative Nursing is titled, \"Use of Essential oils to Treat Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in End of Life: A Case Study.\" Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a particularly virulent bug, can quickly overwhelm a weakened immune system and is easily transmitted. In this study, Lavender (Lavandula augustifolia) was used in a saline eye wash for a 102-year-old nursing home patient who had been isolated for three years due to MRSA in the eyes. She had been treated with everything from Oxacillin, Imipenem and Join us at the NAHA Blog NAHA World of Aromatherapy Blog Spot http://worldofaromatherapy.blogspot.com/ An online environment to learn more about NAHA E-Newsletter Articles Aromatherapy Updates Membership Sharing and Support And Much More!

Someone suggested essential oils and the pharmacy mixed 15 drops of Lavender in 500ml of saline. They soaked a cotton ball in the solution twice a day and swiped it across the patient's eyelid. One month later, the patient was retested and there was no sign of MRSA present. I love to quote that one because as our sta gets comfortable with the use of essential oils for things like constipation, edema, agitation/anxiety, depression, dry/itchy skin, respiratory issues and nausea, my attention is being drawn to more speci c things like the treatment of MRSA, thrush, C-Di (Clostridium dicele), flu and a host of others. Clearly, the practice of aromatherapy in hospice requires a knowledgeable, intrepid aromatherapist who can pick her way through the mine eld but it's well worth the e ort. The Director of Research at the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) said there are no available statistics on the number of hospices with an aromatherapy program. I suspect this may be because many have fledgling, ineectual programs, primarily using Lavender (and nothing more) and often only as a room freshener. The possibilities for aromatherapy in hospice are therefore endless at this point. Although not o ered with a claim that they will prevent or cure disease, essential oils' known historical properties, coupled with an array of recent reputable studies, show them to be highly e ective in hospice, with the added bene t of having few (if any) contraindications (unlike pharmaceuticals). Because of this, it's a pet peeve of mine to have clinicians suggest it would be unwise to use essential oils in hospice because they can cause allergic reactions. We routinely use pharmaceuticals that come with a laundry list of contraindications (many of them potentially lethal) and yet we never question their use.

Yet we use them regularly and without hesitation. I am lucky to be in a hospice that champions the use of essential oils for their therapeutic value. I continually search for the studies and information that help bolster the case for their safe and e ective use. My goal is nothing less than an aromatherapy program in as many hospices nationwide as possible.References: Ballard, CG, O'Brien, JT, Reichelt K., Perry, EK (2003).

The practice of Holistic Aromatherapy, the use of Essential Oils to support and strengthen the immune function, will oer the possibility of improving health through direct eects on the mind/body connection. A relationship that de nes and supports the concepts of aromatherapy has been recently enjoying a new acceptance in western medicine due to the successful research in the eld of Psychoneuroimmunology. Psychoneuroimmunology, (PNI) is the branch of biomedical science that explores the relationships between the nervous system, emotions, and the im- mune system. PNI studies the connections or links between our \"state\" of mind and our \"state\" of health. Interest in the relationship between psychiatric syn- dromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine. Walter Cannon, a professor of physiology at Harvard University, looked at the need for mental and physical balance throughout the organism and created the term, 'homeostasis' in his book, The Wisdom of the Body, published in 1932. Dr. Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in his lab animal, such as anxiety, stress, distress, or rage, was accompanied by total cessation of stomach movement. These studies into the relationship between the eects of emotions and perceptions on the autonomic nervous system, namely the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses initiated the recognition of the \"freeze ght or flight\" response. Picking up on Cannon's work, Hans Selye formed the empiric foundation of the ability for an animal to adapt, heal, and recover from adverse mental and physical conditions. Selye's work was summarized in the concept of the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS). This syndrome consists of an enlargement of the adrenal gland, atrophy of the thymus, spleen, and other lymphoid tissue, and gastric ulcerations due to an environment of prolonged and/or chronic stress and the body's reaction to the presence of stress related stimuli. Selye describes three stages of adaptation, the initial brief alarm reaction, followed by a prolonged period of resistance and a terminal stage of exhaustion and death. This monumental work led to mid-20th century studies that reported that psychiatric patients experienced immune alterations including a decreased number of lymphocytes and a poor response to pertussis vaccination when compared to non-psychiatric control subjects. In 1964, George F. Solomon, et al. coined the term \"psych- oimmunology\" and published his landmark paper: \"Emotions, Immunity, and Disease: a speculative theoretical integration\", Archives of General Psychiatry 1964; 11:657-74. Continued.....page 8 In 1975 Robert Ader and Nicholas Cohen at the University of Rochester advanced PNI research with their demonstration of classic conditioning of the immune function. The previous term of \"psychoimmunology\" was updated to \"psycho- neuroimmunology\". Through his highly controlled research with laboratory rats, he determined that there was a scienti c connection between stress stimulation and immunosuppression. This was one of the rst reproducible scienti c studies that proved the nervous system can a ect the immune system. Up until this point, immunologists believed that the immune system was an autonomous system and functioned independently from other body systems: R. Ader and N. Cohen, \"Behaviorally Conditioned Immunosuppression\", Psychosomatic Medicine, Vol. 37, Issue 4:333-340. Contemporary advances in psychiatry, immunology, neurology, and other integrated disciplines of medicine have fostered enormous growth for PNI. In 1985, research by Candace Pert revealed that neuropeptide-speci c receptors are present on the cell walls of both the brain and the immune system. The discovery that neuropeptides and neuro- transmitters act directly upon the immune system shows their close association with emotions and suggests mechanisms through which emotions and immunology are deeply interdependent. Showing that the immune system and the endocrine system are modulated not only by the brain but by the central nervous system itself has a huge impact on how we understand emotions and disease. PNI research is looking for the exact mechanisms by which speci c brain-immunity e ects are achieved. Evidence for nervous system - immune system inter- actions exists at several biological levels. The im- mune system and the brain communicate to each other though signaling pathways. The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body. During an immune response the brain and the immune system \"talk\" to each other and this process is essential for maintaining homeostasis.The two major pathway systems are involved in this cross-communication are the Hypothalamic - pitui- tary - adrenal axis (HPA axis) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The body's primary stress management system is the HPA axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis by controlling the body's cortisol level. The two major pathway systems that are involved in this cross-communication are the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (HPA axis) and the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS). The body's primary stress management system is the HPA axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenges to maintain homeostasis (the body's balance or internal environment) by adjusting and controlling the body's hormonal level of cortisol. Dysregulation or disruption of the function of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases.

Like the stress response, the in flammatory reaction is crucial for survival. Like the stress response, the in flammatory reaction is crucial for survival. Systemic in flammatory response results in stimulation of four major programs that are mediated by the HPA axis and SNS: the acute phase reaction sickness behavior the pain program the stress responseCommon human diseases such as allergies, autoimmune diseases, chronic infections and sepsis are all characterized by dysregulation of the pro-in flammatory processes take place during depression, manicand bi-polar disease, in addition to autoimmune hypersensitivity and chronic infections. Chronic secretion of stress hormones, glucocortaids (CGs) catechcholamines(CAs), as a result of disease, may reduce the e ect of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine or other receptors in the brain leading to dysfunction of neuro-hormones. The abnormalities and the failure of the adaptive systems to resolve in flammation aect the well-being of the individual, including behavioral parameters, quality of life and sleep. Systemic anti-in flammatory feedback and/or hyperactivity may be key factors in some metabolic and cardiovascular disorders and health. This same systemic neuro-in flammation and neuro-immune activation have been shown to play a role in the etiology of several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, pain, and AIDS-associated dementia. Never before has the phrase, \"Stress will kill you!\" meant more to today's individual. There is now su cient data to conclude that immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. Although changes related to infectious disease and wound healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological disruption is highlighted by increased risks across many medical conditions and diseases. Stress is thought to a ect immune function through emotional and behavioral manifestations, such as fear, anger, sadness, and tension and physiological changes such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating. Researchers have suggested that these changes are bene cial if they are limited in duration, however, when stress becomes chronic, the body is unable to maintain homeostasis or equilibrium. T.B. Herbert and S. Cohen examined 38 studies of stressful events and the immune function of healthy adults and published their results in the Journal of Psychosomatic Medicine in 1993. They found con- sistent stress-related increases in increased numbers Psychoneuroimmunology and the Implications for the Practice of Aromatherapy Elaine Dohms, Certified Clinical Master Aromatherapist \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 11Continued.....page 12Continued.....page 10 of white blood cells as well as decreased numbers of helper T cells, suppressor T cells, and cytotoxic T cells, B cells, and Natural killer cells (NK). E.P. Zorilla, et al published their ndings and correlations of brain behavior and immunity in 2001. The communication and interactions of systems were identi ed: Communication between the brain and immune system Stimulation of the brain sites alters immunity (stressed animals have altered immune systems) Immune cells produce cytokines that act on the Central Nervous System (CNS) Immune cells respond to signals from the CNSCommunication between neuro-endocrine and immune system Glucocorticoids and catechcholamines immune cells[28] Endorphins from pituitary and adrenal medulla act on the immune system Activity of the immune system is correlated with neurochemical/neuro-endocrine activity of brain cells Connection between glucocorticoids and immune system Anti-in flammatory hormones enhances an or- ganism's response to a stressor Prevents the over-reaction of the body's own defense system Regulates the immune system Aects cell growth, proliferation and di erentiation Causes immunosuppression Suppresses cell adhesion, antigen presentation, chemotaxis and Increases apoptosis (necessary death of cells) Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) The release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the Hypothalamus is in fluenced by stress. CRH is a major regulator of the HPA axis/stress axis CRH regulates secretion of Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) CRH is widely distributed in the brain and peripheral nervous system CRH also regulates the actions of the Autonomic Nervous system and immune system Stressors that enhance the release of CRH suppress the function of the immune system and conversely, stressors that depress CRH release potentiate immunity. What does all of this valuable research mean to the potential conventional medicine patient? It means that they may be treated with a new array of \"Pharmaceutical advances\" for all of our Psych- oneuroimmunological disorders/conditions. We correlate the Implications for the Practice of Aromatherapy Elaine Dohms, Certified Clinical Master Aromatherapist \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 12Continued.....page 13Continued.....page 11 antagonists and the list of other treatment drugs goes on. The list of medications and drugs are impressive, however, the list of contraindications and side eects are lengthy and concerning. (Herbert TB, Cohen S. Stress and immunity in humans: a meta-analytical review. Psychsom Med 1993 55:364-379.) Let's review the Precaution List taken from the printed and distributed by \"Publix Pharmacy\" from a national data base known as \"Prescription Facts\". This is a printed form that accompanies the purchase of the lowest dose of an anti-psychotic drug, Risperidone that has been used for years to \"restore the balance of certain natural substances in the brain\" (neurotransmitters). The precautions warn that you should tell your doctor if you have: allergies, liver disease, kidney disease, low blood pressure, seizures, Parkinson's disease, dehydration, breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, dementia, and obesity. The warning also includes a detailed amount of information about heart rhythm (QT prolongation) eects. Please note that we haven't reviewed the Side Eect list. The Side e ects listed for Risperidone are: dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, fainting, unusual muscle movement, constipation, runny nose, increased appetite, weight gain, nervousness, acne, dry skin, diculty concentrating, di culty sleeping, and these are not listed in the \"Serious Side E ects\" section. Serious side e ects (please inform your doctor or report your side e ects to the FDA, Federal Drug Agency at 1.800.FDA.1088), include: severe dizziness, fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat, mental/ mood changes, fever, sweating, drooling, di culty swallowing, seizures, numbness, sudden vision changes, slurred speech, chest pain, confusion, breast lumps and a slightly increased risk of developing heart disease or experiencing a stroke. With all due respect for modern medical drug therapy, it is apparent that there is a distinct possibility that the prescribed medication may be more detrimental to the individual than the original symptom(s) that are being treated. There are available choices for alternative, complementary, more natural therapy or treatment that returns the body/mind to a state of improved unity without compromising an individual's state of wellness. Precise statements about the speci c interaction between essential oils and the various functions of the immune system are not as comprehensive as the PNI research that we have listed. However, there are many other interventions that have been found to boost the immune system and counteract the e ect of stress on individuals without damaging side e ects. Some of these interventions and lifestyle changes include progressive relaxation, mental imagery, breath work, proper diet and exercise, biofeedback, massage therapy, expressive therapy, energy work, counseling, aromatherapy and many more health and wellness treatment options. Psychoneuroimmunology and the Implications for the Practice of Aromatherapy Elaine Dohms, Certified Clinical Master Aromatherapist \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 13Continued.....page 14Continued.....page 12 One of the most promising ndings in PNI is the exciting implications for the practice of arom- atherapy, which o ers the possibility of improving health through direct e ects on immune function, as well as through the mind/body connection. Aromatherapy has been in use since early civilization. The rst drug directory that we know as \"Pen Tsao\" was written by herbalist Shen Nung in the year 2,800 BC. Ancient civilizations of Egyptians, Greeks and Romans all referred to herbal remedies for symptoms of disease. Ali-Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna the Arab, wrote books on the properties of over 800 plants and their eects on the human body in the years of 980-1037AD. During the plague in Europe (1300s), aromatic wood was burned in the streets. Exper- imentation and documented ndings continued throughout the 1800s with the discovery of terpene molecules. Charles Cumberland published a report that studied the e ects of di used essential oils of cinnamon, geranium, oregano and angelica on the inhibition of Staphylococcus, Meningococcal and Salmonella typhi. Work in the aromatherapy eld continued into the 1900s with further proof of the e cacy of microbes becoming unable to reproduce (Cavell). Rene-Maurice Gattefosse, PhD, dedicated much of his work to help identify the healing/antiseptic components of essential oils. His book \"Aromatherapie\" was published in 1937. This book set the chemical and scienti c basis for the utilization of therapeutic essential oils. Marguerite Maury introduced the idea of combining essential oils with massage. Inspired by the methods used in traditional Tibetan medicine, she developed the individual prescription. Essential oils were selected according to the physical and emotional needs of her clients. As the mental and physical patterns altered, she modi ed the aromatherapy treatment. She noticed bene cial side e ects and was amazed to see improved skin conditions, relief from arthritic pain, heightened sexual pleasure, insomnia relief and a generally improved mental state. The complete history of the use of aromatherapy substances, from ancient ritual and medicinal application to today's research, is evidence that essential oils have served as natural support and relief for many disease related symptoms for centuries. The natural chemical complexity of essential oils derived from plants makes them an ideal form of natural pharmacological therapy. The synergies of essential oil constituents in their natural state are easily adapted to human physiology and when safely and well-prescribed are free from undesirable side eects. Essential oils are highly volatile, meaning that they readily evaporate, transforming from liquid to vapor. They occur widely in the plant kingdom, not only in the flowers, leaves and fruits but also in the root system and various parts of green plants. Each plant species has characteristic glands or cells that store essential oils. Research shows that these essential oils play an important part in mediating the interaction of the plant with their environment, such Continued.....page 13 as protection against insect, bacterial, and viral invasion. There is evidence that essential oils work synergistically to therapeutically enhance metabolic processes of the human body. (Battaglia, Salvatore, The Complete Guide to Aromatherapy: The Perfect Potion (Australia) Pty Ltd.,1995 90-98.)

But, how does it work? The olfactory system is responsible for our sense of smell. Smelling begins by inhaling through the nose. Our nose is a direct protrusion of the brain. The aroma vapors travel to the olfactory epithelium (special mucous membrane at the roof of the nasal cavity). The odor penetrates and dissolves into the mucous membrane and the cilia (hair-like structures that are the tips of the olfactory nerves) relay information through the olfactory bulb deep into the brain/limbic system. Our sense of smell is the one place where the nervous system is in direct contact with the external environment.Aromas and scent do e ect emotions by the direct contact with the brain/limbic system. The limbic system is the \"oldest\" part of the brain. It is where thinking and analytical development occurs. The limbic system tells your body how to react to a situation or stimulus, the \" ght or flight\" reaction previously discussed in PNI research. Essential oils \"hit\" the limbic system in less than 1 second via inhalation and within 1-3 seconds with skin application. There is no need to have the body process essential oils by the digestive system or blood stream which is the common mode of absorption in other medication/remedies. Essential oils can support and strengthen the immune response in two ways: i. by directly opposing the threatening micro- organism with antibacterial and antiviral properties ii. by stimulating and increasing the activity of the cells involved by hormonal organ interaction The use of essential oils via inhalation therapy is eective in treating the responses to in flammation that present in adverse immune reactions like asthma and autoimmune disorders. This area of research has been explored by Michael Alexander who states, \"The desired e ect is immunosuppression. Immuno- suppression is a term used to describe therapeutic intervention which attempts to suppress immune responses that are overactive, persistent, and cause harm to the body.\" (Alexander, Michael, The Prophylactic Use of Essential Oil Inhalation Therapy and its Mechanisms of Action in the Treatment of Respiratory Hyper-sensitivity Reaction, Aroma- therapy Journal, 2002.11(3&4), pg.19.) In this article, Alexander goes on to discuss essential oils which inhibit the in flammatory process which include lavender, peppermint, rosemary, and blue chamomile. In addition to acting directly on immune system function, aromatherapy has the potential to strengthen and normalize the immune system and improve health and individual wellness through the mind/body connection by reducing stress and frontalis Neurosensorius OlfactoriusConcha nasalis mediaPsychoneuroimmunology for the Practice of Aromatherapy Elaine Dohms, Certified Clinical Master Aromatherapist \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 16Continued.....page 15 Essential oils are truly made from nature and they possess great beauty and healing potential. Aromatherapy based on such oils is in sharp contrast to the conventional medicine paradigm. Aroma- therapy presents a rare and valid alternative to mainstream medical consumerism. (Schnaubelt, Kurt; Medical Aromatherapy: Healing with Essential Oils (Frog LTD., 1999) 262.) Balance and good health is a personal choice. Com- bining aspects of bene cial exercise, proper nutrition, stress management and lifestyle is a commitment each person must make. Aromatherapy has the potential of contributing to the overall bene t of the choice of mind/body balance and wellness. In the future, aromatherapy and other alternative methods which rely on natural substances to unite the psychological and physical healing will become increasingly more important. Exciting new research in the eld of psychoneuroimmunology reveals a close relationship between emotional and nervous processes and the human immune system. This proves scienti cally the fact that many have known for a long time: the psychological constitution of the individual is of the utmost importance in the healing process. The selection of essential oils that have a calming and restorative e ect on the mind/body are impressive and numerous. The contraindications and warnings are limited to photosensivity, pregnancy and select medical conditions and medications and homeopathy treatments. The potential for relief of stress related symptoms is promising and extensive. The future of health and healing supports amazing opportunities and indications for the ancient healing practice of aromatherapy. I am a new face on the Aromatherapy scene. I recently received my Certi ed Clinical Master Aromatherapist designation, in addition to my Reiki Master/Teacher credentials. A personal, incredible aromatherapy healing experience launched me down the educational pathway of essential oils and therapeutic aromatherapy. This knowledge has created the possibility of healing and individual choice in my life without compromising my health. I have become captivated by the potential healing and wellness that aromatherapy holds for the community of new medicine. I share my life with seven children, three dogs, four cats, numerous rehabilitated squirrels and a very patient husband. edohms@tampabay.rr.com \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved NAHA 2011 E-Journals Call for Articles Do you have a professional quality ar ticle that we can consider for publication in the NAHA 2011 E-Journals ?

Andrea Butje, Certified Clinical Aromatherapist \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 18What do you think is more fun, teaching students to make body butters or teaching them chemistry? Is it easier for you to talk about lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) than chemotypes? The chemistry of essential oils is often presented as an advanced, complex subject. Many consider it dicult to teach. Seriously? It's not that hard! I never took chemistry in high school or college \u2014 that is another story. I've taught myself essential oil chemistry over the years.My self-taught perspective has given me tools I need to teach chemistry to total beginners. I'd like to share some of my teaching methods to hopefully inspire a better understanding of essential oil chemistry. Let's look at the context rst. 1. Why do we want to talk about Carbon, Oxygen and Hydrogen? 2. Do we really need to understand GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) reporting?3. What is the big deal about chemotypes? 4. What about the Chemical Family theory? Some people are afraid that knowledge of essential oil chemistry will demystify aromatherapy and reduce it to a cold and clinical science \u2014 taking away from the magical, intuitive and energetic aspects of this healing art. This has not been my experience. I have found that increasing my knowledge and understanding of essential oil chemistry has only heightened my respect for these remarkable gifts of nature. Understanding both the art and science of aromatherapy gives us a balanced perspective that enhances our therapeutic uses of the oils. How do I teach this material?1. The building blocks: Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Introduce the basics of chemistry by discussing shelf life, a very practical issue for all aromatherapists. In order to understand the approximate shelf life of an oil, we need to understand carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and oxidation. To understand oxidation, we need to introduce the factors that in fluence oxidation \u2014 such as the vulnerability of carbon double bonds to oxygen, molecular size, and how heat and light can rearrange molecules. Context helps students understand why we are asking them to learn chemistry in the rst place. I write these bullet points on the board and discuss them with my students. Continued.....page 19 Teaching the Chemistry of Essential Oils: Why Bother? Andrea Butje, Certified Clinical Aromatherapist \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 19Continued.....page 20 Understand oxida tion to understand shelf life Appreciate why certain oils have a par ticular therapeutic activity Select essen tial oils for therapeu tic eect Understand safety issues concerning certain oils Relate to journal ar ticles, keep up with current essential oil research and comprehend professional lectures at conferences 2. GC/MS, the standard in quality assurance. Why is GC/MS important? The precise breakdown of the chemical components in individual oils (listed on a GC/MS report) is important because the therapeu tic bene ts of essen tial oils can o ften be determined by their chemical components. The safety issues of essential oils are determined largely by the components of the oil, as well as by the dose and application. In order to introduce this material in a prac tical setting, I have students format a GC/MS report. I recently spoke with a student who is taking our Aromahead Ins titute online Aromatherapy Certication Program. She was working on this activity. The ac tivity instructs the student to take a typical GC/MS report (long list of chemical components with percentages) and categorize the components into their correct chemical families. Before she could do the ac tivity she needed to clarify the dierence between a component and a chemical family. Next, she needed to iden tify to which chemical family the component belonged . In order to do this, she needed to look at the component's molecular structure, de ne the backbone (10 carbons, 15 carbons, benzene ring etc.) and then gure out which functional group, if any, was a ttached to it. Once this was clear, the family (or families) the component belonged to became obvious and she was able to categorize the component correctly. This kind of ac tivity helps the student feel more comfortable with the GC/MS reports, the component names and the chemical families. 3. Chemotypes, when a tiny dierence can be a big deal. Introduce this concept by explaining that being able to identify the speci c chemotype of an essen tial oil can easily be done through studying a GC/MS report. In class, we discuss the idea that some plants have the genetic ability to produce di erent chemical constituents based on the environment in which they are growing. Use a case study to demonstrate. We use the examples of rosemary (Rosmarinus o cinalis) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris). We explain that depending on the country of origin and the growing condi tions, both of these oils can produce very di erent essen tial oils. \"Chemotype\" literally means a di erent chemical type. The oil components can vary so drama tically that the oil can even change primary chemical families. How does this relate to prac tical aromatherapy? Aromatherapists use the chemotypes of oils for dierent medicinal purposes and must be aware that they may have di erent safety concerns. It is helpful to have the various chemotypes you are discussing available for the students to smell. The impact of smelling Thyme ct thymol versus Thyme ct linalool helps hammer in the concept of chemotypes and the importance of the issue.Continued.....page 18 growing. Teaching the Chemistry of Essential Oils: Why Bother? Andrea Butje, Certified Clinical Aromatherapist \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 20Continued.....page 214. Putting it all together: Chemical family theory . A solid background in the chemistry of essential oils will add new dimensions to the student's blending abilities. Share the following concepts with students: Essential oils are composed of natural plant chemical components (also called constituents). These components are physical substances that can have some measurable therapeutic activity, sometimes validated through research. A GC/MS analysis of an essential oil gives us a list of components that are present in that oil, along with the exact percentages of each component present. Essential oils can have very few or more than 200 components. I give the students a list of chemical families and common components found in each family. Every component on the list belongs to one speci c chemical family (with a few exceptions like eugenol which belongs to both the Phenols and Ether chemical families). I explain that they are going to be studying ten chemical families, each of which has its own list of components. Under each chemical family there are many chemical names; these are the chemical components. I ask them to look on the list and nd a chemical component, such as a-pinene. I point out that on their handout they see ten headings in bold. Monoterpenes, Sesquiterpenes, and so on. I tell them that these are called chemical families and that a chemical family is a grouping of chemical components based on speci c similarities in their molecular structure (also called their functional group). For example, all Monoterpenols have a functional group, called a hydroxyl group, attached to a 10-carbon backbone. Depending on the structure of molecules the essential oil contains, it is classi ed into a speci c chemical family or several chemical families. Some oils are made up of primarily one chemical family (like lemon which contains 90-95% Monoterpenes), while others are made up of two or more signi cant chemical families (lavender). Each chemical family is associated with certain generalized therapeutic properties. For some of the families we can make broad generalizations about the therapeutic properties. For others we cannot. We begin by generalizing to start the learning process and introduce an understanding of essential oils from a chemical family perspective. This way, the student develops a system for blending more e ectively for speci c health issues. Of course, there are many limitations to the chemical family theory and we discuss those at length as well. Along with the chemical families, some of the individual components have been researched and have been found to have speci c therapeutic activity associated with them. I give them a list of all the components with known, researched therapeutic activity. Classifying essential oils according to their chemical families can help us understand the activity of an essential oil. This classi cation also helps us to understand why several oils can have the same basic properties. If three oils all possess the same chemical family and many of the same constituents, we can guess that some of their therapeutic activities might be similar. This goes a long way in providing us with good choices for combining essential oils to make a potent and e ective blend. Continued.....page 19Teaching the Chemistry of Essential Oils: Why Bother? Andrea Butje, Certified Clinical Aromatherapist \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 21Continued.....page 20 Another advantage to understanding the chemical families and the individual components is safety. Most of the safety concerns of essential oils are based in chemistry, dose and usage. As you understand the chemistry of essential oils, the safety concerns become increasingly clear and easy to understand. As you study an oil, it is always helpful to look at its GC/MS in order to see which chemical families and components are present in signi cant percentages. This will help you understand some of the behavior of the oil. Shelf Life: Monoterpenes oxidize more rapidly so oils high in monoterpenes, like expressed Citrus oils and Pine, have shorter shelf life. Getting to know the qualities of a chemical family is like getting to know a new friend. We can make generalizations about their personality that usually hold true, and there are always quite a few interesting exceptions. We discuss all the exceptions we are aware of, and how the generalizations about chemical families can also be limiting. We use these generalizations as a starting point in our learning, and modify our understanding as we go along. SummaryTeaching basic essential oil chemistry helps the student understand the following: shelf life molecular structure the chemical family theory chemotypes GC/MS some therapeutic properties of essential oils most safety issuesWorking knowledge of essential oil chemistry can facilitate the student's ability to follow up-to-date oil research, which can be a very useful way to keep aromatherapy education fresh and current. An understanding of chemistry empowers the student and provides an e ective way to develop a deeper relationship with essential oils. I encourage you to share essential oil chemistry with your students through creative, hands-on teaching methods. Andrea Butje has been teaching courses in the therapeutic uses of essential oils since 1995. After co-founding the successful Finger Lakes School of Massage in Ithaca NY, Andrea developed Aromahead Institute and the scienti cally-based 200-hour Aromatherapy Certi cation Program approved by the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists. She also designed the exclusive Aromahead Institutes Scholars Program, a 400-hour Aromatherapy Certi cation Program. By working directly with distillers around the world and participating in research and teaching, Andrea remains on top of current issues and trends in the growing practice of Aromatherapy.

I agree, but I think one small word needs to be added - there is a lack of published research. However, there is a wealth of clinical observa tion that goes unrecognised because no one documents it in a way that conven tional medicine would accept. However, that could change. The humble case-study, that is what we take every time we see a client, is the basis for a case-series. The case-series is the basis for a clinical trial. A clinical trial is the basis for the randomised, placebo-controlled trial that conven tional medicine loves so much. So, how does this work? Well, you may begin with just a hunch and you try it on yourself. It works! Then you try it on a friend or one of your family members. It works! Now you are ready to try it on a client (with their consent). This study needs to be carefully observed and documented. More case-studies follow. Then, when you are absolutely sure of the exact essential oil/s you want to use (and the percentage) for the outcome you want to achieve, you are ready for a case-series. During this study, every person receives exactly the same treatment. The case-series may only have 6-10 people in it, but it becomes the evidence base for a clinical trial. A clinical trial is where someone other than you does either the treatment or the analysis of the outcome. This is to ensure that you can't be accused of bias. Finally the clinical trial - some times called a pilot study, leads to the randomised, placebo-controlled trial that has a lot of rules and regula tions. I can write about that in another ar ticle if anyone is interested. The thing to remember is that it all begins with the humble case-study! The single case-study is important enough for the US government (who give out hundreds of millions of dollars each year for research into CAM) to ask the Oce of Cancer: Complementary and Alterna tive Medicine to put a sample case-study on their website because they have been ac tively recrui ting for best case-studies for funding! Imagine if all aromatherapists agreed on a set format for a case-study database. Imagine if that set format was set up in a so ftware program - something like Filemaker - so the details of each case-study could be entered into that database. Imagine if the database was coded into headaches, skin complaints, sleep disorders, menstrual problems and so on. Imagine that each condi tion was rated on a visual analogue Con tinued.....page 23The Humble Case Study: Gold Dust at your Fingers!

Now imagine that anyone who has a recognised aromatherapy cer tication could enter his/her own case-studies and anyone could search this resource. I hope you are ge tting excited about the poten tial we have if we combined our e orts. United we stand, divided we fall. So that leads me on to the 'perfect case-study' format that could form the basis of those going to be entered into a database. Case-StudyYou need to be focused, precise and objec tive. It is like writing a recipe. Someone else needs to be able to do exactly what you did. There should be a con rmed documented diagnosis from a cer tied health care practitioner. There should also be a documented history of the disease that will include: Conventional Treatment or other CAM 1. History of disease/symptoms plus dates 2. Exact treatments tried (drug, dosage, time frame), success or failure3. Current status in as much detail as possible - blood pressure, pulse, temp, any medical results, WBCC, ESR (blood tests where relevant)4. No concurrent (including other CAM treatment) that could confound (confuse) the outcome*5. Detailed outline of current regime: drugs, diet, sleep, stress6.

This has been one of the criticisms about aromatherapy as o ften massage is also used. Is the e ect caused by the massage, the oils being absorbed through the skin, inhaling the essential oils, or all of the above? If you use a mixture of essential oils, you will not know if all, some or the combination has produced the e ect. Music can also confound the outcome, as can scented candles, so avoid those.

St. James Burton, GRMT, LMBT \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 26I came into aroma- therapy class thinking, \"Oh well. This will be a fun little course. No hard work!\" Boy was I wrong. I started the Professional Level I class at Greenville Technical College in Greer, SC under the instructor Barbara (Shellie) Enteen, South Carolina Director and Vice President of the Na tional Associa tion for Holis tic Aromatherapy (NAHA). As soon as the class started we began to discuss the topic of quality and purity of essential oils. For some reason I was entranced and fascinated by how delicate and thorough the process of obtaining true essen tial oils is and should be. Our class had a student kit with oils from what I will call Company 1. Our instructor had a larger, more expensive kit with oils from this company and another new one that would be providing the oils in the future, Company 2. Wondering how pure the oils from Com-pany 1 and Company 2 were, I decided to do some research. The rst thing that stuck out about Company 1's oils was the prices. For an ounce of essen tial oils, the price was below the majority of the other companies I viewed online. That was the red flag for me. Company 2 was my next hurdle. Prior to this inves tigation, I had spoken with another prestigious aromatherapist in the southeast region and she gave me informa tion about Company 2. She had explained to me that the founder of Company 2 acquires oils from someone in Europe, another famous aromatherapist. She also gave me some inter-esting informa tion about a di erent well known com- pany (Company 3) owner that had apparently at one point acquired his oils from Company 2. Upon hearing this, I attempted to contact the European company owner and con rm these ndings about both Com- pany 2 and the owner of Company 3 resourcing their oils through him. Unfortunately he would not give me the informa tion saying that it was \"unethical to disclose the details (regarding their) customers or make comments regarding other companies.\" (Ed., brackets mine.) However, understanding ethics from being a massage therapist, I respected his response and moved down one link on the chain to approach both of these com-panies directly. I contacted the founder of Company 2's granddaughter who is also a sales representa tive for the company. She con rmed all of the informa tion I had previously received and also assured me that their essen tial oils were tested by an independent lab and that I could get results for speci c oils, but said she would not divulge the name of the lab. The fact that she was so honest and open with me about answering my ques tions made me feel very secure about the purity of my current Company 2 oils. Now, I attempted to contact the famous Company 3 owner. I was informed that there was no way for me to contact the company owner directly and that for prod-uct questions I must e-mail Product Services. Ques- tions for the company owner were to be sent to Customer Service at which time they would forward the e-mail to his personal assistant. My rst e-mail went to Product Services with the following ques-tions: 1. How many di erent types of tes ting do your essen- tial oils undergo and what are the tests? 2. How many di erent independent tes ting sites do you send your oils to and what are the names of the testing sites? Continued.....page 27 A Pure Journey Dr. Rev. St. James Burton, GRMT, LMBT \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 27Continued.....page 26 1. Can I request the tes ting results for the individual oils I buy from each of the tes ting facilities? 2. How do I know from what countries these essen tial oils originate? 3. How do I know if the essen tial oils were wild-crafted or organically cul tivated? 4. Is there anything you could send or tell me now that would further convince me that your oils are the best I can buy? After receiving a reply and reading through it, I was very disappointed. I was told they do very extensive testing which includes: Physical Density, Op tical Rotation and Refrac tive Index, and Chemical GC/MS Testing. Wonderful, right? Wrong. The reason being because I was informed that I could not receive these test results because they are \"unique in how [they] distill their oils\" and this informa tion would appear on the testing results so they can't reveal the results or they would also reveal their secret process to competitors. My problem though is that, as a prospective customer, if I can't read the results, how do I know they are what they say they are? I was also told that all tes ting is done \"in-house\"! Well isn't that comforting?! Not really. Yes it's cheaper for the company but the results can also be easily manipulated. Oh, and the other problem with this is that this company has representa tives that claim the oils are tested by AFNOR and ISO. However, the company when ques tioned said all their oils meet AFNOR and ISO Standards. According to the company they also own or supervise all the farms from which they attain their oils. In answering my organic and wild-crafted question, I was told \"The reason why our oils are not 100% cer tied organic is due to the fact that we occasionally import some oils from di erent countries. As most of these countries do not have organic standards set or organic standards that match the US standards, we are unable to cer tify them organic.\" My ques tion is, if they supervise all of the farms, how is it that they themselves cannot cer tify whether or not the oils are organic due to their own growing methods? Regardless of whether or not the country has organic standards, they are impor ting them to the USA and they are supervised by their own US company. Finally, at the bo ttom of the e-mail I was assured their essen tial oils are \"therapeu tic-grade\". (This is a terminology which is not accepted as legitimate by the aromatherapy industry.) Apparently what makes their oils \"therapeu tic-grade\" is: 1. \"Excep tional soil\" - Whoa. What? They mean to tell me there are giant trucks impor ting and expor ting this \"exceptional soil\" to all these countries where they grow all these plants for their oils? I had an interes ting moment imagining these caravans of dirt, ceaselessly on the move. Continued....page28A Pure Journey Dr. Rev. St. James Burton, GRMT, LMBT \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 28Continued.....page 27 1. \"[They] make every e ort to preserve \"nature's living energy\" in a manner as close to its natural state as possible.\" - Ok, then why is Oregano the only wild-crafted oil they o er? I would have to say that wild-crafted would be as \"close to its natural state\" as you can get, right? 2. \"Unadulterated, uncut and totally free of chemicals, pes ticides and metals.\" - Well if that's the case why can these oils not be cer tied organic? Isn't that what organic means? Things get interes ting when the buyer is educated and can think for themselves. All in all, the buyer must make the nal decision. If you are interested in obtaining pure, quality essen tial oils, take what I have said here and use it to pose ques tions to your current supplier and make sure YOU are sa tised. Don't go by what anyone else tells you. You are the aromatherapist, so it is up to you to do the work to protect yourself, your clients and ul timately our profession. Knowing I am buying top quality, pure essen tial oils enhances the good feeling I have when working with them for myself and for others. Dr. Rev.

Since I have been an LMT for over 25 years and an Aromatherapist for over 20 (and now an RA) who has also been a teacher in the massage program at a local community college and also wrote and taught a professional and an intro- duction to Aromatherapy course there for the past three years, it was with great interest that I read the new textbook by Jade Shutes and Chris tina Weaver that was created to cover both of these bases. Aromatherapy is a natural adjunct to massage and some say massage is the best way to deliver an essential oil session. I have seen amazing things happen through aromatherapy massage and bodywork and I do hope that massage schools everywhere will realize that their students need more than a two or three hour class on working with essential oils and will adopt a quali ed program and use a text such as this one, as a way for their students to get the vital prepara tion they need to work with aromatherapy safely and e ectively. \"Aromatherapy for Bodyworkers\" is a wonderful showcase for all the extensive aromatherapy information and knowledge Jade Shutes has collected over her many years in the eld. There is no one who could fail to appreciate and acknowledge the range of her educa tion and experience and those she acknowledges as her teachers and mentors. In wri ting a book that focuses on bodyworkers, she has engaged the input of Chris tina Weaver, who seems to have a lot of good creden tials and experience in the holis tic health eld.

It would be easy for an instructor to make this complicated and detailed informa tion available to students in a way they can understand without the kind of confusion that certain areas (like chemistry) can create. There are also chapters that make this a wonderful book for those who focus on the spa industry. There is an illustrated example of an aromatherapy face massage treatment and a chapter on how to go about setting up a prac tice. Truly all bases are covered in a very clear way, including the way to break down costs (often not discussed in basic aromatherapy classes) and with the inclusion of 'new terminology' lists, worksheets and chapter tests that make homework assignments an easy task. If I would change anything about the book's format it is the loca tion of the informa tion on the speci c essences themselves and the idea of trea ting some in depth and others in a shortened version. This information is in the last chapter and the essences themselves have been named many times earlier in the book in lists for various reasons (from blending tips to addressing certain client complaints). As a teacher of Aromatherapy, I would like to see the student engaged in ge tting a good understanding of the essences themselves before they start doing blends and bodywork. And it isn't clear why certain essences (bergamot, grapefruit, jasmine, lemongrass) were in the 'short version' category while others (black pepper, fennel, patchouli) get the longer version and the way these sec tions follow each other in the same chapter is a li ttle confusing if one is looking an essence up alphabe tically. I also wondered why I missed seeing certain familiar safety data for certain oils. Which brings me to the one thing regarding content that, as a Professional Member who is on the Board of NAHA and as such, following NAHA safety educa tion guidelines, I do need to ques tion. In one chapter, undiluted use of essences on the skin is described as unsafe prac tice but Chapter 8 contains a list of oils that are said to be safe to use undiluted and an insert which discusses the controversy among aroma- therapists over dilu tion which engages the reader not to 'live in fear' but to \"work toward gaining a greater understanding of the poten tial bene ts\" of undiluted use. Where I can see how this kind of discussion could be appropriate in a professional journal ar ti cle or a presentation at a conference, I ques tion if en- couraging a beginner to make this kind of judgment and to experiment without a greater founda tion and experience with essen tial oils truly supports the purpose of the text. This expression of a personal point of view is not in keeping with the scholarly, researched tone of the rest of the book. The inclusion of endangered oils such as sandalwood and frankincense might be understood by the 2008 copyright. One would expect to see an explana tion of endangered oils in a revised version. Having said this, all in all, \"Aromatherapy for Bodyworkers\" is a book that both Jade Shutes and Christina Weaver can be very proud of authoring and one which, in the hands of a quali ed instructor, would be extremely useful.

More people are choosing a simpli-ed lifestyle, and they are looking to the natural health industry for sup- port and guidance. The aromatherapy industry holds a tremendous growth opportunity when we consider all the areas in which this discipline is bene cial. As aromatherapists, we have the opportunity to grow along with the industry. To do this, it is important that you establish your own business model which includes understand-ing the aromatherapy community as a whole and what your speci c contribu tion will be. Your a ttitude and the ways in which you deliver informa tion have a profound impact on the aromatherapy community as a whole. To maximize your success, it is essen tial that you understand these concepts, the bigger picture, and create your personal business model with them in mind. The aromatherapy industry has a lot of work to do to ght the myths regarding aromatherapy and the plethora of inferior products sold every day to consumers by larger companies interested in capitaliz-ing on the term \"aromatherapy\" without actually producing a true aromatherapy product. Consumers are unknowingly purchasing inferior products which cannot provide the therapeu tic property intended. In turn they pass o aromatherapy as ine ective and the aromatherapy industry loses credibility. Becoming an aromatherapist indicates that someone has naturally been drawn to the botanical world, understood its value and decided to get educated. As aromatherapists, it is our responsibility to inform customers or clients about the true discipline of aromatherapy. Unfortunately, many aromatherapists I've met don't fully understand the power in the wealth of knowledge at their disposal and so hesitate to educate the public. However, many in the general public would welcome and embrace this knowledge if the proper principles were shown to them. Unless we do our part in correc ting the common mispercep tions of aromatherapy, we cannot end the confusion that surrounds our industry. This is why our dedica tion to supporting our clients with true aromatherapy educa- tion is so essen tial to the growth and credibility of the aromatherapy industry. As an aromatherapist, you are more of an expert than you think (given that you follow the ethical guide-lines), and the educa tion you have is very valuable, possibly even essen tial, to the interested consumer. The knowledge you hold may seem basic and obvious to you but it is a treasure to a great many that are beginning their aromatherapy journey. Learn to trust that the knowledge you have is valuable to people. Before you can build your business model, the rst thing to recognize is that you are a representa tive of the greater industry as a whole. Cherish this knowl-edge and strive to make the industry proud. As you flourish, there will be a mul titude of grateful people that are able to have be tter lifestyles. Once you embrace your responsibility and dedica tion to the greater aromatherapy community and accept that the knowledge you have is of substance, you do need to think about how you will deliver your mes-sage. There is a myriad of ways to use essen tial Con tinued.....page 32 The Aromatherapy Business Offers Practitioners Many Opportunities Rose Chard, LMT \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 32Continued.....page 31 oils and aromatherapy as a lifestyle. There are many essential oils out there and at least twelve di erent ways of applying them such as in carriers, a bath, in diusers. Similarly, essen tial oils can be used for skin and beauty, fragrance or well-being. Then consider other aspects of aromatherapy such as safety, pro les of individual oils, methods of absorp tion, therapeu tic properties, deciphering pure oils from synthe tics, dealing with inaccurate informa tion and dubious products with aromatherapy labeling and so forth. Even these aromatherapy basics are an incredible amount of informa tion to absorb. Make no mistake - aromatherapy is a discipline, but it is a worthy one. Newcomers will not immediately be able to grasp the full concept of aromatherapy and you will be unable to communicate this informa tion without a good business model. First, decide what your area of focus will be and then build a strong base around that. You may decide you want to focus on a small aspect of the aromatherapy industry or encompass mul tiple aspects. For example, aromatherapy educa tion, retail, consul ting, manufacturing your own products, or using the principles of aromatherapy to increase the quality and the value of the services you provide in conjunc tion with another related discipline such as massage therapy. Many massage therapists don't think twice about the massage lo tion or oil they use on their clients and look for the cheapest or the most comfortable to apply. It may not occur to them that most of the standard massage oils and lo tions on the market are packed with preserva tives and ar ticial fragrances. (Interes tingly, they are doing the most damage to themselves as their skin is absorbing the lotion every day with every massage.) And some massage therapists are using quality products including pure essen tial oils but not taking the opportunity to promote this fact and the extra care they are giving their clients. A massage therapist with aromatherapy training should make it very clear to clients that their service has that addi tional value. Unless it is for promo tional reasons, a massage therapist should not o er aromatherapy for free as it removes the value that true aromatherapy has to oer as an industry. There is a great opportunity for massage therapists to educate the public and reclaim the percep tion of aromatherapy as well as derive direct compensa tion for the body work. The massage therapist might want to begin with creating a selec tion of pre-made blends that clients can choose from, such as a muscle blend for those who complain about fa tigued muscles, a relaxa tion blend for those who need to unwind and so forth. Take the time to consider your choice of blends and then add them to a cold pressed carrier oil - and consider avoiding the use of any carrier oil which may cause a reac tion for clients who have peanut allergies. Once you have your blends, you can promote them on a laminated sheet presented to clients before the treatment. Indicate that an extra charge will be added for the blends. If a client asks what the bene t of aromatherapy is you have the opportunity to educate them. For example, \"Our muscle rub is made of ginger, black pepper, clove etc. This blend will help warm the area and bring blood to your sore muscles more quickly... essen tial oils, which should not be confused with fragrance oils, have known therapeu tic properties ...\" Or perhaps your client wants to relax, in which case you might say, \"Would you like to try the lavender blend? Lavender does a wonderful job of relaxing your nervous system and has a very comforting aect.\" Con tinued.....page 33 The Aromatherapy Business Offers Practitioners Many Opportunities Rose Chard, LMT \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 33Continued.....page 32 Even if your client declines the blend you've s till educated them a bit and they will know that you follow true aromatherapy principles. Those clients that do add the aromatherapy op tion, will no tice how much the aromatherapy enhanced their massage and appreciate that you took the time to discuss your aromatherapy exper tise with them. Your clients will also appreciate knowing that you are using quality essen tial oils and quality carrier oils. If you are providing your clients these services without promoting it, then you are missing a terri c opportunity to set yourself apart from other businesses. Worse s till, your clients will not know the important added bene ts you oer. Whether you are a massage therapist, cosmetologist or are involved in another aspect of the industry, it is a good idea to take time to think about where you want to focus your e orts. Do not be overwhelmed with having to incorporate everything if there are areas that are not relevant to you. Some companies have built their en tire business based on one essen tial oil - an impressive feat! Whatever area of aromatherapy interests you, always keep in mind that the focus should not be quan tity over quality. If you are going to do something, do it correctly. This will serve you well in di erentiating what you o er from other services and products out there. If you are o ering quality aromatherapy products or services, then s tick to that commitment. It is important to be discerning in your own purchasing because you need to keep an eye on the nances in your business. However, purchasinginferior products to save a buck will not make you successful. Quality products and services will speak for themselves. Keeping costs down with quality stock is harder so consider star ting out with a smaller stock of well chosen quality products. A less obvious bene t of this approach is that because there are more people using inferior quality products there is a lot of compe tition among those who work with inferior products. Happily, when you maintain a high standard of quality in your products, you will nd yourself facing less compe tition. We men tioned earlier that there are many misconcep tions regarding aromatherapy. One is that aromatherapy is \" flu\" and is all about fragrance only or relates to ambiguous, foolish new age jargon like \"unleash your inner goddess.\" I am sure you have heard a response like the following when discussing aromatherapy: \"Oh, I am not into smells\", or \"I have a friend that is into new age stu but that's not my thing.\" I can tell you, I have encountered many people like this my career - both male and female. In most cases, when I explained aromatherapy in more accurate and realis tic terms, many of these same people ended up becoming the biggest users of essential oils. Continued.....page 34The Aromatherapy Business Offers Practitioners Many Opportunities Rose Chard, LMT \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reserved 34Continued.....page 33 Before you can begin successfully selling your service or product, you need to understand what aspect of the aromatherapy business you are marke ting to and who populates that market. Ask ques tions such as: Where do I prac tice? What is my typical demographic? How many people do I want to appeal to? For example my company, Your Body Needs, is located just outside Washington DC. Most of the clientele in this area work long hours, are middle to upper income and are generally not considered 'laid back' types. We have had great success explaining the basics of aromatherapy from a simple academic approach rather than a more ethereal one. We may say something like, \"the essen tial oil of ginger and black pepper in our muscle rub encourages be tter circulation and brings blood to an area more quickly.\" Most of our clients would not relate to a sentence like \"ginger oil will s timulate the yang energy of the kidneys.\" We have made rm decisions about what is important to us as a company and how we want to represent the business of aromatherapy. We made these decisions based on who we are, what we o er and who our target audience is. This will be a very helpful approach for you to consider when beginning a business. Even though it is important to have your business re flect you, it is equally as important to assess what your clients or customers really need or want and nd how to integrate both. It is an exci ting time to be in this wonderful industry. There is tremendous poten tial to succeed if you are respectful of the discipline as a whole, accept that the knowledge you have is valuable and that people will bene t from it, have clarity on how you will communicate your message and execute your services or products in a focused and professional way.

She wished to check on the safety, validity, and e cacy of using large doses of undiluted essential oils on the spine to correct scoliosis due to it being caused by a \"virus harboring in the spine\" (a.k.a. Rain Drop Technique, or Therapy, RDT). Part 1 attempted to cover what scoliosis is based on current medical community de nitions regarding currently known causes, and possible cures; and it addressed why a massive dose of essen tial oils may not be the best treatment. We introduced Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae (SET), founded by Don McCann, which denes and treats scoliosis based on a structural core distortion of the pelvis and spine that forms as the fetus develops. (See Note 1). Four case studies previously published by Don McCann were presented as well including one dealing with a child. In this installment Sylla shares the bene ts of having had the therapy herself, and will show how adding Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae to her aromatherapy massage prac tice has re ned her skills so she can address acute and chronic pain. In addi tion Don will also describe how the Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae techniques will e ectively resolve scoliosis problems for each of the cases that were described in the rst installment. Let us review our scoliosis cases from the last issue. Shirley, a 35-year-old mother of three children, was referred to me for low back pain that developed a fter the delivery of her third child. She reported that she had been doing a lot of li fting of all three of her children ages 5 years, 3 years, and 6 months, and that her back was ge tting worse. In addi tion, she had complications during the last month of her pregnancy, so the doctor had insisted that she stay in bed and o her feet as much as possible. She brought her chiroprac tic x-rays that showed a narrowing of the disc space in the lumbar region with some arthri tic spurring already developing, a scolio tic curvature of her entire spine and signi cant rota tion of her iliums, one anterior, one posterior resul ting in a tipped sacrum. It was obvious that Shirley could not stop li fting her children, but she needed relief from her back pain as soon as possible. Jason, a 49-year-old accountant, had been rear-ended in an auto accident two years ago while si tting at a stop light. He had been receiving chiroprac tic care ever since the accident un til his insurance was depleted. His diagnosis was a flexion/extension injury of the cervical spine with a slight hernia tion between C3-C4 and a bulging disc between C7-T1. In addi tion, his x-rays showed a signi cant degree of scoliosis of his entire spine with the rota tion of the iliums and tippage of the sacrum. The chiroprac tic notes indicated treatment of the flexion/extension injuries of the neck only, and no men tion or diagnosis of the scoliosis in the thoracic and lumbar spine. The discs that were injured were at the greatest degree of the scoliotic curvature. Jason came to me because a friend of his had insisted that Don could help him, and since his PIP had run out insurance no longer covered chiroprac tic care. The sad part is that, even though he had two years of treatment, he only had minimal improvement and was now also experiencing severe headaches. He needed some e ective therapy. Continued.....page 37\u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedScoliosis: Effective Alternative Methods of Treatment Part 2 Sylla Sheppard-Hanger, LMT and Don McCann MA, LMHC, LMT, CSETT 37Continued.....page 36 Carol, aged 13, was brought to me by her mother a fter she had been picked out of a school scoliosis screening and was referred to a neurosurgeon for possible surgical interven tion. The parents were scared when they saw that Harrington rods were part of the surgical interven tion suggested for their daughter's scoliosis. The x-rays and MRI's that conrmed the scoliosis showed a more than 40 degree scolio tic curvature. The neurosurgeon had told them that since she was in a growth spurt this would probably progress to somewhere around 50-60 degrees by the end of her normal growth and would leave her incapable of bearing children. Carol was reasonably athle tic and really wanted to join the high school girls' volleyball team as she was already 5'10\" and played very well. She only occasionally complained of back pain or any discomfort. However, she shared her parent's concern about the prognosis of dire pain, disc degenera tion and inability to carry a child due to the scoliosis. Anita, a 63- year-old massage therapist who had been practicing for 20 years, came for sessions because of a sizeable dowagers hump and inability to stand up straight. A fter a bone density test she was told by her doctor that she had osteoporosis and was collapsing into a scolio tic curvature of her spine. Other than reinforcing her bone mass with medica tion and exercises, there was li ttle else she could do. In addition, they informed her that the scolio tic collapse was irreversible, and that chiroprac tic manipula tions might cause fractures of her weakening spine. They also told her that she would have to quit doing massage because the scolio tic collapse and fractures of the spine would worsen almost immediately. Having been a massage therapist for 20 years, Anita had heard of the so ft tissue work that Don does and wanted to know if the scolio tic curvature of her spine could be rehabilitated so she could con tinue doing the massage she loved. Now let's look at the way that Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae techniques e ectively address the rehabilita tion of each of these cases. Shirley had lost a great deal of the tonus in her intrinsic muscles that had previously counter balanced her scoliosis a fter having a month's bed rest. In addition, the spreading of her pelvis during the birth process had further rotated the iliums and weakened the ilium/sacrum rela tionship causing her left ilium to move even further into anterior rota tion and the tippage of the sacrum to increase. The Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae techniques, which included the Cranial/Structural Core Distor tion Releases and the pelvic balancing protocol, were applied. These techniques addressed the anterior/posterior rota tion of the iliums and the tippage of the sacrum that were exaggerated during pregnancy and birth, along with the musculature of her hips, legs and abdomen. This unwound and released some of the lumbar curvature of the scoliosis resulting in a signi cant decrease in the scolio tic curvature and low back pain. Jason was experiencing most of his pain in his neck and shoulders due to his auto accident that had increased his scoliosis pu tting pressure on his cervical and lumbar discs. Structural evalua tion revealed an acute head forward posture, head tipped to the right, right shoulder medially rotated and dropped, le ft shoulder higher at the superior angle of the scapula, and a shortening of the back of his neck. This time the Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae Cranial/Structural Core Distortion techniques were applied integrated with the soft tissue Head, Neck and Shoulders protocol to address the neck and shoulder pain. The pectoralis muscles and the anterior neck muscles were treated rst to move the head and shoulders back out of the head forward collapse. This was followed by trea ting Con tinued.....page 38 \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedScoliosis: Effective Alternative Methods of Treatment Part 2 Sylla Sheppard-Hanger, LMT and Don McCann MA, LMHC, LMT, CSETT the shoulders and posterior neck. After several sess- ions the scoliosis in the rest of his spine became the limi ting factor and needed to be addressed by balancing his pelvis with the pelvic balancing protocol as in Shirley's case. Following that same sequence the ant- erior/posterior rotation of the iliums and tippage of the sacrum were addressed along with the hips, legs and abdomen which took the pressure o the curvatures in the spine and allowed his lumbar discs to heal. Carol, the 13-year-old, was in excellent shape being an athlete, but was facing a growth spurt that could increase the developing scoliosis. She also had a major anterior/posterior ilium rota tion with a substantial tippage in her sacrum, and her head was signicantly in front of her shoulders resul ting in a shortening of the back of her neck. Since Carol was constantly jumping up and down playing volleyball, balancing the iliums to support a balanced sacrum was the focus of the ini tial treatments. Without this support the curvature in her spine would have rapidly increased. As in the previous cases, Cranial/Structural Core Distor tion techniques and pelvic balancing protocol of Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae were applied to release the anterior/posterior rota tion of the iliums and tippage of the sacrum, and to treat the hips, legs and abdomen. A fter several sessions, the ilium rota tion was decreased, her sacrum was leveling out, and the curvature of her lumbar and thoracic spine was rapidly improving. It was now time to treat the neck and shoulders using the Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae head, neck and shoulder protocol to move her head and shoulders back and into balance with the pelvis. For the next four weeks the treatment alternated between the neck and shoulders and the low back. When Carol was re-evaluated, her scoliosis was in the 20 degree range and her parents were extremely pleased. Due to the fact that she was in a growth spurt, and ac tively jumping and jamming the sacrum, the treatment con tinued on a monthly basis for the next ve years. Her scolio tic curvature remained stable and she was able to have a college career in volleyball. Anita was aggrava ting her scolio tic condition by doing massage. Her structural evalua tion showed her head was far in front of her shoulders and the back of her neck had become very shortened. She had a very exaggerated dowager's hump from using her arms and locking her shoulders down while doing massage. This area was also where she experienced the most pain and di culty while doing massage. Therefore, initial treatments focused on releasing her internally rotated shoulders and anterior neck allowing her head to move back, then releasing the tops of her shoulders and back of the neck allowing her to straighten up and her shoulders to drop using the head, neck and shoulder protocol a fter the ini tial application of the Cranial/Structural Core Distor tion Releases. This also had a drama tic eect on reducing the size of her dowager's hump. It was then necessary to build support in her low back by balancing the iliums and reducing the tippage of her sacrum using the same sequences within the pelvic balancing protocol as in the other three cases. Another important detail for Anita was to change the height of her massage table so that her shoulders were not hiked up and her head was not thrust forward when she was doing her massages. Once this was accomplished she was able to maintain correct posture, and con tinued working even though the osteoporosis was s till in a degenera tive state and she was losing bone mass. With the scolio tic curvature greatly reduced, the pressure was now distributed evenly across the vertebral surfaces and no longer on the edges of her vertebrae which prevented the compression fractures. She was now able to enjoy giving massages again. When working with all four of these clients, the most eective method of working with the so ft tissue was the three-step approach which is the basis of all the soft tissue protocols of Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae. This involves 1) releasing the fluids and toxins to reduce in flammation and clear the trigger points, 2) applying directed myofascial unwinding strokes to release the myofascial holding pa tterns within the Con tinued.....page 39 d \u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedScoliosis: Effective Alternative Methods of Treatment Part 2 Sylla Sheppard-Hanger, LMT and Don McCann MA, fascia that held the distor tion of the structure, and 3) releasing individual bers, scar tissue and adhesions. This approach enabled each of the clients to be treated within their pain thresholds, in spite of the acuteness of the condi tion, and to have deep structural balancing work that might have been impossible without working slowly into the tissue in this manner. How can we add aromatherapy to this approach? There are several ways in which aromatherapy can be used in these treatments. Aromatherapy has the ability to help clear toxins and trigger points. The essential oils can also be used on the pain, soreness, and swelling that occurs for the cases previously mentioned. Since these are resolved cases, it is obvious that Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae (SET) stands alone just ne on its own. So, adding aromatherapy is an extra bonus. Having a pleasant smelling o ce and therapy room can put people at ease and make a good rst impression as well as keeping the air clean and fresh. This is most easily accomplished with an ultrasonic di user that adds a mist to the air, rather than a heated or air dispersal machine. Essen tial oils diused in the air can also help clear any energy that may be released during a session since the body work can release deep emotional energies that have been stored in the body. With some clients I can muscle test them using Robbi Zeck's Blossoming Heart book and chart for the essential oil they need. This is a simple method discussed later on in this paper, to iden tify what someone may need, using the body and applied kinesiology. Once I get their par ticular oil and give them a sni on a tissue I read out loud to them about the oil, and what it could mean for them. I may also intuit what it may mean and share if appropriate. Perhaps I may use that essen tial oil in their blend below as well, or give them some to work with later. During the actual SET therapy we use a thicker cream or butter to prevent sliding on the tissue as the movements are very slow and deep. I previously used fractionated coconut oil for typical massage, but now I prefer organic shea bu tter for this bodywork. Sometimes I will warm it up, or mix in coconut (raw) oil to make a thinner bu tter- either way it melts at body temperature and absorbs quickly into the body. Since I use a separate container for each treatment, I can easily add an essen tial oil or blend to use during the treatment, just as in any massage session. If there is any left, I give it to the client to use at home. Speci c blends can be used either to address immediate pain or swelling along with the bodywork, or just for a pleasant scent while working. Some times clients will come in wishing to work on an issue such as clarity or compassion. Together we can choose the oil that speaks to them and use that in the session to facilitate the work on those issues. The blend or oil can be sent home with the client for later use, including sore areas of the body where the SET therapist worked, or anywhere there may s till be some pain. Essen tial oils I have found useful for pain are: helichrysum and lavender, lavandin, rosemary camphor, peppermint. For in flammation a combination of blue tansy and helichrysum work wonders along with German Chamomile, yarrow and others. An ti spasm oils like Roman chamomile, petitgrain, sweet marjoram, and lemon eucalyptus would be good on any acute spasm. All of these would be properly diluted of course! (10% or less is su cient if working a small area). The muscle tes ting or kinesiology is part of the twelve class program of the SET training. This is how we conrm what we see structurally in the body in the initial body reading. This single tool has taken the guesswork out of my treatments. This was not new to me as I learned Touch for Health in the 1980's. I have had it used on me during chiroprac tic treatments in the past, and more recently I re-learned it in Robbie Zeck's awesome Aroma tic Kinesiology class several years ago. This changed the way I decide what essential oils to use on people- (barring an emergency of course, or when trea ting a physical illness, acute pain, wound, etc.) A fter that class I am now able to use the chart in the book to muscle test and ask the body to determine which category: Emo tional, Mental, Spiritual, or Physical, and then to narrow down to one oil. I then use an Energe tic Oil kit Marge Clark (naturesgi ft.com) put together to give a sample of the diluted oil on a tissue while we read what the oil is saying to them. They always say it is right on! That method really cut my work in half. It also showed me that what I may think they need is one thing and what their body tests for is something else! This simple method works very well at health fairs and trade shows to give someone a quick reading on an essential oil they may need and an insight on a personal issue. Personally, having experienced Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae and then learning the techniques has transformed my life in several ways. Since I was about 14 I have su ered on and o with low back pain, and Con tinued.....page 40\u00a9 Copyright 2010 NAHA All rights reservedScoliosis: Effective Alternative Methods of Treatment Part 2 Sylla Sheppard-Hanger, LMT and Don McCann MA, LMHC, LMT, CSETT 40Continued.....page 39 was diagnosed early on with a birth defect that allowed my vertebrae to shi ft, especially when lying down. During my work as massage therapist and aroma therapist I tried every therapy (chiroprac tic, neuromuscular, Rol ng, etc) and every essen tial oil to no avail. I was s till in some pain most of the time. In 2005 I nally heard my daughter Nyssa's voice saying I needed to try the SET therapy (she had seen it at massage school), but it was when I read a case study that could have been my story in one of Don McCann's ar ticles that I called to set an appointment. Thus began my un-winding from my own Core Distortion, old pa tterns, thoughts and beliefs, and stued emotions that I have held onto all these years. After a year of receiving the therapy and realizing the potential to be pain free, I asked my daughter to take the training guring she could take care of me. During her rst year I realized I was referring my clients to her because I could not get them out of pain and she could. Thus, I signed up for the program to learn myself what I needed to progress, and to nish the bodywork I needed to be pain free! I also realized that sometimes it is not good for a family member to work on another, so I needed others to work on me. Now have a network of SET therapists who will trade with me. It took some time for my body to respond, but today I can easily move, dance, and exercise without fear of something pulling and, more importantly, without pain!! I am the most balanced I have ever been in all areas because when you balance the structure, everything moves more readily into place. I'm no longer slightly irritated with a nagging ache. I can sit and meditate for an hour without pain. I am s till in amazement that I can live the rest of my life with no discomfort, having previously thought I would always be in pain due to buying into the beliefs about being older and having arthri tis, etc. Going back to school at 58 years old was not easy, but I was commi tted. I am fascinated with this therapy and want to make it part of my work along with the essential oils. I con tinually learn about myself as I go through these classes, and feel I have a higher level of professionalism, much more self-con dence and nally the ability to help others out of acute and chronic pain. SET has transformed my business as well, gaining more clients because I can do more than just a relaxing aromatherapy massage now. I already have some good success cases of ge tting people out of pain quickly that refer me more business. In the next installment and we will go more in depth into other areas of combining essen tial oils and Structural Energe tic therapy\u00ae such as the au tism work I have already begun, and how SET works to facilitate the feeling of well being on other levels with emotional energy release. NOTE 1: Structural Energe tic Therapy\u00ae or SET (www.structuralenerge tictherapy.com). SET has been developed over 30 years by Don McCann and is constantly in a state of evolu tion. SET is a rehabilita tive therapy which integrates Cranial/Structural Core Distortion Releases with speci c deep so ft tissue protocols designed to address and release the so ft tissue holding pa tterns of the core distor tion and structural sub-patterns that cause painful condi tions and dysfunction. These so ft tissue protocols include postural analysis, directed myofascial unwinding and individual ber strokes, scar tissue and adhesion release, along with other Cranial/Structural releases speci c to each structural pa ttern distor tion. Emotional energy releases are also used to release the tensions within the body holding the distor tions. The SET Therapist rst addresses the primary area of discomfort using these protocols, and then releases any restric tions causing imbalances in the other areas of the body so the improved alignment is supported. When this is accomplished, the whole structure supports balance and func tion, and maximum rehabilita tion is achieved. SET compliments standard medical treatments and chiroprac tic, both as a primary therapy and an adjunct therapy.
