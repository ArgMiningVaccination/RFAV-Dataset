Methods: The survey was designed by an international team, translated and adapted to simplied Chi- nese, including 132 kinds of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation recommended by guidelines. It was distributed and collected from February to May 2021, with data analysed by WPS spreadsheet and wjx.cn. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographics and clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatments, preventative behaviours and interventions, and their associated outcomes. Results: The survey was accessed 503 times with 341 (67.8%) completions covering 23 provinces and four municipalities in China. Most (282/341, 82.7%) respondents reported no symptoms during the pan- demic and the majority (290/341, 85.0%) reported having a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test at some point. Forty-ve (13.2%) reported having a respiratory infection, among which 19 (42.2%) took one or more categories of modern medicine, e.g. painkillers, antibiotics; 16 (35.6%) used TCM interventions(s); while seven respon- dents combined TCM with modern medicine. All respondents reported using at least one behavioural or medical approach to prevention, with 22.3% taking TCM and 5.3% taking modern medicines. No respon- dents reported having a critical condition related to COVID-19. Conclusion: We found evidence of widespread use of infection control behaviours, modern medicines and TCM for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and other respiratory symptoms. Larger scale studies are warranted, including a more representative sample exploring TCM preparations recommended in clinical guidelines. \u00a92 0 2 1 Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine.

Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until September 13 th 2021, there have been more than 224 million conrmed cases, including 3 million deaths reported on the World Health Organisation website 1 . Most people diagnosed with COVID- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2021.100798 2213-4220/\u00a9 2021 Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ Integrative Medicine Research 10 (2021) 100798 19 experienced mild to moderate respiratory illness and the most common symptoms include fever, dry cough and tiredness 2-7 . As for current treatments of COVID-19 patients with mild symp- toms, WHO guidelines recommend that they should be isolated and given symptomatic treatment including antipyretics for fever and pain, adequate nutrition and appropriate rehydration 9 . Differ- ing from WHO guidelines, Chinese guidelines recommend not only symptomatic and anti-viral treatments, but also traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) such as Qingfeipaidu Decoction and Hanshiyi De- coction 6-8 For people with severe or critical COVID-19 10 , current evidence indicates that corticosteroids, remdesivir, hydroxychloro- quine, lopinavir/ ritonavir and interferon may have some effects on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay 9 , 11-14 . For public health and suspected cases, quarantine is an effec- tive way to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and other pan- demics 15 . Other behavioural control methods, such as physical dis- tancing, wearing a mask, hand washing, keeping rooms well ven- tilated, avoiding crowds, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue could also be effective 16 . At the same time, nearly 300 vaccines are being developed, among which eight have been used worldwide 18 . In China, there are mainly three categories of vaccines with com- pletion of over two billion doses of vaccination 18 , including inacti- vated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero 5 adenovirus vector) 23 , and recombinant SARS- CoV-2 vaccine (CHO cell) 24 . However, the evaluation of effective- ness and safety of these vaccines are still ongoing, and their im- pact on mutated virus variants remains to be seen 25-27 . TCM has been proved to help enhance the body's resistance (Zheng qi) to infectious diseases based on clinical studies and experiments 28-30 . Therefore, considering the need for more evidence, we collab- orated with international researchers to investigate behavioural changes, preventative and therapeutic interventions, their occur- rence and outcomes among the Chinese population during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to conduct this online cross- sectional survey to show the general situation during the pandemic in China and to indicate the further challenges to ght COVID-19. 2. Methods The content of this study is reported following the Strength- ening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement 31 , and the ndings are reported following the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-surveys checklist (CHERRIES) 32 . The study design and data management method are as follows. 2.1. Study design of the survey An international retrospective survey of prevention, treatment, occurrence and outcomes of COVID-19 in the community (RTO- COVID-19) involving 14 countries was led by researchers at the University of Southampton (UoS) and the University of Geneva. The original survey questions in the English version (available at: https: //www.rtocovid19.com ) were translated and adapted by authors at Beijing University of Chinese medicine since 10 th May, 2020. Localisation was made to reflect the tendency of Chinese people to prevent and cope with diseases, and to adapt to China's anti- epidemic policies and vaccine market. After gaining contact infor- mation from the respondents, we also conducted a three-month follow-up questionnaire to acquire more information on peoples' changes based on this cohort baseline. 2.1.1. Participants All potential participants were able to access the website of this survey. In those cases where participants were unable to answer the questions themselves, their family members or friends were also invited to help them complete the survey. There was no se- lective bias on participants. The questionnaire was disseminated by authors and other academic research groups. Inclusion criteria: 1) Any person who could access the ques- tionnaire online; 2) Any person who can read and understand the questionnaire; 3) Person checked \"agree\" on the informed consent page, to present information on preventive behaviours, treatments taken, symptoms of respiratory illness and their clinical outcomes. 4) There was no restriction on gender. 5) For children ( < 16 years old), their parents were invited to complete the questionnaire. Exclusion criteria: Persons lacking mental capacity to understand the questionnaire were excluded. 2.1.2. Ethics approval and informed consent This study received ethical approval from BUCM (2020BZYLL0501, Sep 2020) and from UoS (ERGO 56975, May 2020). All participants were invited to read the overview of the survey. Only those who conrmed consent, by clicking the button \"I agree\" at the beginning, proceeded to the questions. Participants' contact information was collect. All data collected were managed by the Chinese team. 2.2. Development of the survey 2.2.1. Adaptation for Simplied Chinese version Questions in simplied Chinese version were adjusted to t the context in China, especially adding more information on TCM. Firstly, machine translation was applied for the original English version questionnaire. Secondly, four authors edited the question- naire word by word to improve readability. Thirdly, the question- naire was designed on wjx.cn . Fourthly, all authors piloted the sur- vey with different test scenarios, to improve the logic and wording. This was repeated seven times before the questionnaire was nal- ized. Questions or answers were changed according to the habits and situation in China, for example, replacing proprietary names of medications (such as \"Dafalgan\u00ae\" to \"Tylenol\u00ae, \"Cetallerg\u00ae\" to \"Zyrtec\u00ae\") or medical system e.g. Ayurvedic interventions were removed because they are rarely used in China. The content of Chinese patent medicine was expended because of the common use of TCM in China. The Chinese medicines were identied from both national and provincial TCM guidelines to alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, including three versions of national guidelines, Bei- jing version, three versions of Hunan province, two versions of Guangdong province, Shaanxi province version, Jiangxi province version, Liaoning province version, Sichuan province version, Hebei province version, Gansu province version, Guizhou province ver- sion 33-49 . To reduce the diculty and time cost of lling the ques- tionnaire, we categorized 132 recommended TCM preparations ac- cording to their dosage forms, details in supplementary table 1. With the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, we also added the latest information regarding vaccination. 2.2.2. Pre-test for Simplied Chinese version The survey was issued on a survey platform wjx.cn . Each person had only one account to answer the questions. The questionnaire was tested by all Chinese authors before dissemination, and con- sidering the different logical relationships between questions. All authors also piloted the questionnaire using different scenarios. 2.3. Recruitment process 2.3.1. Disseminating and advertising The open questionnaire was released on wjx.cn from February 6 to May 19, 2021. The authors forwarded the WeChat post (designed 2 C.-L. Lu, R.-X. Zheng, X. Xue et al. Integrative Medicine Research 10 (2021) 100798 with QR code) to their friends as snowball sampling. The authors contacted ve academic organisations to help disseminate the post to more possible respondents. The survey advertisement attached the questionnaire link and the main content of the survey was posted on WeChat subscrip- tion account (ebcm2016). People could access from WeChat and Weibo (social platform). Participants who agreed to give their con- tact details were asked to complete the follow-up questionnaire af- ter three months. 2.4. Survey administration As a public survey platform, wjx.cn is openly accesible in China. When the respondents submitted their answers, they could get a lottery supported by wjx.cn without any conflict of interest. To pre- vent bias, answers to the questions were arranged in random order. We designed 39 sections including 226 question-items per page, and also added one page of welcome and one page of thanks. Re- spondents could skip some questions due to the logic and their conditions. Considering the possible multiple options, we only set the informed consent as the mandatory item. Each respondent could review the answers but could not change any content once they submitted. 2.5. Data collection and analysis 2.5.1. Summary of data collected The primary outcomes included a summary of: (1) response rates (2) basic characteristics (physical and mental conditions, COVID-19 impact on social situation) (3) diagnosis (detection of COVID-19 and related respiratory symp- toms) (4) treatments and outcomes (for the respiratory symptoms during rst and second week) (5) preventive measures The secondary outcomes were similar items from the follow-up questionnaire after three-months, including the response rates, ba- sic characteristics, treatments and outcomes and preventive mea- sures. 2.5.2. Response rates wjx.cn supported the identication of unique visitors who vis- ited the webpage multiple times with the same IP addresses. wjx.cn could calculate the unique rst survey page visitors, partici- pant rate and completion rate. The participants could only be with- drawn by contacting the investigators and asking to be removed from the study. All participants were free to stop at any time and not to complete the survey. 2.5.3. Data analysis Data were managed in WPS spreadsheet and analysed with wjx.cn ( https://www.wjx.cn/ ). Descriptive analysis was used for ba- sic physical and mental conditions, detection of COVID-19 and re- lated symptoms, treatment for respiratory symptoms, measures to prevent the spread, testing and vaccination of COVID-19, general social information, and the follow-up questionnaire, presented as numbers and percentages. If a questionnaire was collected success- fully, we regarded this answer as a complete respondent. Missing data in the analysed items were presented as non-values. 3. Results 3.1. Response rates The survey was available online from Feb. 6, 2021 to May 19, 2021 and collected a total of 503 visit times, among which 341 (67.8%) submitted their answers. The basic information of the re- spondents is provided in Table 1 . The data were collected from 23 provinces and four municipalities in China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong, no sample from Macao), and we removed the data when the participants were not living in main land China, and distribution map covering 316 respondents' report is shown in Figure 1 , the detailed numbers in supplementary table 2. As for the follow-up survey after three-months, we sent the questionnaire also via wjx.cn to 155 respondents separately who were willing to be followed up and provided their contact informa- tion on July 2, 2021. Finally, 23 respondents answered the follow- up questionnaire. 3.2. Basic characteristics of 341 respondents 3.2.1. Basic characteristics of physical and mental conditions from 341 respondents This section of the questionnaire mainly involved chronic dis- eases, pregnancy, regular medications, and mental health. 82.7% respondents had no chronic diseases or mental illness, and 17 respondents reported mental health conditions, details in Table 1 and supplementary table 3. In terms of the 23 respondents from the follow-up questionnaire after three-month, their mental conditions were shown in supplementary table 4. The majority of the respondents (291/341, 85.4%) did not take any medication during COVID-19, and the others took some medicine such as anti-hypertensive drugs, statins, thyrox- ine, immunosuppressor, anti-allergic agent and traditional Chinese medicine due to their long-standing chronic diseases. 3.2.2. COVID-19 impact on social situation Regarding the economic situation, only a few (12/341, 3.5%) par- ticipants did not provide an answer. Among those who did re- spond, 38.9% (128/329) believed that COVID-19 influenced their lives, and more than half (201/329, 61.1%) did not think COVID- 19 has impact. 138 respondents were health care workers and the rest of other people's working status and occupations during the epidemic were shown in Table 1 . Twenty-eight respondents reported their behaviours changed due to COVID-19, details in Table 2 . As for the 23 respondents from the follow-up questionnaire after three-month, their behavioural changes were also shown in Table 2 . 3.3. Diagnosis (detection of COVID-19 and related symptoms) Up to the time of responding to the questionnaire, 85.0% re- spondents had completed a PCR test for COVID-19. Six respon- dents had been infected with SARS-COV-2 and the others (284/290, 97.9%) had a negative result, details in Table 1 . 86.8% (296/341) respondents had not developed any respiratory symptoms since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. 13.2% (45/341) respondents had experienced respiratory symptoms and their common symptoms are shown in Figure 2 . The respiratory symptoms restricted the patient's normal activities for a maximum of 28 days, with an average of 5.95 days. These 45 respondents re- ported that their symptoms caused varying degrees of discomfort as the average of the symptom severity score was 4.17 (Score of 0 is the best and 10 is the worst). The average score for concern about their illness was 3.29 (Score of 0 is no concerns and 10 is extremely concerned). 60.0% (27/45) of them recovered completely 3 C.-L. Lu, R.-X. Zheng, X. Xue et al.

Others out- comes including improvement, no improvement, and deterioration are in Table 6 . 3.4. Treatments and outcomes (from 45 respondents for their respiratory symptoms during the rst and second weeks) Forty-ve respondents with respiratory symptoms reported their therapeutic treatments and thirty respondents reported the source of treatments during the rst week of their illness, detailed in Table 4 and Table 5 , including mainly four types, such as mod- ern medicine, TCM, other treatment and no treatment. Most com- monly, they practiced selfcare/self-medication (17/45, 37.8%). Seven respondents combined Chinese herbal preparation or acupuncture together with modern medicine. TCM included seven kinds of Chi- nese herbal preparation, acupuncture and moxibustion. In terms of access to antibiotics, 66.7% (6/9) obtained by prescription from a professional, 22.2% (2/9) used what was left over from the past and 11.1% (1/9) bought it on the Internet. The treatments were used af- ter an average of 2.66 (1-7) days of symptoms (available data from 30 respondents). Only three respondents reported that they were in the hospital for 5.5 (1-10) days on average, and they had been discharged at the time of lling out the questionnaire. Only one respondent re- ported conrmed as COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, the other two did not reported other chronic diseases or any reasons for be- ing in the hospital. No one was in intensive care, and no one was on a ventilator. All respondents had improved and recovered after one or two weeks, details in Table 6 . In terms of the 23 respondents from the follow-up question- naire after three-month, two respondents reported that they had new respiratory symptoms, and their treatment and prevention were shown in supplementary table 5. Among these 45 respondents, they failed to get SARS-CoV-2 PCR test when they had respiratory symptoms in 2020, so seven re- spondents suspected to be infected with COVID-19 and they made possible behavioural changes to prevent the potential spread since 2020, details in Table 2 . However, up to the time of responding to the questionnaire in 2021, 28.9% (13/45) respondents reported as both negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and negative anti- body testing of COVID-19, and only one respondent reported as both positive. Two respondents reported as positive SARS-CoV-2 6 C.-L. Lu, R.-X. Zheng, X. Xue et al. Integrative Medicine Research 10 (2021) 100798 Fig. 2. Symptoms occurred from 45 respondents during COVID-19.

Others (28/45, 62.2%) did not have any test for COVID-19. 3.5. Preventive measures to prevent the spread from 341 respondents We collected all respondents' treatments and behaviours to pre- vent COVID-19. 22.3% (76/341) (13/76, 65.0%). 18.5% (63/341) chose other preventive measures such as exercise, food supplements, special foods, and home remedies, detailed in Table 7 . As for vaccination against COVID-19, 20.8% (71/341) respon- dents had received the COVID-19 vaccine since November 27, 2020. The percentages of different brands of received rst-dose and second-dose vaccines are shown in Table 1 . People' opin- ions and behaviours were influenced when the various COVID- 19 vaccines are available, the results from 149 respondents was shown in Table 3 . 35.6% (53/149) respondents were still worried and 46.6% (159/341) were vaccinated to prevent COVID-19. 30.8% (105/341) were vaccinated because they worked in hospitals, and 3.5% (12/341) had a need to go abroad. With regard to the results of the follow-up questionnaire from 23 respondents, 91.3% (21/23) respondents had received the rst dose of COVID-19, and 82.6% (19/23) had received the second dose. The majority of respondents kept their behaviours the same as before receiving vaccines, such as hand washing rates (20/23, 95.2%), social distancing (18/23, 85.7%), and wearing masks in pub- lic places (17/23, 81.0%), details in Table 3 . In addition, considering anxiety about COVID, 47.6% (10/21) respondents were much more reassured after the vaccination; 14.3% (3/21) were relieved a little, and 38.1% (8/21) had no change. 4. Discussion Since 2020, COVID-19 is still currently one of the most impor- tant public health challenges to populations worldwide 50 . Numer- ous studies have focused on hospitalized patients infected with novel coronavirus 51-53 , but there have been fewer studies on the general population in the community. Therefore, our survey has provided data from the general population in China, so as to ex- 7 C.-L. Lu, R.-X. Zheng, X. Xue et al.

First and foremost, we used wjx.cn platform to support the identication of unique visitor by IP addresses, it helped to calcu- late the respondent rate. The response rate was only 67.8%, which seemed to be low. As the results of a meta-analysis study showed that there was a greater chance of response when patients were presented with a comparatively shorter questionnaire 54 . This is a comprehensive survey covering diagnosis, treatment, outcome for one week and two weeks, and preventive measure. However, it takes more than 30 minutes which might be a challenge with be- haviour fatigue and people reluctant to complete more surveys. People faced increasing COVID-19 questionnaires since 2020, so they may have experienced behaviour fatigue and were reluctant to complete more surveys. Furthermore, considering the online questionnaire, the respondents were particularly easily distracted during the answering process, so they could not concentrate on for a long time. For geographical distribution of respondents, we tried to in- clude people from as many provinces and municipalities in China as possible, so only several areas were missing. Considering the in- terpersonal relationship of all authors and our dissemination strat- egy, the respondents from different geographic areas were nearly correlated to the prevalence rate of COVID-19 in various areas in 2020. The total number of respondents varied between different regions, and among them, Hubei province was the highest. This could be due to the tendency of people in Hubei province who suffered most in COVID-19 and were willing to make a contribu- tion to scientic research. Our ndings indicated that 86.8% respondents did not have any respiratory symptoms since the beginning of the COVID-19 out- break. As China has beneted from the effective im plementation of epidemic prevention and control policies 55 , there were few cases of COVID-19 and so data collected on treatment, prevention and treatment outcomes were limited. Referring to respiratory symptoms, common clinical features of COVID-19 include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia 56 . Patients with mild COVID-19 had similar symptoms to those with the common cold and required a PCR test for a denitive diagnosis. A study in the Shanghai city of China indi- cated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protection and reduction of human gathering can also effectively reduce the in- fection of influenza in the population 57 . Therefore, the above strict prevention and control measures may have a potential positive ef- fect on both COVID-19 and influenza. Additionally, in terms of routes of transmission of COVID-19, coughing, sneezing, and touching could transmit the virus 58 . The behavioural changes including keeping hands clean, wearing a mask and social distancing reflected that people were influenced by COVID-19 and kept away from the virus in different methods as the Table 2 and Table 3 listed. Based on the results, 45 respondents with respiratory symp- toms had a good outcome. COVID-19 clinical guidelines recom- mended to use TCM for treatment and prevention 33 . At the very beginning of 2020, evidence proved that TCM played an important role in improving self-resistance, regulating immu- nity and preventing virus, maybe including COVID-19 28 . The main prevention principles of TCM were to tonify Qi to pro- tect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, 9 C.-L. Lu, R.-X. Zheng, X. Xue et al.

Although we failed to collect enough data about TCM usage, we listed all possible TCM modalities and patent remedies recommended by clinical guidelines in supplementary table 1 and showed usage frequency. When we released the questionnaire, there were main six brands of vaccines. We found that 20.53% respondents received a COVID-19 vaccine. It would be necessary to focus on vaccine appli- cation in the future to gure more information about the common population's attitude and feedback on it 60 . Mental health problems have been addressed from the results, as 17 respondents reported their mental health problems (supple- mentary table 3). A recent living systematic review of the psycho- logical disorders in people suffering from COVID-19 showed that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients manifested psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disor- der (PTSD), insomnia, somatization, and fear 61 . In addition to the 11 C.-L. Lu, R.-X. Zheng, X. Xue et al. Integrative Medicine Research 10 (2021) 100798 patients with COVID-19, another study has shown that the epi- demic has also caused adverse mental health consequences on the general population 62 . Thus, further studies should not only focus on treatment of COVID-19, but also involve the negative impact on general population's mental condition. Effective psychological in- tervention and support are needed during the post COVID-19 epi- demic. For the special population, due to limited data from nine preg- nant women among our respondents, we cannot nd any special treatment or prevention from them. However, the safety of preg- nant women and fetuses should still be noticed, including suscep- tibility and prognoses and the effects of the infection on the fe- tuses. Previous studies have shown that the severity of the disease in pregnant women was not yet apparent, and COVID-19 did not increase the rate of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm labor or ter- atogenicity, and no unequivocal evidence support the fetal infec- tion by intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 63-66 , but there are still more and more reports of maternal deaths due to COVID-19 64 , 67-68 . Consequently, we still need to keep in mind that pregnant women and neonates require special attention regarding the prevention, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 to achieve health equity. Differing from a large number of previous clinical studies fo- cusing on patients 49-51 , we aimed at a wide range of situations by following the general population in the community, so we can ex- plore the issues from a multi-dimensional perspective. Besides, in the process of adaptation of the questionnaire, we fully considered China's national conditions, added various complementary and al- ternative medicines recommended according to COVID-19 clinical guidelines in the questionnaires as the options. As the TCM clini- cal guidelines recommended in different ares of China varied, we collected different principles of treatments according to syndrome differentiation based on TCM theories as much as possible, in order to present much potential TCM evidence. However, there were also several limitations in our study. The questionnaire sample was not as large as we had planned and the respondent rate was low. If questionnaires could have been dis- tributed in the early stage of the outbreak, the information ob- tained would have been richer. Considering the majority (89.0%, 138/155) of participants who responded to the question about their occupations were healthcare workers and nearly a half of partici- pants did not respond , we failed to recruit a representative sample of the population . If we could disseminate the survey via com- munities and primary care, the results and sample may be differ- ent. The primary healthcare providers could be a good way to re- cruit more participants. In addition, longitudinal associations can be studied in future in order to have a more comprehensive under- standing of the issue, such as the association between preventative behaviour and subsequent illness, the association between treat- ments taken and illness outcomes, the association between disease course and mental statement, and so forth. Further exploratory analyses can inspire creative topics for future public health devel- opments, as well as further pre-clinical and clinical research. In summary, we found evidence of widespread use of infection control behaviours and modern medicines and TCM for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms, especially many TCM preparations recommended in Chinese clinical guide- lines. The ecacy of TCM still needs to be evaluated in further ro- bust studies. Larger scale studies including a more representative sample are needed to conrm our ndings.
