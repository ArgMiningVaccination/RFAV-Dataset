Immunisation providers are encouraged to discuss: * common and rare reactions associated with vaccination (found on the outer pages) * reactions associated with specific vaccines (found on the inner pages).

This fact sheet explains common reactions that may be experienced after receiving a vaccine and recommended actions to take if you are concerned. If you experience any other symptoms that you are concerned about, seek medical attention and advise them that you have been recently vaccinated. You are requested to remain at the centre for 15 minutes following vaccination to ensure you and/or your child is within easy access of medical care in the unlikely event of a severe or rare reaction. Common reactions What you can do Most vaccines can cause mild reactions; these should be explained to you by your immunisation provider. Side effects after vaccination are usually mild and short lasting and do not need special treatment. *Local reaction (pain, redness and/or swelling around injection site) *Place a cold damp cloth (cold compress) over the affected area to give relief. *Paracetamol (not aspirin) may be used to ease the discomfort. *Mild temperature or fever *Monitor the temperature regularly (a fever is above 38.5 \u00b0C). *Extra fluids are recommended (e.g. water, milk). *Keep cool by not overdressing. *Paracetamol (not aspirin) may be used to help reduce the temperature. *Irritability, decreased appetite, sleepiness *These symptoms are common in children and usually disappear over 24-48 hours. It does not usually require any specific treatment. *Vomiting and diarrhoea *Extra fluids are recommended (e.g. water, milk). *Continue to breastfeed, giving small frequent feeds. *Wash hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies to prevent any spread. *A small lump may appear at the injection site *No treatment is usually required and it will disappear in a few weeks. *Fainting may occur, and is usually seen in adolescents and adults *Anyone experiencing light-headedness before or after vaccination is advised to lie down until symptoms subside.Site Left RightDisease and vaccine Vaccine-specific side effects Rotavirus Rotarix Other *Mild temperature *Vomiting and diarrhoea can occur up to 7 days after vaccination *Vaccine virus can be shed in the stools, particularly after the first dose. Handwashing is important after nappy occur 5-26 days after vaccination: *Mild chickenpox-like rash (2-5 spots) usually at injection site, may also appear on other parts of the body If those vaccinated develop a rash, they should cover the rash and avoid contact with people who have impaired immunity for the duration of the rash.

This is to ensure that each vaccine is safe and proven to be effective based on clinical trials. You can obtain more information about vaccines and reactions to vaccines from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS) www.ncirs.edu.au or Australian Department of Health www.health.gov.au/immunisation Any serious or unexpected adverse event (reaction) following immunisation (AEFI) should be reported to the Department of Health by using the Western Australian Vaccination Safety Surveillance (WAVSS) System at www.safevac.org.au/Home/Info/WA (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) (08) 6456 0208 (8am- 4.30pm weekdays).Oral (by mouth) legarm legarm Rare Serious reactions are possible, but are rare. Anaphylaxis *A severe allergic reaction which occurs suddenly, usually within 15 minutes, however anaphylaxis can occur within hours of vaccine administration. Early signs of anaphylaxis include: redness and/ or itching of the skin, swelling (hives), breathing difficulties, persistant cough, hoarse voice and a sense of distress. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death. Seizure (also known as convulsion or fit) *Some children are more prone to seizures when experiencing a high fever. The seizure usually lasts approximately 20 seconds and very rarely more than 2 minutes. Intussusception* (relates to rotavirus vaccine) *It is an uncommon form of bowel obstruction where one segment of the bowel slides into the next, much like the pieces of a telescope. *There is a very small risk of this occurring in a baby in the first one to seven days after receiving the first dose of rotavirus vaccine , and a smaller risk after the second dose of rotavirus vaccine. The baby has bouts of crying, looks pale, gets very irritable and pulls the legs up to the abdomen because of pain. Chickenpox-like blistering rash (relates to shingles vaccine) *Very rarely a generalised chickenpox-like rash following shingles vaccination may occur around 2-4 weeks after vaccination, which may be associated with being unwell/fever. This may be a sign of a serious adverse event related to the Zostavax vaccine. Seek immediate medical attention and inform of recent shingles vaccination. What you should do if you have a rare reaction Seek medical advice immediately by either: *calling your GP or usual health provider *calling healthdirect Australia on 1800 022 222 , who will advise you on what to do next. The advice may include: *calling an ambulance (000) to get immediate assistance *seeing your family doctor (GP).
