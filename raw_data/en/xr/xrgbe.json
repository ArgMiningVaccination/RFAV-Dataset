This type of care focuses on making lifestyle changes to help prevent or manage disease through nutrition, supplements, exercise and mind-body techniques, such as sleep, stress management, yoga and meditation. These techniques are often used in conjunction with conventional medicine treatments, such as medications. You'll see a doctor or advanced practice clinician (APC) who completed a fellowship in integrative medicine and is board certified in their primary specialty. Integrative primary care physicians or APCs have also completed conventional medical training. They can meet your primary care needs and help treat a variety of ailments, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, colds, flu, aches and pains. If you need specialized care, integrative specialists apply holistic practices to their area of specialty practice, such as cardiology, gynecology, oncology, hormone replacement therapy, gut health or chronic pain. They work closely with your primary care physician and conventionally trained specialists to coordinate your care. Functional medicine is a specialty within integrative medicine that focuses on the interaction of genes, environment and lifestyle factors to determine the underlying causes of illness or disease. This might require several rounds of conversations with your doctor to determine the cause of an illness and to find the best treatment option. You'll see a subspecialist who has completed integrative and functional medicine training and is an Institute of Functional Medicine certified practitioner (IFM-CP). During your visit, the functional medicine subspecialist will collaborate with your primary care physician to reach a diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan that promotes long-lasting healing. These types of visits may be right for you if you: You'll receive the same services as you would from a conventionally trained primary care physician or a specialist. The difference is your treatment plan will be customized with lifestyle changes, such as supplements. You'll also receive comprehensive education in areas that can help you live well, such as nutrition, sleep and stress management. While a physician trained in either integrative or functional medicine can help, you might consider integrative medicine if you feel that the conventional approach to medicine hasn't provided relief from your pain or illness. Functional medicine might be right for you if you're looking for an investigative approach to determine what causes your symptoms and the best course of treatment. Count on being asked lots of questions about your health and lifestyle choices, including nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress, relationships, spirituality and critical life events.
