It's a powerful word. It means different things to different people. For one San Diego father many years ago, it meant a promise. In 1944, Thomas E. Sharp lost his son \u2014 22-year-old San Diego pilot Donald N. Sharp \u2014 who gave his life for his country on a mission with the B -26 Marauders of the United States Army Air Forces. To honor his son, Thomas E. Sharp ma de a generous donation in 1950 to fund the first Sharp hospital , with the promise that the new hospital be named the Donald N. Sharp Memorial Community Hospital and be \"dedicated to all servicemen who sacrificed their lives.\" It was to be a health care organization designed not for profit, but for people; committed to the care, health and well -being of the community. Since that time, Sharp HealthCare has held true to its commitment and has expanded to serve San Diego C ounty with four acute care and three specialty care hospitals, three affiliated medical groups and more than 18,000 employees . In addition, Sharp has pledged to our community an extraordinary standard of care through The Sharp Experience \u2014 bringing focus a nd alignment in all we do to the most basic and critical element of the health care equation: people. Each page of our F iscal Year 2019 Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report reflects a commitment to the community that is stronger than ever. This commitment is represented not only by uncompensated care dollars, but also by more than 1 18,000 hours devoted by Sharp team members to programs beyond our medical facilities \u2014 including free s creenings, resources and transportation to those in need, mentorship and training for students, and education and support to members of our community . In fiscal year 2019, Sharp's communi ty benefit contributions total ed $462,155,993 and included such vital community support as uncompensated care, benefits for vulnerable populations , health research and education activities. This support is our commitment to t he promise that founded Sharp HealthCare. That promise to the San Diego comm unity defines our organization and inspires our vision to be the best place to work, the best place to practice medicine and the best place to receive care. As we look ahead to the challenges in health care, our commitment is only further strengthened, and we will continue to go above and beyond to serve members of the San Diego community. We will continue to spend each day providing care and programs that set community standards, exceed community expectations, and honor the sacrifice Donald N. Sharp made f or his nation more than 70 years ago.

Extensive research reinforces the significant impact that social determinants of health (SDOH) \u2014 the conditions where people live, learn, work and play \u2014 have on individual and community health. As an extension of our mission, Sharp has embarked on an exciting, systemwide pilot with 2-1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE) to better understand and address the SDOH that affect our community members. The CIE is comprised of more than 70 community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and other social service agencies \u2014 who use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person-centered care. The CIE's shared community member records enable partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and their current use of community programs and services, and make referrals to additional necessary resources. As CIE partners, Sharp's hospitals, medical groups and health plan will help provide critical insight into the impact of addressing SDOH on the health and well- being of our community.

Patient Access to Care Programs Sharp provides financial assistance and a variety of support services to improve access to care for uninsured, underinsured and other patients without the ability to pay as well as insured patients with inadequate coverage. In accordance with federal law, Sharp does not refuse any patient requiring emergency medical care. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 13 Sharp provides services to help every uninsured patient receiving care i n the ED find opportunities for health coverage through PointCare \u2014 a quick, web -based screening, enrollment and reporting technology designed by health coverage experts to provide community members with financial assistance options. At Sharp, patients use PointCare's simple online questionnaire to generate personalized coverage options that are filed in their account for future reference and accessibility. The results of the questionnaire enable Sharp staff to have an informed and supportive discussion with the pat ient about health care coverage and empower them with op tions. From October 2015 to September 2019 , Sharp helped nearly 63,700 self-pay patients through PointCare, while maintaining each patient's dignity throughout the process. In 2014, Sharp hospitals implemented an on -site process for real -time Medi -Cal eligibility determinations (Presumptive Eligibility), making Sharp the first hospital system in SDC to provide this service. In fiscal year (FY) 2019, Sharp secured this benefit for more than 1,800 unfunded patients in the ED. In support of Covered C alifornia's annual open enrollment period, Sharp's registration staff includes 25 Certified Application Counselors in order to better assist both patients and the general community with navigating the Covered California website and plan enrollment. In col laboration with San Diego -based CSI Financial Services, Sharp utilizes the specialized loan program , ClearBalance, to assist patients who struggle to resolve high medical bills. Through the program, both insured and uninsured patients can secure small bank loans to help pay off their medical bills in low monthly installme nts and prevent unpaid accounts from going to collections. Since its inception in 2010, more than 4,000 Sharp patients have received assistance through ClearBalance. In addition, three Sharp hospitals \u2014 SCVMC, SGH and SMH \u2014 qualify as covered entities for the 340B Drug Pricing Program administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Health Resources and Services Administration. Hospitals participating in the 340B D rug Pricing Program are permitted to purchase outpatient drugs at reduced prices . The savings generated by this program are used to offset patient care costs for Sharp's most vulnerable patient populations, as well as to assist with patient access to medic ations through Sharp's Patient Assistance Program. The Patient Assistance Program at Sharp helps those in need of assistance gain access to free or low -cost medications. Patients are referred by population health teams, physicians, pharmacists, case manag ers, social workers, nurses or even other patients, as well as may be identified through usage reports. Team members research all available options for these patients , including programs offered by drug manufacturers, grant -based programs offered by founda tions, co -pay assistance and other low -cost alternatives. Eligible patients receive assistance that may help reduce readmissions and the need for frequent medical services resul ting from a lack of access Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 14 to medication. In FY 201 9, the Patient Assistance Program helped under - and uninsured patients access more than $5 million worth of prescriptions. Also in FY 201 9, Sharp assisted underinsured and vulnerable individuals who were unable to meet their financial responsibility after health insurance. Through the Maximum Out of Pocket Program, team members met with patients at all Sharp hospitals to help them better understand their health insurance benefits and how to access care during their hospital stay, as well as provided payment options. In FY 201 9, the Maximum Out of Pocket Program made a total of more than $385,000 in adjustments to patient bills. In addition, Public Resource Specialists from Sharp's Patient Financial Services ( PFS) team offered support to uninsured and underi nsured patients at all Sharp hospitals in need of extra guidance about available funding options. These team members performed field calls (home visits) to patients who required assistance with completing the coverage application process after leaving the hospital. Since FY 2016, SGH's PFS team has worked closely with the hospital's Care Transitions Intervention program to evaluate patients for CalFresh \u2014 California's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 prior to hospital discharge . These consultat ions have dramatically increased the likelihood that patients complete CalFresh applications and receive benefits. In February 2017, Sharp's PFS team expanded CalFresh consults to the remainder of Sharp's acute care hospitals. More than 72 0 Sharp patients have been granted CalFresh benefits as a result of this effort . In summer 2015, a pilot program was launched to evaluate eligibility for financial assistance among both insured and unfunded families with babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at SMBHWN. This process included helping families whose newborn had been diagnosed with a devastating medical condition or extremely low birth weight apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to help with the cost of care for their baby both within and outside of the hospital. The program was expanded to SCVMC and SGH in 2017, and since its inception, Public Resource Specialists have assisted more than 2 80 families through the SSI application process. City of San Diego Partnership In 2018, Sharp and t he City of San Diego began a three -year partnership designed to help improve the health and wellness of residents in all nine San Diego City Council Districts. As the Official Health and Wellness Partner of the City of San Diego, Sharp provides a wide vari ety of classes and workshops at district libraries and recreation centers. The partnership drew on findings from Sharp's community health needs assessment (CHNA), which helped identify neighborhoods with greater health disparities within the City Council D istricts, as well as health topics of interest to those specific neighborhoods. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 15 Presented by Sharp health educators from around the system, FY 2019 class topics included: stroke prevention and education; Medicare; cancer prevention \u2014 nutrition, lifestyle a nd healthy habits; achieving optimal health; weight births; prevention; nutrition and healthy eating; and mental health; mental health education; risk for cardiovascul ar disease (CVD) ; back pain prevention and management; stress management; diabetes and exercise; older adults and exercise; caregiver stress; heart failure and more. This partnership allows Sharp to bring important health and wellness information directl y to San Diegans in the communities in which they live. It is a powerful example of how Sharp takes its commitment to improve the health of those it serves beyond the walls of health care. Health Professions Training Students and recent health care graduates are a valuable asset to the community. Sharp demonstrates a deep investment in these potential and newest members of the health care workforce through internships and career pipeline programs. In FY 201 9, more than 3,600 student interns dedicated over 579,900 hours within the Sharp system. Sharp provided education and training for students in a variety of disciplines, including multiple areas of nursing (e.g. , critical care, medical/surgical, behavioral health, women's se rvices, cardiac services and hospice) , midlevel practitioner positions (nurse practitioner and physician assistant) and allied health (ancillary) professions such as rehabilitation therapies (speech, physical and occupational therapy), lactation care, pharmacy, respiratory therapy, imaging, cardiovascular, dietetics, lab oratory , surgical technology, paramedic, social work, psychology, business and public health. Students came from local community colleges, such as Grossmont College, San Diego City College, San Diego Mesa College and Southwestern College (SWC); local and national universities such as California State University San Marcos (CSUSM), Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU), San Diego State University (SDSU), University of California (UC) San Diego , University of San Diego (USD) , and University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences ; and vocational schools such as Concorde Career College.

In FY 2019, the program supervised six chaplain residents and five chaplain interns on the campuses of SGH, SMBHWN, SMH, SMV and Sharp Home Health services. In addition, more than 100 Sharp Clinical Pastoral Education program graduates attended three professional chaplains' educational events hosted by Sharp's Spiritual Care and Education Department as part of their continued education and development . These events were held throughout the year and included Healing Stories from Traditions of World Religions: Buddhist Stories, Praying for Miracles and Sharing our Spiritual Practices. Further, these graduates of Sharp's Clinical Pastoral Education program now serve various health care institutions and hospices within San Diego . Sharp also provides specialized classes to prepare future preceptor s for their mentoring role. Th rough the Precepting With Pride Class, nurses and respiratory care practitioners who are new to the role of precepting learn about the essential components of role modeling and educating. Sharp's A dvanced Preceptor Class for Nursing supports the continued development of more experienced nurse preceptors. In addition, new nurse mentors and mentees attend an orientation program designed to describe their unique roles and promote a successful precepting experience. Allied Health 19% Nursing 74%Midlevel Practitioner 1%Pharmacy 6% Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 18 Health Sciences High and Middle College Health Sciences High and Middle College (HSHMC) \u2014 a partnership between Sharp, a group of SDSU professors and the Grossmont -Cuyamaca Community College District \u2014 is a tuition -free, public charter high school that provide s students with broad exposure to he alth care careers. HSHMC students are given the opportunity to connect with Sharp team members through job shadowing to explore real -world application s of their school -based knowledge and skills. This collaboration prepares students to enter health, scienc e and medical technology careers in the following five pathways: biotechnology research and development, diagnostic services, health informatics, support services and therapeutic services. The high school curriculum provides students with a variety of se rvice -learning projects and internships focused on careers in health care. Students earn high school diplomas, complete college entrance requirements and have opportunities to earn community college credits, degrees or vocational certificates. The HSHMC pr ogram began in 2007 with students on the campuses of SGH and SMH, and expanded to include SMV and SMBHWN in 2009, SCHHC in 2010, and SCVMC in 2011. Students also devote time to various SRS MG sites. Students begin their internship experience with a systemw ide orientation to Sharp and their upcoming job -shadowing activities, which consist of two levels of training. Level I of the HSHMC program is the entry level for all students and is conducted over an eight - week period. Through Level I, ninth -grade student s shadow primarily non -nursing areas of the hospital as well as complete additional coursework in Infection Control, Medical Ethics and Introduction to Health Professions. Level II is designed for students in grades 10 through 12 and includes enhanced pati ent interaction, college -level clinical rotation s and hands -on experience. Level II students are placed in a new assignment each semester for a variety of patient care experiences and take additional health -related coursework at a community college, includ ing Health 101, Public Health, Psychology and Abnormal Psychology, Realities of Nutrition, Intro to Health Professions and Organizations, and Health and Social Injustice , among other courses . In FY 201 9, 266 HSHMC students \u2014 including 121 Level I student s and 145 Level II students \u2014 were supervised for nearly 57,500 hours on Sharp campuses. Students rotated through instructional pods in specialty areas, including but not limited to: nursing; emergency services; obstetrics and operations. Stude nts not only had the opportunity to observe patient care, but also received guidance from Sharp staff on career ladder development as well as job and education requirements . Each year, Sharp reviews and evaluates its collaboration with HSHMC, including th e outcomes of students and graduates, to promote long -term sustainability. Seventy -two percent of HSHMC students are economically disadvantaged, and the school's free and Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 19 reduced -price meal eligibility rate is higher than the average s for both SDC and California . Despite these challenges, HSHMC maintains a 95% attendance rate and excels in preparing students for high school graduation, college entrance and a future career. In May 201 9, 162 students graduated from HSHMC , and 90% of the graduating class went on to a ttend two - or four -year colleges. Further , 75% of students said they wanted to pursue a career in health care. HSHMC has a 98. 8% graduation rate, which is higher than the California state average (83%). HSHMC has received numerous awards for its innovation , vision and impact . Most recently, in 2017 HSHMC received Gold Recognition \u2014 the highest level that can be awarded \u2014 from Schools of Opportunity, a project of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. This p roject recognizes public high schools around the nation that engage in research -based practices focused on closing opportunity gaps for student learning. Also in 2017, HSHMC was recognized for the third time as a U.S. News & World Report Best High Schools bronze award winner , having previously been recognized in 2014 and 2016. In 2016, HSHMC received the Impact Award from the Classroom for the Future Foundation as the most innovative education program in SDC. Sharp is honored to have partnered with HSHMC fo r more than a decade and looks forward to continually providing HSHMC students with opportunities to flourish in a career in health care. Lectures and Continuing Education Sharp contributes to the academic development of students at colleges and universities throughout San Diego. In FY 201 9, Sharp staff provided hundreds of hours in guest lectures and presentations on numerous health care topics. Lecture topics included clinical aromatherapy; clinical informatics; the role of a medical social work er in a hospital setting; diabetes; careers in dietetics; diabetes and exercise; spiritual care in the health care setting; and end-of-life care including advance care planning, hospice, bereavement, bioethics and goals of care. Lectures were delivered to students from a variety of graduate and undergraduate programs at SDSU, National University (NU) , PLNU, USD, San Diego City College, Azusa Pacific University (APU), and CSUSM . Sharp's Continuing Medical Education (CME) Department has received Accredit ation with Commendation by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians, as well as by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education to provide continuing pharmacy education. Sharp's CME Department provides evidence -based and clinically relevant professional development opportunities to help practicing physicians and pharmacists improve patient safety and enhance clinical outcomes. In FY 2019, Sharp's CME Department invested more than 1, 500 hours in live and online CME activities for San Diego health care providers. This included conferences on cardiology, oncology, diabetes, integrated healing, urgent care and patient safety , as well as presentations on suicide prevention, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 20 food insecurity4, physician leadership, sepsis, infection prevention, opioid usage and advances in lung cancer. Beyond conferences, CME develops and implements online learning modules as well as performance improvement projects to inspire clinicians and teams to improve their practice and optimize patient care. As a result of provider demand, 56 online CME modules were made available in FY 2019 \u2014 a 68% increase in modules from FY 2018. Additionally, CME partnered with Sharp's Lean Six Sigma team as well as Sharp - affiliate d physicians to complete 15 performance improvement projects. Each year, Sharp's CME Department identifies and addresses a public health priority in compliance with its Accreditation with Commendation. In FY 2019, the CME Department continued to collabor ate with the Community Benefit team to address the FY 2018 identified public health issue: food insecurity. Together, CME and Community Benefit educate d and engage d Sharp -affiliated physicians, pharmacists and employees on the impact of food insecurity on health , as well as assess ed patients for food insecurity and referred them to community resources. Four online educational modules were developed in collaboration with the San Diego Hunger Coalition and are actively viewed by community providers . The CME and C ommunity Benefit food insecurity initiative has helped change how Sharp cares for its community, as well as delivered positive patient outcomes. To address the FY 2019 public health priority of dementia , the CME Department developed a comprehensive needs assessment demonstrating the need for dementia training aimed at primary care providers. The CME Department collaborated with community organizations, including Champions for Health and the Alzheimer's Project Clinical Roundtable, to develop educatio n and clinical guidelines focused on addressing dementia in SDC . This concerted effort reached over 300 clinicians , as well as led to countless additional non -CME educational strategy meetings with internal and external stakeholders, and important conversa tions regarding dementia patients at Sharp. In addition, t he Alzheimer's Project Clinical Roundtable Physician Guidelines were converted into an online CME activity . In further support of this project, the department provided four hours of live and online CME activities for San Diego health care providers, as well as more than 50 hours of planning and development with providers. This included grand rounds at both SGH and SCHHC, and a panel discussion at SCMG's Annual CME Conference, where the Alzheimer's P roject Clinical Roundtable exhibited and promoted its clinical guidelines. In addition, SRSMG's Clinical Guidelines committee utilized the Alzheimer's Project Clinical Roundtable's clinical guidelines to update their dementia guidelines. Results from pos t-evaluation surveys collected from these CME -accredited events showed markedly increased confidence in treating patients with Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias. Participants also stated an intent to change their 4 Food security means access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food -nutrition -assistance/food -security -in-the-us/.

Research Sharp Center for Research Sharp is dedicated to expanding scientific knowledge for the broader health and research communities. The Sharp Center for Research promotes high-quality research initiatives that help advance patient care and outcomes throughout the world. The Sharp Center for Research includes the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) , the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Outcomes Research Institute (OR I). Human Research Protection Program The Sharp Center for Research's HRPP is responsible for the ethical and regulatory compliant oversight of research conducted at Sharp . In March 2016, Sharp received accreditation from the Association for the Accreditation of Human Resea rch Protection Programs (AAHRPP) and in December 2018, was re -accredited for an additional five years. This accreditation acts as a public affirmation of the HRPP's commitment to following rigorous stand ards for ethics, quality and protection for human research. To date, Sharp is the only health system in SDC to receive accreditation from the AAHRPP . Institutional Review Board As one of the key component s of the HRPP , the IRB seeks to promote a culture of safety and respect for those participating in research for the greater good of the community. All proposed entity research studies with human participants must be reviewed by the IRB in order to protect participant safety and maintain responsible resear ch conduct. In FY 201 9, a dedicated IRB committee of 17 \u2014 including physicians, nurses, pharmacists , individuals with expertise and training in non -scientific areas, and members of the community \u2014 devoted hundreds of hours to the review and analysis of both new and ongoing research studies. Research at Sharp is conducted on all clinical phases of drug and device development , and the populations studied span the life cycle \u2014 from newborns to older adults. These clinical trials increase scientific knowledge and enable health care providers to assess the safety and effectiveness of new treatment s. At any given time, Sharp participates in approximately 2 50 clinical trials encompassing many therapeutic areas , including behavioral health, emergency care, infectious disease, newborn care , heart and vascular, kidney, liver, neurology, gastroenterology, orthopedics and oncology \u2014 the latter of which comprises the largest share of Sharp's clinical trials. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 22 The HRPP educates and supports researchers across Sharp as well as the broader San Diego health and research communities regarding the protection of human research participants. As part of its mission, the Sharp C enter for Research hosts quarterly research meetings on relevant educational topics for community physicians, psychologists, research nurses, study coordinators and students throughout SDC. In FY 2019, meetings included the following presentations: Research Community Outreach; Health Insurance Por tability and Accountability Act and Research; Protecting Vulnerable Subjects; Deviations: Identification, Responses and Solutions; and the Revised Common Rule. Education was also provided during the q uarterly research m eetings on the external IRB review process, short form consenting, and protection of human subjects. Additionally, Sharp researchers presented their current studies during the meetings. As part of National Clinical Trials Day in May, the Sharp Center for Resear ch held its inaugural Clinical Trials Day event to showcase Sharp's latest clinical research to the San Diego community. The event was featured on two local news channels and drew nearly 200 attendees, including community researchers, drug and device manuf acturers, Sharp physicians, donors and the general public. Outcomes Research Institute Since its inception in 2010, Sharp's ORI has sought to measure the long -term results of care to continue to develop and promote best practices in health care delive ry. The ORI enables Sharp to develop and disseminate new knowledge to the larger health care community and help improve the quality of care delivery across SDC. The ORI collaborates with Sharp team members to aid in the design of patient -centered outcomes research projects; assist with study protocol development, data collection and analysis; explore funding mechanisms for research projects; and facilitate IRB application submissions. The ORI seeks guidance and expertise from the local and national acade mic community on how to effectively conduct outcomes research to improve patient and community health. This networking has resulted in collaborative research partnerships with investigators at SDSU and NU. The ORI shares its research studies with other c ommunity health and research professionals. In FY 2019, this included a study titled Detecting Atrial Fibrillation in the Emergency Department in Patients with Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices , published in The Journal of Emergency Medicine , as well as a presentation titled Prediction of Acute Care Utilization for Patients with Hematologic Malignancies , provided at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Quality Care Symposium in San Diego. Since September 2016, the ORI has expanded its contributi ons to research, education and clinical service through SMH's Integrated Behavioral Health/Cardiac program \u2014 an Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 23 initiative that integrates psychological services for patients of SMH's Heart Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support units, including pre -surgical psychological candidacy assessments as well as psychological testing, consultation, and ongoing treatment. The program provides opportunities for ongoing outcomes research, including the contribution of publications and presentations to support t he broader health and research communities in the psychosocial management of heart failure patients. These research opportunities are extended to advanced graduate students in clinical psychology through yearlong practicum training experiences. In FY 2019, this innovative program fostered the continued implementation of three ongoing heart failure studies, and as of October 2019, has enabled the creation and funding of a new full - time psychologist staff position. Evidence -Based Practice Institute Sharp participates in the Evidence -Based Practice Institute (EBPI), which prepares teams of staff fellows and mentors to change and improve clinical practice and patient care through identifying a care problem, developing a plan to solve it and incorporati ng this new knowledge into practice. The EBPI is part of the Consortium for Nursing Excellence, San Diego, which promotes the use of evidence -based practice s in the nursing community. The consortium is a partnership between Sharp, Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, UC San Diego Health, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System, Kaiser Permanente, Elizabeth Hospice, PLNU, SDSU, APU and USD. Sharp actively supports the EBPI by providing instructors and mentors as well as administrative coordination. The EBPI includes six full -day class sessions featuring group activities, self -directed learning programs outside of the classroom , and structured mentorship throughout the program. EBPI fellows and mentors partner with one ano ther through a variety of learning strategies . Mentors facilitat e and support fellows as they navigate the hospital system and implement the processes of evidence - based practice change . Mentors also assist fellows in working collaboratively with key hospit al leadership personnel. In FY 2019, t he nine -month program culminated with a community conference and graduation ceremony in November, during which the EBPI fellows and mentors shared their project results. Twenty -seven project teams, comprised of mento rs and fellows, graduated from the program. Projects address ed issues in clinical practice and patient care including : spinal cord injury protocols to improve discharge preparedness; patient communication boards as a bedside handoff tool; music therapy to reduce anxiety in breastfeeding mothers; changes in checking gastric residuals in tube fed babies for quicker full feeds; immunization protocols in liver pre -transplant patients; and development and education on a new evidence -based program for increased p atient mobility. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 24 Volunteer Service Sharp Lends a Hand In FY 2019, Sharp continued its systemwide community service program , Sharp Lends a Hand (SLAH). Sharp team members suggested proje ct idea s tha t wou ld improve the health and well-being of San Diego in a broad, positive way; rely solely on Sharp for volunteer labor; and suppo rt existing nonprofit initiative s, community activities or other programs tha t serve SDC. SLAH selected 21 voluntee r proje cts for FY 2019: San Diego Food Bank (Food Bank) ; Feeding San Diego (FSD) ; Mama 's Kitchen ; San Diego Wreaths Ac ross America ; USS Midway Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Walk-down; American Diabetes Association (ADA) Tour de Cure; Promises2Kids; Ssubi is Hope Greening for Good Project; Special Olympics Annual Spring Games; Habitat for Humanity ReStore; Stand Down for Homeless Veterans ; Life Rolls On \u2014 They Will Surf Again; Surfride r Foundation's Beach Cleanup; I Love a Clean San Diego's Coastal Cleanup , Creek to Bay Cleanup, Storm Drain Stenciling Day, and Morning After Mess Cleanup ; the San Diego River Park Foundation's Poin t Loma Native Plant Garden , San Diego River Garden and Coastal Habita t Restoration; and River Kids Discovery Days \u2014 a joint effort between I Love a Clean San Diego and the San Diego River Park Foundation. More than 3,000 Sharp employee s, family members and friends volunteered nearly 6,000 hou rs in support of these projects.5 The Food Bank feed s San Diegans in need, advocate s for the hungry , and educates the public abou t hunger-related issues. Each month, the Food Bank serve s nearly 2 million meals to approximately 350,000 San Diegans. Backpa cks filled with a weekend's supply of food are provided to chronically hungry elementary school children throughout SDC, while Food Bank distribution sites provide boxes of grocerie s and staple food items to low-income seniors. At eight even ts between December 2018 and Augu st 2019, 50 SLAH volunteers gathered at the Food Bank warehouse to help inspect, clean, sort and package donated food as well as assist with assembling boxes and cleaning the facility.

Four teenagers participated in Sharp HospiceCare's Teen Volunteer program in FY 2019. Through this program, teens completed special projects in Sharp HospiceCare administration, as well as performed activities at Sharp HospiceCare's hos pice homes, including patient grooming and hygiene tasks, as well as simply sitting with patients, listening to their stories and holding their hand. Additionally , 13 premedical students 11 Sharp employees' time on these boards is not financially valued in this community benefit report. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 33 from SDSU, UC San Diego and CSUSM volunteered their time by supportin g family caregivers in private homes. Sharp HospiceCare continued to provide the 11th Hour program to ensure that no patient died alone. Through the program, volunteers accompanied patients who were in their final moments of life but did not have family members present. This included holding the patient's hand, reading softly to them and remaining by their side. Volunteers also comforted families who were present while their loved one passed away. Twelve volunteers were trained through the 11th Hour progr am in FY 2019. In FY 2019, Sharp HospiceCare trained four volunteers in integrative therapies to promote relaxation and restful sleep and enhance the quality of life of Sharp HospiceCare patients and their caregivers. Integrative therapies included Healin g Touch, a gentle energy therapy that uses the hands to help manage physical, emotional or spiritual pain; Reiki, a Japanese energy healing therapy in which practitioners use their hands on or above the patient's body to facilitate the healing process; aromatherapy; and hand massage. Nine volunteers also supported Sharp HospiceCare's partnership with We Honor Veterans (WHV). WHV is a national program developed by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the VA to empower hospice professionals to meet the unique end -of-life needs of veterans and their families. As a WHV partner, Sharp HospiceCare is equipped to provide education and training that qualifies its volunteers to identify and support veteran patients and their c aregivers. This includes the Vet -to-Vet Volunteer program, which pairs volunteers who have military experience with veteran patients receiving hospice or home -based palliative care. The program also honors veteran patients through special pinning ceremonie s, during which volunteers present veterans with a WHV pin and a certificate of appreciation for their service. In FY 2019, Sharp HospiceCare held pinning ceremonies for more than 90 Sharp HospiceCare veteran patients and pinned 40 veteran community member s during various community events. Sharp HospiceCare continued to offer the Memory Bear program to support community members who have lost a loved one.

In FY 2019, volunteers dedicated nearly 3,000 hours to sewing more than 740 bears for approximately 250 families. Sharp HospiceCare recognizes the valuable impact that volunteers h ave on its patients and their family and caregivers. In light of this recognition, Sharp HospiceCare offered a monthly continuing education support group to enhance volunteers' skills. In addition, Sharp HospiceCare honored its volunteers during National V olunteer Week in April and National Hospice and Palliative Care Month in November through special award and pinning celebrations. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 34 Sharp Metropolitan Medical Campus (SMH, SMBHWN, SMV, SMC) Volunteer Programs Through the Community Care Partner (CCP) progr am at SMH, hospital volunteers are hand -selected and trained to serve and comfort patients without family or friends present during their hospital stay. Activities may include reading to patients , writing letters, taking walks, playing games, or simply engaging in conversation. In addition, CCP volunteers look out for patients ' safety and notify medical staff when needs arise \u2014 a task that is usually performed by a family member or friend but often overlooked when patients lack a companion. In FY 201 9, 6 CCP volunteers devoted more than 500 hours to approximately 115 patient visits. The Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library and SMH Volunteer Department continued to offer the Health Information Ambassador program in FY 201 9. Serving SMH, the SMH Rehabilitation Center and SMBHWN's perinatal special care unit, the program brings the library's services directly to patients and family members , which both helps to improve their health literacy and empower them to become involved in their own health care. Through the program, hospital volunteers are special ly trained to become Health Information Ambassadors who are responsible for bringing diagnosis - related resources to patients and family members upon request. The consumer health librarian receives these requests, then uses reputable health websites to gather consumer -oriented information for the Health Information Ambassadors to return to the patient or their family members. Following their hospital stay, patients and families are invited to access an online database of reliable health information as well as to keep in touch with the library to ensure ongoing receipt of quality health information at home. Throughout the year, the Health Information Ambassadors visited more than 2,400 patient rooms an d filled nearly 875 information requests. In addition, to address the vast number of Americans demonstrating basic or below health literacy, the consumer health librarian continued to provide a pamphlet titled Health Literacy 101 as a resource for the Health Information Ambassadors as they communicate with patients about their diagnosis. The pamphlet emphasizes the importance of verbally explaining a patient's diagnosis to them and describes a protocol to help improve their understanding of their medical in formation. Established in 2007, the Arts for Healing program at SMMC uses art and music to reduce feelings of fear, stress, pain and isolation among patients facing significant medical challenges and their loved ones. The program brings a variety of activ ities to patients at their bedside \u2014 including painting, beading, creative writing, card -making, seasonal crafts, scrapbooking, quilting, music and drumming \u2014 to improve emotional and spiritual health and promote a faster recovery. The program also engages visitors and members of the community during hospital and community events. Funded completely by donations, Arts for Healing is led by Sharp's Spiritual Care and Education Department and is implemented with help from licensed music and art therapists as w ell as a team of trained volunteers. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 35 At SMH, Arts for Healing typically serves patients who are receiving cancer treatment, recovering from surgery or stroke, awaiting organ transplantation, receiving palliative care, or facing life with newly acquired d isabilities following catastrophic events. At SMBHWN, Arts for Healing supports mothers with high -risk pregnancies who are susceptible to stress and loneliness during extended hospital stays prior to childbirth. Music therapy is also provided in SMBHWN's NICU to promote the development of premature babies. At SMV and SMC, Arts for Healing offers several art and music therapy groups, including those for adolescents and adults receiving treatment for substance use, mood and anxiety disorders, as well as older adults receiving treatment for dementia or depression . In collaboration with SMMC's social workers and palliative care nurses, in FY 201 9, Arts for Healing facilitated the donation of 50 handcrafted blankets and quilts for patients receiving end -of-life care at SMH .

In FY 2019, Arts for Healing cultivated a partnership with the San Diego Symphony resulting in a brass ensemble performance for patients at SMH and the Sharp Allison deRose Rehabilitation Center in September. In FY 2019, Arts for Healing received a grant from the Music Man Foundation to support its efforts to promote and prov ide the healing power of music at SMMC. With this grant, SMMC expanded Arts for Healing by 24 hours per week, nearly doubling its music therapy services, as well as launched an evidence -based practice project to measure the impact of music therapy on patie nts. In FY 2019, 50 volunteers and five staff members facilitated art and music activities for approximately 39,000 patients, visitors and staff through the Arts for Healing program . Since its inception , the time and talent of the program's dedicated volunteers, licensed therapists and staff have reached more than 178,000 individuals. Other Sharp Community Efforts In FY 201 9, Sharp engaged in a variety of community service projects to improve the well-being of community members throughout San Diego. The following are just a few examples of these efforts. According to the January 201 9 WeAllCount Annual Report , there are more than 8,100 individuals experiencing homelessness in SDC, of whom more than 4,470 are unsheltered. For the second year in a row, the number of individuals experiencing homelessness in the region has decreased by nearly 6%. Since 2011, Sharp has sponsored the Downtown San Diego Partnership's Family Reunification Program, which serves to reduce the number of unsheltered individuals on the streets of downtown San Diego . Through the program, homeless outreach coordinators from the Downtown San Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 36 Diego Partnership's Clean & Safe Program identify unsheltered individuals who would be best served by traveling back home to loved ones. Family an d friends are contacted to ensure that the individuals have a place to stay and the support they need to get back on their feet. Once confirmed, the outreach team provides the transportation needed to reconnect with their support system. With Sharp's help, the Family Reunification Program has reunited more than 1,700 individuals in Downtown San Diego with friends and family across the nation. In addition, in 2019 Sharp provided funding that helped secure two new buses to support the Family Reunification Pro gram. Through the Giving Tree program at the Downtown Sharp Senior Health Center, community members and staff donate gift cards to make the holidays brighter for seniors in need. I n December 201 8, nearly 60 patient s who visited the Downtown Sharp Senior H ealth Center left with a gift bag and a gift card to a local drug store, grocery store or restaurant. In addition, in December, SCVMC partnered with a Chula Vista chapter of Optimist International for a holiday bike giveaway.

In FY 2019, t he holiday bike giveaway provide d bicycles as holiday gifts to eight children of the hospital's cancer patients . The SGH Engineering Department led a variety of volunteer initiatives in FY 2019 . For the past nine years, the SGH Engineering Department 's landscap ing team and the hospital's Auxiliary have collaborated with local businesses to bring The Shirt Off Our Backs Program to community members in need during the holidays. Through the The Shirt Off Our Backs Program , volunteers collect and donate a variety of items to help meet the basic needs of homeless or low -income children and adults. In FY 201 9, volunteers fi lled three trucks with donated food and other essential items, including 80 hygiene kits (shampoo, soap, wipes, toothbrushes, etc.), 200 handmade sandwiches and 150 water bottles as well as clothing, socks, shoes, toys, towels, blankets, pet food and other household items. The SGH Engineering Department continued to provide This Bud's for You, a special program that delivers hand -picked flowers from the campus' abundant gardens to unsuspecting visitors, patients and staff. Through the program, the landsca ping team grows, cuts, bundles and delivers colorful bouquets to patient rooms as well as offers single -stem roses in a small bu d vase to passers -by. Each week during FY 2019 , the team delivered three vases of flowers along with an inspirational quote, as well as at least six vases during peak flower season and upon additional requests.

In FY 2019 , the team assembled up to four Cheers Bouquets per month, including bouquets for more than 40 new fathers on Father's Day weekend. In collaboration with Christi e's Place \u2014 a nonprofit organization that supports women, children and families affected by human immunodeficiency virus or AIDS \u2014 since 2014, SGH nurses have engaged employees throughout the hospital in an annual backpack drive to prepare children and teens for academic success. Team members from a variety of departments help assemble backpack s with school supplies and personal notes wishing the students all the best for the coming school year. Each year, the team distributes more than 160 backpacks to youth during a back -to-school party at Balboa Park. For more than 30 years, SGH has held its annual Santa's Korner giving event to provide for those in need during the holidays. Through this effort, various hospital departments adopt a family that has been vetted and referred by local service agencies . Using primarily their personal resources , as well as support from occasional fundraisers , hospital staff purchase special holiday gifts for the families , including grocery gift cards, clothing, toiletries, household items, movie tickets, bicycles, children's toys and a holiday meal. During the 2018 holiday season, Santa's Korner served more than 120 individuals from 36 families . All Ways Green Initiative Sharp has a long -standing dedication to minimizing adverse environmental impacts by creating and promoting healthy, green practices for employees, physicians and patients. Through education, outreach and collaboration with San Diego's earth -friendly businesses, Sharp works to identify best practices in sustainability, and implement and reduce the costs of these initiatives. Sharp's Environmental Policy guides the identification and implementation of green practices within the health care system, while its All Ways Green initiative fosters a culture of environmental respo nsibility throughout the organization and the San Diego community. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 38 Sharp's systemwide All Ways Green Committee spearheads the organization's sustainability efforts. Sharp's environmental initiatives are concentrated in five domains: (1) energy efficiency, (2) water conservation, (3) waste minimization, (4) sustainable food p ractices and (5) commuter solutions. Specialized committees are responsible for each of these domains (see Table 3), while Green Teams at each Sharp entity are responsible for sustaining the existing initiatives and developing new programs to educate and motivate employees to conserve natural resources. Table 3: All Ways Green Committees/Subcommittees and Domains To monitor progress and measure tangible results, All Ways Green utilizes a Sharp - developed report card which trends each domain's annual performance against a baseline. The report card shows where Sharp has achieved desired results as well as identifies opportunities for improvement in order to strategically plan initiatives that engage team members in red ucing the organization's carbon footprint. Sharp's accomplishments and goals within each All Ways Green committee/subcommittee and domain are highlighted in the following pages. Natural Resource Conservation According to the EPA, health care organizations spend over $6.5 billion on energy each year. Health care organizations rank as the country's second most energy in tensive industry, with hospitals using roughly three times the amount of energy as a typical office building. In the U.S., h ospital water use constitutes 7% of the total water used in commercial and institutional buildings . Sharp's goal is to optimize the use of electricity, gas and water across its facilities , identify and evaluate opportunities for improvement, implement initiatives in the most cost -effective manner and track progress . A 2017 World Health Organization report encouraged hospitals to proactively address the environmental footprint of the health care sector by reducing power consumption and utilizing altern ative sources of energy generation . Sharp's Natural Resource Subcommittee has addressed this call by implementing numerous conservation initiatives, including infrastructure changes as well as adopting best practices to ensure its facilities are optimally operated while monitoring and measuring energy and water consumption. Sharp's Natural Resource Subcommittee also educates employees about the energy -conscious behaviors that can be practiced in the workplace and at home to promote continuous energy and wat er savings . Committee/Subcommittee Domain Natural Resource Subcommittee Energy efficiency and water conservation Waste Minimization Committee Waste minimization Food and Nutrition Best Health Committee Sustainable food practices Commuter Solutions Subcommittee Commuter solutions Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 39 During California's recent five-year drought, Sharp adopted a focused water conservation program at all sites. Although the drought restrictions were officially lifted in 2017, Sharp remains dedicated to using water wisely . To align with thi s commitment, Sharp partners with Emerald Textiles for its laundry and linen services. The company operates a state -of-the-art plant that is efficiently designed to reduce utility consumption and preserve natural resources. Each year, Emerald Textiles save s an estimated 40 million gallons of water through its water filtration system, more than 71,000 kilowatt - hours (kWh) of electricity through the use of energy -efficient lighting, and over 700,000 therms of gas by using energy -efficient laundry equipment. Sharp was one of the first health care organizations in the country to commit to environmental best practices in IT. In 2013, Sharp became the first health care system in SDC to implement a computer management program that places computers and monitors into a low -power sleep mode after a one-hour period of inactivity. The program has been installed on all Sharp computers result ing in annual energy savings in excess of 1.6 million kWh. In 2015 , Sharp implemented the TSO Logic software program, which identi fies inefficient, energy -consuming hardware for replacement or elimination. Sharp's hardware e lectrical consumption has decreased by more than 5% each year following implementation. Since 2016, the SGH campus has been operating essentially off the electri cal grid due to the Brady Family CoGen, its state -of-the-art Central Energy Plant (CEP). The CEP includes a 52-ton, 4.4 -megawatt combustion turbine generator that produces enough electricity to meet up to 95 % of the hospital's needs while reduc ing greenhouse gases by up to 90 %. In addition to providing electrical power, the CEP converts heat to steam to operate medical equipment, space heating , and air conditioning as well as provides hot and cold water to the hospital. The CEP is fully compli ant with state and local air emissions standards. In 2017, Sharp installed n ew software on 10 air condition ing units in the data center at its corporate office , resulting in more efficient cooling and a 16% decrease in power usage. In addition, n ew virtual env ironments replaced more than 150 devices in the data center, further reducing power and cooling needs for the building . In 2018, Sharp opened the new Copley building which houses administrative space for SRSMG, as well as the complex, consolidated Sharp HealthCare Laboratory that services the entire Sharp system. To reduce the Copley building's CO 2 emissions, Sharp restored the original fuel cell that came with the building upon purchase, making it the first Sharp location to use fuel cell energy. A fuel cell uses the chemical energy of hydrogen or another fuel to produce clean and efficient electricity , which could help reduce the Copley building's CO 2 emissions by more than 90 % while self-generat ing over 3 million kWh of electricity per year. In 2019, fluorescent light bulbs were replaced with high -performance light -emitting diode (LED) bulbs at multiple Sharp sites as part of a systemwide LED lighting retrofit project. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 40 The new LED lighting is projected to decrease energy usage by 55%. It is al so rated to meet and exceed the requirements established by California's Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Since implementation, retrofits have been completed at SRSMC, SCVMC, SMMC, SCHHC and Sharp's system offices. Also in 2019, a set -point temperature (an agreed upon temperature that a building will meet) project was completed throughout Sharp's facilities in order to standardize, optimize, maintain, and enforce temperature and l ighting schedules during occupied and unoccupied hours. Research indicates that increasing cooling temperature set - points and decreasing heating temperature set -points by two degrees Fahrenheit decreases energy use by approximately 1% and 5%, respectively. In January 2020, Sharp will open the new Ocean View Tower on the SCVMC campus which has been designed to meet the organization's sustainability goals. The Ocean View Tower will be approximately 12% more efficient than Cal -Green requirements (California's mandatory green building standards code) and is projected to reduce annual CO 2 emissions by nearly 250,000 lbs. compared to buildings of similar square footage. This will be achieved through the installation of high -efficiency boilers, the use of more eff icient heating, ventilati on and air -conditioning system s (HVAC) in non -patient care areas, and the use of LED lighting during the approximately three -year construction process. In addition, the installation of a cool roof (a roof designed to reflect more s unlight and absorb less heat than a standard roof) on the Ocean View Tower will further reduce energy consumption. All Sharp hospitals engage in the EPA's ES database and monitor their ES scores on a monthly basis, thus following an international standard for energy efficiency created by the EPA. Buildings that are certified by ES must earn a 75 or higher on the EPA's energy performance scale, indicating that the building performs better than at least 75 % of similar buildings nationwide without sacrifices in comfort or quality. According to the EPA, buildings that qualify for ES certification typically use 35 % or less energy than buildings of similar size and function. As a result of Sharp's commitment to superior energy performance and responsible use of n atural resources, SCHHC and SCVMC earned the ES certification in 2019 . SCHHC previously earned ES certification in 2007, each year from 2010 t o 2013, and in 2017 and 2018. SCVMC previously earned ES certification from 2009 to 2011, as well as in 2013 and f rom 2015 to 2018. In addition, the SRSMC Downtown office building meets Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) silver certification specifications, making it o ne of the first medical office buildings of its kind in SDC . SMMC participates in the San Diego Higher Opportunity Projects and Programs Retrocommissioning Program (HOPP s RCx), which is funded by California utility customers and administered by SDG&E . Through HOPPs RCx, qualified facilities receive a free building analysis to identify energy -saving opportunities, financial incentives to implement energy -saving measures and staff training on post -installation Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 41 maintenance. HOPPs RCx projects typically reduce building energy costs by 5 to 20% with financial returns on investment averaging less than two years. In 2017, Sharp received the Environmental Stewardship Award in the large business category from the BBB serving San Diego, Orange and Imperial C ounties. The award recognizes businesses that increase efforts toward a more sustainable f ootprint and green initiatives. Also in 2017, Sharp was named San Diego's Grand Energy Champion by SDG&E in recognition of its continuous commitment to energy efficiency. The award specifically noted the particular challenges faced by health care organizat ions trying to conserve energy, given the need to maintain a comfortable, clean and safe environment for patients, visitors and staff 24 hours a day, seven days a week. See Table 4 for a listing of Sharp's natural resource conservation efforts.

Sharp is committed to significantly reduc ing waste at each entity and extend ing the lifespan of local landfill s. In FY 2019, Sharp's waste minimization initiatives \u2014 including recycling, don ating, composting, reprocessing and reusing programs \u2014 have helped divert more than 2,170 tons of waste . See Table 5 for Sharp's waste diversion rates in FY 201 9. Sharp's Waste Minimization Committee provides oversight of systemwide waste minimization initiatives. See Table 6 for specific waste minimization efforts occurring across the organization . In addition, Sharp achieved the following in waste minimization in FY 201 9: Sharp's single -waste stream recycling program diverted more than 2.5 million lbs. of trash from the landfill, including non -confidential paper, cardboard, exam table paper, plastic, aluminum cans and glass containers. Sharp collected, reprocessed and sterilized 106,000 lbs. of surgical instruments for further use. Sharp donated more than 146,000 lbs. of computer equipment in place of utilizing e -waste disposal. Sharp diverted more than 84,000 lbs. of plastic and cardboard from the landfill through the use of reusable sharps containers. Lighting Retrofits to LEDs Occupancy Sensors Mist Eliminators Plumbing Projects to Address Water Leaks Thermostat Control Software & Temperature Set-Point Projects Filtered Water Dispensers to Replace Plastic Water Bottles Water -efficient Dishwashing/Equipment Washing/Chemical Dispensing System Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 43 Sharp has significantly reduced paper waste through electronic bill pay, cloud - based document storage , and office supply reuse and repurpose program s. SRSMC Sorrento Mesa and Mira Mesa locations stopped purchasing cups and paper goods for breakrooms and encourages staff to bring their own reusable containers to minimize waste. Sharp continued to partici pate in San Diego County's Hazmat Stakeholder meetings to discuss best practices for medical waste management with other hospital leaders in SDC. Sharp was named the 2017 Outstanding Recycling Program by CRRA for its innovative waste minimization initiatives . In addition , the City of San Diego's Environmental Services Department named Sharp as one of the Recyclers of the Year in its 2016 Waste Reduction and Recycling Awards Program.

In collaboration with Sodexo \u2014 its food service partner \u2014 Sharp remains an innovator and early adopter of a variety of sustainable and healthy food practices that enhance the health of patients, employees, the community and the environment. Sharp's Food and Nutrition Best Health Committee supports these efforts by promot ing food sustainability awareness throughout the health care system and within the greater San Diego community. Sharp's Mindful food program is a key component of the organization's effort to increase the consumption of healthy foods in its cafeterias while reducing its carbon footprint. The Mindful food program includes the following elements: reduced meat consumption through the promotion of Meatless Mondays; increas ed purchases of beef and poultry raised without the routine use of antibiotics; menus that highlight wellness options ; increased use of locally sourced , fresh, organic and sustainable food; food composting ; increased recycling activities; the promotion of sugarless beverages; the use of post - consumer recycled packaging solutions ; and participation in Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) \u2014 a community of individuals who pledge support to a farm operation in order for it to become, either legally or spiritually, the community's farm . Up to 40% of the food produced in the U.S. is never eaten and instead goes to waste. Sodexo teams at SCMVC and SMH use Lean path food waste prevention technology to combat food w aste and facilitate compliance with new comp osting and recycling laws. Leanp ath provides an advanced food waste tracking software system to help kitchen teams measure food prior to discarding or donating in order to prevent pre -consumer food waste (waste g enerated in the kitchen) as well as post -consumer food waste (food Waste Minimization Project Entity SCHHC Paper Napkins and Plastic Cutlery Dispensers Surgical Instrument Reprocessing Replacement of Bottled Water with Spa Water Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 46 the consumer throws away) from entering the landfill. In addition, the use of self-audit checklists help kitchen teams reduce waste between food preparation and cleanup. Since 2016, SMH, SMV, and SGH have collaborated with the S an Diego Rescue Mission and the Food Bank on an innovative food recovery program that donates food items that can no longer be used in Sharp's kitchens but are perfectly healthy and nutritious to more than 45 hunger relief organizations in SDC. In addition, SCVMC's partnership with FSD and SCHHC's partnership with the Food Bank makes Sharp the first health care system in the county to donate food to San Dieg ans at such a wide - scale level. Food recovery efforts benefi t the local community in two ways: one, by increasing availability of nutritious meals to people with barriers to healthy food access; and two, by enabling Sharp to save on waste disposal costs and keep food out of landfills. In 2019, Sharp donated more th an 30 tons of food to these safety -net organizations. All Sharp hospitals participate in food waste composting. In 2012, SMMC became the first hospital campus to participate in the City of San Diego's food scraps composting program. In 2017, SCVMC began composting in partnership with the City of Chula Vista. That same year , SGH collaborated with Resource Management Group recycling center to begin a composting program , which expanded to SCHHC in September 2018. Through these programs, food waste at t hese Sharp locations is processed into a rich compost product , which is provided to residents at no charge for volumes of up to two cubic yards. The compost offers several benefits including improving the health and fertility of soil, reducing the need to purchase commercial fertilizers, increasing the soil's ability to retain water and helping the environment by recycling valuable organic materials. In FY 201 9, Sharp's composting programs diverted nearly 50 0,000 lbs. of waste from landfills. Further, in F Y 2019, Sharp's use of imperfect produce in its kitchens \u2014 produce that is aesthetically less -than-perfect yet still nutritious and usable \u2014 prevented the waste of more than 1,600 lbs. of food. SCHHC, SMH and SMV also continued to operate the first county -approved hospital -based organic gardens, p roduce from which is used in meals served at the hospital s' caf\u00e9s. Sharp is in the process of eliminating oil fryers in its kitchens, with healthier methods of food preparation already in use at SCHHC and SMMC. In addition, in FY 2019, SGH and SCVMC recycled more than 16,000 lbs. of used cooking oil for conversion to eco - friendly biodiesel fuel through Filta, an environmental kitchen solutions service. Sharp is an active member of San Diego's Nutrition in Healthcare Leadership Team. The group of more than a dozen SDC hospitals and health care systems collaborates to ensure that all food and beverages served by the county's hospitals are healthy, fresh, affordable, and produced in a manner that supports the local economy, environment and community. In addition, Sharp continues to participate in Practice Greenhealth's Healthier Food Challenge . Through the program, Sharp commits to reducing its purchase of animal protein and increasing its purchase of local ly grown food and sustainable animal proteins (grass -fed, antibiotic - and hormone -free beef and cage -free Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 47 chicken ). In FY 2019, Sharp reduced animal protein purchases by almost 32%, and increased sustainable animal protein purchases by more than 60%, compa red to FY 2014. As a recipient of the 2018 EMIES UnWasted Food award, Sharp was recognized by the San Diego Food System Alliance for its collaboration as an innovator and early adopter of food waste prevention and recovery programs. The award is designed to honor the 1996 Federal Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, which encourages food donation to nonprofit organizations by protecting donors from liability. Sharp previously earned this award in 2016. Sharp and Sodexo remain committed to food sustainability efforts that improve both individual and environmental health. Sharp's sustainable food initiatives are outlined in Table 7 . Table 7: Sustainable Food Projects by Sharp HealthCare Entity Commuter Solutions Sharp supports ride sharing, public transit programs and other transportation efforts to reduce CO 2 emissions generated by the organization and its employees. Sharp's Commuter Solutions Subcommittee develop s innovative and accessible programs an d marketing campaigns to educate employees on the benefits of ride sharing and other environmentally friendly modes of transportation . Sharp's ongoing efforts to promote alternative commute r choices in the workplace ha ve led to its recognition as a SANDAG Sustainable Food Project Entity SCHHC SMH/ SMBHWN SMV/ SMC SRSMG Report Card and Indicators Tracking Food Recovery Imperfect Produce Composting Oil Recycling Fryers Eliminated Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 48 iCommute Diamond Award recipient consistently between 2001 and 2010, and again from 2013 to 2019. Sharp replaced high fuel-consuming cargo vans with economy Ford transit vehicles, which save approximately five miles per gallon. In addition, Sharp's employee parking lots offer carpool and motorcycle parking spaces. Sharp was the first health care system in San Diego to of fer electric vehicle chargers (EVCs), helping to reduce carbon emissions and dependence on petroleum by supporting the creation of a national EVC infrastructure. As part of the nationwide Electric Vehicle Project, Sharp has installed EVCs at its corporate office location, Copley building , SCVMC, SMMC and some SRSMC sites . Sharp will continue to expand EVCs at its other entities. Sharp encourages employees to participate in alterna tive commuting methods such as public transit, carpooli ng, vanpooling, biking, walking and telecommuting . Employees are encouraged to participate in SANDAG's iCommute program , which provides ride - sharing match es based on a commuter's work schedule, dep arture location and destination. In addition, Sharp has enrolled in SANDAG' s Guaranteed Ride Home program which provides commuters who carpool, vanpool, take an express bus, ride the Coaster, or bike to work three or more times a week with a taxi or a rental car in case of an emergency or be coming stranded at work. Sharp employee s can also purchase discounted monthly bus passes. Employees can monitor the cost and carbon savings from their alternat ive commuting methods by logging their miles in an internal tracking tool on Sharp's intranet site . Sharp provides bike racks at its en tities as well as offers a bicycle commuter benefit which gives employees who bike to work up to $20 per month to use toward qualified costs associated with bicycle purchase, improvement, repair and storage. In addition, Sharp participates in SANDAG's annu al Bike to Work Day event each May. In 2019, Sharp employees were among nearly 10,000 San Diegans who opted to ride their bike to work. During the event, Sharp hosted several pit stops at various sites throughout SDC where they offered bikers free food and beverages to fuel their ride. In FY 2019, Sharp recognized National Rideshare Week during the first week of October by encouraging employees to replac e their solo drive with a greener commut ing choice . The annual effort is instrumental in helping reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions throughout SDC . Furthering its commitment to improving commuting options for its employees, Sharp supplies and supports the hardware and software for more than 700 employees who are able to efficiently and effectively telecommute to work. These employees work in areas that do not require an on -site presence, such as IT, transcription and human resources. Sharp also offers compressed work schedule s to eligible full -time employe es, which enables them to complete the standard eighty -hour biweekly work requirement in less than 10 workdays . Telecommuting and compressed work schedule options can help Sharp to reduce CO 2 emissions, lower commut ing costs and enhance employee morale. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 49 Community Education and Outreach Sharp actively educates employees and the community about its sustainability efforts . In addition to the following activities, Sharp's ongoing community education and outreach efforts are highlighted in Table 8. In April, Sharp held its annual systemwide All Ways Green Earth Week celebration, including Earth Fairs at each Sharp hospital and system office. E mployees learned how to decrease their water, energy and resource consumption, divert waste through recycling, and redu ce their carbon footprint through alternative commuting methods . Many of Sharp's key vendors participated in th e fairs to help raise awareness of green initiatives and how Sharp is involved in those programs. In addition, Sharp publishe s e- newsletters that highlight the organization's environmental accomplishments and remind employees about proper workplace recycling, carpooling, and energy and water conservation . In October and April, Sharp held community recycling event s that included free e -waste recycl ing and confidential document destruction. The event also included the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's Drug Take Back Program, which provides a safe, convenient, and responsible method of drug disposal and educates the general public about the potential for prescription medication abuse.

In FY 2019, Sharp provided disaster preparedness education to staff, community members and community health professionals, as well as collaborated with numerous state and local organizations to prepare the community for a potential emergency or disaster. Sharp' s disaster preparedness team offered several training programs to first responders and community health care providers throughout SDC. This included a standardized, on -scene federal emergency management training for hospital leaders titled National Inciden t Management System/Incident Command System/Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) as well as a training focused specifically on HICS, an incident management system that can be used by hospitals to manage threats, planned events or emergencies. A training course was also offered on the WebEOC (Web Emergency Operations Center) crisis information management system, which provides real -time information sharing between health care systems and outside agencies during a disaster. In addition, in June Sharp's dis aster leadership provided education about personal disaster preparedness at the County of San Diego's Vital Aging 2019 event at the San Diego Convention Center. In FY 201 9, Sharp's disaster leadership donated their time to state and local organiz ations and committees, including County of San Diego Emerge ncy Medical Care Committee, California Hospital Association Emergency Management Advisory Committee , California Department of Public Health Joint Advisory Committee, Ronald McDonald House Operations Commi ttee, and San Diego County Civilian/Military Liaison Work Group. Sharp's disaster leadership also participates in the County of San Diego Healthcare Disaster Coalition \u2014 a multi -agency group of representatives who assist the county in improving mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery activities during emergencies and disasters. As part of this coalition, in FY 2019, Sharp's disaster No Smoking Policy Organic Farmer's Market Organic Gardens Recycling Education Ride Share Promotion Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 51 leadership led a subcommittee to review hospital emergency food and water supply planning and identify tools and best practices to disseminate to community health care professionals. Further, Sharp's disaster leadership continued to participate in the Statewide Medical Health Exercise Program. This work group of representatives from local, regional and state agencies \u2014 including health departments, emergency medical services, environmental health departments, hospitals, law enforcement, fire services and more \u2014 is designed to guide local emergency planners in developing, planning and conducting emergency responses. Throu gh participation in the DHHS Public Health Emergency Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) grant, Sharp created the Sharp HealthCare HPP Disast er Preparedness Partnership . The partnership includes Sharp as well as SDC hospitals, health clinics and other health providers. The partnership seeks to continually identify and develop relationships with health care entities, nonprofit organizations, law enforcement, military installations and other organiz ations that serve SDC and are located near partner health care facilitie s. In FY 2019, the Sharp HealthCare HPP Disast er Preparedness Partnership continued to network as well as provide resources, trainings and information to prepare non -hospital entities in SDC for a collaborative response to an emergency or disaster . Sharp supports the safety efforts of California and the City of San Diego through maintenance and storage of a county decontamination trailer at SGH to be used in response to a n event requir ing mass decontamination. Additionally, all Sharp hospitals are prepared for an emergency with backup water supplies that will last up to 96 hours in the event of an interruption to the system's normal water supply. At any time, global endemic events have the potential to impact public health in SDC . Sharp continues to collaborate with community agencies, County of San Diego Public Health Services and first responders to delive r uninterrupted care to the community in the face of public health threats. Sharp Equality Alliance Sharp recognizes the power of bringing individual differences, cultures and backgrounds together to create a stronger whole. Working as a diverse team of people strengthens Sharp's ability to become the best place to work, practice medicine and receive care. In 20 14, a network of Sharp employees formed the Sharp Equality Alliance (SEA) to serve as a catalyst for Sharp's dedication to embracing diversity and celebrating equality. The SEA works to: increase awareness of diverse culture s within Sharp's workforce; focus on the influence of employees' individual backgrounds and strengths; and partner across the Sharp system and with the San Diego community to achieve equality for all. The SEA accomplishes these goals by engaging Sharp 's workforce in education and dialogue around diversity and equality, as well as through participation in community events that promote inclusiv ity and acceptance. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 52 The SEA encourages diversity awareness among Sharp employees through the communication of educa tional articles and resources that emphasize the importance of mutual respect in the workplace and appreciation for each team member's unique talents and perspectives. In addition, the SEA promotes the dignified and sensitive treatment of each Sharp patien t in a manner that responds to individual cultural health beliefs, preferences and communication needs to ensure health equity. The SEA also provides resources and recommendations to Sharp leadership to engage them in the process of ensuring inclusive valu es within the organization. In 2017, the SEA hosted its first Quarterly Breakfast Forum, which welcomed all Sharp employees and Sharp -affiliated physicians to learn and engage in meaningful conversations about current and relevant topics regarding divers ity and inclusion . Since then, the SEA has organized eight Quarterly Breakfast Forums addressing the following subjects: Celebrating Human Rights Day - Promoting Equality, Justice and Human Dignity; Chaldean Life Experience in America; Hunger and Health - The Intersection of Food Insecurity, Health and Health Care Utilization; Transgender -Affirming Health Care; Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease - Where Are We Now and What Can We Do?; Mental Health Challenges for Adolescents and Young Adults: Addressing Stigma and Increasing Access; Seniors and Mental Health; and Weight Bias and the Stigma of Obesity. In addition, the SEA identifies and creates opportunities to publicly demonstrate Sharp's commitment to diversity and inclusiveness. Since its inception, the SEA has represented Sharp at numerous community events that support equality and acceptance for a variety of populations. Events have included the National Alliance on Mental Illness' (NAMI's) 2018 NAMIWalks/Runs San Diego County, as well as both the 2018 and 2019 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Parades and San Diego Pride Parades. The SEA looks forward to expanding its reach across the Sharp system, as well as its presence in the San Diego community. In FY 2020, the SEA plans to integrate diversity traini ng into Sharp's workforce education and compliance programs in order to continue strengthening cultural competency, inclusive thinking and workplace sensitivity among team members. In addition, the SEA will host presentations that engage the public \u2014 including community members, academic and health care institutions, and other interested community groups \u2014 in collaborative discussion and idea -sharing surrounding various diversity issues. The SEA will also continue to promote Sharp's commitment to diversity and equality at community events, including NAMIWalks/Runs San Diego County, the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Parade, the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . Human Dignity Award Breakfast and the San Diego Pride Parade. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 53 Employee Wellness: Sharp Best Health12 Sharp recognizes that improving the health of its team members benefits the health of the broader community. Since 2010, the Sharp Best Health employee wellness program has created initiatives to improve the overall health, safety, happiness and productivity of Sharp's workforce. Each Sharp hospital, SRSM G site and system office location has a dedicated Best Health committee that works to motivate team members to incorporate healthy habits into their lifestyles and support them on their journey to attain their personal health goals. Team members are encouraged to participate in a variety of workplace health initiatives ranging from fitness challenges and weight management programs to health education and events. Sharp Best Health also offers an interactive, web-based health portal where employees can create a wellness plan and track their progress. Since 2013, Sharp Best Health has offered annual employee health screenings to raise individual awareness of important biometric health measures, educate team members on reducing the risk of related health issues, and encourage employees to track changes in their metrics over time. In FY 201 9, nearly 9,000 employees received health screenings for blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, blood sugar and tobacco use. Post-screening resources and tools are available for Sharp employees and their family members . This includ es free access to a health coach as well as classes on a variety of health topics, including smoking cessation, healthy food choices, physical activi ty, stress management and managing the challenges of living with a chronic condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma or arthritis. The AHA recommends walking 10,000 steps a day to promote overall health. To align with this goal, in FY 2019, Sharp Best Health introduced a new app -based program called Move More Rewards, which encourages team members to use digital activity monitors to track their steps, distance, calories burned, sleep patterns and more. By syncing statistics to computers or s martphones, these devices help inspire team members to achieve their personal fitness goals. Throughout the year, Sharp Best Health held both entity -specific and systemwide activity c hallenges to encourage team members to set personal goals and compete for prizes. During FY 201 9, more than 2,300 participants across the Sharp system participated in Move More Rewards, walking an average of 8,900 steps per day. In addition, Sharp's acceptable footwear policy permits employees to wear walking shoes each day of the week at Sharp system offices to promote safety along with increased physical activity.

In addition, Sharp Best Health has collaborated with certified mindfulness facilitators to provide on -site mindfu lness programming at six Sharp locations, including both series and drop -in classes , mindfulness clubs, and mindful lunching events . Throughout FY 201 9, Sharp Best Health continued to provide Wellness on Wheels to help Sharp employees access health resou rces and programs during work hours. Wellness on Wheels involves a Sharp Best Health committee member rounding in staff lounges, hospital units and nursing stations to promote a new and relevant health - related subject each month. Each session includes an e ducational component, an interactive activity and a call to action. Wellness on Wheels gives employees access to quick and relevant wellness resources where they work, accommodating their unique schedules and dedication to patient care. During FY 201 9, Wel lness on Wheels topics included flu knowledge, self -care for stress relief and relaxation, employee wellness offerings, essential oils, mindful eating, yoga poses for relaxation, heart health , nutritious snacks, promoting physical activity and common workp lace safety hazards , including safe handling of sharp objects . In 201 9, Sharp continued its partnership with Farm Fresh to You to give Sharp employees discounted access to customi zable boxes of organic, locally grown produce. This CSA service offers a con venient method for employees and their families to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into their diet while supporting local farmers. In FY 2019, Sharp Best Health partnered with First Class Vending to provide \"micro markets\" for Sharp sites experienci ng challenges with access to healthy food, such as locations without caf\u00e9 or cafeteria services, and those that lack healthy options for night shift staff. The new micro markets have increased the availability of healthy food, beverage and snack items for clinical teams regardless of where and when they work. WW (formerly Weight Watchers\u00ae) offers weight -loss services and produ cts founded on a scientifically based approach to weight management that encourages healthy eating, increased physical activity and other healthy lifestyle behaviors. Sharp Best Health continued its partnership with WW to offer employees a subsidized membership rate to any WW program. With program availability at work, in the community and online, this partnership has offered Sharp te am members a variety of healthy eating and physical activity options that can be tailored to different lifestyles and schedules. At any given time during FY 201 9, approximately 510 Sharp employees were actively using WW. Since the program's inception in 2016, participating employees have lost an estimated 4,800 lbs. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 56 In addition to providing WW at work, during FY 201 9, Sharp Best Health continued to partner with the Sharp Rees -Steal y Center for Health Management to offer free in - person and online nutrition classes to Sharp employees through the New Weigh program. New Weigh is an eight -week weight loss program that emphasizes nutrition education and healthy lifestyle development. Prog ram participants create a semi - structured food plan and have access to a skilled health coach or RD to ensure continued support and accountability. During FY 201 9, 147 Sharp employees completed the New Weigh program. Nearly 1 in 6 community members face t he threat of hunger every day in SDC. Each month, the Food Bank distributes food to approximately 3 50,000 children and families, active -duty military and fixed -income seniors living in poverty. For more than a decade, Sharp has used holiday food drives to support the Food Bank's tremendous efforts , and in recent years, Sharp Best Health has transformed these events into superfood drives. Throughout the 2018 holiday season, Sharp team members were encouraged to donate nutritious and sustaining superfoods , helping to ensure the accessibility of healthy food to San Diegans in need. Through the six -week holiday superfood drive, locations throughout the Sharp system collected more than 3,900 lbs. of nutritious food for the Food Bank . In addition, Sharp team members donated nearly $3,200 through a Sharp Virtual Food Drive specifically benefiting the Food Bank . Combined, these donations and funds provided nearly 16,000 healthy meals for San Diegans in need of assistance with putting fo od on the table during the holidays.

Community Benefit Planning Process Designing the Community Benefit Strategy For the past two decades, Sharp HealthCare has participated in a countywide collaborative with hospitals, health care organizations and community agencies to conduct a triennial community health needs assessment (CHNA) that identifies priority health needs for San Diego County. Since 2013, Sharp has developed CHNAs for each of its individually licensed hospitals in order to address the requirements for not-for-profit hospitals under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Findings from Sharp's CHNAs are used to provide a foundation for community benefit program planning and implementation specific to the communities served by each hospital. For the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report, Fiscal Year 2019, each Sharp hospital used the results of its individual 2019 CHNA to help identify the needs of its communities; update its community benefit objectives in response to those identified needs; report the community benefit programs and services provided according to Senate Bill 697; and create a community benefit plan for the upcoming fiscal year. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 67 Section 3 Community Benefit Planning Process One of the more recent ways in which Sharp is assisting the community through its community benefit is providing real data about health in the community. Community organizations can use this easily accessed, local data to augment their ability to buttress their applications for funding and otherwise help them fulfi ll their missions. Through this type of mutual reinforcement, efforts to improve the health of our community multiply exponentially . \u2014 Sara Steinhoffer, Vice President of Government Relations, Sharp HealthCare For more than 20 years, Sharp HealthCare (Sha rp) has based its community benefit planning on findings from its triennial Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) process. Sharp utilizes its CHNA findings in combination with the expertise in programs and services of each Sharp hospital, as well as knowledge of the populations and communities served by those hospitals, to provide a foundation for community benefit program planning and implementation. This section describes Sharp's most recent CHNA process and findings, which were completed in Septemb er 2019. Sharp HealthCare 2019 Community Health Needs Assessments Sharp has been a longtime partner in the process of identifying and responding to the health needs of the San Diego community. Since 1995, Sharp has participated in a countywide collaborat ive that includes a broad range of hospitals, health care organizations and community agencies to conduct a triennial CHNA that identifies and prioritizes health needs for San Diego County (SDC). In addition, to address the requirements for not -for-profit hospitals under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Sharp has developed CHNAs for each of its individually licensed hospitals since 2013. This process gathers both hospital data and the perspectives of community health leaders and residents in order to identify and prioritize health needs for residents across the county, with a special focus on community members facing inequities . Further, the process seeks to highlight community health needs that Sharp hospitals could impact through programs, s ervices and collaboration. For the 2019 CHNA process, Sharp actively participated in a collaborative CHNA effort led by the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) and in contract with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University (SDSU) . The complete HASD&IC 2019 CHNA is available for public viewing and download at https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ . The methodology and findings of the collaborative HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA significantly informed the process and findings of Sharp's individual hospital CHNAs , thus, both CHNA processes are described throughout this section. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 68 The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA was implemented and managed by a standing CHNA Committee comprised of representati ves from seve n hospitals and health systems: Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego Palomar Health Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego Scripps Health (Chair) Sharp HealthCare (Vice Chair) Tri-City Medical Center UC San Diego Health To develop its individual hospital CHNAs, Sharp analyzed its own hospital -specific data and contracted separately with IPH to conduct community engagement activities expressly for the patients , providers and community members served by Sharp . In accordance with federal regulations, the Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH) 201 9 CHNA also includes needs identified for communities served by Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns, as the two hospitals share a license, and report all utilization and financial d ata as a single entity to California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Developmen t (OSHPD). As such, the SMH 2019 CHNA summarizes the processes and findings for communities served by both hospital entities. The 201 9 CHNAs for each Sharp hospital help inform current and future community benefit progra ms, services and partnerships , particularly for community members who face inequities. This section describes the general methodology empl oyed for Sharp's 2019 CHNAs , including applicable elements of t he HASD&IC 2019 CHNA. 2019 CHNA Objectives The 2019 CHNA processes (HASD&IC and Sharp) were designed to build off the findings from and community feedback on the 2016 CHNA processes. With thoughtful application of the knowledge and community insights gai ned from the 2016 CHNAs, the CHNA Committee developed the following objectives for the 2019 CHNA processes: Identify, understand and prioritize the health -related needs of SDC residents, particularly those community members served by Sharp. Provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in SDC, as well as inform and guide local hospitals in the development of their programs and strategies that address identified community health needs. Build on and strengthen community partnerships es tablished through the 2016 CHNA processes. Obtain deeper feedback from and about specific populations in San Diego who face inequities.Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 69 Align with national best practices around CHNA development and implementation, including the integration of health condi tions with social determinants of health ( SDOH ).20 Community Defined For the purposes of the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA as well as Sharp's 2019 CHNAs , the study area is the entire County of San Diego. More than three million people live in socially and ethnically diverse SDC. Information on key demographics, socioeconomic factors, access to care, health behaviors and the physical environment can be fou nd in the full HASD&IC 2019 CHNA report at: https://hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ . Recognizing that health needs differ across the region and that socioeconomic factors impact health outcomes, Sharp's 2019 CHNA proces s utilized the Dignity Health Community Need Index (CNI) to identify communities with the highest level of health disparities and needs. The CNI generates a score for every ZIP code based on data about barriers to socioeconomic security. The five barriers used to determine CNI scores are: 1.Income Barriers 2.Cultural Barriers 3.Educational Barriers 4.Insurance Barriers 5.Housing Barriers The CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP code in the United States on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP code with the least need (light blue in Figure 8), while a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP code with the most n eed (dark green in Figure 8). For a detailed description of the CNI please visit the interactive website at: http://cni.chw -interactive.org/ . Figure 8 below presents a CNI map of SDC. This information was utilized to collect input from specific San Diego communities with health disparities and to guide the exploration of Sharp's community programs and services within those communities. 20 'Social determinants of health ' refers to the conditions in the places where people live, learn, work and play, which affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes. https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/index.htm . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 70 Figure 8: San Diego County, CNI Map21 Methodology Again, t he HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process and findings provided the foundation for the Sharp 2019 CHNA process and as such are described as applicable throughout this report. For complete details on the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process, please visit the HASD&IC website at www.hasdic.org/2019 -chna/ or contact Lindsey Wade at lwade@hasdic.org . For the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, quantitative analyses of publicly available data provided an overview of critical health issues across SDC, while qualitative analyses of community feedback provided improved understanding of the experiences and needs of San Diegans. The CHNA Committee reviewed these analyses and applied a pre - determined set of criteria to them to prioritize the top health needs in SDC. This process is represe nted in Figure 9 below. 21 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018; OSHPD accessed via SpeedTrack\u00a9, Inc., 2017. Map produced by Sharp Strategic Planning Department, 2019. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 71 Figure 9: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA \u2014 Process Map Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 72 Quantitative/Secondary Data The 2019 CHNA process began with a comprehensive scan of recent community health statistics from several public sources to support both the HASD&IC and Sharp 2019 CHNAs. Data from the Dignity Health CNI and the Public Health Alliance of Southern California's Healthy Places Index were used to identify geographic communities in SDC that were more likely to experienc e health inequities . This knowledge guided the selection of communities/individuals for community engagement activities, as well as the development of community engagement questions. Hospital discharge data exported from SpeedTrack's California Universal Patient Information Discovery application were used to identify current and three -year trends in primary diagnosis discharge categories and were stratified by age and race. This allowed for the identification of health disparities and the conditions having the greatest impact on hospit als and health systems in SDC. Data from national and state -wide data sets were analyzed including SDC mortality and morbidity data, and data related to SDOH. In addition, Kaiser Permanente consolidated data from several national and state -wide data sets related to a variety of health conditions and SDOH in SDC , and conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to identify those SDOH that were most predictive of negative health outcomes. Kaiser Permanente then created a web -based data platform (chna.org/ kp) to post these analyses for use in the CHNA. In addition, Sharp inpatient and emergency department data, as well as Sharp Cancer Registry Data w ere analyzed for Sharp's 2019 CHNAs into the Sharp 2019 CHNA analyses. Community Engagement HASD&IC 2019 CHNA community engagement activities included focus groups, key informant interviews, and an online survey designed for stakeholders from every region of SDC, all age groups, and numerous racial and ethnic groups. Collaboration with the County of San Diego Health & Human Services Agency, Public Health Services was vital to this process. A total of 579 individuals participated in the 2019 CHNA: 138 community residents and 441 leaders and experts. Please see Figure 10 for details on the types of participants engaged. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 73 Figure 10: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA \u2014 Community Engagement Activity Summary Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 74 In addition , Sharp contracted separately with the IPH at SDSU to conduct multiple community engagement activities to collect input specifically from Sharp providers as well as from patients and community members served by Sharp hospitals. This input focused on behavioral health, cancer, diabetes, maternal and prenatal care, aging conce rns (formerly termed senior health ), and the needs of patients and community members facing inequities . These additional efforts included focus groups and key informant interviews involving 50 Sharp providers and 14 patients/community members. Further, IPH created case studies with the intent of representing a \"typical\" patient experience within Sharp. The case studies focused specifically on breast cancer and high-risk pregnancy. Lastly, the Sharp 2019 CHNA community engagement process included a robust o nline survey conducted through the Sharp Insight Community. The Sharp Insight Community is a private , online environment for Sharp patients and their families, community members, Sharp employees and Sharp -affiliated physicians. The 2019 CHNA Sharp Insight Community online survey sought to obtain feedback on the top health and social needs faced by SDC community members, as well as assess their awareness of community outreach programs offered by Sharp. The online survey also gave participants the opportunity to provide specific suggestions for Sharp to improve community health and well -being. A total of 380 community members completed the online survey. Figure 11 below summarizes Sharp 2019 CHNA community engagement activities. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 75 Figure 11: Sharp 2019 CHNA Community Engagement Activities Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 76 Prioritization The CHNA Committee collectively reviewed the quantitative and qualitative data and findings. Several criteria were applied to the data to determine which health conditions were of the highest priority in SDC. These criteria included: the severity of the need; the magnitude/scale of the need; disparities or inequities; and change over time. Those health conditions and SDOH that met the largest number of crit eria were then selected as top priority community health needs. As the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process included robust representation from the communities served by Sharp , this prioritization process was replicated for Sharp's 2019 CHNA s. Findings The Figure 12 below illustrates the highest priority community health needs in SDC, identified by the 2019 CHNA Committee (in alphabetical order by SDOH or health condition). Figure 12: 2019 CHNA Top 10 Community Health Needs for San Diego County Figure 12 illustrates the interactive nature of SDOH and health conditions \u2014 each impacting the other. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 77 In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across 2019 CHNA community engagement activities. For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services that address SDOH, which consequentially impacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. These same findings were supported through both the quantitative analyses and community engagement activities conducted specifically as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process . In addition, Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy , was also identified as a community health need during Sharp's 2019 CHNA process . Community Assets and Recommendations The 2019 CHNA s identified many community assets in SDC, including social service organizations, government departments and agencies, hospital and clinic partners, and other community members and organizations engaged in addressing many of the needs priorit ized by the 2019 CHNAs . In addition, 2 -1-1 San Diego (2-1-1) is an important community resource and information hub that facilitates access to services. Through its 24/7 phone service and online database, as well as a host of innovative navigation and supp ort programs, 2 -1-1 helps connect individuals with community, health and disaster services. 2-1-1 researched their database using relevant search terms for each identified need. The number of resources located for each need are listed below: Aging Conce rns: 91 Access to Care: 260 Behavioral Health: 703 Cancer: 129 Cardiovascular Disease: 161 Diabetes: 144 Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy: 251 Obesity: 298 SDOH : 5,836 ( e.g., transportation, food access, etc.) In addition to community input on health conditions and SDOH, a wealth of ideas emerged from community engagement participants about how hospitals and health systems could support additional resources and partner with organizations to help meet San Diego's community health needs. Figure 13 outlines types of resources identified by community engagement participants . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 78 Figure 13: 2019 CHNA \u2014 Resources and Opportunities to Address Identified Health Needs Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 79 Further, to increase awareness of Sharp's CHNA process and community programs, the Sharp CHNA Community Guide was developed and made publicly available on website at: Sharp CHNA Community Guide seeks to provide community members with a user -friendly resource to learn about Sharp's CHNA process and findings, as well as the identified health and SDOH needs a ddressed through Sharp programs. The Sharp CHNA Community Guide also provides a direct link for community members to provide feedback on Sharp's CHNA processes . An updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide will be available on sharp.com in early - to mid - 2020. Next Steps for the CHNA Sharp is committed to the health and well -being of its co mmunity, and the findings of Sharp's 2019 CHNA s will help inform the activities and services provided by S harp to improve the health of its community members. These programs are detailed in Sharp hospitals' FY 2020 - FY 2023 Implementation S trategies publicly available online at: http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Sharp will continue to work with HASD&IC and IPH as part of the CHNA Committee to develop and implement Phase 2 of the 2019 CHNA. Phase 2 will focus on continued engagement of comm unity partners to analyze and improve the CHNA process, as well as refine hospital implementation strategies. Thus, the CHNA process will evolve to meet the needs of San Diegans and support the work of our community partners who also address identified com munity health needs. This will include a deeper dive into the impact of stigma on health and exploration of how hospitals may address this impact. The health needs and SDOH identified in the 2019 CHNA process will not be resolved with a quick fix. Rather, they will require time, persistence, collaboration and innovation. The entire Sharp system is devoted to this journey, and remains steadfastly dedicated to the care and improvement of health and well-being for all San Diegans. Further, Sharp is committed to providing a CHNA that is valuable to all our community partners, and we look forward to strengthening that value and those community partnerships in the years to come. The findings of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs help inform and guide the programs and services provided to improve the health of its community members and are a critical component of Sharp's community benefit report process, outlined below. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 80 Steps Completed to Prepare Sharp's Community Be nefit Plan and Report On an annual basis, each Sharp hospital performs the following steps in the preparation of its Community Benefit Plan and Report: Establishes and/or reviews hospital -specific objectives , taking into account results of the entity CHNA and evaluation of the entity's service area and expertise/services provided to the community Verifies the necessity for an ongoing focus on identified community needs and/or adds newly identified community needs Reports on activities conducted in th e prior fiscal year (FY) \u2014 FY 2019 Report of Activities Develops a plan for the upcoming FY, including specific steps to be undertaken \u2014 FY 2020 Plan Reports and categorizes the economic value of community benefit provided in FY 201 9, according to the fr amework specifically identified in Senate Bill 697 Reviews and approves a community benefit p lan Distributes the Community Benefit Plan and Report Executive Summary to members of the Sharp Board of Directors and each of the Sharp hospital boards of directors Share the Community Benefit Plan and Report process and findings through presentations across Sharp, including to management, entity boards and committees, and others upon request Implement community benefit activities identified for the upcoming FY Figure 14 outlines Sharp's community benefit process. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 81 Figure 14: Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Process Ongoing Commitment to Collaboration Underscoring Sharp's ongoing commitment to collaboration in order to address community health priorities and improve the health of San Diegans, Sharp executive leadership, operational experts and other staff are actively engaged in the national American Ho spital Association, Association for Community Health Improvement, statewide California Hospital Association, HASD&IC, and a variety of local collaboratives including but not limited to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, the San Diego Regional Chamber of Comme rce, 2 -1-1 and the Community Information Exchange at 2-1-1. Sharp Chula Vista Medical CenterKeeping Families Safe Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center is committed to the health and safety of San Diego's youngest community members. This past year the hospital hosted its second annual Family Safety Fair, providing education and resources on a variety of prenatal and postpartum care topics, as well as car seat installation and inspection by the California Highway Patrol. Sharp Chula Vista's Family Safety Fair included collaboration with health care providers, local businesses and government officials, who all contributed expertise and materials to help families keep babies safe through every stage of development. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 83 Section 4 Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center Through personal giving, sharing of time and knowledge, and especially by showing others how they too can have a better life, that is how we impact the community. If we can guide them to helpful resources, if we can provide them a service that will improve their or their loved one's life, that is the goal . \u2014 Dan Dredla, Vice President of Patient Support Services and Development, Sharp Chula Vis ta Medical Center Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Community Benefit Program Highlights Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center ( SCVMC ) provided a total of $91,017,600 in community benefit in FY 2019 . See Table 13 for a summary of unreimbursed costs based on the categories specifically identified in S enate Bill 697 (SB 697) and Figure 15 for the distribution of SCVMC 's community benefit among those categories. Table 13: Economic Value of Community Benefit Provided Sharp Chul a Vista Medical Center \u2014 FY 2019 SB 697 Category Programs and Services Included in SB 697 Category Estimated FY 201 9 Unreimbursed Costs Medical Care Services Shortfall in Medi -Cal22 $23,394,167 Shortfall in Medicare22 56,383,399 Shortfall in County 1,125,086 1,378,059 Other Benefits for Vulnerable24 Populations Project HELP, patient transportation, and other assistance for the vulnerable25 503,023 Other Benefits for the Broader Community Health education and information, health screenings, flu vaccinations, support groups, meeting room space and donations of time to community organizations25 242,611 Health Research, Education and Training Programs Education and training programs for students, interns and health care professionals25 1,512,258 TOTAL $91,017,600 22 Methodology for calculating shortfalls in p ublic programs is based on Sharp's payor -specific cost -to-charge ratios, which are derived from the cost accounting system, offset by the actual payments received. Costs for patients paid through the Medicare program on a prospective basis also include pay ments to third parties related to the specific population. 23 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for ser vices at the time the services were rendered. 24 \"Vulnerable populatio ns\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children's Services Program, or costs may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits p lus costs for supplies, materials and other purchased services. Any offs etting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of providing services. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providing the program or service. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 84 Figure 1 5: Percentage of Community Benefit by SB 697 Category Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center \u2014 FY 2019 Key highlights: Medical Care Services included uncompensated care for patients who were unable to pay for services and unreimbursed costs of public programs , such as Medi -Cal, Medicare, CMS and CHAMPVA/TRICARE . In FY 2018, the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv ices approved a Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019. This resulted in recognition of net supplemental revenues for SCVMC totaling $1 8.2 million in FY 2019. This reimbursement helped offset prior years' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 201 9 understate the true unreimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year . Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations included van transportation for pat ients to and from medical appointments; Project HELP, which provides funding for specific needs (e.g., medications, etc.) to assist lower -income patients; programming to help establish medical homes for low -income, medically uninsured and underserved patie nts in the south region ; contribution of time to Habitat for Humanity, Stand Down for Homeless Veterans, Ssubi is Hope, Feeding San Diego, Mama's Kitchen and the San Diego Food Bank (Food Bank) ; the Sharp Humanitarian Service Program ; and other assistance for vulnerable community members.

In addition, hospital staff actively participated in community boards, committees and other civic org anizations, including the American Cancer Society (ACS), American Heart Associa tion (AHA), Las Damas de San Diego International Nonprofit Organization (Las Damas de San Diego Foundation) , San Diego County Breastfeeding Coalition , Rotary Club of Chula Vista , Chula Vista Community Collaborative, San Diego Human Dignity Foundation, South Bay Community Services, San Diego Association of Directors of Volunteer Services, Las Primeras, American Lung Association, San Diego Immunization Coalition , Kiwanis Club of Bonita, Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) and Chula Vista Chamber of Commerce. See Appendix A for a listing of Sharp HealthCare's (Sharp's) community involvement . The category also incorporated costs associated with community benefit planning and administration, including community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation . Health Research, Education and Training Programs included education and training of health care professionals; student and intern supervision; and time devoted to generalizable health -related research projects that were made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community SCVMC is located at 751 Medical Center Court in Chula Vista, ZIP code 91911 . The community served by SCVMC encompasses the south region of San Diego County (SDC), including the sub regional areas of Chula Vista, Imperial Beach, Otay Mesa, Bonita, Sweetwater, Na tional City and Coronado. See Appendix B for a map of community and region al boundaries in SDC. Notably, m ost residents of Coronado utilize Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center . For SCVMC's 2019 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) was utilized to identify communities with greater health disparity within the county. The CNI identifies the severity of health disparity for every ZIP code in the United States (U.S.) based on specific barriers to health care access , including education, income, culture/language, insurance and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitalizations. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 86 According to the CNI, communities served by S CVMC with especially high need include Imperial Beach, National City and Southeast San Diego . Figure 16 presents a map of the CNI scores across San Diego's south region . Figure 16: CNI Map \u2014 SDC's South Region26 SCVMC has been providing health care to the south region community for more than 40 years. In the past decade, the population growth in this community has exceeded that of almost every other region in the nation. Th is trend is expected to continue \u2014 particularly for seniors in the south region. To meet this increased need for care, SCVMC began construction on a new patient tower in 2016. The tower is scheduled to open in January 2020, and will provide an additional 138 beds, advanced health care technology and programs, and services to expedite and improve care for community members in the south region. 26 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018 . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 87 Description of Community Health SDC's south region population is largely Hispanic (61.6%), and in 2019, there were 75,996 residents ages 65 and older in t he region, representing 13.7% of the population. Between 2019 and 2024, it is anticipated that the senior population in SDC's south region will grow by 26.9%.27 In 2017, 14.8% of the south region population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The unemployment rate in SDC's south region was 9.2%, which was higher than the rate for SDC overall (6.8%). In addition, 6.8% of households received Supplemental Security Income, also higher than the rate for SDC overall (5.0%).28 According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7, or 14% of SDC's population , experienced food insecurity29 in 2017. An additional 1 in 5 San Diegans were food secure but relied on supplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget. Latinos h ad a disproportionately higher incidence of food insecurity; 42% of low - income Latinos (household income below 200% FPL) experienced food insecurity and 55% of all food insecure adults were Latino.30 In 2017, 11.0% of households in the south region partic ipated in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 22.6% of the population lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program. These rates were higher than SDC overall (7.2% of households participated in SNAP benefits whil e 19.9% of households lived at or below 138% FPL). 28 Please refer to Table 14 for SNAP participation and eligibility in the south region.

Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 90 Priority Community Needs Addressed in Community Benefit Report \u2014 SCVMC 2019 CHNA SCVMC completed its most recent CHNA in September 201 9. SCVMC's 2019 CHNA was significantly influenced by the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties ( HASD&IC ) 2019 CHNA process and findings . Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process and findings. In addition, this year SCVMC completed its most current implementation strategy \u2014 a description of SCVMC programs designed to address the priority health needs identified in the 2019 CHNA. The most recent CHNA and implementation strategy for SCVMC are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Through the SCVMC 2019 CHNA, the following priority health needs were identified for the communit ies served by SCVMC (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Concerns Behavioral Health (including Substance Use) Cancer Chronic Health Conditions (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) , Diabetes and Obesity) Community and Social Support Economic Security Education Homelessness and Housing Instability Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy Unintentional Injury and Violence The following pages detail SCVMC programs, activities and services that specifically address aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer, chronic health conditions, community and social support (these programs also help address access to health care, economic security , and homelessness and housing), education, maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, and unintentional injury. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. SCVMC provides general nutrition and exercise education for obesity, as well as programs that address a healthy lifestyle as part of care for heart disease, cancer, diabetes and other issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. In addition, Sharp Rees -Stealy Medic al Group clinics throughout SDC \u2014 including the south region \u2014 provide structured weight management and health education programs to community members, such as smoking cessation and stress management; long -term support for weight management and fat loss an d personalized weight -loss programs. For additional details on SCVMC programs that specifically address the needs identified in the 2019 Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 91 CHNA, please refer to SCVMC's implementation strategy available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Further , SCVMC's behavioral health (including substance use) community efforts are supported through the programs and services provided through Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital (SMV) and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use services in SDC . Please refer to Section 11 of this report for details on those programs. For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale for and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2019 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s), and FY 2 020 Plan. Identified Community Need: Education, Support and Screening for Stroke Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 201 9 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2019 CHNA s identified chronic conditions (including CVD and cerebrovascular disease s/stroke) as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by S CVMC . According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of emergency department (ED) visits for stroke in SDC increased 11.0% from 2014 to 2016, with the most significant increases in individuals ages 27 to 44 (20.0%) and those identified as \"other\" race (28.9%). Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SCVMC 2019 CHNA identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions, including: limited access to healthy food; lack of transportation; physical limitations or limited mobility; high health care costs; economic insecurity; low health literacy; poor health behaviors, such as unhealthy diet or lack of physical activity; medication management; unsafe neighborhoods; and unstable or complete lack of housing. Participants in the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus g roup conducted as part of the Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified the following hospital discharge challenges and barriers for patients, including those with chronic conditions: transportation support; a shortage of recuperative or respite care options; a lack of short -term caregivers and in -home support services; and a need for a streamlined process from the hospital to the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency ( HHSA ) for those who qualify for wraparound support. In 201 7, cerebrovascular diseases including stroke were the third leading cause of death for SDC's south region . Data analysis in Sharp's 2019 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges for CVD and Type 2 diabetes in communities facing greater Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 92 socioeco nomic challenges within SDC's south region such as Chula Vista and National City.35 In 2017, diseases of the heart were the leading cause of for SDC's south region. In 2017, SDC's south region experienced 208 deaths due to cerebrovascular diseases (includi ng stroke),36 as well as 1,040 hospitalizations and 419 ED visits attributed to stroke. According to 2018 CHIS data, 28.6% of residents in SDC's south region had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, which was slightly lower than the rate for SDC ov erall (29.0%). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), more than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke each year, and strokes are responsible for approximately one out of every 20 deaths (CDC, 2017). The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) reports that 25% of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within five years (NINDS, 2019). The CDC estimates that up to 80% of strokes are preventable through the recognition of early signs/symptoms and the elimination of stroke risk factors. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include choosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate -intensity aerobic physical activity each week, refraining from or quitti ng smoking, and limiting alcohol intake (CDC, 2018). FY 2019 Report of Activities In August 2017, the Joint Commission and AHA/ American Stroke Association (ASA) certified SCVMC as a Primary Stroke Center. The program is nationally recognized for its ou treach, education and thorough screening procedures, as well as documentation of its success rate. In addition, SCVMC is a recipient of the AHA/ASA's Get With The Guidelines\u00ae (GWTG) \u2014 Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award for excellence in stroke care as well as the Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation. The AHA/ASA's GWTG is a national effort focused on ensuring the use of evidence -based therapies to improve outcomes for stroke patients. The AHA/ASA's Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation focuses on improving the timeliness of Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator (IV t -PA) administration to eligible patients. During Stroke Awareness Month in May, Sharp's systemwide stroke program participated in Stroke Awareness Day at the Padres, held at Petco Park. This annual event is organized by the San Diego County Stroke Consortium, the County of San Diego HHSA, the San Diego Padres and other key partners to promote stroke 35Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018; California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development via SpeedTrack, Inc., 2017. 36The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Un it collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the NCHS. Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates fil ed in SDC in 2017. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths ass igned to all rankable causes, which are a subset of ICD - 10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile. \" (County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2019; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2017.

Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 93 prevention, awareness and recovery, as well as celebrate stroke survivors. During the baseball game, Sharp offered education about the warning signs of stroke and how to respond using B.E. F.A.S.T. (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arms, Speech, Time) \u2014 an easy techni que to detect and enhance responsiveness to a stroke. Giveaways were provided throughout the evening, while stroke educa tion was displayed on the Jumbot ron to the entire stadium of nearly 30,000 community members. In FY 2019, Sharp's systemwide stroke program , including SCVMC, served older adults in the south region through stroke education and screenings. In November, SCVMC provided stroke education at the Chula Vista Chamber of Commerce Mixer. Sharp's systemwide stroke program also provided ed ucation on signs and symptoms of stroke, the importance of calling 911 and stroke risk factors, as well as provided blood pressure screenings to community members at St. Paul's Senior Services' annual Senior and Family Resource Fair in May. In addition, at Sharp's Health and Wellness in Aging: Know Your Options Conference in August, a nurse practitioner provided blood pressure screenings and education on stroke awareness, prevention, risk factors and how to lower blood pressure to more than 80 community mem bers at the Elks Lodge in Chula Vista. SCVMC actively participated in the quarterly San Diego County Stroke Consortium, a collaborative effort with other SDC hospitals to improve stroke care and discuss issues impacting stroke care in SDC. SCVMC also con tinued its 14 -year collaboration with the County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services to provide data for the SDC stroke registry. FY 2020 Plan SCVMC Stroke Program will do the following: Provide stroke education, screening and outreach to community members in the south region Continue to participate in Stroke Awareness Day at the Padres Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide stroke education and resources to residents in the city's nine districts Continue to particip ate in the San Diego County Stroke Consortium Continue to provide data to the SDC stroke registry Provide stroke risk factor education to community health professionals at the Veterans Home of California, Chula Vista Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 94 Identified Community Need: Cancer Edu cation and Patient Navigator Services Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 201 9 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated.

According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, cancer was the leading cause of death in SDC in 2016. Data analyzed as part of t he SCVMC 2019 CHNA identified the top sites for cancer diagnoses at SCVMC in 2018 to be breast, lung, colon, lymphoma and prostate. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified cancer as a condition that many members of the community fear, particularly brain, colon and breast cancers. Participants also described barriers to receiving cancer screenings and treatment, including: stigma surrounding a cancer diagnosis; fear about immigration status, particularly for asylum seekers; financ ial burdens , even for those with health insurance; and practical issues such as transportation to medical appointments. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 67% of respondents ranked cancer amo ng the top five health conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. As part of the SCVMC 2019 CHNA, focus groups comprised of Sharp cancer patient navigators and clinical social workers identified the following health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH) related to cancer: chronic diseases such as asthma or heart disease , which are often connected to stress; care challenges associated with behavioral health and substance use; barriers to care (cost, delays in receiving care and fear related to diagnosis or immigration status; frustration navigating health insurance; screening avoidance; logistics such as transportation or childcare; and language barriers); and fear of stigma due to cancer diagnosis. Sharp cancer patient navigator and clinical social worker focus group participants also described the following hospital discharge barriers and support needs: lack of patient or family support and education (particularly for caregivers); homelessness; health insurance issues; lack of follow -up care or access to medication; and a need for a \"one -stop shop\" incorporating financial navigators and legal support, as well as other resources like pain management or wigs. The most frequently observed cancers at SCVMC in 201 8 were (in rank order): breast, colorectal, lung, prostate and gynecological cancers . In total, there were 983 new cases of cancer at SCVMC in 2018. According to 2018 Sharp oncology data, 50% of the 431 SCVMC cancer patients who received the cancer psychosocial dist ress screening scored at a range of moderate to severe distress, and were referred to internal or external resources , such as social workers or community cancer resources . At SCVMC, anxiety related to integrated political and health care issues was a signi ficant contributor to patient Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 95 distress, causing reluctance to provide identification and consideration of dropping health insurance coverage for fear of negative immigration consequences. In 201 7, cancer was the second leading cause of death in SDC's south region. There were 7 22 deaths due to cancer (all types) in SDC's south region in 201 7. The region's age -adjusted rate of death due to cancer was 153.0 deaths per 100,000 population, which is higher than the overall SDC age -adjusted rate of 136.7 per 100,000 population .36 In 201 7, the south region's age -adjusted death rates were higher than the rates for SDC overall for the following cancers: brain, colorectal, female reproductive, kidney, liver, lung, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , pancreatic, prostate and skin . In 201 7, 19.5% of all cancer deaths in SDC's south region were due to lung cancer, 9.2% to colorectal cancer, 8.2% to pancreatic cancer , 7.3% to female breast cancer , 7.3% to female reproductive cancer s, 6.4% to prostate cancer , and 6.2% to liver cancer . According to the ACS 2017 California Cancer Facts & Figures report, 72.4 % of breast cancer cases among non -Hispanic white women in SDC were diagnosed at an early stage, compared to 69.3 % of African American cases, 68.1 % of Hispanic cases and 70.4 % of Asian/Pacific Islander cases. Data suggests that early breast cancer detection resources are needed in minority communiti es. According to findings from the ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2019 report , the 40% decrease in the female breast cancer death rate between 1989 and 2016 is attributed to improvements in early detection, namely screening and increased awareness. The rates o f new cancer cases and cancer deaths vary significantly among racial and ethnic groups, with rates generally highest among African Americans and lowest for Asian Americans. (ACS, 201 9). A recent study by the ACS found that 42 % of newly diagnosed cancer ca ses in the U.S. are potentially avoidable. Many of the known causes of cancer \u2014 and other noncommunicable diseases \u2014 are attributable to behavioral factors including tobacco use as well as excess body weight due to poor dietary habits and lack of physical activity (ACS, 2018). The Journal of Oncology Navigation & Sponsorship (JONS) emphasizes the importance of patient navigators as part of a multidisciplinary oncology team with the goal of reducing mortality among underserved patients . The navigator works with the patient across the care continuum , and often makes suggestions to help manage a patient from a holistic perspective (JONS, 2019 ). According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advances. Greater clinical trial enrollment benefits medical research and increases the health of future generations as well as improves disease outcomes, quality of life and health of trial participants (NIH, 2017) . Objectives Provide c ancer screenings and education to community members in SDC's south region Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 96 Provide cancer support services, including health care navigation, to community members in SDC's south region FY 2019 Report of Activities The Cancer Centers of Sharp HealthCare (C ancer Centers of Sharp), which includes SCVMC, Sharp Grossmont Hospital and Sharp Memorial Hospital, are accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer as an Integrated Network Cancer Program, demonstrating its commitment to meeting ri gorous standards and improving the quality of care for patients with cancer. In FY 2019, the Douglas & Nancy Barnhart Cancer Center at SCVMC (Barnhart Cancer Center) hosted more than 40 free cancer -related seminars and classes, where community members received education and resources for awareness and prevention of various cancers, including colorectal, lung, cervical and breast, as well as education on smoking cessat ion. Education included advance care planning (ACP) with assistance in drafting advance health care directives (advance directives) ; nutrition management and healthy eating during and after treatment (in English and Spanish); and management of treatment -related lymphedema. In addition, the hospital continued its collaboration with Las Damas de San Diego Foundation, San Diego Imaging - Chula Vista and La Maestra Community Health Centers to provide quarterly breast and cervical cancer screening events for approximately 100 attendees in FY 2019. Attendees were primarily low -income Hispanic women residing in the south region who were registered with Every Woman Counts, a state program that pays for cancer screenings and care for uninsured and underinsured women. The events offered a variety of free services, including: genetic testing; blood pressure, glucose, and bone density screenings; weight and body fat measurements; preventive health lectures on nutrition, oral health and the importance of breast self - examinations; cancer education and resources; and mammograms, clinical breast exams and pelvic exams or Pap smears. SCVMC continues to strengthen its partnership with Las Damas de San Diego Foundation by offering patients and community members access to medical care, resources, education, financial assistance and prevention and screening programs. Throughout the year, the Ba rnhart Cancer Center served more than 1,400 individuals at community events, providing breast self -examination demonstrations and education on the importance of clinical breast exams and annual mammograms, as well as education on proper techniques for mont hly breast self -exam s. Additional cancer -specific education and resources were provided at these events, including genetic testing, nutrition information and patient navigator services. Events included San Diego Community Action Network (SanDi -CAN) and So uth County Action Network 's (SoCAN's) Interactive Technology & Health Fair for Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities at the Jackie Robinson YMCA, St. Paul's Senior Services Senior and Family Resource Fair, Sharp Senior Resource Centers' and Sharp Hospic eCare's Health and Wellness in Aging: Know Your Options conference at the Elks Lodge , the Chula Vista Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 97 Chamber of Commerce Mixer and Trade Show events, and the Sharp Women's Health Conference, where a dietitian and Sharp -affiliated hematologist/oncologist p resented on breast cancer and lifestyle choices to reduce risk. SCVMC also supported the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk - San Diego, sponsored by the ACS, where Sharp nurses provided first aid and blood pressure screenings for walkers and runner s. In June, SCVMC provided education on the Mediterranean diet, as well as tips to help improve eating habits and manage lifestyle factors to promote long -term health and help prevent chronic disease at the San Diego Central Library. In addition, the Barnh art Cancer Center provided resources to community physicians and health care professionals at the Incorporating Updated Guidelines into the Management of Breast Cancer event at Sharp's Corporate Office . In FY 2019, the Barnhart Cancer Center reached more than 300 individuals through a variety of cancer support groups provided in response to community needs. This included a monthly women's cancer survivor support group offered in English and Spanish; a twice -monthly men's cancer support group; a monthly sup port group for children with an adult loved one facing any type of cancer; a monthly support group for individuals living with advanced cancer; and a support group for women newly diagnosed with cancer, offered twice monthly in English and monthly in Spani sh. New in FY 2019, the twice -monthly Women's Peer Survivor Network, led by an SCVMC volunteer, offered women the opportunity to network with fellow cancer survivors to discuss issues that may arise after completing cancer treatment, such as follow -up care , anxiety, fear of recurrence and where to find additional support. SCVMC also provided free meeting space for community cancer groups throughout the year. This included the peer -facilitated Young Women's Breast Cancer Forum and Support Group for the You ng Survival Coalition, an organization dedicated to assisting young women diagnosed with breast cancer . In addition , in collaboration with Las Damas de San Diego Foundation, a Las Damas support group met twice a month at the Barnhart Cancer Center to provi de psychosocial support for women undergoing diagnosis and treatment for breast or cervical cancer. The Barnhart Cancer Center also continued to offer a wig and prosthesis bank. In FY 2019, two trained wig fitters provided 85 cancer patients with more tha n 100 donated wigs, prosthetic devices, bras, scarves, hats and other items at no cost. The wigs and prostheses were provided through the hospital's partnership with ACS as well as through donations from community members and associations. The Barnhart C ancer Center offers a cancer patient navigator program through which trained and certified navigators provide personalized education, support and guidance to patients and their loved ones from early detection through diagnosis and treatment. In FY 2019, ca ncer patient navigators assisted more than 600 patients at the Barnhart Cancer Center . The Barnhart Cancer Center team also includes a licensed clinical social worker, a genetics counselor, a speech -language pathologist , a lymphedema therapist, and a palli ative care specialist . In addition, the Barnhart Cancer Center provides a certified dietitian who identifies patients at risk of nutritional problems and provides group education classes and referrals to meal delivery services and in-home Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 98 parenteral nutrit ion (method of getting nutrition into the body through the veins) care. Further, 20 volunteers \u2014 including a cancer survivor \u2014 assist ed patients with wigs and prosthetics as well as offered Healing Touch, Reiki and pet therapy. Additional volunteers brought waiting room patients freshly baked cookies, coffee and warm blankets, as well as provided other assistance as needed. Volunteers also assembled bouquets from flowers donated by Trader Joe's Chula Vista for display throughout the center as well as to give to \"graduating\" cancer patients who completed a course of treatment. Lastly, Southwestern College (SWC) students who enrolled in the Integrative Therapies Collaborative, an innovative externship program developed by Sharp and SWC, offer ed cancer patients a variety of integrative healing therapies, including music for healing, hand massage and aromatherapy. In FY 2019, t he Barnhart Cancer Center helped raise community awareness of cancer through a variety of special events . In honor of National Mammography Day in October, the Barnhart Cancer Center held the Sharp Chula Vista Goes Pink event to increase awareness of the lifesaving importance of mammograms. The event featured a cancer survivor and employees of her s alon who dyed the hair o f Sharp -affiliated physicians and staff as well as Chula Vista police officers. New this year, event attendees were invited to participate in the Girls Love Mail project by writing letters of support to women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. These effor ts were featured by numerous media outlets, including FOX 5 San Diego, NBC 7 San Diego, CBS News 8 - San Diego, Televisa Tijuana Oficial, Telemundo, El Latino Newspaper and Diego 99.3 FM . Throughout FY 201 9, Sharp cancer specialists appeared in local Engli sh and Spanish television as well as print and radio news to educate community members about cancer. This included a discussion with 1 0News - ABC San Diego KGTV about supporting children with loved ones diagnosed with cancer and a discussion with FOX 5 San Diego regarding cancer diagnosis, support group options, and advice to family and friends regarding what to say to someone diagnosed . The Cancer Centers of Sharp conduct oncology clinical trials to support the discovery of new and improved treatments to help individuals overcome cancer and to enhance scientific knowledge for the larger health and research communities. In FY 2019, the Cancer Centers of Sharp approached and evaluated 480 patients for participation in oncology clinical trials. As a result, 1 11 patients were enrolled in cancer research studies. In FY 2019, clinical trials focused on multiple types of cancer, including but not limited to brain, breast, colon, head and neck, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian, prostate and spinal cord. FY 2020 Plan The Barnhart Cancer Center at SCVMC will do the following: Continue to partner with local organizations and agencies to provide underserved community residents with health education and access to cancer screenings Offer cancer support groups for patients, caregivers and loved ones as well as members of the community, including groups in English and Spanish Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 99 Continue to offer complementary integrative therapies including Healing Touch, Reiki and music for healing as well as aroma, hand and pet thera pies Continue to offer wigs, prosthetics, bras, hats and scarves for cancer patients Offer monthly educational classes on nutrition for cancer prevention and nutrition during cancer treatment in both English and Spanish Provide meeting space for a program that offers quarterly sessions to assist women with makeup application during and after treatment, and following facial hair loss from chemotherapy Offer monthly lymphedema education classes Offer monthly ACP classes Identified Community Need: Diabetes Education , Prevention and Support Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2019 CHNAs identified chronic con ditions, including diabetes, as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SCVMC. Data analysis in the SCVMC 2019 CHNA revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to Type 2 diabetes in communities within SDC's s outh region facing greater socioeconomic challenges, such as National City and San Ysidro.35 According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of ED visits for diabetes in SDC increased 7.2% from 2014 to 2016, with the most significant increases in individuals ages 27 to 44 ( 13.9%) and those identified as black/African American (15.1%). According to data presented in the SCVMC 2019 CHNA, in 2017, the top three ED and inpatient Type 2 diabetes diagnoses at SCVMC included Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease and Type 2 diabetes (uncomplicated). According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 51.0% of respondents ranked diabetes (Types 1 and 2) among the top five health conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. Focus groups and key informant interviews c onducted as part of the HASD&IC and SCVMC 2019 CHNAs identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions such as diabetes, including: lack of access to healthy food; lack of transportation; physical limitations or limited mobility; high health care costs; economic insecurity; low health literacy; poor health behaviors, such as unhealthy diet or lack of physical activity; medication management; unsafe neighborhoods; and unstable or complete lack of housing. Participants in the Sharp diabetes educator focus group conducted as part of the SCVMC 2019 CHNA process identified several barriers to effective diabetes Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 100 management, including: challenges associated with pharmacies, insurance policies and finances (including co -pays, loss of income due to time off work and the cost of transportation to medical appointments); fear related to job loss or immigration status; and lack of knowledge or cultural beliefs about food and illness. The Sharp diabetes educator focus group also identified the following barriers associated with diabetes management: isolation and loneliness; stigma, particularly when it is reinforced by physicians; lack of support from family members; and difficulty managing co -morbidities including cardiovascular issues, kidney issues, neuropathy , and vision issues. In 2017, diabetes was the fifth leading cause of death in SDC's south region. In 2017, there were 153 deaths due to diabetes in SDC's south region. The region's age-adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 32.1 per 100,000 population, n early 50% higher than the overall SDC age -adjusted diabetes death rate (21.5 deaths per 100,000 population).36 In 2017, there were 859 hospitalizatio ns due to diabetes in SDC's south region. The age-adjusted rate of hospitalization was 177.5 per 100,000 population. This rate was the second highest among all SDC regions and was higher than the age -adjusted rate of hospitalization for SDC overall (122.9 per 100,000 population). In 2017, there were 1,117 diabetes -related ED visits in SDC's south region, a 12.9% increase from 2016. The age -adjusted rate of diabetes -related ED visits was 230.3 per 100,000 population. This was the second highest rate among al l SDC regions and was higher than the rate for SDC overall (165.0 per 100,000 population). According to 2017 -2018 CHIS data, 16.5% of adults living in SDC's south region indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was higher than SDC o verall (9.6%) and the state of California (10.4%). Diabetes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 33.6% of south region adults over 65 reporting that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes. According to 2018 CHIS data, 25.3% of residents in the south region had been told by their doctor that they had pre - or borderline diabetes, compared to 17.3% of residents in SDC overall. A study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Health Policy Research estimated that 13 million adults in California (46%) have prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes, while another 2.5 million (9%) have already been diagnosed with diabetes (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2016). Data presented by the United Health Foundation (UHF) indicates that, in 2017, diabetes prevalence in California was highest among American Indian/Alaska Natives (24.8%), followed by individuals of other race (16.4%), non -Hispanic blacks (14.8%) and Hispanics (12.1%) (UHF, 2018). According to the CDC, diabetes is the s eventh leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than tripled in the last 20 years (CDC, 2019). According to the CDC's 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report , 87.5% of adults diagnos ed with diabetes were overweight or obese. To prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, the CDC recommends lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthier and engaging in regular physical activity. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 101 The CDC estimates that 30.3 million people in the U.S. have diabetes. Of those individuals, 1 in 4 is not aware they have the disease (CDC, National Diabetes Statistics Report , 2017). The CDC identify diabetes as the leading cause of kidney failure, non -traumatic lower -limb amputations and new cases of blindness among adults (CDC, 2019). Objectives Provide diabetes education, prevention and support in the south region of SDC Collaborate with community organizations and projects to provide diabetes education to SDC's vulnerable populations Participate in local and national professional conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community FY 2019 Report of Activities The SCVMC Diabetes Education Program is recognized by the American Diabetes Asso ciation ( ADA) for meeting national standards for excellence and quality in diabetes education covering blood sugar monitoring, medication and nutritional counseling as well as insulin pump and other device training. The program is led by certified diabetes educators who provide individuals and their support systems with the skills needed to successfully self -manage various conditions, including prediabetes, gestational diabetes (diabetes developed during pregnancy) , and Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes . Small group and one -on-one education options are offered in English and Spanish. In FY 201 9, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program (Sharp's systemwide diabetes program) offered diabetes education and support to approximately 1,000 attendees at the Sharp Women's Health Conference. This included diabetes risk assessments using the ADA's Diabetes Risk Test questionnaire as well as resources on the different types of diabetes ; diabetes prevention; signs, symptoms and complications of diabetes; the connection between diabetes and CVD; nutrition and reading food labels; exercise; medication; and diabetes self -management. Also during the conference, a Sharp diabetes expert presented on the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes, including helpful diets, physical ac tivity and the power of lifestyle change . In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided fundraising and team participation for the San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk at Balboa Park in September . In November, the SCVMC Diabetes Education Program pr ovided education on diabetes, including prediabetes, risk factors, signs and symptoms, treatment and goal - setting to eight community members at the Community Congregational Church of Chula Vista. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program also participated in Sh arp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide diabetes resources and nutrition education, including how food groups and serving size s affect blood sugar levels, to nearly 15 community members at the Colonel Irving Salomon San Ysidro Community Act ivity Center . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 102 The Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to collaborate with FHCSD to provide education to patients with diabetes at multiple FHCSD sites , including those in the south region , through the organization's Diabetes Management Care Coordination Project (DMCCP). Through DMCCP , Sharp's diabetes educators provide weekly group health and nutrition education, healthy co oking demonstrations, physical activity classes, and one -on-one support from a nurse practitioner to FHCSD's diabetes patients . In addition, project \"graduates\" offer peer support and education to current enrollees in both English and Spanish. The project monitors participants' physical activity as well as their A1C and blood glucose levels, which it has proven to successfully lower and maintain . In FY 2019, Sharp diabetes educators provided 6 lectures in English and Spanish to nearly 60 community members at FHCSD's Chula Vista site . Topics included creating an active lifestyle; nutrition , including the effect of food groups and serving sizes on blood sugar levels; prediabetes; and diabetes risk factors, symptoms, treatment, self -management and goal -setting. In 2019, 32.5% of those enrolled in DMCCP saw a decrease in their overall A1C results. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program is an affiliate of the California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program's Sweet Success Program, which provides comprehensive technical support and education to medical personnel and community liaisons to promote improved outcomes for high -risk pregnant women with diabetes. As an affiliate, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program teaches underserved pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers wi th Type 1, Type 2 or gestational diabetes how to manage their blood sugar levels. In collaboration with community clinics, in FY 201 9, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided these patients with a variety of education and resources to support a healt hy pregnancy. Topics covered gestational diabetes statistics; new diagnostic criteria; treatment and management of blood glucose levels; goals for blood sugar levels before and after a meal; insulin requirements; self -care practices; nutrition and meal pla nning; exercise and weight management; monitoring fetal movement; and the risks and complications of uncontrolled diabetes. Clinic patients also received logbooks to track and manage their blood sugar levels. In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Education Progr am evaluated patients' management of their blood sugar levels and collaborated with community clin ics' obstetrician/gynecologists (OB -GYN) to prevent complications. At SCVMC, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided services and education to nearly 43 0 underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women with diabetes in FY 201 9. Throughout the year, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to provide services and resources to meet the needs of culturally diverse populations within SDC . Educational reso urces included: How to Live Healthy With Diabetes; What You Need to Know About Diabetes; All About Blood Glucose for People With Type 2 Diabetes; All About Carbohydrate Counting; Getting the Very Best Care for Your Diabetes; All About Insulin Resistance; A ll About Physical Activity With Diabetes; Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Seven -Day Menu Plan; and Food Groups. Resources were provided in Arabic, Somali, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish, and food diaries and logbooks were distributed for community members t o track their blood sugar levels. Additionally, l ive interpreter services were available in more than 200 languages via the Stratus Video Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 103 Interpreting iPad application. Further, Sharp team members received education regarding the different cultura l needs o f diverse communities to improve the delivery of inclusive and culturally competent care. In FY 201 9, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program supported the professional health care community through participation in various conferences. At the Liberty Statio n Conference Center in May, team members gave a presentation titled Obesity, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease to approximately 250 health professionals during Sharp's Obesity Crisis Conference. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program's presentation covered multiple topics, including: the history and prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in the U.S.; testing for diabetes; the link between diabetes, CVD and obesity; decreasing risks; and weight management . In June, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program attend ed the ADA's 7 9th Scientific Sessions conference in San Francisco , California . The conference shared research advances to improve the lives of people with and affected by diabetes with more than 1 5,000 international attendees. In addition, in August , the Sharp Diabetes Education Program presented on the Use of Outcomes Data and M arketing Strategies to Sustain Diabetes Programs to approximately 200 health professionals at the American Association of Diabetes Educators' 201 9 Annual Conference in Houston , Texas. In November, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program hosted a diabetes conference for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, laboratorians, clinical and managerial leaders and other community health professionals interested in optimizing inpatient diabete s care. The conference provided 150 participants with specific tools and strategies for creating a culture that supports and encourages emerging therapeutic trends in glycemic management in a hospital setting. Topics included treating patients with Type 2 diabetes ; cardiovascular risk for patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes; new insulin products and their potential benefits; metabolism and weight loss in those using insulin ; automated insulin infusion algorithms ; and insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring. In addition, in FY 2019 the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided diabetes education \u2014 including the different types of diabetes, diagnoses, current technology and medication, and careers in diabetes education \u2014 to more than 20 nurse pract itioner students at San Diego State University (SDSU) , as well as mentored two dietetic intern s from the San Diego Women, Infants , and Children (WIC) program. Lastly, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program presented on diabetes and exercise to approximately 10 students at Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU) School of Nursing's Health Promotion Center at the Church of the Nazarene in Mid -City, as well as provided diabetes education to approximately 10 Azusa Pacific University (APU) nursing students. FY 2020 Plan The SCVMC and Sharp Diabetes Education Program s will do the following: Provide community members with information related to prediabetes and diabetes at various community venues in SDC's south region Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 104 Explore collaborations to assist and educate food insecure community members Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide diabetes education and resources to residents in the city's nine districts, including the San Ysidro communit y Explore opportunities to provide diabete s education to the Imperial Beach community Explore additional opportunities to provide community -based diabetes education classes Continue to collaborate with FHCSD to provide education and resources to their patients with diabetes Continue to provide ges tational diabetes services and resources to underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women, both at the hospital and in collaboration with community clinics Offer blood glucose screenings for community members in the south region of SDC Participate in Tour de Cure \u2014 the ADA's signature fundraising event to fight diabetes \u2014 as well as the San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk Maintain up -to-date resources to support community members with diabetes treatment and prevention, particularly foreign language and culturally appropriate resources for diverse populations Continue to participate in local and national professional conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community Conduct educational symposiums for healt h care professionals focused on improving outpatient and inpatient diabetes care Continue to host a diabetes conference for health care professionals Explore collaborations with community service organizations that focus on diabetes prevention and care Partner with community physicians to help them im prove patient outcomes using technology, including insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors Identified Community Need: Health Education and Screening Activities Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2019 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer, chronic conditions, community and social support, economic security, education, homelessness and housing instability, and unintentional injury and violence as the priority health issues affecting members of the communities served by SCVMC. In addition, maternal and prenatal c are, including high -risk pregnancy was identified in the SCVMC 2019 CHNA as a priority health need. HASD&IC focus group participants also identified health literacy as a barrier to care, and recommended several strategies to address this issue, including: culturally sensitive education about preventive care, including immunizations and health Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 105 screenings; education about lifestyle choices that promote health, such as smoking cessation, nutrition and exercise; and assistance understanding and navigating the health care and insurance systems, particularly for those who have received a serious health diagnosis. As part of the SCVMC 2019 CHNA, a focus group comprised of members of Sharp's Patient Family Advisory Council described lack of health education and heal th literacy, particularly surrounding preventive care (including immunizations), illness and disease as barriers to health care. Participants also noted that many patients and community members do not understand how to navigate the health care system, espe cially identifying the appropriate sites of care to meet their needs. Participants in the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs identified the following as being in the top five most important health conditions for south re gion residents: cancer (83%); aging concerns (72%); diabetes (64%); obesity and behavioral/mental health issues (58%). In addition, the SDOH most frequently identified as having the greatest impact on south region residents were: health insurance is sues (83%); health behaviors (72%); economic security (67%); access to care (58%); and homelessness (31%). As part of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, facilitated discussions with Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns ( SMBHWN ) case managers, social workers and a Nurse Educator identified the following health conditions that impact Sharp's maternal and prenatal patients: diabetes; preterm pregnancies; short interval pregnancies; substance use; and mood disorders, including postpartum depression and anxiety. Disc ussions also identified the following SDOH affecting their patients: limited access to behavioral health services, even for those patients with insurance; lack of access to transportation; and economic stress related to childcare and maternity leave. Accor ding to 2018 CHIS data, the self -reported obesity rate for adults in SDC's south region was 34.7%, higher than the rate for SDC overall (26.3%). In 2018, between 25% and 30% of California adults self -reported being obese. Obesity levels decreased as educat ion levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates (CDC, 2019). According to the CDC, some of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. In 2015 -2016, 39.8% of Americans were obese (CDC, 2017). In 2018, 13.0% of south region adults reported that fresh fruits and vegetables were only sometimes affordable in their neighborhood (CHIS, 2018). According t o the CDC, Americans now experience mortality at a much later age and largely due to chronic disease. In 2017, only 30% of Americans had advance care plans. With the largest generation of Americans now aging, education on end -of-life care is a public healt h issue (CDC, 2017). In 2017, seniors in SDC's south region experienced higher rates of hospitalization and ED visits for unintentional injuries, falls, cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, overall hypertensive diseases, influenza, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease /chronic lower respiratory diseases and asthma when compared to SDC overall. Seniors in the south region experienced higher rates of Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 106 hospitalization for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease compared to seniors in SDC overall. In 2017, there were 497 low birth weight (LBW) births in SDC's south region, accounting for 6.8% of the region's total births. In the same year, there were 78 very low birth weight (VLBW) births in the south region, or 1.1% of total births. In SDC overall in 2017, LBW births accounted for 6.5% of births while VLBW births accounted for 1.0% of all births. There were 4,998 hospitalizations due to maternal complications in SDC's south region in 2017. The region's age -adjusted rate was 2,132.8 per 100,000 population, which was higher than the age -adjusted rate for SDC overall (1,843.0 per 100,000 population).37 According to the NIH, more than 53 million people in the U.S. either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass. Along with the financial costs, osteoporosis can reduce quality of life for many people who suffer from fractures. It can also affect the lives of family members and friends who serve as caregivers. Preventable risk factors for osteoporosis include smoking, alcohol c onsumption, and medication and vitamin intake (NIH, 2018). Objectives Provide health education classes , support groups and screening activities for the community with a focus on health issues identified through the SCVMC 2019 CHNA Participate in community -sponsored events and support nonprofit health organizations FY 2019 Report of Activities In FY 201 9, SCVMC participated in numerous community health fairs and events serving more than 500 community members. Events included the San Diego Recover y Ride, AHA Heart & Stroke Walk and the Susan G. Komen San Diego Race for the Cure\u00ae. SCVMC provided a variety of health services during these events, including first aid booths and blood pressure screenings. In addition , SCVMC conducted five blood drives w here more than 160 SCVMC team members donated blood. Throughout the year, SCVMC provided flu vaccinations to nearly 170 south region community members at various locations, including St. Paul's Plaza assisted living facility, the Salvation Army's Silvercrest Residence in Chula Vista, and a shelter for asylum seekers. At the Chula Vista Chamber of Commerce Business Trade Show & Mixer in November and August , more than 150 community members were offered flu vaccinations; blood pressure , cholesterol and glucose screenings ; and education and resources on cancer, blo od pressure, hospice, stroke, sepsis and other health topics. 37 The definition of maternal complications is based on analysis of ICD -10 codes conducted by the County of San Diego HHSA Community Health Statistics Unit. In 2018, the definition of maternal complications included 666 ICD -10 codes, however it was expanded in 2019 to include 1,827 ICD -10 codes. Notable conditions now included in this definition include: supervision of high -risk pregnancy, gestational or preexisting diabetes, preterm labor and/or delivery, complications related to sexually transmitted infections, maternal alcohol or drug use, and sexual, physical or psychological abuse of the mother. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 107 Lastly, SCVMC offered flu vaccinations to staff and community members at the Consulate General of Mexico in San Di ego. In August, SCVMC attended Sharp Senior Resource Centers' and Sharp HospiceCare's Health and Wellness in Aging: Know Your Options conference at the Elks Lodge , which reached nearly 90 seniors and their families. The conference focused on ways to mana ge and promote healthy aging and wellness for seniors and their family members. Topics included staying safe and avoiding elder abuse, achieving emotional wellness as one ages, aging mindfully, understanding the expectations of normal aging, daily habits to encourage healthy aging, and the benefits of ACP including advance directives. The conference also included a resource fair with a variety of senior services and programs as well as mood screenings to assess attendees' emotional well -being. SCVMC provi ded health education to a variety of groups throughout the year. In October, SCVMC continued to collaborate with Sharp HospiceCare to provide classes on advance directives to nearly 20 community members. In June, SCVMC presented on the importance of high -reliability measures to more than 50 people aboard the U.S. Navy hospital ship, the USNS Mercy , before deploy ment on a humanitarian mission. In July, SCVMC provided nearly 280 community members with resources and information on senior health issues and brea st cancer at SanDi -CAN and SoCAN's Interactive Technology & Health Fair for Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities at the Jackie Robinson YMCA. SCVMC also provided education and resources on orthopedics and bone health during FY 2019. In October, a Sha rp-affiliated orthopedic surgeon provided education on pain management to 20 community members at the Kiwanis Club of Bonita. At the Sharp Women's Health Conference in May, the Sharp Ortho -Neuro Service Line , including staff from SCVMC, provided osteoporos is heel scans \u2014 a quick and painless method to measure the risk of low bone mass; orthopedic education and materials on calcium and vitamin D requirements; and exercise tips for osteoporosis treatment and prevention to approximately 100 attendees. In addition, SCVMC provided seminars on treating knee, hip and shoulder pain to more than 90 community members in FY 2019. Throughout the year, SCVMC Women's Health Services hosted and participated in a variety of activities to support mothers in the comm unity. Free breastfeeding support groups led by the hospital's certified lactation educators provided education, support and guidance to more than 120 breastfeeding mothers in FY 2019. The groups were offered in both English and Spanish as well as held twi ce a week to accommodate working mothers. In October, SCVMC Women's Health Services held its 18th annual Breastfeeding Support Group Halloween Costume Parade for more than 40 mothers and family members from the hospital's breastfeeding support groups. Moth ers had the opportunity to dress their infants and children in costumes and celebrate with one another as their tiny trick -or-treaters paraded around several floors of the hospital . Also in FY 201 9, SCVMC Women's Health Services was actively involved in th e San Diego County Breastfeeding Coalition ; Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses ; and the Regional Perinatal System. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 108 In September, SCVMC hosted its second Family Safety Fair to educate more than 50 parents, expecting parents and g randparents on prenatal and postnatal safety. The fair included a variety of resource booths, free car seat installations and checks from the California Highway Patrol (CHP), and information on baby -proofing, lead poisoning and poison control, emergency pr eparedness and umbilical cord blood banking. The event collaborated with local retailer buybuy BABY for giveaways and raffle prizes and was supported and attended by local Assembly Member Shirley Weber and her team. In addition, Sharp -affiliated OB -GYNs an d pediatricians were available to answer questions at the event. On two days in April, SCVMC clinicians and staff collaborated with CHP to provide the Every 15 Minutes program to raise awareness among juniors and seniors at Olympian High School about the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The event included an in -depth simulation of a car accident and video of SCVMC staff caring for the victim in one of the hospital's patient rooms to illustrate that, on average, someone in th e U.S. dies from an alcohol -related incident every 15 minutes . In addition, an SCVMC staff member spoke in opposition of drinking and driving to approximately 1,300 students attending the event. Th rough the program, students were challenged to think about substance use , driving, personal safety, the responsibility of making mature decisions and how their decisions impact family, friends and the community. SCVMC continued to raise awareness of and foster collaboration around behavioral health needs in SDC' s south region. In May, SCVMC hosted its third annual Changing Minds - Minds Matter South County Ment al Health Fair at Chula Vista High School , a free event to educate community members about behavioral health challenges and raise awareness of available be havioral health services in the south region . In collaboration with SMV, the event included Check Your Mood screenings \u2014 a brief questionnaire aimed at assessing risk for depression \u2014 as well as educational workshops on substance use , dementia, mental heal th awareness, and child and adolescent mental health. The event brought m ore than 50 community partners together for a day of learning intended to reduce stigma, inspire recovery and empower 150 community members. Throughout FY 2019, SCVMC helped raise c ommunity awareness of important health issues through information segments with KUSI News. Experts included a Sharp - affiliated cardiologist, a Sharp -affiliated emergency medicine physician and a registered dietitian. Topics included what plants to be cautious of, how a plant -based diet could help reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, and how a t least six hours of sleep per night may help prevent plaque build -up in arteries. Throughout the year , SCVMC provided coordination, support and related fundraising activities for various community nonprofit organizations , including R otary Club of Chula Vista , Chula Vista Chamber of Commerce, Kiwanis Club of Bonita, AHA, AHA Regional Policy Board, Community Emergency Response Team, La Maestra Community Health Centers, San Diego Association of Directors of Volunteer Services, Chula Vista Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 109 Community Collabor ative , ACS, San Diego Human Dignity Foundation , FHCSD, Las Primeras, American Lung Association, South Bay Community Services, Altrusa International Club of San Diego, San Diego Immunization Coalition , California Immunization Coalition, Champions for Health , and South R egion - Live Well San Diego l eadership, chronic disea se, and commu nities of excellence committees. SCVMC also collaborated with the City of Chula Vista on the Healthy Chula Vista Advisory Commission to promote community wellness. FY 2020 Plan SCVMC will do the following: Provide a variety of educational resources , services and screenings at community health fairs and events In collaboration with community partners, provide an off -site, behavioral health resource and education event for community members in the south region Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide stroke education and resources to employees and residents in the city's nine districts Conduct two half -day heart health seminars with health scr eenings in English and Spanish Conduct seven blood drives Continue to provide education and community resources on a variety of health issues to underserved communities Continue to assist community nonprofit organizations through coordination, support and fundraising activities Continue to host an annual conference for seniors Continue to host a family safety fair Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration w ith Local Schools to Promote Interest in Health Care Careers Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2019 CHNAs identified education as one of 10 priority health conditions and SDOH affecting members of the communities served by SCVMC. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 31% of respondents ranked education, including access, health lit eracy, workforce development and economic mobility, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. According to participants in a focus group conducted during the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, when residents are unable to attain high er levels of educational Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 110 achievement, individual and community health are impacted in the following ways: limited or low wage employment opportunities for those with low educational attainment; constant stress related to housing or food among families who are not econ omically secure, which contributes to poor health; and limited career mobility in low-wage jobs, creating little potential for promotions or higher wages. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, in 2018, there were 157,756 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 9% of all jobs countywide (SDWP, 2019). According to a 2017 report from the SDWP titled San Diego's Priority Sectors: An Update on Labor Force and Training Needs , the health care industry in SDC experience d net employment growth of 40.4% between 2006 and 2016 \u2014 considerably higher than the growth rate in the state of California (27%) and the nation (21%) (SDWP, 2017). The report also found that health care employers identified registered nurses ( RNs), physi cians and surgeons, and health technologists and technicians as the most difficult positions to fill. The most frequently cited reasons for hiring difficulties were lack of experience, small applicant pools, and insufficient non -technical skills (SDWP, 201 7). According to SDWP, a major challenge faced by education and training programs in the health care sector is accommodating the number of clinical training hours required for students in California to become certified. In addition, the health care industr y is facing significant changes due to uncertainty related to legislation and technology, as well as the growing demand for services to support California's aging population (SDWP, 2017). Total employment in California is projected to grow 10.7% between 20 16 and 2026, reflecting an increase of 1.9 million jobs statewide over the decade. The health care and social assistance sector is expected to be the fastest growing industry in California, with 24.9% growth anticipated (California Employment Development Department , 2018). In its Employment Projections - 2018 -2028 report, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that health care support occupations and health care practitioners/ technical occupations will contribute about 30% of all new jobs and account for 18 of the 30 fastest growing occupations. Increased demand for health care services for an aging population and people with chronic conditions will drive much of the expected employment growth (BLS, 2019). As of 2018, SDC was one of 28 counties in California designated as a Registered Nurse Shortage Area by the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission (California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) Registered Nurse Shortage Areas Update , 2019). The U.S. Departmen t of Health and Human Services Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) projects that the demand for RNs in California will increase 71% by 2030 if current levels of health care are maintained. The report projects that California will need to hire an additional 26 ,270 nurses to meet the demand (BHW, 2018). According to forecasting performed by the Healthforce Center at University of California, San Francisco ( UCSF ), the demand for primary care clinicians in California will increase 12% to 17% by 2030. These forecasts predict that the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 111 southern border region will experience some of the highest levels of clinician shortages in the state. UCSF recommends a comprehensive and holistic targeted strategy to enhance the education pipeline, improve recruitment and retention, maximize the existing workforce, and leverage workforce data (UCSF, 2017 -2018). According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) , titled California Physician Supply: Headed for a Drought?, the total supply of active patient care physicians in California declined slightly between 2013 and 2015, a trend that appears to be driven by the aging of the physician workforce. In SDC, nearly a quarter of practicing physicians were ages 60 and older in 2015 (CHCF, 2018). The same report found that 32% of California's active patient care physicians were primary care physicians. In SDC, there were 112.3 specialty physicians practicing per 100,000 residents in 2015, compared to 49.8 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents (CHCF, 2018). According to a report from PolicyLink, a national research institute dedicated to advancing economic and social equity, building a diverse health care workforce in California \u2014 one that reflects the state's racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity \u2014 is a critical strategy for increasing access to culturally and linguistically appropriate services, eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities, improving the qua lity of care, and reducing preventable costs ( Building an Inclusive Health Workforce in California: A Statewide Policy Agenda, 2018 ). A report by the California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) titled Meeting the Demand for Health identified seve ral strategies to recruit and maintain California's health care workforce, including but not limited to: offer health career pipeline programs for students from low -income backgrounds; provide academic, advising and health career development support to und errepresented college students; expand educational programs that train students to provide health care in underserved communities; and provide scholarships for low -income students (CFHWC, 2019). Objective In collaboration with local schools, colleges and universities, offer opportunities for students to explore a vast array of health care professions FY 2019 Report of Activities Throughout FY 2019, SCVMC provided more than 131,200 hours of training and supervision for nearly 850 students pursuing health care careers. Students came from colleges and universities throughout the community, including APU, California College San Die go, California State University Dominguez Hills, California State University San Marcos, Capella University, CBD College, Concorde Career College, EMSTA College, Grand Canyon University, Grossmont College, Grossmont Health Occupations Center , Keck Graduate Institute, Midwestern University, National University (NU) , Palomar College, Pima Medical Institute, PLNU , San Diego City College, San Diego Mesa College, San Jose State University (SJSU), SDSU , SWC, Touro University, University of California San Diego , University of San Diego (USD) , University of Southern Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 112 California and Western Governors University, as well as the San Diego Fire Department. This included more than 700 nursing students who dedicated more than 87,200 hours to clinical rotations and individual training with hospital preceptors . Nursing students sought degrees ranging from associate level to Master of Science in Nursing. This also included a variety of students specializing in social work, dietetics, clinical or medical laboratory science, health informatics and more. In addition, the Barnhart Cancer Center precepted two radiation therapy students f rom NU, as well as a medical dosimetrist student and a Master of Social Work student from SJSU. Further, SCVMC Women's Health Services precepted eight nursing student s from USD and SDSU in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit . SCVMC provided more than 1,300 hours of supervision, training, lectures and support to pharmacy students and more than 900 hours to pharmacy tech students in FY 2019. In addition, the hospital hosted 37 pharmacy students in advanced pharmacy practice exper ience rotations as well as provided over 1,060 hours of training to eight postgraduate year one Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) residents and one post -graduate year two Emergency Medicine Pharmacy Resident. SCVMC also provided information to hundreds of PharmD candidates, residents, students and interns about the education and training opportunities provided by the hospital's residency program. Education was provided through participation in showcases, educational sessions, poster presentations and lectures at various schools and state and national conferences. Furthermore, in FY 2019, SCVMC conducted 36 half -day interviews for pharmacy residency candidates after receiving and processing more than 110 applications. SCVMC continued to partner with SWC to train nursing students enrolled in the Integrative Therapies Collaborative, an innovative externship program developed between the two organizations and offered as an elective by SWC. Through the program, students receive training for relaxing therapies , includi ng hand massage, aromatherapy and music for healing. Students visit patient rooms on each nursing unit as well as hospital waiting areas and the Barnhart Cancer Center , where they nurtur e and interact with patients, families and visitors to help create a r elaxing environment. SCVMC trained 30 students through the Integrative Therapies Collaborative in FY 201 9. In October and April, an SCVMC social worker presented on the role of a medical social worker in a hospital setting to 50 social work students at S an Diego City College. In November, t wo SCVMC nurses presented at Castle Park High School's fourth annual Building and Construction Trades Fair on topics including what it is like to be a nurse, nursing career opportunities, nursing prerequisites, professi on expectations and general compensation. Throughout FY 2019, Sharp offered Spanish -language resources and educational opportunities to Hispanic or Latino community members and health workers in the south region. As part of the Conviva y Aprenda (Share and Learn) educational series, Sharp offered five educational session s to approximately 300 promotores (community health Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 113 workers) at the San Diego Country Club in Chula Vista. Session topics included Domestic Violence and How it Affects the Whole Family; Die ts and Healthy Eating; Depression Can Affect Anyone at Any Age; Diet and Daily Stress Affect the Digestive System; and Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia. Sharp also offered three open enrollment Medicare presentations and four New to Medicare seminars in Sp anish to more than 100 attendees. Throughout FY 201 9, SCVMC continued its participation in the Health Sciences High and Middle College (HSHMC) program. This partnership provides students with early professional development and promotes interest in health care careers through hospital internships. In FY 201 9, more than 30 students in grades nine through 12 explored a variety of hospital specialties based on their interests, including pharmacy, radiation oncology, pathology, nursing, medical/surgical, Sodexo /food and nutrition services, engineering and physical rehabilitation. HSHMC students spent more than 7,300 hours at SCVMC during FY 201 9. SCVMC also continued to foster student interest in health care careers through the provision of hospital tours. In F Y 201 9, four tours were provided to 60 students from San Ysidro Adult School, SWC and UEI College. FY 2020 Plan SCVMC will do the following: Continue to provide educational and professional development opportunities to health profession students throughout SDC In collaboration with high schools, colleges and other organizations, provide hospital tours to promote student interest in health care careers Continue participation in the HSHMC program to provi de job shadowing and mentorship for high sch ool students Continue to provide education to health professionals in the community Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care and Community and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2019 CHNAs identified community and social support, economic security, and homelessness and housing instability among the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SCVMC, particularly underserved and underfunded patients who face inequities . Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified five primary barriers to accessing health care in San Diego: (1) lack Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 114 of insurance; (2) economic insecurity; (3) transportation; (4) fear related to immigration status; and (5) lack of culturally competent/linguistically appropriate care options. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 72% of respondents identified access to care, 60% identified economic security, and 35% identified care management, including disease management and communi ty social service linkage, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. Participants in the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group conducted as part of the SCVMC 2019 CHNA identified a lack of : family support ; caregiver upon discharge ; and childcare assistance as priority SDOH related to community and social support that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants also identified economic security as a signifi cant barrier to care. In particular the cost of housing, taking time off work for medical appointments, the cost of medication and food insecurity were highlighted. Further, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants identified the following hospital discharge challenges and barriers for patients: transportation support; a shortage of recuperative or respite care options; a lack of short -term caregivers and in -home support services; and a need for a streamlined process from the hospital to th e County of San Diego HHSA for those who qualify for wraparound support. Participants in Sharp's 2019 CHNA community engagement activities identified the following strategies to address economic security in patients: prioritizing the hiring and training of social workers; offering free post -surgery visits; providing follow -up phone calls to patients following discharge; making in -home care more accessible; ensuring access to 2-1-1 San Diego's (2-1-1's) Community Information Exchange (CIE) to and other commu nity resources at all Sharp facilities; establishing more patient -centered initiatives; and creating on -site resources to assist patients in finding and applying for affordable housing. In 2017, there were 710 ED visits related to mood disorders in SDC's s outh region, and the age -adjusted rate was 138.1 per 100,000 population. Individuals ages 15 to 24 had a significantly higher rate of ED visits for mood disorders when compared to all other age groups (282.9 per 100,000 population). There were 511 ED visit s for substance -related disorders in SDC's south region in 2017. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits for substance -related disorders was 102.5 per 100,000 population. From 2017-2018, 25.8% of adults reported visiting the emergency room in SDC's south regi on, while 9.3% of south region adults, teens and children claimed to have no usual source of care (CHIS, 201 7-2018). According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition , 1 in 7 San Diegans experienced food insecurity in 2017 . Half of adults experiencing food insecurity are living with a disability (San Diego Hunger Coalition, 2019). The Regional Taskforce on the Homeless' January 2019 WeAllCount campaign estimated that there were 8, 102 homeless individuals in SDC, roughly 5 5% of whom were unsheltered. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 115 In 2019, 5.3% of SDC's homeless population resided in the south region. A 2016 report by the County of San Diego HHSA titled Identifying Health Disparities to Achieve Health Equity in San Diego County: Socioeconomic Status found that low-income communities in the county are disproportionately affected by numerous health issues, including injury, chronic and communicable diseases, poor maternal and child health outcomes, and behavioral health outcomes. Two of the lowest income c ommunities, Chula Vista and National City, are located in SDC's south region. According to OSHPD, the number of primary care clinics in California rose steadily between 2014 and 2018 . During this period, t he number of patients utilizing the se clinics incre ased by 22.0%, while the total number of primary care clinic encounters increased by 38.8% (OSHPD , 201 8). According to a report from the CHCF titled Mental Health in California: For Too Many, Care Not There , the prevalence of serious mental illness varies by income level, with lower -income individuals experiencing higher rates of mental illness. Although the number of adults with mental health coverage in California increased nearly 50% between 2012 and 2015 because of Medi -Cal expansion, in 2015, approximately two -thirds of Californian adults with mental illness and adolescents who experienced major depressive episodes did not receive treatment (CHCF, 2018). According to the same report, ED visits resulting in inpatient psychiatric admissions increased 30 % from 2010 to 2015. More robust community behavioral health services for low -income and uninsured patients may decrease unnecessary ED use (CHCF, 2018). Objectives Establish a medical home for the safety net patient population of SDC's south region Provide assessment and early intervention for behavioral health issues among safety net patients presenting in the ED Assist economically disadvantaged individuals through transportation, community clinic refer rals, pharmaceutical assistance and connection to services in the community FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 2019, SCVMC continued to provide specialized programming to support low - income, uninsured and medically underserved patients in SDC's south reg ion who receive care from SCVMC hospitalists. The program provided these patients with access and timely referrals to primary care and behavioral health services, as well as facilitated the establishment of medical homes (e.g., primary care) at community c linics, including Chula Vista Family Health Center and San Ysidro Health locations. SCVMC provided care and community resources to safety net patients with chronic conditions to help them better manage their pain, diseases and overall health care. This included providing affordable medications through low -cost generic prescriptions Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 116 available at Costco and Walmart, as well as discount cards for select medications. Additional pharmaceutical assistance was provided through referrals to Sharp's pharmacy assis tance program, which helps patients enroll in discount programs through pharmaceutical companies. Patients also received other resources including but not limited to medication assistance through community clinics and programs for various conditions throug h the County of San Diego Public Health Services. In addition, in FY 2019, SCVMC provided nearly $26,700 in free medications, transportation and financial assistance through its Project HELP funds as well as financial assistance for a variety of post-acute care services, such as durable medical equipment necessary for the safe discharge of unfunded patients. Further, Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SCVMC. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. SCVMC 's social services staff continued to provide safety net patients with comprehensive behavioral health services. Individuals who presented in the ED with severe mental illness received mental health evaluation, appropriate placement within the hospital and community, and community resources an d referrals as needed. In FY 2019, more than 14,600 social service interventions, including behavioral health interventions, were provided throughout the hospital as well as Birch Patrick Convalescent Center \u2014 a skilled nursing facility at SCVMC . Through t hese interventions, the hospital conducted more than 1,800 family conferences, nearly 2,700 psychosocial assessments and nearly 5,600 staff consultations. In addition, the t otal number of interventions strictly for information and resources were nearly 4,2 00. Further , more than 1,650 patients received counseling and nearly 1,100 patients were evaluated for substance use. Individuals were also assessed for suicidal or homicidal ideation and provided with outpatient resources or mental health treatment and placement as needed. SCVMC's spe cialized programming establishes a higher standard of care delivery for nurses and doctors who handle exceptionally vulnerable patients . In FY 2019, SCVMC continued to collaboratively establish outpatient treatment plans with safety net patients who frequent the ED , and provided these patients with education on the proper use of the ED . More than 850 patients were treated strictly for issues related to homelessness , and many of those patients also received treatment for substa nce use . In addition, SCVMC's efforts to establish medical homes has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of vulnerable community members utilizing the hospital's ED as a primary source of care, indicating improved access to and quality of care fo r these individuals. Diapers are expensive \u2014 a month's supply can cost up to $80 per child \u2014 and cannot be purchased with CalFresh or WIC benefits. As a result, parents with limited economic resources may change diapers less frequently than recommended an d unintentionally place their infant at risk. In May 2019, SCVMC collaborated with the Food Bank to help struggling families cope with a serious challenge \u2014 the cost of diapers \u2014 by starting a Diaper Bank at SCVMC. This three -year partnership provides diap ers to low -income Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 117 parents in SDC so they can remain employed, provide for their families, and lift themselves out of poverty. In FY 2019 SCVMC distributed more than 5,500 diapers to more than 80 households through this partnership, serving more than 100 children in the community. New in FY 2019, SCVMC joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1's CIE to better unders tand and address the SDOH that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH \u2014 the conditions where people live, learn, work and play \u2014 have a significant impact on the ability for community members to ac cess care and maintain their health. SCVMC joined the CIE pilot partnership in order to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with SDOH needs, and to connect them directly to community resources specifically for those needs. More than 70 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared community member records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and current use of community programs and services, and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. Beginning in summer 2019, SCVMC case managers and social workers received training on CIE as a tool to serve vulnerable patients in the acute care setting, including those patients experiencing food insecurity and homelessness. Metrics of this partnership, including demographic and utilization data, as well as volume and successful community referrals, are curre ntly being collected and will help to assess the impact and value of the partnership at the end of its pilot year in early summer 2020. In addition, SCVMC continued to collaborate with the San Diego Rescue Mission' s (SDRM) Recuperative Care Unit (RCU) to provide a safe discharge plan for patients experiencing chronic homelessness who require further supervision and a stable living environment for their continued recovery . The RCU was a temporary shelter program that addresse d the needs of men and women experiencing homelessness who were newly released from the hospital . The program provided case management, social work and counseling services as well as referrals for community -based medical and psychiatric services, long -term housing and other community su pport programs. In January 2019, SDRM closed their RCU, thus ending this partnership. Lastly, in FY 2019, SCVMC continued to participate in the County of San Diego's Whole Person Wellness pilot program to help provide comprehensive care management for home less Medi -Cal beneficiaries who experience high utilization of medical services. FY 20 20 Plan SCVMC will do the following: Continue to collaborate with local community clinics to provide referrals and establish appointments for low -income, underserved and uninsured individuals in the south region ; continue inclusion of SCVMC transition planning Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 118 Continue to provide safety net p atients with opportunities for education on the proper use of the ED as well as help them establish medical homes Continue to explore new funding opportunities for programs that assist safety net patients with establishing a medical home and connect them t o community resources Continue to provide assistance to those in need through Project HELP Continue to participate in 2 -1-1's CIE program to serve homeless and other complex patients by connecting them to needed services in the community Continue to colla borate with the Food Bank to provide free diapers to patients Establish a collaboration between the Birch Patrick Convalescent Center and a mobile dentist to provide in -house dental care (beginning October 2019) Continue to partner with the Food Bank to pr ovide diapers to low -income parents in SDC Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 119 SCVMC Program and Service Highlights 24-hour emergency services ACP Acute inpatient medical care Birch Patrick Convalescent Center Bloodless Medicine and Surgery Cancer care, including radiation and infusion therapy at the Barnhart Cancer Center Classes, events and physician referral through 1 -800-82-SHARP Clinical trials for cancer treatment, orthopedics and cardiovascular health Diagnostic imaging, including X -ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, nuclear medicine, mammography, ultrasound, bone density testing, and outpatient imaging center Ear, nose and throat Endoscopy services Eye care Financial counseling and assistance FollowMyHealth\u00ae, a secure on -line patient website that gives patients convenient, 24-hour access to their personal health information General and specialty surgical services, including robotic surgery, open -heart surgery, total joint replacement and minim ally invasive surgery Genetic counseling and testing Heart and vascular care, including diagnostics, open -heart surgery, interventional cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation Home health38 Hospice39 Integrative and complementary medicine, including Healing Touch and aromatherapy Interventional radiology Laboratory services Medical and Surgical Intensive Care Units Mindful Caf\u00e9, offering healthy and nutritious food options for patients, family and staff Neurology and stroke services ( nationally recognized by the AHA/ASA for stroke) Nutrition counseling Orthopedics Outpatient diabetes services, recognized by the ADA Outpatient Surgery Center Pharmacy (inpatient and outpatient), including residency program Pulmonary care Rehabilitation, including physical, occupational, speech and lymphedema therapies, as well as balance and vestibular rehabilitation Social services Translation and interpreter services 38 Provided through Sharp Memorial Hospital Home Health Agency. 39 Provided through Sharp HospiceCare.

In response to community need, Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center developed the Fall Prevention Workshop to protect senior community members from the potentially devastating effects of a fall. Since July 2018, the monthly Fall Prevention Workshop has educated community members about common causes of falls, equipment and home modifications to help prevent falls, and strategies to avoid injury during a fall. Each participant is screened for their risk of falling by the hospital's physical therapist and certified personal trainer. Finally, attendees leave with a personalized fall prevention plan for continued support at and away from home.

Together we have transformed health care and have set a standard of patient and family centered care that is amongst the world's best. We are grateful to our community for sharing our vision to make this hospital the best in the universe! \u2014 Susan Stone, Chief Executive Officer, SCHHC Fiscal Year (F Y) 2019 Community Benefit Program Highlights Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center (SCHHC) provided a total of $22,137,976 in community benefit in FY 2019. See Table 19 for a summary of unreimbursed costs based on the categories specifically identified in Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), and Figure 17 for the distribution of SCHHC's community benefit among those categories.

Costs for patients paid through the Medicare program on a prospective basis also include payments to third parties related to the specific population. 41 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for ser vices at the time the services were rendered. 42 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children 's Services Program, or county may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits p lus costs for supplies, materials and other purchased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of providing services. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providin g the program or service. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 122 Figure 17: Percentage of Community Benefit by SB 697 Category Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center \u2014 FY 2019 Key highlights: Medical Care Services included uncompensated care for patients who were unable to pay for services and unreimbursed costs of public programs, such as Medi -Cal, Medicare and CHAMPVA/TRICARE. In FY 2018 , the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019. This resulted in recognition of net supplemental revenues for SCHHC totaling $ 7.2 million in FY 2019. These supplemental revenues were funded through SCH HC's traditional Medi -Cal program, which was only in a shortfall position of $3.5 million prior to the fee. As such, the net impact of the program was to reduce SCHHC's shortfall in traditional Medi -Cal to $0.00 (zero). This reimbursement helped offset pri or years' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 2019 understate the true unreimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year .

Other Benefits for the Broader Community included education and information on a variety of health topics, participation in community health fairs and events, flu vaccinations, collaboration with local schools to promote student interest in health care careers and donation of meeting room space to community groups. In addition, SCHHC staff actively participated in community boards, committees and other civic organizations, including the Rotary Club of Coronado, Coronado SAFE (Student And Family Enrichment) , Coronado Chamber of Commerce, San Diego Eye Bank Nurses' Advisory Board, Grossmont College Respiratory Advisory Committee, California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI)/Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) Subcommittee (CDPH HAI/ASP Subcommittee ), and th e Planetree Board of Directors. See Appendix A for a listing of Sharp's involvement in community organizations in FY 201 9. This category also included costs associated with planning and operating community benefit programs, such as community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation. Health Research, Education and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training for health care professionals, student and intern supervision and health -related research projects that were generalizable and made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community SCHHC is located at 250 Prospect Place in Coronado, ZIP code 92118. The communities served by SCHHC include the City of Coronado, Downtown San Diego and Imperial Beach, an incorporated city. Notably, most Coronado residents use SCHHC. Coronado is connected to central San Diego by a bridge to the east and an isthmus known a s the Silver Strand to the south. SCHHC is geographically isolated and located in the central area of Coronado, which includes hotels, shops, single -family homes, condominiums and apartments. Coronado also includes Coronado Cays, a marina community located on the isthmus. In addition to these communities, there are six military sites in Coronado, including one of the largest Naval Commands with housing located both on - and off -base. Downtown San Diego and Imperial Beach are in close proximity to Coronado. Certain secondary data sources are not available at this level of specificity, and, in these cases, broader summaries of San Diego County (SDC) are provided. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries in SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 124 For SCHHC's 201 9 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) was utilized to identify communities with greater health disparity within the county. The CNI identifies the severity of health disparity for every ZIP code in the United States (U.S.) based on specific barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitalizations. According to the CNI, communities served by SCHHC with especially high need include Imperial Beach, National City and Southeast San Diego . Figure 18 presents a map of the CNI scores across SDC . Figure 18: CNI Map \u2014 SDC44 Description of Community Health In 2019, there were 504,267 residents ages 65 and older in SDC, representing 15.1% of the population. Between 2019 and 2024, it is anticipated that SDC's senior population will grow by 22.4%. Further, i ndividuals ages 65 and older make up 19.2% of Coronado Island's population, while adults ages 45 to 64 make up 20.0%. Between 2019 and 2024, the senior population is projected to grow by 20.3% on Coronado Island and by 44 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018 . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 125 24.9% in SCHHC's service area, which includes Coronado Island, Imperial Beach and Otay Mesa, among other communities.45 Given the unique geography and demographic composition of SCHHC, many of the hospital's services address the health needs of older adults. In 2017, 13.3% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemployment rate was 6.8% and 5.0% of households received Supplemental Security Income.46 According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7, or 14% of SDC's population experienced food insecurity47 in 2017. An additional 1 in 5 San Diegans were food secure but relied on supplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget.48 In 2017, 7.2% of households in SDC participated in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 19.9% of the p opulation lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program. 46 Please refer to Table 20 for SNAP participation and eligibility in SDC.

SCHHC's 201 9 CHNA was significantly influenced by the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties ( HASD&IC) 201 9 CHNA process and findings . Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process and findings. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 128 In addition, this year SCHHC completed its most current implementation strategy \u2014 a description of SCHHC programs designed to address the priority health needs identified in the 201 9 CHNA. The most recent CHNA and implementation strategy for SCHHC are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Through the SCHHC 2019 CHNA, the following priority health needs were identified for the communities served by SCHHC (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Concerns Behavioral Health (including Substance Use) Cancer Chronic Health Conditions (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) , Diabetes and Obesity) Community and Social Support Economic Security Education Homelessness and Housing Instability Unintentional Injury and Violence The following pages detail SCHHC programs, activities and services that speci fically address aging concerns, chronic health conditions, community and social support (these prog rams also help address a ccess to health care , economic security and homelessness and housing), education and unintentional injury. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional e ntity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. In light of the significant number of adults and older adults that comprise the community served by SCHHC (adults ages 45 to 65 -plus, nearly 40%), many of SCHHC's programs focus on aging concerns. However, SCHHC also provides education and screening programs that address a healthy lifestyle and are an important factor in care for obesity, CVD and diabetes. Unfortunately, SCHHC has limited capacity and resources to comprehensively add ress these health needs through community initiatives , as well as lacks the resources to meet the need for community education and support in behavioral health. Community education and support elements of behavioral health are addressed through the program s and services provided by Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital (SMV) and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use services in SDC. Please refer to Section 11 of this report for details o n those programs. SCHHC has collaborated with SMV in recent years and continues to explore those opportunities as capacity allows. For additional details on SCHHC programs that specifically address the needs identified in the 2019 CHNA, please refer to SCHHC's implementation strategy available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 129 For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2019 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s) and FY 2020 Plan. Identified Community Need: Health Education, Screening and Support Activities Rationale references the findings of the SCHHC 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCHHC 2019 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer, chronic conditions, community and social support, economic security, education, homelessness and housing instability, and unintentional injury and violence as the priority health issues affecting members of the communities served by SCHHC. HASD&IC focus group participants also identified health literacy as a barrier to care, and recommended several strategies to address this issue, including: culturally sensitive education about preventive care, including immunizations and health screenings; education about lifestyle choices that promote health, such as smoking cessation, nutrition and exercise; and assistance understanding and navigating the health care and insurance systems, particularly for those who have received a serious heal th diagnosis. As part of the SCHHC 2019 CHNA, a focus group comprised of members of Sharp's Patient Family Advisory Council described lack of health education and health literacy, particularly surrounding preventive care (including immunizations), illness and disease as barriers to health care. Participants also noted that many patients and community members do not understand how to navigate the health care system, especially identifying the appropriate sites of care to meet their needs. Participants in the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs ranked the following health conditions and social determinants of health ( SDOH ) as the top ten items with the greatest impact on the health of community residents: understanding, secur ing and using health insurance; access to care, particularly primary, dental, behavioral health and specialty care; aging concerns; behavioral/mental health issues; cancer (all health behaviors (diet, phys ical and sexual activ ity, tobacco and substance use) and diabetes. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SCHHC 2019 CHNAs identified several health conditions that particularly impact older adults, including: Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease s, dementia, arthritis, loss of mobility, opioid abuse, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, de pression, lung disease, obesity and poor oral health. In addition, the focus group identified the following SDOH that impact seniors: lack of accessible or reliable transportation options; challenges accessing fresh food; social isolation and inadequate family support; economic insecurity and environmental pollutants. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 130 Sharp senior health focus group participants suggested the following strategies for increasing healt h care access for seniors: establishing a centralized communication database so that patient information can be shared across health care systems; creating and promoting programs to assist seniors with transportation to medical appointments and grocery sto res; expanding meal delivery services; expanding behavioral health care options for Me di-Cal and Medicare patients and increasing the availability of translators. Data analysis in Sharp's 2019 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to CV D and Type 2 diabetes in communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges throughout SDC.52 In 2017, cancer was the leading cause of death, and diseases of the heart were the second leading cause of death in SDC. In 2017, the 10 leading causes of death among adults ages 65 years and older in SDC were diseases of the heart, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular diseases (including stroke), chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes, accidents/unintentional injuries, essential hypertension and hyp ertensive renal disease, Parkinson's disease, and influenza or pneumonia.53 In 2017, the number of osteoarthritis -related hospitalizations in SDC totaled 9,235 \u2014 an age -adjusted rate of 245.3 per 100,000 population. SDC adults ages 65 years and older repres ented the highest hospitalization rate for arthritis when compared to all other age groups, with a rate of 1,251.2 per 100,000 population. According to 2018 CHIS data, 26.3% of SDC adults reported being obese. In 2018, between 25% and 30% of California adu lts self -reported being obese. Prevalence of obesity decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates (C enters for Disease Control and Prevention (C DC), 2019). According to the CDC, so me of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. In 2015 -2016, 39.8% of Americans were obese (CDC, 2017). According to an article titled Social and En vironmental Factors Influencing Obesity , obesity prevalence is significantly associated with sex, racial or ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status. Higher odds of obesity are attributed to multiple factors, including: environments experi encing deprivati on, disorder, or high crime; proliferation of high calorie, energy dense food options that are perceived as more affordable; and reductions in occupational and transportation -related physical activity. Both objective and subjective measures of social statu s and inequality are associated with increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure, which could place individuals of low social status at greater risk of developing obesity (Lee, Cardel & Donahoo, 2019). 52 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018; California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development via SpeedTrack, Inc., 2017. 53 The Coun ty of San Diego H ealth and Human Services Agency 's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) . Data is based on \"underlying cause of dea th\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2017. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all rankable causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile. \" (County of San Diego H ealth and Human Services Agency Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2019; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2017. National Vital Statistics Reports; vol. 68 no 6. Hyattsville, Marylan d: NCHS . 2019.) . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 131 According to the National Institutes of H ealth ( NIH), more than 53 million people in the U.S. either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass. Along with the financial costs, osteoporosis can reduce quality of life for many people who suffer from fractures. It can also a ffect the lives of family members and friends who serve as caregivers. Preventable risk factors for osteoporosis include smoking, alcohol consumption, and medication and vitamin intake (NIH, 2018). According to HP2020, most events resulting in injury, disa bility or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk - taking; physical environment both at home and in the community; acce ss to health services and systems for injury -related care; and social environment, including individual social experiences (e.g., social norms, education and victimization history), social relationships (e.g., parental monitoring and supervision of youth, peer group associations and family interactions), community environment (e.g., cohesion in schools, neighborhoods and communities) and societal factors (e.g., cultural beliefs, attitudes, incentives and disincentives, laws and regulations). Objectives Provide on -site and community -based education addressing CHNA -identified health needs , including chronic conditions (e.g., obesity , diabetes and CVD ), cancer, aging concerns, unintentional injury and health literacy Provide community health screenings that respond to the CHNA -identified chronic health conditions of obesity, diabetes and CVD Collaborate with local schools and first responders to promote community safety FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 201 9, SCHHC actively supported the health and well -being of hundreds of San Diego and Coronado community members through the provision of health education and screenings addressing a range of health needs, including many identified in the 2019 CHNA process. Outreach took place during several community heal th fairs and events as well as numerous opportunities hosted on -site at the hospital. SCHHC reached approximately 180 community members through participation in health fairs hosted by the John D. Spreckels Center and Bowling Green (Spreckels Center). This included the Spreckels Center annual Wellness Fair in October, where team members provided various health screenings, including for blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol and body composition, as well as offered chair massage, ear acupressure and nut rition education. In April, SCHHC participated in the Spreckels Center Spring into Health event to provide community members with education and resources that support healthy aging, including body composition and blood pressure screenings as well as tips f or balance and fall prevention. In October, SCHHC provided stroke education and blood pressure screenings to more than 100 community members at the City of Coronado Fire and Police Department s' Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 132 Annual Public Safety Open House. In February, SCHHC helped r aise community awareness about heart health through the provision of nearly 15 community blood pressure screenings as part of Live Well San Diego's (LWSD's) Love Your Heart initiative. The annual effort brings organizations together from across the U.S. an d Mexico to provide free blood pressure screenings to the public on Valentine's Day. In September, SCHHC's Sewall Healthy Living Center hosted its inaugural Community Wellness Fair. More than 50 community members attended the free event which offered fitness demonstrations, chair massage, acupressure, body composition testing, fall prevent ion tips, and healthy food samples from the hospital's Mindful Caf\u00e9. In FY 201 9, SCHHC supported special safety events aimed at reducing drug and alcohol related incidents among Coronado's youth. At Coronado Middle School in April , team members participa ted in Coronado SAFE 's Drug Store event which used lifelike scenarios to educate sixth -grade students about the dangers of drugs an d alcohol . During the event, a SCHHC pharmacist taught students about the negative impact of drugs and alcohol on the brain, while the hospital's nurses supported a demonstration and discussion about what occurs in the emergency room following an overdose. SCHHC provided a variety of community health education opportunities throughout the year. At the Spreckels Center, SCHHC o ffered free monthly classes for community members on a range of health and wellness topics, including understanding Medicare, cancer prevention, mindful eating, stroke prevention and warning signs, disaster preparedness, Chinese medicine and longevity, mus culoskeletal conditions, and women's health and fitness. Approximately 120 community members attended the classes in FY 2019. In May, SCHHC provided health education to 20 seniors in the Coronado Seniors Out & About Program \u2014 a volunteer -driven program tha t provides scheduled rides to seniors for a nominal fee. Education covered how to recognize the signs of a heart attack or stroke and get to the hospital for care. In March, SCHHC opened its auditorium for the Coronado Cultural Arts Commission's communit y seminar titled The White Plague: Tuberculosis, Yesterday and Today. During the event, more than 20 community members heard from a County of San Diego Public Health Services expert about the history and trends of tuberculosis, how the disease continues to impact the population, and recommendations for screening and prevention. In April, an SCHHC team member spoke during a FOX 5 San Diego live news segment regarding new mammogram guidelines from the American College of Physicians. Various fitness and welln ess classes were also offered throughout the year at the hospital's Sewall Healthy Living Center and Sandermann Education Center. Free weekly chair yoga promoted mobility, stress reduction and increased mental clarity, while a free weekly Mini Guided Medit ation class offered stress reduction techniques, coping skills for chronic physical or emotional pain, and tips to improve focus and sense of well -being. A variety of yoga classes were offered each week, including healing yoga, simple yoga, restorative yog a, Vinyasa yoga and yoga sculpt, as well as biweekly cardio Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 133 circuit, Qigong and tai chi. In addition, a biweekly Gentle Fitness class helped improve muscular strength, range of motion and activities of daily living for older adults and those with physical limitations, while a Balance, Strength and Flexibility class \u2014 offered four times a week \u2014 focused on strengthening muscles and reflexes to reduce the risk of falling. Further, SCHHC offer ed daily Express Yoga and Express Zumba to community members and emp loyees during the lunch hour. SCHHC also provided four fall prevention workshops in FY 2019, covering topics such as common causes of falls, home modifications for safety, frequently used equipment for fall prevention and tips to stay safe in the community . The workshops included a one -hour lecture as well as the provision of a personalized fall prevention plan. Finally, SCHHC hosted nine physician - led community seminars during the year on topics including sleep ap nea, Medicare and treating orthopedic condi tions . SCHHC participated in several Sharp -sponsored events in FY 201 9, including the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference in May, held at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina. During the conference, team members reached hundreds of community members through screenings for osteoporosis, body composition and balance/fall prevention ; chair massage s and consultations with a personal trainer. In addition, team members provided orthopedic education and materials including calcium and vitamin D requirements , and exercise for osteoporosis treatment and prevention. SCHHC's Sewall Health Living Center also provided several fitness -oriented educational sessions during the conference, including Qigong for pain management and injury prevention; resistance band str ength training; and stretching, strengthening, and meditation to alleviate pain and discomfort and promote a balanced lifestyle. In support of community and environmental health, SCHHC participated in Sharp's annual Drug Take Back, Document Shredding and E-Waste Event s in October and April. Community members were invited to drop off expired or unwanted prescription drugs, paperwork and electronics for convenient, confidential and safe disposal. Further , SCHHC participated in year -round fundraising activit ies on behalf of Sharp in support of the 201 9 American Heart Association Heart & Stroke Walk. SCHHC keeps the community regularly informed of upcoming health classes and events through the internet, radio broadcast, local journals and newspapers, posters in the hospital lobby, and fliers within physician offices and other community organizations. SCHHC also supports patients, family and community members with locating reliable health information to support their diagnosis. Individuals can search relevant l iterature from high -quality websites using the hospital's computer stations. In FY 201 9, SCHHC leadership and hospital staff contributed their time to several organizations, including Rotary Club of Coronado, Coronado SAFE, Coronado Chamber of Commerce, San Diego Eye Bank Nurses' Advisory Board, Grossmont College Respiratory Advisory Committee, CDPH HAI/ASP Subcommittee, and th e Planetree Board of Directors. In addition, SCHHC actively participated in the quarterly San Diego County Stroke Consortium, a collaborative effort to improve stroke care and discuss issues impacting stroke care in SDC. SCHHC also continued its 1 4-year co llaboration Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 134 with the County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services to provide data for the SDC stroke registry. FY 20 20 Plan SCHHC will do the following: Provide education and screenings at community health fairs and events as well as at the hospital to support identified community health needs surrounding obesity , cardiovascular health, aging concerns and unintentional injury Support health literacy among seniors and their caregivers through the distribution of easy -to-read materials from the Institut e for Healthcare Advancement at community health fairs and events Participat e in two community health fairs at the Spreckels Center Participate in the LWSD Love Your Heart initiative to provide free blood pressure screenings to the public Continue to prov ide free educational classes for the community on a variety of health topics in collaboration with the Spreckels Center Provide education on fall prevention and safety at the City of Coronado Fire and Police Department s' Annual Public Safety Open House Promote healthy eating, including the consumption of anti -inflammatory foods, at A Taste of Coronado Collaborate with local schools and first responders to provide community safety activities Explore opportunities to provide behavioral health screenings and resources to community members in collaboration with SMV Expand education, screenings and outreach to the Logan Heights and Imperial Beach communities Continue to participate in the San Diego County Stroke Consortiu m with other SDC hospitals Continue to provide data to the SDC stroke registry Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care and Community and Social Support Rationale r eferences the findings of the SCHHC 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recen t SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCHHC 2019 CHNAs identified community and social support, economic security, and homelessness and housing instability among the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SCHHC, particularly underserved and underfunded patients who face inequities . Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified five primary barriers to accessing health care in San Diego: (1) lack Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 135 of insurance; (2) economic insecurity; (3) transportation; (4) fear related to immigration status; and (5) lack of culturally competent/linguistically appropriate care options. According to the results of the Sharp Insig ht Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 72% of respondents identified access to care, 60% identified economic security, and 35% identified care management, including disease management and community social service linkage, among the top fi ve SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. Participants in the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group conducted as part of the SCHHC 2019 CHNA identified economic security as a significant barrier to care. In particular, the cost of housing , taking time off work to for medical appointments, the cost of medication and food insecurity were highlighted. Further, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants identified the following hospital discharge challenges and barriers for pati ents: transportation support; a shortage of recuperative or respite care options; a lack of short -term caregivers and in -home support services; and a need for a streamlined process from the hospital to the County of San Diego H ealth and Human Services Agen cy for those who qualify for wraparound support. Participants in Sharp's 2019 CHNA community engagement activities identified the following strategies to address economic security in patients: prioritizing the hiring and training of social workers; offerin g free post -surgery visits; providing follow -up phone calls to patients following discharge; making in -home care more accessible; ensuring access to 2 -1-1 San Diego (2 -1-1) Community Information Exchange ( CIE) and other community resources at all Sharp fac ilities; establishing more patient - centered initiatives; and creating on -site resources to assist patients in finding and applying for affordable housing. According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7 San Diegans experienced food insecurity in 2017. Half of adults experiencing food insecurity are living with a disability (San Diego Hunger Coalition, 2019). As of October 2019, the overall unemployment rate in SDC was 2.8%, which was lower than the unemployment rate for the state of California (3.9%) an d the national rate (3.6%) during the same period (Labor Market Information, California Employment Development Department (EDD) , 2019; BLS, 2019). The Regional Taskforce for the Homeless' January 2019 WeAllCount campaign estimated that there were 8,102 homeless individuals in SDC, roughly 55% of whom were unsheltered. Objectives Provide free flu vaccinations to community members , including seniors Improve food security among at -risk seniors through home -based meal delivery services Assist economically disadvantaged individuals through financial assistance for transportation and pharmaceuticals Support environmental health through sustainable food purchasing and initiatives to prevent food waste Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 136 FY 201 9 Report of Activities SCHHC provides supportive programs that address a variety of SDOH \u2014 the conditions where people live, learn, work and play \u2014 impacting seniors and community members who face inequities , including access to health care, access to healthy food and environmental health. SCHHC continued to assist economically disadvantaged individuals through its Project HELP financial assistance program, providing more than $10,800 in free medication and transportation in FY 201 9. SCHHC also provided more than $1 18,000 in free valet servi ces to improve patient, family and community member access to the hospital , including approximately $8,500 to support access to SCHHC's community seminars and events. In addition, Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SCHHC. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these progr ams and services. In an effort to protect members of the community from the flu virus, in FY 201 9, SCHHC provided free seasonal flu vaccinations to more than 260 community members. This included residents of the Coronado Retirement Village, members of the Coronado Fire Department , attendees of the hospital's annual community flu clinics , family members of the hospital's long -term care residents, and staff, student s and family members at Logan K -8 elementary school. In addition, SCHHC served as a blood donation site in support of Sharp's FY 2019 systemwide blood drive effort to collect life -saving blood for those with medical needs. In May, SCHHC participated in the San Diego Unified School District's Community Education Resource Fair at the Educational Cultural Complex located near the Logan Heights community. During the event, SCHHC shared information and resources with approximatel y 40 community members about free and low -cost services provided by the hospital, including health education and screenings opportunities. For more than 30 years, SCHHC has helped deliver meals to the homes of vulnerable community seniors, including tho se who are homebound or living alone. Beginning in 2016, SCHHC partnered with Meals on Wheels San Diego County to create the new Sharp Coronado Hospital Auxiliary Meals on Wheels Adopt -a-Route. This program provides more extensive services to the community , including meals with enhanced nutritional quality, free pet food, in -home safety assessments and sliding -scale payment options for those in need. Through the partnership, SCHHC auxiliary members and volunteers provided 5,500 meals to approximately 30 community members in FY 201 9. Again, in FY 2019, SCHHC partnered with the San Diego Food Bank (Food Bank) to support community members facing hunger . Throughout the year, the hospital donate d surplus food from its kitchen, as well as collected 480 pounds (lbs.) of food during the 2018 Holiday SuperFood Drive, for the Food Bank to distribute to San Diegans in need. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 137 New in FY 2019, SCHHC joined Sharp's systemwi de pilot partnership with 2 -1-1's CIE to better understand and address the SDOH that influence the h ealth and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH have a significant impact on the ability for community members to access care and maintain their health. SCHHC joined the CIE pilot partnership in order to provide more info rmed, holistic care to patients with SDOH needs, and to connect them directly to community resources specifically for those needs. More than 70 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and other social service agencies \u2014 use a n integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared community member records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and current use of community programs and services, and to make direct referra ls to critical, community -based resources. Beginning in summer 2019, SCHHC' s case manager and social worker received training on CIE as a tool to serve vulnerable patients in the acute care setting, including those patients experiencing food insecurity and homelessness. Metrics of this partnership, including demographic and utilization data, as well as volume and successful community referrals, are currently being collected and will help to assess the impact and value of the partnership at the end of its pi lot year in early summer 2020. SCHHC supports community health through a variety of sustainable food and food waste initiatives. The hospital purchases 40% of its produce from local sustainable farms ( a 20% increase from 2018, with a goal of 50 % of purch ases by July 20 20) to help reduce the number of deliveries coming from more than 250 miles outside of SDC . SCHHC is also committed to purchasing sustainable protein, hormone -free dairy and cage -free eggs. In addition, SCHHC saves an average of 45 lbs. of food each week by creating soup stock from unused vegetable scraps . Further, the hospital's on-site, certified organic fruit, vegetable and herb garden provides nutritious ingredients for the hospital's Mindful Caf\u00e9 , as well as serves as an educational tool to teach community members how to start an organic garden through free monthly gardening classes. FY 20 20 Plan SCHHC will do the following: Continue to administer Project HELP funds to those in need Continue to provide free flu vaccinations for co mmunity members at a variety of community sites Serve as a blood donation site in support of Sharp's systemwide blood drive effort In partnership with Meals on Wheels San Diego County, continue to administer the Sharp Coronado Hospital Auxiliary Meals on W heels Adopt -a-Route to provide daily meals and safety assessments for seniors in their homes Serve as a donation site for Sharp's annual holiday food drive to support the Food Bank Evaluate the impact of the pilot year of the Sharp -CIE partnership to info rm next steps in collaboration with community organizations to address SDOH Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 138 Continue sustainable food purchasing and food waste prevention efforts to support environmental health Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest in Health Care Careers Rationale references the findings of the SCHHC 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCHHC 2019 CHNAs identified education as one of 10 priority health conditions and SDOH affecting members of the communities served by SCHHC. According to the results of th e Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 31% of respondents ranked education, including access, health literacy, workforce development and economic mobility, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. According to participants in a focus group conducted during the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, when residents are unable to a chieve higher levels of education, individual and community health are impacted in the following ways: limited or low wage employment opportuni ties for those with low educational attainment; constant stress related to housing or food among families who are not economically secure, which contributes to poor health; and limited career mobility in low -wage jobs, creating little potential for promoti ons or higher wages. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, in 2018, there were 157,756 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 9% of all jobs countywide (SDWP, 2019). According to a 2017 report from the SDWP tit led San Diego's Priority Sectors: An Update on Labor Force and Training Needs , the health care industry in SDC experienced net employment growth of 40.4% between 2006 and 2016 \u2014 considerably higher than the growth rate in the state of California (27%) and the nation (21%) (SDWP, 2017). The report also found that health care employers identified registered nurses (RNs) , physicians and surgeons, and health technologists and technicians as the most difficult positions to fill. The most frequently cited reasons for hiring difficulties were lack of experience, small applicant pools, and insufficient non -technical skills (SDWP, 2017). According to SDWP, a major challenge faced by education and training programs in the health care sector is accommodating the number of clinical training hours required for students in California to become certified. In addition, the health care industry is facing significant changes due to uncertainty related to legislation and technology, as well as the growing demand for services to support California's aging population (SDWP, 2017). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 139 Total employment in California is projected to grow 10.7% between 2016 and 2026, reflecting an increase of 1.9 million jobs statewide over the decade. The health care and social assistance sector is expe cted to be the fastest growing industry in California, with 24.9% growth anticipated (California EDD, 2018). In its Employment Projections - 2018 -2028 report, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that health care support occupations and healt h care practitioners/ technical occupations will contribute about 30% of all new jobs and account for 18 of the 30 fastest growing occupations. Increased demand for health care services for an aging population and people with chronic conditions will drive much of the expected employment growth (BLS, 2019). As of 2018, SDC was one of 28 counties in California designated as a Registered Nurse Shortage Area by the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission (California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Registered Nurse Shortage Areas Update , 2019). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) projects that the demand for RNs in California will increase 71% by 2030 if current levels of health care are maintained. The report projects that California will need to hire an additional 26,270 nurses to meet the demand (BHW, 2018). According to forecasting performed by the Healthforce Center at the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ), the demand for primary care clinicians in California will increase 12% to 17% by 2030. These forecasts predict that the southern border region will experience some of the highest levels of clinician shortages in the state. UCSF recommends a comprehensive and holistic ta rgeted strategy to enhance the education pipeline, improve recruitment and retention, maximize the existing workforce, and leverage workforce data (UCSF, 2017 -2018). According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) titled California Physician Supply: Headed for a Drought?, the total supply of active patient care physicians in California declined slightly between 2013 and 2015, a trend that appears to be driven by the aging of the physician workforce. In SDC, nearly a quarter of practi cing physicians were ages 60 and older in 2015 (CHCF, 2018). The same report found that 32% of California's active patient care physicians were primary care physicians. In SDC, there were 112.3 specialty physicians practicing per 100,000 residents in 2015, compared to 49.8 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents (CHCF, 2018). According to a report from PolicyLink, a national research institute dedicated to advancing economic and social equity, building a diverse health care workforce in California \u2014 one that reflects the state's racial, ethnic and linguistic diversity \u2014 is a critical strategy for increasing access to culturally and linguistically appropriate services, eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities, improving the quality of care and re ducing preventable costs ( Building an Inclusive Health Workforce in California: A Statewide Policy Agenda, 2018 ). A report by the California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) titled Meeting the Demand for Health identified several strategies to re cruit and maintain California's health care workforce, including but not limited to: offer health career pipeline programs for students from low -income backgrounds; provide academic, advising and health career development support to underrepresented colleg e Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 140 students; expand educational programs that train students to provide health care in underserved communities and provide scholarships for low -income students (CFHWC, 2019). Objectives Collaborate with local schools, colleges and universities to provide opportunities for students to explore and train for a variety of health care professions Provide education and training for local and national health care professionals, including focus on the Planetree philosophy of patient -centered care Disseminate best practices in clinical research findings to the health care community FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 201 9, SCHHC provided training opportunities for more than 330 nursing students and approximately 40 ancillary students. Together, these students ded icated 45,500 hours on the SCHHC campus. Internships were completed by students from a variety of schools, including Azusa Pacific University, Brightwood College, California College San Diego, Concorde Career College, Keck Graduate Institute, Lake Erie Col lege of Osteopathic Medicine, National University (NU), Pima Medical Institute, Point Loma Nazarene University, Roseman University of Health Sciences, San Diego Mesa College, Sodexo Dietetic Internships, Southwestern College, The George Washington Universi ty, Touro University, University of San Diego (USD), Walden University and Western University of Health Sciences. In addition, SCHHC continued to partner with Midwestern University at Glendale, Arizona, to provide physician -led mentorship opportunities for medical students, serving 24 students in FY 201 9. Further, in November, an SCHHC team member provided a lecture on clinical aromatherapy to 12 NU nursing students, while in March and April, an SCHHC clinical informatics expert provided three lectures on t he use of electronic health records to approximately 40 Master of Science in Health Care Informatics students at USD. The Planetree philosophy of care upholds that care should be organized first and foremost around the needs of the patient. In 2007, SCHHC became California's first Planetree designated hospital and is one of only three hospitals worldwide to have maintain ed this designation for each of the past 12 years . In 2017, NU's School of Health and Human Services achieved Planetree Silver Recognition, making it the first academic institution in the world to be recognized by Planetree. Since September 2018, SCHHC has supported NU's efforts to integrate the Planetree model of patient -centered care into its student training curriculum by providing internship opportunities for the school's nursing students. As two Planetree recognized organizations, SCHHC and NU serve as a global model for other academic -practice partnerships, while exposure to a Planetree designated hospital in action h elps give students a competitive advantage for entering the health care profession. In FY 2019, SCHHC share d its expertise on the Planetree philosophy of care , as well as other innovative knowledge , with community health care professionals throughout the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 141 U.S. In October, team members provided several presentations at the annual Planetree International Conference on Patient -Centered Care, including: Creating a Culture of Rounding to Engage Patients, Families and Team Members; Fantastic Four: Acupuncture, Ma ssage, Aromatherapy, Healing Touch - Superpowers that Transform Patients' Experience and Satisfaction; How to Wow: Making Clinical Experiences Less \"Clinical\"; Making Human Connections Through an Evidence -based Music Therapy Program; Lights, Camera, Action : The Making of a Planetree Video; Building a Pipeline of Community, Patient and Family Advisors; and Community Wellness Fair: Your Passport to Health. In April, hospital leadership participated on the executive leadership panel at the Southern California & San Diego Healthcare Financial Management Association Chapter's 4th Annual Women's Event in Newport Beach, CA. Designed specifically for women health care professionals and leaders, the event panel provided 500 attendees with insights from executive lea ders into the biggest industry challenges seen today and projected for the next five to 10 years. In September, hospital leadership presented at the California Hospital Association's annual Disaster Planning for Hospitals Conference in Pasadena, CA. The pr esentation highlighted the role of an executive leader during a disaster response and reached nearly 1,000 hospital emergency preparedness coordinators throughout the state. Further, in October, a member of SCHHC's clinical informatics team presented on de livering person -centered care with the electronic health record to 65 attendees of the Cerner Health Conference 2019 in Kansas City, Missouri. SCHHC also educated approximately 150 community health professionals about the prevention of facility -acquired infections through a poster presentation , titled Modeling the Cost Savings from a Multipronged Approach to Minimize Antibiotic -Associated Diarrhea and C. Difficile Infections at Sharp Coronado Hospital, at the 2018 Hospital Quality Institute Conference in October. In addition, SCHHC continued to participate in the CDPH HAI/ASP Subcommittee, which holds monthly teleconferences to develop toolkits designed to aid long -term care facilities in the formation of an ASP, following requirements that took effect in January 2017. SCHHC also shares resources about its own long-term care ASP on the CDPH website to help other facilities establish similar programs . In FY 2019, SCHHC provided free hospital tours to expose local and international health professionals and s tudents to a day at a local hospital in action. Tours were provided to nursing students from NU, nursing students from Korea, nurses from Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, and Planetree members from the Auckland District Health Board New Zealand . In FY 2019, SCHH C provided a variety of professional development education and opportunities for students in grades K -12. In March, SCHHC leadership spoke to 15 community Girl Scouts about women in leadership roles, including career paths and the importance of education a nd self -motivation. SCHHC also shared information about Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 142 careers in the medical field at two student career fairs in FY 2019, including Coronado High School (CHS) in March, and Feaster Charter School in April. SCHHC continued to host ninth and 10th grade students from Health Sciences High and Middle College (HSHMC). HSHMC students visit ed SCHHC once a week to shadow staff in a range of hospital departments and observe health care in a real -world setting. During the 201 9 school year, this included rotations in the departments of physical therapy, clinical nutrition, emergency, laboratory, radiology, respiratory, cardiovascular, pharmacy, medical/surgical, pre -anesthesia, spiritual care, wound care and long -term care. Students also learned about the Planetree philosophy of patient -centered care at SCHHC as well as received instruction on career ladder development and job requirements for a career in health care. In 201 9, nine HSHMC students dedicated nearly 1,950 hours of learning on the SCHHC campus. With funding from a state health science grant, SCHHC continued the CHS - SCHHC Internship Partnership. In FY 201 9, 10 students in grades 10 through 12 from CHS' Advanced Sports Medicine program spent 345 hours rotating through various hospital departments , including laboratory, emergency, physical therapy, radiology, medical/surgical and long -term care. This unique learning experience allowed students to observe real -world application of the skills they learned in the classroom and explore the range of pot ential career paths available in health care. FY 20 20 Plan SCHHC will do the following: Continue to collaborate with colleges and universities on internships, externships and other professional training opportunities for students Continue to participate in the HSHMC program by offering learning experiences for ninth and 10th grade students Continue to collaborate with CHS to provide learning experiences for students in grades 10 through 12 Provide hospital tours and presentations t o educate community health care professionals about the Planetree philosophy of patient -centered care Continue to share best practices from clinical research studies with the larger health care community Conduct clinical trials to improve patient care and outcomes Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 143 SCHHC Program and Service Highlights 24-hour emergency services with non-urgent online reservations available Acute care Advanced liver care and hepatology, including clinical trials, MARS\u00ae treatment for liver dialysis, and joint liver transpla ntation program with UC San Diego Health Care Partner Program Classes, events and physician referral through 1 -800-82-SHARP FollowMyHealth\u00ae, a secure on line patient website that gives patients convenient, 24 - hour access to their personal health information Heart and lung services, including electrocardiogram Home health, including home infusion services54 Hospice55 Imaging services, including computed tomo graphy scan, (MRI) , mammography and ultrasound Inpatient hospice unit Integrative therapies, including acupuncture, clinical aromatherapy and massage Intensive Care Unit Laboratory services Long -term care at Villa Coronado Skilled Nursing Facility, accredited by the Joint Commission Mindful Caf\u00e9, offering healthy and nutritious food options for patients, families, staff and community members Nutrition counseling Orthopedics, including Radiostereometric Analysis, and robotic and total joint replacement surger ies recognized by He althGrades and certified by The Joint Commission Online appointment scheduling for emergency care, mammograms, physical therapy, laboratory services, integrative spa therapies and fitness services Payne Family Outpatient Pavilion, including robotic surgery, endoscopy suite with endoscopic ultrasound, and dedicated imaging and women's services suite, providing 3D mammography, DEXA scanning and ultrasound Pathology services Pharmacy, including a prescript ion medication disposal kiosk, Community Pharmacy Travel Clinic and free delivery throughout Coronado and the Cays Rehabilitation services, including sports medicine, and occupational, physical, and speech therapies Sharp Coronado Hospital Auxiliary and Meals on Wheels Adopt -a-Route Senior community wellness and educational services Sewall Healthy Living Center, providing integrative spa therapies, rehabilitation and fitness programs Stroke care, nationally certified as Acute Stroke Ready by The Joint Com mission Subacute services Surgical services 54 Provided through Sharp Memorial Hospital Home Health Agency . 55 Provided through Sharp HospiceCare .

In partnership with local nonprofit License to Freedom, Sharp Grossmont recruits qualified high school seniors from San Diego's East County who are bilingual in English and either Arabic, Farsi, Kurdish, Turkish or Dari. During the program, students shadow nurses in various departments from acute care to women's health to administration. At daily meet-and-greet luncheons, students explore nursing programs and degrees, and the processes for pursuing each educational track with students from local universities. The program culminates with students presenting research projects that address current local community health needs. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 145 Section 6 Sharp Grossmont Hospital You can change the community by being fully present and engaged in it. The community are its people and therefore it reflects the collective value of the group. Influence positively and shape the future . \u2014 Scott Evans, Chief Executive Officer, Sharp Grossmont Hospital Fiscal Year ( FY) 2019 Community Benefit Program Highlights Sharp Grossmont Hospital (SGH) provided $146,439,047 in community benefit in FY 2019. See Table 25 for a summary of unreimbursed costs based on the categories identified in Senate Bill (SB 697), and Figure 19 for the distribution of SGH's community benefit among those categories. Table 25: Economic Value of Community Benefit Provided Sharp Grossmont Hospital \u2014 FY 201 9 56 Methodology for calculating shortfalls in public programs is based on Sharp's payor -specific cost -to-charge ratios, which are derived from the c ost accounting system, offset by the actual payments received. 57 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for ser vices at the time the services were rendered. 58 \"Vulnerable popula tions\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children 's Services Program, or county costs may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits plus costs for supplies, materials and other purchased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of providing services. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providin g the program or service.

In FY 2018, the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid S ervices approved a Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for th e time period of January 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019 . This resulted in recognition of net supplemental revenues for SGH totaling $ 31.5 million in FY 201 9. This reimbursement helped offset prior year s' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 201 9 understate the true unreimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year . Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations included van transportation for p atients to and from medical appointments; comprehensive prenatal clinical and social services to low -income, low -literacy women with Medi -Cal benefits; financial and other support to Neighborhood Healthcare; Project HELP, which provides funding for specifi c needs (e.g., medications, etc.) to assist lower -income patients ; flu vaccination clinics for vulnerable adults, including seniors; contribution of time to Stand Down for Homeless Veterans, Mama's Kitchen, Promises2Kids, Feeding San Diego (FSD) and the San Diego Food Bank (Food Bank); the Sharp Humanitarian Shortfall in Medi -Cal 26.0% Shortfall in Medicare 64.6%County Medical Services 0.1%Shortfall in CHAMPVA/TRICARE 1.6%Charity Care 4.8%Bad Debt 0.6%Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations 0.8%Other Benefits for the Broader Community 0.4% Health Research, Education and Training Programs 1.1%Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 147 Service Program; support for Meals on Wheels San Diego County; the provision of durable medical equipment (DME); the Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) program; and ot her assistance for vulnerable community members.

See Appendix A for a listing of Sharp HealthCare's (Sharp's ) community involvement. The category also incorporated costs associated with community benefit planning and administration, including community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation. Health Research, Education and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training for health care professionals, student and intern supervision, and time devoted to generalizable, health-related research projects that were made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community SGH is located at 5555 Grossmont Center Drive in La Mesa, ZIP code 91942. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 148 The community ser ved by SGH includes the entire east r egion of San Diego County (SDC), including the sub regional areas of Jamul, Spring Valley, Lemon Grove, La Mesa, El Cajon, Santee, Lakeside, Harbison Canyon, Crest, Alpine, Laguna -Pine Valley and Mountain Empire. Approximately 5% of the population lives in remote or rural areas of this region. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries in SDC. For SGH's 2019 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) was utilized to identify communities with greater health disparity within the county. The CNI identifies the severity of health disparity for every ZIP code in the United States (U.S.) based on specific barriers to health care access including education, income, culture/language, insurance and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates th e link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitalizations. According to the CNI, communities served by S GH with especially high need include , but are not limited to, Lemon Grove , Spring Valley and El Cajon.

Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 149 Description of Community Health In 2019, there were 88,400 residents ages 65 and older in SDC's east region, representing 16.6% of the total regional population. Between 2019 and 2024, it is anticipated that the east region's senior population will grow by 21.4%.61 In 2017, 13.7% of the east region population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The unemployment rate in SDC's east region was 8.2%, which was higher than the rate for SDC overall (6.8%). In addition, 7.0% of households received Supplemental Security Income (SSI), also higher than SDC overall (5.0%).62 According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7, or 14% of th e SDC population experienced food insecurity63 in 2017. An additional 1 in 5 San Diegans were food secure but relied on supplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget.64 In 2017, 11.4% of households in the east region participated in Suppleme ntal Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 20.6% of the population lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program. These rates were higher than SDC overall (7.2% of households participated in SNAP benefits while 19.9% of househo lds lived at or below 138% of the FPL). 62 Please refer to Table 26 for SNAP participation and eligibility in the east region.

SGH's 2019 CHNA was significantly influenced by the collaborative HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process and findings. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 152 Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process and findings. In addition, this year SGH completed its most current implementation strategy \u2014 a description of SGH programs designed to address the priority health needs identified in the 201 9 CHNA. The most recent CHNA and implementation strategy for SGH are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/ health -needs -assessments.cfm . Through the SG H 201 9 CHNA, the following priority health needs were identified for the communities served by SG H (listed in alphabetical order) : Access to Health Care Aging Concerns Behavioral Health ( including Substance Use) Cancer Chronic Health Conditions (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) , Diabetes and Obesity) Community and Social Support Economic Security Education Homelessness and Housing Instability Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy Uninten tional Injury and Violence The following pages d etail SG H programs, activities and services that specifically address aging concerns, cancer, chronic health conditions, community and social support (these programs also help address access to health care, economic security and homelessness and housing), education , maternal and prenatal care, including high - risk pregnancy, and unintentional injury. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. SGH provides behavioral health services to SDC's east region through clinical programs for adults and older adults, including individuals living with psychosis, depre ssion, grief, anxiety, traumatic stress and other disorders. SGH also provides a dedicated psychiatric assessment team in the emergency department (ED) and acute care as well as hospital -based outpatient programs that serve individuals dealing with a varie ty of behavioral health issues. Beyond these clinical services, SGH lacks the resources to comprehensively meet the need for community education and support in behavioral health (including substance use). Consequently, the community education and support elements of behavioral health care are addressed through the programs and services provided through Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use services in SDC. Please refer to Section 11 of this report for details on those programs. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 153 Obesity is addressed through general nutrition and exercise education and resources provided at SGH. There are also programs that address a healthy lifestyle as part of care for CVD , diabetes and other health issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. In addition, Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Group clinics throughout SDC \u2014 including SDC's east region \u2014 provide structured weight management and health education programs to community members, such as smoking cessation and stress management; long -term support for weight management and fat loss; and personalized weight -loss programs. For additional details on SGH programs that specifically address the needs identified in the 2019 CHNA, please refer to SGH's implementation strategy available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 201 9 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s), and FY 20 20 Plan. Identified Community Need: Education, Support and Scr eening for Stroke Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified chronic conditions (including CVD and cerebrovascular diseases/stroke) as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SGH. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of ED visits for stroke in SDC increased 11.0% from 2014 to 2016, w ith the most significant increases in individuals ages 27 to 44 (20.0%) and those identified as \"other\" race (28.9%). Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNA identified numerous barriers to care for chro nic conditions, including: limited access to healthy food; lack of transportation; physical limitations or limited mobility; high health care costs; economic insecurity; low health literacy; poor health behaviors, such as unhealthy diet or lack of physical activity; medication management; unsafe neighborhoods; and unstable or complete lack of housing. Participants in the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group conducted as part of the Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified the following hospital discharge challen ges and barriers for patients, including those with chronic conditions: transportation support; a shortage of recuperative or respite care options; a lack of short -term caregivers and in -home support services; and a need for a streamlined process from the hospital to the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency ( HHSA ) for those who qualify for wraparound support. In 2017, cerebrovascular diseases (including stroke) were the third leading cause of death for SDC's east region. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 154 In 2017, there were 226 deaths due to stroke in SDC's east region. The region's age-adjusted death rate due to stroke was 40.0 per 100,000 population. This rate was the second highest among all SDC regions and was higher than the HP2020 target of 34.8 deaths per 100,000.69 In 2017, there were 1,150 hospitalizations due to stroke in SDC's east region. The region's age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations for stroke was 199.0 per 100,000 population - the second highest among all SDC regions. In 2017, there were 448 stroke -related ED visits in SDC's east region, a 14.9% increase from 2016. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits was 78.3 per 100,000 population. According to 2018 CHIS data, an estimated 30.4% of east region adults were obese, 14.5% were current smokers, 12.1% reported that they were not physically active at all, and 20.0% reported that fresh fruits and vegetables were only sometimes affordable in their neighborhood. The rates for each of these activities were higher in the east region than SDC overall. According to the Cente rs for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), more than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke each year, and strokes are responsible for approximately one out of every 20 deaths (CDC, 2017). The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NI NDS) reports that 25% of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within five years (NINDS, 2019). The CDC estimates that up to 80% of strokes are preventable through the recognition of early signs/symptoms and the elimination of stroke risk factors. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include choosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate -intensity aerobic physical activity each week, refr aining from or quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake (CDC, 2018). Objective Provide stroke education, support and screening services for the east region of SDC FY 201 9 Report of Activities The Joint Commission and American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) has certified SGH's Stroke Center as a Primary Stroke Center (recertified in June 2016). The program is nationally recognized for its outreach, education and thorou gh screening procedures, as well as documentation of its success rate. SGH is a recipient of the AHA/ASA 's Get With The Guidelines\u00ae (GWTG) \u2014 Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award for excellence in stroke care as well as the 69 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Cen ter for Health Statistics (NCHS) . Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2017. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all rankable causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile. \" (County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2019; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2017. National Vital Statistics Reports; vol. 68 no 6. Hyattsville, Mary land: NCHS, 2019) . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 155 Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation. The AHA/ASA's GWTG is a national effort focused on ensuring the use of evidence -based therapies to improve outcomes for stroke patients. The AHA/ASA's Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation focuses on improving the timeliness of intr avenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t -PA) administration to eligible patients. In FY 201 9, the SGH Stroke Center provided stroke education and screenings to more than 750 community members at 11 community events in SDC's east region. Education includ ed stroke risk factors, warning signs and appropriate interventions, including arrival at the hospital within early onset of symptoms. The SGH Stroke Center also provided nearly 200 attendees with blood pressure checks or stroke screenings, during which th e team identified risk factors, provided education and advised behavior modification, including smoking cessation, weight loss and stress reduction. Community events and locations included: San Ysidro Health's Chaldean & Middle -Eastern Social Services' Fam ily Health and Wellness Fair at Crystal Ballroom in El Cajon; the 2019 Love Your Heart event \u2014 an annual event in which organizations from across the U.S. and Mexico join together to provide free blood pressure screenings \u2014 at San Diego Oasis; Spring into Healthy Living senior health and technology fair at McGrath Family YMCA; ECSSP's annual East County Senior Health Fair at the La Mesa Community Center; the annual La Mesa Safety Fair hosted by the La Mesa Police Department and Heartland Fire and Rescue Dep artment; the San Diego East County Chamber of Commerce's Health Fair Saturday events at Grossmont Center and Parkway Plaza; and the annual Lakeside Firefighters Open House. In April, the SGH Stroke Center provided stroke education and risk factor screeni ngs with pulse checks to more than 100 attendees at the Sharp Women's Health Conference held at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina. Educational topics included types of strokes, how to identify risk factors, strategies for risk reduction and recognizing symptoms of stroke. In addition, the SGH Stroke Center provided education to nearly 30 certified nursing assistant students at San Diego City College. Education focused on stroke codes, general stroke information, and B.E. F.A.S.T. (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arms, Speech, Time) \u2014 an easy technique to detect and enhance responsiveness to a stroke. During Stroke Awareness Month i n May, Sharp's systemwide stroke program participated in Stroke Awareness Day at the Padres, held at Petco Park. This annual event is organized by the San Diego County Stroke Consortium, the County of San Diego HHSA , the San Diego Padres and other key partners to promote stroke prevention, awareness and recovery, as well as celebrate stroke survivors. During the baseball game, Sharp offered stroke and blood pressure screenings, education about the warning signs of stroke and how to respond using B.E. F.A.S.T . Giveaway s were provided throughout the evening, while stroke education was displayed on the Jumbo tron to the entir e stadium of nearly 30,000 community members. The SGH Outpatient Rehabilitation Department continued to offer a weekly Stroke Communication Support Group for stroke survivors and their family members with a Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 156 focus on stroke and brain injury survivors with aphasia or other speech or language difficulties. Topics included games to improve visual skills, language stimulation, listening activities and social interaction. The support group is sponsored by Young Enthusiastic Stroke Survivors, a community network that offers social, recreational and support group activities to st roke survivors and their families and caregivers. An average of six community members attended each session in FY 2019 . In addition, SGH actively participated in the quarterly San Diego C ounty Stroke Consortium, a collaborative effort with other SDC hospitals to improve stroke care and discuss issues impacting stroke care in SDC. SGH also continued its 1 4-year collaboration with the County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to provide data for the SDC stroke registry. FY 20 20 Plan SGH Stroke Center will do the following: Provide stroke screening and education at events in the east region of SDC Provide education for individuals with identified stroke risk factors Continu e to participate in Stroke Awareness Day at the Padres Provide stroke education and screenings at the Sharp Women's Health Conference Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide stroke education and resources to residents in th e city's nine districts Offer a stroke support group in conjunction with the hospital's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department Continue to participate in the San Diego County Stroke Consortium Continue to provide data to the SDC stroke registry Provide commu nity members with at least one physician speaking event on stroke care and prevention Identified Community Need: Heart and Vascular Disease Education and Screening Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most rece nt SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified chronic conditions, including C VD, as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SGH. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 157 Data analysis in the SGH 2019 CHNA revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to CVD in communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges within SDC's east region, such as El Cajon and Spring Valley.70 According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of ED visits for coronary heart disease (CHD) in SDC increased 35.3% from 2014 to 2016, with the most significant increases in individuals ages 45 to 64 (41.9%) and those identified as Asian/Pacific Islander (55.1%). In addition, heart disease was the seco nd leading cause of death in SDC in 2016. According to data presented in the SGH 2019 CHNA, in 2017, the top three inpatient CVD diagnoses at SGH were classified as hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and heart failure, while the top three CVD dia gnoses for ED visits were classified as hypertension, CAD, and undiagnosed prior heart attack. Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions such as CVD, including: lack of access to healthy food; transportation; physical limitations or limited mobility; high healthcare costs; economic insecurity; low health literacy; poor health behaviors, such as unhealthy diet or minimal physical activity; medicati on management; unsafe neighborhoods; and unstable or complete lack of housing. Participants in the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group conducted as part of the Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified the following hospital discharge challenges and barriers fo r patients, including those with chronic conditions: transportation support; a shortage of recuperative or respite care options; a lack of short -term caregivers and in -home support services; and a need for a streamlined process from the hospital to the Cou nty of San Diego Department of Health and Human Services for those who qualify for wraparound support. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 56.0% of respondents ranked CHD among the top five he alth conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. In 2017, there were 858 deaths due to diseases of the heart in SDC's east region. The region's age -adjusted death rate due to heart disease was 144.0 per 100,000 population. This was higher than the age -adjusted death rate for SDC overall (126.2 deaths per 100,000 population) and the HP2020 target (103.4 deaths per 100,000 population).69 In 2017 , there were 1,016 hospitalizations for CHD in SDC's east region. The age - adjusted rate of hospitalization for CHD was 176.1 per 100,000 population, which is higher than the age -adjusted rate for SDC overall (157.6 per 100,000 population ). In 2017, there were 253 ED visits for CHD in SDC's east region. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits was 44.7 per 100,000 population, the highest among all county regions and higher than the age -adjusted rate for SDC overall (35.3 per 100,000 population). According to 2017 -2018 CHIS data, 8.7% of adults living in SDC's east region indicated that they were ever diagnosed with heart disease, which is higher than SDC overall (6.5%). 70 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018; California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development via SpeedTrack, Inc., 2017 . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 158 Data from the 2017 -2018 CHIS indicated that 31.9% of adults living in SDC's e ast region had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, higher than SDC overall (27.5%) and the state of California (29.4%). According to the CDC, heart disease (including CHD, hypertension and stroke) is the leading cause of death for both men and wo men, and kills approximately 630,000 people each year (CDC, 2017). Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. including African Americans, Hispanics, and w hites. For Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Alaska Natives, heart disease is second only to cancer (CDC, 2017). In 2018, the AHA reported that CHD is responsible for 1 in 7 deaths in the U.S., killing nearly 370,000 people each year. Death rates and actual numbers of deaths from CHD decreased significantly between 2005 and 2015, but disease burden and risk factors remain high. According to blood pressure guidelines championed by the AHA and the American College of Cardiology, 45.6% of U.S. adults now have hypertension (AHA, 2018) . According to the AHA, it may be possible to prevent heart disease, stroke, and CVD by not smoking, engaging in daily physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet and body weight, and controlling cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar (AHA, 2018). Objectives Provide heart and vascular education and screening services for the community, with an emphasis on adults, women and seniors Share expertise in cardiovascular care with community health care professionals through participation in professional conferences and collaboratives Participate in programs to improve the care and outcomes of individuals with heart and vascular disease FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 201 9, SGH's Cardiac Rehabilitation Department provided education and support to patients and community members impacted by congestive heart failure (CHF). A free, monthly CHF class and support group provided nearly 100 individuals with a supportive environment to discuss various topics about living well with CHF. A free Heart and Vascular Risk Factors Education class was offered twice a month to individuals who were hospitalized within the last six months due to select heart conditions, reaching more than 310 individuals . In addition, SGH's C ardiac Rehabilitation Department provided two community lectures about risk factors for heart disease as well as information about exercise to approximately 25 attendees from the Better Breathers Club and SGH Senior Resource Center. SGH's Cardiac Trainin g Center and Cardiac Rehabilitation Departments participated in a variety of community events throughout San Diego in FY 201 9. Together, they offered community members free blood pressure screenings, cardiopulmonary resuscitation Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 159 (CPR) demonstrations, and cardiac health education and resources, including prevention, symptom recognition, evaluation and treatment. Events included Celebrando Latinas, AHA San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk and Health Fair Saturday at Grossmont Center. Throughout the year, SGH prov ided expert speakers on heart disease and heart failure at professional conferences and events. This included SGH's 10th annual Heart and Vascular Conference in October, a two -day event at the US Grant Hotel where more than 350 health care professionals \u2014 including physicians, nurses and allied health workers caring for patients with CVD \u2014 received education on advances in cardiovascular care. In November and May, SGH participated in the 1 4th and 1 5th semiannual meetings of Southern California VOICe (Vascu lar Outcomes Improvement Collaborative), which included more than 30 regional vascular physicians, nurses, epidemiologists, scientists and research personnel working together to collect and analyze vascular data in an effort to improve patient care. SGH sh ared its expertise on the use of data processes to improve outcomes, compliance to clinical standards, and care. SGH continued to participate in programs to improve the care and outcomes of individuals with heart and vascular disease. To help improve car e for acutely ill patients in SDC, SGH provided data on STEMI (ST -elevation myocardial infarction or acute heart attack) to the County of San Diego EMS and participated in the quarterly County of San Diego Cardiac Advisory C ommittee for STEMI. Additionally , SGH provided its Peripheral Vascular Disease Rehabilitation Program to provide education and coaching on exercise, diet and medication to keep patients \u2014 particularly low -income patients \u2014 at the highest functional level. The program is partially funded by donations to the Grossmont Hospital Foundation to help defray the cost for patients with limited resources. Throughout FY 201 9, SGH -affiliated cardiologists and an electrophysiologist shared heart -related information with local news outlets, including : KUSI News; Bustle, an online women's magazine; Mic, a digital media company; and The East County Californian. Topics included the elevated risk of heart attack on Christmas Eve, heart rhythm problems and treatments, heart disease, and the impact of coffee on arterial health. SGH's cardiac team is committed to supporting future health care leaders through active participation in student training and internship programs. In FY 201 9, the team spent more than 500 hours mentoring more than 35 students from Az usa Pacific University (APU), Pima Medical Institute, San Diego State University (SDSU), University of California (UC) San Diego, Grossmont College, National University (NU) and Western University of Health Sciences, including students with an int erest in a career as a nurse, cardiovascular tech nologist or x -ray technologist . New in FY 2019, SGH's Cardiac Rehabilitation Department began offering an internship program for exercise physiology and kinesiology students. The program provides Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 160 students with comprehensive, hands -on practical and technical experience in delivering care to cardiac rehabilitation patients. Upon completion, students are proficient in obtaining vitals, prescribing exercise, providing patient education and modifying pa tient risk factors. The internship is approximately 8 to 12 weeks in length but may be adjusted to meet school requirements. Through the program , SGH's Cardiac Rehabilitation Department dedicated approximately 185 hours to two Exercise Physiology Master's program students from Point Loma Naz arene University (PLNU) FY 20 20 Plan will do the following: Provide a free monthly CHF class and support group Provide free bimonthly Heart and Vascular Risk Factor Education classes Provide cardiac and vascular risk factor education and screening at community events Provide one cardiac health lecture and a Cardiovascular Expo for community members Pursue additional research opportunities to benefit patients and community members As invited, offer educational speakers to the professional community on topics such as performance improvements in CHF and acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular treatment options Provide a conference on heart and vascular disease for community physicians and other health care professionals Continue to provide student learning opportunities, including an internship module for exercise physiology and kinesiology students Continue to provide data on STEMI to the County of San Diego EMS and participate in the County of San D iego Cardiac Advisory C ommittee Continue to provide the Peripheral Vascular Disease Rehabilitation Program Conduct three live, low sodium cooking demonstrations and provide recipes for patients and community members affected by CHF Identified Community Need: Diabetes Education , Prevention and Support Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified chronic conditions, including diabetes, as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SGH. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 161 Data analysis in the SGH 2019 CHNA revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to Type 2 diabetes in communities within SDC's east region facing greater socioeconomic challenges, such as El Cajon and Spring Valley.70 According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of ED visits for diabetes in SDC increased 7.2% from 2014 to 2016, with the most significant increases in individuals ages 27 to 44 (13.9%) and those identified as b lack/African American (15.1%). According to data presented in the SGH 2019 CHNA, in 2017, the top three ED and inpatient Type 2 diabetes diagnoses at SGH included Type 2 diabetes (uncomplicated), Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease, and Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 51.0% of respondents ranked diabetes (Types 1 and 2) among the top five health conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions such as diabetes, including: lack of access to healthy food; lack of transportation; physical limitations or limited mobility; high health care costs; economic insecurity; low health literacy; poor health behaviors, such as unhealthy diet or lack of physical activity; medication manag ement; unsafe neighborhoods; and unstable or complete lack of housing. Participants in the Sharp diabetes educator focus group conducted as part of the SGH 2019 CHNA process identified several barriers to effective diabetes management, including: challeng es associated with pharmacies, insurance policies and finances (including co -pays, loss of income due to time off work and the cost of transportation to medical appointments); fear related to job loss or immigration status; and lack of knowledge or cultura l beliefs about food and illness. The Sharp diabetes educator focus group also identified the following barriers associated with diabetes management: isolation and loneliness; stigma, particularly when it is reinforced by physicians; lack of support from family members; and difficulty managing co -morbidities including cardiovascular issues, kidney issues, neuropathy, and vision issues. In 2017, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in SDC 's east region. In 2017, there were 158 deaths due to diabetes in SDC's east region. The region's age-adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 26.4 per 100,000 population, higher than the overall SDC age -adjusted rate (21.5 deaths per 100,000 population).69 In 2017, there were 982 hospitalizations due to diabetes in SDC's east region. The age-adjusted rate of hospitalizations for diabetes was 189.6 per 100,000 population. This rate was the highest among al l SDC regions and higher than the age -adjusted rate of hospitalization for SDC overall (122.9 per 100,000 population). In 2017, there were 1,050 diabetes -related ED visits in SDC's east region. The age - adjusted rate of diabetes -related ED visits was 202.2 per 100,000 population. This was the third highest rate among all SDC regions and was higher than the age - adjusted rate for SDC overall (165.0 per 100,000 population). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 162 According to 2018 CHIS data, 11.7% of adults living in SDC's east region indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was slightly higher than SDC overall (9.8%) and the state of California (10.1%). Diabetes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 25.0% of east region adults over 65 reporting that they had ever be en diagnosed with diabetes. According to 2018 CHIS data, 17.6% of residents in the east region had been told by their doctor that they have pre - or borderline diabetes, slightly higher than residents in SDC overall (17.3%). A study by the University of Cal ifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Health Policy Research estimated that 13 million adults in California (46%) have prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes, while another 2.5 million (9%) have already been diagnosed with diabetes (UCLA Center for Health Po licy Research, 2016). Data presented by the United Health Foundation (UHF) indicates that, in 2017, diabetes prevalence in California was highest among American Indian/Alaska Natives (24.8%), followed by individuals of other race -Hispanic blac ks (14.8%) and Hispanics (12.1%) (UHF, 2018). According to the CDC, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than tripled in the last 20 years (CDC, 2019). According to the CDC's 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report , 87.5% of adults diagnosed with diabetes were overweight or obese. To prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, the CDC recommends lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthier and gett ing regular physical activity. The CDC estimates that 30.3 million people in the U.S. have diabetes. Of those individuals, 1 in 4 is not aware they have the disease (CDC, National Diabetes Statistics Report , 2017). The CDC identif ies diabetes as the leading cause of kidney failure, non -traumatic lower -limb amputations and new cases of blindness among adults (CDC, 2017). Objectives Provide diabetes education, prevention and support in the east region of SDC Collaborate with community organizations and projects to provide diabetes education to SDC's vulnerable populations Participate in local and national professional conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community FY 201 9 Report of Activities The SGH Diabetes Education Program is recognized by the American Diabetes Association ( ADA) for meeting national standards for excellence and quality in diabetes education covering blood sugar monitoring, medication and nutritional co unseling as well as insulin pump and other device training. The program is led by certified diabetes educators, who provide individuals and their support systems with the skills needed to successfully self -manage various conditions, including prediabetes, gestational diabetes Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 163 (diabetes developed during pregnancy) , and Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes . Small group and one -on-one education options are offered in English and Spanish. In FY 201 9, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program (Sharp's systemwide diabetes program) offered diabetes education and support to approximately 1,000 attendees at the Sharp Women's Health Conference. This included diabetes risk assessments using the ADA's Diabetes Risk Test questionnaire as well as resources on the differen t types of diabetes ; diabetes prevention; signs, symptoms and complications of diabetes; the connection between diabetes and CVD; nutrition and reading food labels; exercise; medication and diabetes self -management. Also during the conference, a Sharp diabetes expert presented on the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes, including helpful diets, physical activity and the power of lifestyle change . In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided fundraising and team participation for the San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk at Balboa Park in September . The Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided education to various community groups throughout the year. In collaboration with the SGH Senior Resource Center in November , the program provided a lecture on diabetes and the power of lifestyle change to more than 10 senior community members at the GHD's James G. Stieringer Conference Center . The SGH Diabetes Education Program also provided a Heart Healthy Cooking event for approximately 15 communi ty members at Temple Emanu -El in February. Lecture topics included food choices, reading food labels, snack ideas, sodium intake, and understanding and decreasing fat in one's diet. In addition, in June the SGH Diabetes Education Program provided a lecture on diabetes and nutrition to approximately 100 community members at the Grossmont Center Health Fair. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to collaborate with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) to provide education to patients with diab etes at multiple FHCSD sites , including those in the east region , through the organization's Diabetes Management Care Coordinati on Project (DMCCP). Through DMCCP , Sharp's diabetes educators provide weekly group health and nutrition education, healthy cooking demonstrations, physical activity classes and one -on-one support from a nurse practitioner to the clinics' diabetes patients . In addition, project \"graduates\" offer peer support and education to current enrollees in both English and Spanish. The project monitors participants' physical activity as well as their A1C and blood glucose levels, which it has proven to successfully mai ntain and lower. At FHCSD's Lemon Grove , Grossmont Spring Valley and El Cajon sites, Sharp diabetes educators provided 14 lectures to more than 170 community members. Topics included creating an active lifestyle; nutrition , including the effect of food gro ups and serving sizes on blood sugar levels; healthy eating; and diabetes risk factors, symptoms, trea tment, self -management and goal setting. In 2019, 32.5% of those enrolled in DMCCP saw a decrease in their overall A1C results. The Sharp Diabetes Educat ion Program is an affiliate of the California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program's Sweet Success Program, which provides comprehensive technical support and education to medical personnel and community liaisons to Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 164 promote improved outcomes for high -risk pregna nt women with diabetes. As an affiliate, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program teaches underserved pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with Type 1, Type 2 or gestational diabetes how to manage their blood sugar levels. In collaboration with community c linics, in FY 201 9, the team provided these patients with a variety of education and resources to support a healthy pregnancy. Topics covered gestational diabetes statistics; new diagnostic criteria; treatment and management of blood glucose levels; goals for blood sugar lev els before and after a meal; insulin requirements; self -care practices; nutrition and meal planning; exercise and weight management; monitoring fetal movement; and the risks and complications of uncontrolled diabetes. Clinic patients also received logbooks to track and manage their blood sugar levels. In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program evaluated patients' management of their blood sugar levels and collaborated with community clin ics' obstetrician -gynecologists to prevent complications. At SGH , the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided services and education to more than 400 underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women with diabetes. Throughout the year, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to provide services and resources to m eet the needs of culturally diverse populations within SDC . For the east region, this included particular attention to the needs of the newly immigrated Iraqi Chaldean population . Educational resources included How to Live Healthy With Diabetes; What You N eed to Know About Diabetes; All About Blood Glucose for People With Type 2 Diabetes; All About Carbohydrate Counting; Getting the Very Best Care for Your Diabetes; All About Insulin Resistance; All About Physical Activity With Diabetes; Gestational Diabete s Mellitus Seven -Day Menu Plan; Food Groups and Arabic language materials about pregnancy. Resources were provided in Arabic, Somali, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish, and food diaries and logbooks were distributed for community members to track their blood sugar levels. Live interpreter services were available in more than 200 languages via the Stratus Video Interpreting iPad application , and the program facilitated translation and other resources specifically addressing Chaldean cultural needs . Additionall y, Sharp team members received education regarding the different cultura l needs of diverse communities to improve the delivery of inclusive and culturally competent care. In FY 201 9, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program supported the professional health care community through participation in various conferences and meetings. . At the Liberty Station Conference Center in May, team members presented Obesity, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease to approximately 250 health professionals during Sharp's Obesity Crisis Conference. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program's presentation covered multiple topics, including: the history and prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in the U.S.; testing for diabetes; the link between diabetes, CV D and obesity; decreasing ris ks and weight management . In June, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program attended the ADA's 7 9th Scientific Sessions conference in San Francisco , California . The conference shared research advances to improve the lives of people with and affected by diabetes with more than 1 5,000 international attendees. In addition, in August , the Sharp Diabetes Education Program presented on the Use of Outcomes Data and M arketing Strategies to Sustain Diabetes Programs to Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 165 approximately 200 health professionals at th e American Association of Diabetes Educators' 201 9 Annual Conference in Houston, Texas. In November, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program hosted a diabetes conference for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, laboratorians, clinical and managerial leaders and other community health professionals interested in optimizing inpatient diabetes care. The conference provided 150 participants with specific tools and strategies for creating a culture that supports and encourages emerging therapeutic trends in glycemic management in a hospital setting. Topics included treating patients with Type 2 diabetes ; cardiovascular risk for patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes; new insulin products and their potential benefits; metabolism and weight loss in those using insulin ; automated insulin infusion algorithms ; and insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring. In addition, in FY 2019 the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided diabetes education \u2014 including the different types of diabetes, diagnoses, current technology and medication, and careers in diabetes education \u2014 to more than 20 nurse practitioner students at SDSU , as well as mentored two dietetic intern s from the San Diego Women, Infants , and Children (WIC) program. Lastly, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program pr esented on diabetes and exercise to approximately 10 students at PLNU School of Nursing's Health Promotion Center at the Church of the Nazarene in Mid-City, as well as provided diabetes education to approximately 10 APU nursing students. FY 20 20 Plan The SGH and Sharp Diabetes Education Program s will do the following: Provide community members with prediabetes and diabetes information at various community venues in SDC's east region Explore collaborations to assist and educate food insecure community members Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide diabetes education and resources to residents in the city's nine districts Explore collaboration with community organizations to provide diabetes education for community membe rs, including seniors and caregivers Continue to collaborate with FHCSD to provide education and resources to their patients with diabetes Continue to provide gestational diabetes services and resources to underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women, bot h at the hospital and in collaboration with community clinics Participate in Tour de Cure \u2014 the ADA's signature fundraising event to fight diabetes \u2014 as well as the San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk Maintain up -to-date resources to support community members wi th diabetes treatment and prevention, particularly foreign language and culturally appropriate resources for diverse populations Continue to participate in local and national professional conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and contro l with the broader health care community Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 166 Conduct educational symposiums for health care professionals focused on improving outpatient and inpatient diabetes care Continue to host a diabetes conference for health care professionals Explore collaborations w ith community service organizations that focus on diabetes prevention and care Partner with community physicians to help them im prove patient outcomes using technology, including insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors Identified Community Need: Health Education, Screening and Support for Aging Concerns Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs i dentified aging concerns as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SGH. Aging concerns are defined as those conditions that predominantly affect seniors \u2014 people who are 65 and older \u2014 such as Alzheimer's disease, P arkinson's disease, dementia, falls and limited mobility. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of inpatient discharge in SDC increased for Alzheimer's disease (35.1%) and dementia (16.3%) from 2014 to 2016. According to data presente d in the SGH 2019 CHNA, in 2017, seniors represented 59.4% of inpatient discharges for unintentional injury at SGH, with fall -related injuries occurring in 81.5% of those discharges. Data analyzed as part of the SGH 2019 CHNA indicated that seniors admitte d to SGH with a behavioral health diagnosis were more likely to have dementia (42.5%) when compared to all behavioral health inpatient discharges (18.5%). Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified the following health cond itions that impact older adults: Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, dementia, arthritis, loss of mobility, opioid misuse, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, depression, lung disease, obesity, and poor oral health. In addition, the focus groups identifie d the following social determinants of health (SDOH) that impact seniors: lack of accessible or reliable transportation options; difficulty accessing fresh food; social isolation and inadequate fami ly support; economic insecurity and environmental pollutan ts. According to the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 83% of respondents ages 65 and older ranked aging concerns among the top five conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. As part of the SG H 2019 CHNA, focus groups comprised of Sharp Senior Health Center staff and patients, as well as community members identified the following SDOH that impact seniors: few transportation options; lack of access to fresh food; social isolation and inadequate family support; economic insecurity; housing issues; and environmental pollutants, including sound. Participants indicated that these Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 167 issues contribute to a loss of independence, leading to increased stress, isolation, loneliness and poor mental health. Sharp senior health focus group participants suggested the following strategies for increasing health care access for seniors: establishing a centralized communication database so that patient information can be shared across health care systems; creating an d promoting programs to assist seniors with transportation to medical appointments and grocery stores; expanding meal delivery services; expanding behavioral health care options for Medi -Cal and Medicare patients; and increasing the availability of transla tors. In 2017, Alzheimer's disease was the fourth leading cause of death in SDC's east region for all age groups. In 2017, the top 10 leading causes of death among adults ages 65 and older in SDC's east region were (in rank order): diseases of the heart, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular diseases (including stroke), chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes, essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, accidents/unintentional injuries, Parkinson's disease, and flu/pneumonia. In 2017 , hospitalization rates among seniors in SDC's east region were higher than the east region's general population for all major causes, including cancer, hypertensive diseases, diseases of the heart, asthma, osteoarthritis, unintentional injuries, falls, st roke, diabetes and flu/pneumonia. The top three causes of ED utilization among SDC's east region residents ages 65 and older in 2017 were unintentional injuries, falls and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease /Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases. According to the CDC, 2.8 million older adults are treated in the ED for falls every year. One in five falls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones or a head injury, and each fall doubles the chance of falling again. These injuries may result in serious mobil ity issues and difficulty with everyday tasks or living independently. The direct medical costs for fall injuries are estimated at $31 billion annually (CDC, 2018). In 2015, more than 84,400 San Diegans ages 55 and over were living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), one quarter of whom lived in the east region. Between 2015 and 2030, the number of east region residents living with ADRD is projected to increase by 27.4% ( Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in San Diego County, Count y of San Diego HHSA, 2018). In 2017, 67.7% of the influenza hospitalizations and nine of the 14 influenza deaths in the east region occurred among residents ages 65 and older. The age -adjusted rate of influenza death among this group was 12.2 per 100,000, lower than the rate for seniors in SDC overall (16.2 per 100,000). According to the C alifornia Department of Aging (CDA), in 2019, 11.1% of SDC residents ages 60 and older were considered low -income, and 17.1% were eligible for Medi -Cal coverage. In addition, 17.5% of SDC seniors were identified as living alone (CDA, 2019). According to re search published in Health Affairs, an estimated 15 million family caregivers in the U.S. provide unpaid care for a loved one with dementia. Caregiver burden and fatigue can result in increased use of hospital and emergency services for dementia patients ( Slaboda et al, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 168 The same study identified the following as the biggest challenges facing family caregivers of individuals with dementia: dealing with memory loss and the disease's impact; handling the stress and emotional toll; having patience with their loved one; handling mood swings or behavior changes; and managing daily activities, including bathing, bathroom, dressing and meals (Slaboda et al, 2018). According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP ), more than 40 million people i n the U.S. act as unpaid caregivers to people ages 65 and older. More than 10 million of these caregivers are Millennials with separate full - or part - time jobs, and 1 in 3 employed Millennial caregivers earns less than $30,000 per year (AARP, 2018). Objectives Provide a variety of senior health education and screening programs Produce and mail quarterly activity calendars to community members Provide daily telephone reassurance/safety check calls to ensure the safety of homebound seniors and disable d adults in SDC's east region In collaboration with community partners, offer seasonal flu vaccination clinics at convenient locations for seniors and vulnerable adults in the community Serve as a referral resource to additional support services in the com munity for senior residents in SDC's east region Provide education and community resources to caregivers Maintain and grow partnerships with community organizations to expand community outreach and provide seniors and caregivers with updated information on available services and resources FY 2019 Report of Activities Sharp Senior Resource Centers meet the unique needs of seniors and their caregivers by connecting them to a variety of free and low -cost programs and services through email, phone and in -person consultations. The Sharp Senior Resource Centers' compassionate staff and volunteers provide personalized support and clear, accurate information regarding health education and screenings, community referrals and caregiver resources. In FY 2019, the SGH Senior Resource Center developed and mailed quarterly calendars of its programs and services to more than 6,700 households in SDC's east region. In addition, the SGH Senior Resource Center distributed more than 3,500 Vials of Life, which are small vinyl s leeves that can be magnetically placed on a refrigerator to provide emergency personnel with critical medical information for seniors and people with disabilities . The SGH Senior Resource Center provides a telephone reassurance and safety check program f or isolated or homebound seniors and disabled community members living in SDC's east region. Through the program, SGH Senior Resource Center staff and volunteers place computerized phone calls to participants daily at regularly scheduled times. In the even t that staff members do not connect with participants, a phone call is placed to family members or friends to ensure the individual's safety. In FY 2019, staff Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 169 placed more than 4,900 phone calls to 22 seniors and community members with disabilities , as wel l as approximately 15 follow -up phone calls to family and friends. In FY 2019, the SGH Senior Resource Center reached more than 600 community members through 30 free health education programs provided at locations in SDC's east region including the SGH c ampus, La Mesa Community Center, G HD's James G. Stieringer Conference Center, and San Diego Oasis \u2014 an organization that promotes healthy aging through lifelong learning, active lifestyles and volunteer engagement.

Topics included audiology, mental health and finding joy in aging. Lectures were held at the GHD's James G. Stieringer Conference Center and San Diego Oasis. Further, the SGH Senior Resource Center presented to more than 530 community members on senior services, Vials of Life, fall prevention, resources and tools for caregivers, introduction to smart phones and talking to a health care provider. Presentations were held at various locations throughout SDC, including but not limited to El Cajon, La Mesa and Santee . Through Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego, the SGH Senior Resource Center delivered three lectures on Senior Resources in San Diego to approximately 50 community members at College -Rolando Library, Point Loma/Hervey Branch Library and Rancho Bernardo Branch Library. Throughout the ye ar, the SGH Senior Resource Center provided eight health screening events at various sites in SDC's east region, reaching more than 130 members of the senior community. Screenings included balance and fall prevention, hand (checking for increased swelling, redness or deformity in elbows, wrists or fingers, as well as decreased grip strength) , and depression . In addition, in FY 2019, the SGH Senior Resource Center provided free blood pressure screenings to more than 670 individuals at approximately 50 commun ity events. Screenings were provided at th e SGH campus, Dr. William C. Herrick Community Health Care Library, La Mesa Adult Enrichment Center, Jewish Family Service of San Diego ( JFS) College Avenue Center and McGrath Family YMCA, as well as at community h ealth fairs and special events , and to the Grossmont Mall Walkers. As a result of these blood pressure screenings, five seniors were referred to physicians for follow -up care. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 170 The SGH Senior Resource Center continued to sponsor the Grossmont Mall Walkers, a free fitness program to increase physical activity, improve balance and strength, and encourage a healthy lifestyle among community adults and seniors. Every Saturday, participants gathered at Grossmont Center to walk around the mall and perform gentle exercises led by an instructor from the SGH Senior Resource Center. On average, more than 130 community members participated in the Grossmont Mall Walkers program each month in FY 2019. At The San Diego Union -Tribune's CaregiverSD community expo at Liber ty Station in April, the SGH Senior Resource Center provided Vials of Life, senior resources and information about its services to approximately 500 community members. T he SGH Senior Resource Center also offered Vials of Life, caregiver and community resou rces, and information about its services to more than 1,700 seniors at the County of San Diego's AIS Vital Aging 2019: Live Well to Age Well conference held at the San Diego Convention Center. The event covered a variety of subjects including brain health, caregiver well -being, nutrition, physical activity, health and independence, and other topics to help empower older adults to live healthy, safe and thriving lives. In April, Sharp Senior Resource Centers' collaborated with Sharp HospiceCare to host the Health and Wellness in Aging: Know Your Options conference. Held at the La Mesa Community Center, the free conference provided more than 110 attendees with educational presentations on staying healthy, improving emotional wellness, end-of-life options and estate planning tips, as well as provided valuable resources to help manage and promote healthy aging . Throughout the year, the SGH Senior Resource Center both hosted and participated in health fairs and events throughout SDC's ea st region. This included the provision of blood pressure screenings and educational resources to nearly 1,500 community seniors and caregivers at the El Cajon Heartland Fire Open House at an El Cajon fire station, Oasis San Diego's Technology Fair, Taste o f Oasis Annual Open House at San Diego Oasis, ECSSP's Senior Health Fair at the La Mesa Community Center, Senior Transportation and Housing Expo at the La Mesa Community Center, JFS College Avenue Center's annual health fair, Parkway Plaza Health Fair at P arkway Plaza Mall in El Cajon, Spring Into Healthy Living event at the McGrath Family YMCA in Rancho San Diego and In -Home Supportive Services' Provider Appreciation Day (for caregivers) at Balboa Park. The SGH Senior Resource Center continued to provide seasonal flu vaccines in selected community settings. In FY 2019, 390 vaccinations were provided at nine community sites, including the Lemon Grove Senior Center, JFS College Avenue Center, La Mesa Community Center, Lakeside Community Center, Santee Publi c Library, George L. Stevens Senior Center, Salvation Army of El Cajon, Journey Community Church and SGH. In addition to providing flu vaccinations at these sites, the SGH Senior Resource Center offered activity calendars detailing upcoming blood pressure and flu clinics, health screenings and community senior programs as well as provided Vials of Life and information regarding telephone reassurance calls. Further, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 171 seniors, caregivers, individuals who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, individuals wit h chronic illnesses, and vulnerable adults with limited access to care, including those without transportation, were notified about flu vaccine events through activity calendars, collaborative outreach conducted by the flu clinic site, sharp.com, and paper and electronic newspaper notices. Throughout the year, the SGH Senior Resource Center maintained active relationships with organizations that enhance professional networking and provide quality programming for seniors in SDC's east region. Organizations included the Caregiver Coalition's Caregiver Education Committee, ECSSP, ECAN, AIS Health Promotion Committee, East County Elder Abuse Council, St. Paul's PACE, and Meals on Wheels San Diego County East County Advisory Board. Further, in order to avoid unnecessary visits to the emergency room and the potential risks of hospitalization, SGH works alongside the GHD, Alzheimer's San Diego and Live Well San Diego (LWSD) as part of the Alzheimer's Response Team (ART) in the east region . Launched in July by th e County of San Diego , ART links medical first - responders, social workers, Sheriff's deputies and other professionals to individuals living with dementia to ensure they receive the most appropriate services during an emergency. The team also provide s ongoi ng support to families to help prevent future crises. The ART is an outgrowth of The Alzheimer's Project, the county -led initiative to find a cure for Alzheimer's and help families struggling with the disease. FY 2020 Plan SGH Senior Resource Center will do the following: Provide resources and support to address relevant concerns of community seniors and caregivers through in -person and phone consultations Provide community health information and resources through educational programs, monthly blood pres sure clinics and health screening events Collaborate with Sharp experts and community partners to provide approximately 30 seminars focus ed on issues of concern to seniors Participate in community health fairs and events targeting seniors Collaborate with an east region YMCA, AIS and ECAN to provide a healthy living conference for seniors In collaboration with the Caregiver Coalition, coordinate a conference dedicated to family caregiver issues In collaboration with Sharp HospiceCare, hos t an aging conference for seniors Provide telephone reassurance calls to seniors and disabled adults in SDC's east region Provide approximately 4,000 Vials of Life to senior community members Produce and distribute quarterly calendars highlighting events of interest to seniors and family caregivers Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 172 Collaborate with community organizations to provide seasonal flu vaccinations to community members facing barriers to accessing care, including individuals who are homeless or at risk of homelessness Maintain an d grow active relationships with organizations that serve seniors in SDC's east region In partnership with San Diego Oasis and SGH clinical experts and affiliated physicians, provide a monthly educational program on health and wellness topics for seniors ( e.g., vascular disease, fall prevention, stroke, etc.) Continue to participate in ART in SDC's east region Identified Community Need: Cancer Education and Support, and Participation in Clinical Trials Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHN A, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 201 9 CHNAs identified cancer as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SGH. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, cancer was the leading cause of death in SDC in 2016. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified cancer as a condition that many members of the community fear, particularly brain, colon and breast cancers. Participants also described barriers to receiving cancer screenings and treatmen t, including: stigma surrounding a cancer diagnosis; fear about immigration status, particularly for asylum seekers; financial burdens, even for those with health insurance; and practical issues such as transportation to medical appointments . According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 67% of respondents ranked cancer among the top five health conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. As part of the SGH 2019 CHNA, focus gr oups comprised of Sharp cancer patient navigators and clinical social workers identified the following health conditions and SDOH related to cancer: chronic diseases such as asthma or heart disease , which are often connected to stress; care challenges asso ciated with behavioral health and substance use; barriers to care (cost, delays in receiving care and fear related to diagnosis or immigration status; frustration navigating health insurance; screening avoidance; logistics such as transportation or childca re; and language barriers); and fear of stigma due to cancer diagnosis. Sharp cancer patient navigator and clinical social worker focus group participants also described the following hospital discharge barriers and support needs: lack of patient or family support and education (particularly for caregivers); homelessness; insurance issues; lack of follow -up care or access to medication; and a need for a \"one-stop shop\" incorporating financial navigators and legal support, as well as other resources like pai n management or wigs. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 173 The most frequently observed cancers at SGH in 201 8 were (in rank order): breast, lung, brain, colorecta l and prostate . In total, there were 1,2 86 new cases of cancer at SGH in 201 8. According to 201 8 Sharp oncology data, 46% of the 518 SGH cancer patients who received the cancer psychosocial distress screening scored at a range of moderate to severe distress and were referred to internal or external resources , such as social workers or community cancer resources. In 201 7, cancer was the leading cause of death in SDC's east region. There were 9 22 deaths due to cancer (all types) in SDC's east region in 201 7. The region's age -adjusted rate of death due to cancer was 157.4 deaths per 100,000 population, which is higher than the overall S DC age -adjusted rate of 136.7 per 100,000 population and the HP2020 target of 161.4 deaths per 100,000 population .69 In 201 7, the east region's age -adjusted death rates were higher than the rates for SDC for the following cancers: bladder, brain, colorectal, female breast and reproductive, kidney, leukemia, lung, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, pancreatic, prostate and skin . In 201 7, 21.0% of all cancer deaths in SDC's east region were due to lung cancer, 7.4% to female reproductive cancer , 7.4% to female breast cancer, 7.3% to colorectal cancer, 6.7% to pancreatic cancer, and 6.2% to prostate cancer. According to the American Cancer Society ( ACS) 2017 California Cancer Facts & Figures report, 72.4 % of breast cancer cases among non -Hispanic white women in SDC were diagnosed at an early stage, compared to 69.3 % of African American cases, 68.1 % of Hispanic cases and 70.4 % of Asian/Pacific Islander cases. D ata suggests that early breast cancer detection resources are needed in minority communities. According to findings from the ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2019 report , the 40% decrease in the female breast cancer death rate between 1989 and 2016 is attributed to improvements in early detection, namely screening and increased awareness. The rates of new cancer cases and cancer deaths vary significantly among racial and ethnic groups, with rates generally highest among African Americans and lowest for Asian Amer icans (ACS, 201 9). A recent study by the ACS found that 42 % of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. are potentially avoidable. Many of the known causes of cancer \u2014 and other noncommunicable diseases \u2014 are attributable to behavioral factors including tobacco use as well as excess body weight due to poor dietary habits and lack of physical activity (ACS, 2018). The Journal of Oncology Navigation & Sponsorship (JONS) emphasizes the importance of patient navigators as part of a multidisciplinary oncology team with the goal of reducing mortality among underserved patients. The navigator works with the patient across the care continuum , and often makes suggestions to help manage a patient from a hol istic perspective (JONS, 2019 ). According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advances. Greater clinical trial enrollment benefits medical research and increases the heal th of future generations as well as Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 174 improves disease outcomes, quality of life and health of trial participants (NIH, 2017) . Objectives Provide cancer education and support to patients and community members Provide cancer resources and education at commu nity events Provide cancer patient navigation and support services to the community Provide genetic testing and counseling Participate in cancer clinical trials, including screening and enrolling patients FY 2019 Report of Activities SGH is accredited by the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers, indicating the highest standard of care for patients with diseases of the breast. The Cancer Centers of Sharp HealthCare (Cancer Centers of Sharp), which includes SGH, Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH) an d Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center, are also accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer as an Integrated Network Cancer Program, demonstrating its commitment to meet rigorous standards and improve the quality of care for patients w ith cancer. In FY 2019, the David and Donna Long Center for Cancer Treatment at SGH (David and Donna Long Cancer Center) provided education on cancer, breast self -examination demonstrations, breast cancer awareness, and resources from the ACS and National Cancer Institute to more than 400 individuals at community events, including the Spring into Healthy Living event at the McGrath Family YMCA and Health Fair Saturday at Grossmont Center. At Sharp's annual Women's Health Conference in May, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center offered approximately 1,000 community members cancer education ; health screening recommendations fo r various age groups ; breast self-exam demonstrations and breast -self exam waterproof reference cards ; information about skin checks and melanoma ; information about the David and Donna Long Cancer Center programs ; and literature on cancer care and preventi on including risk reduction through lifestyle changes. Additionally, David and Donna Long Cancer Center staff walked alongside cancer patients and families in the ACS Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk in October. In honor of Breast Cancer Awarenes s Month, SGH provided cancer resources to nearly 40 individuals at an event titled Mind, Body and Spirit: A Holistic Approach to Patient Care . The October event was held at the S harp Memorial Outpatient Pavilion and educated community members on how taking a holistic approach to caring for oneself or a love one can help with healing. Community members also learned about breast health , spiritual care , and st rategies to lower the risk of breast cancer including integrative therapies, coaching, diet and exerci se, and breast self -exam techniques. Attendees also had the opportunity to speak with Sharp -affiliated physicians and support staff who specialize in breast cancer. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 175 In FY 2019, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center provided a variety of free support gr oups for approximately 125 community members impacted by cancer. Offered twice monthly, the breast cancer support group allowed women in all stages of breast cancer \u2014 from recent diagnosis, to treatment and survivorship \u2014 to share experiences and discover coping strategies. A general cancer support group was offered monthly to meet the educational and emotional needs of people living with any kind of cancer. This group provided encouragement and hope in a safe environment as well as an opportunity to share experiences and coping strategies during any phase of treatment. The weekly Art and Chat support group offered cancer patients, survivors and their loved ones a combination of conversation and relaxing drawing methods to increase focus, creativity, self -confidence and personal well -being. The David and Donna Long Cancer Center also offered a monthly Man Cave support group for men with cancer, which provided a safe and comfortable setting to explore important issues that can arise when coping with any type o f cancer, including work, relationships, family and regaining control over life. Furthering its support for those with cancer, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center continued to provide the Wall of Hope and Inspiration \u2014 a special art installation creat ed in 2015 for patients and visitors to write words of wisdom, advice and encouragement to those with cancer. In addition, in FY 2019, SGH Cancer patients participated in the Swallows project in which more than 35 patients and loved ones painted unique alu minum birds that represent what healing looks like to them. The birds were assembled into a flight of swallows over the entrance to the oncology areas as a symbol of hope and a successful journey. New in July 2019, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center offered a special healing arts program open to any person living with cancer entitled Finding Your Silver Lining. Fourteen participants created a collage reflecting on their cancer journey and the silver linings th ey may have found. Participants also had opportunities to share and connect with other cancer patients and survivors. In August, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center held a six -week Women's Writing Circle: Expressive Writing Program where nearly 10 women, who were either still in treatment or had recently finished treatment, came together to write and share about health and their journey. The David and Donna Long Cancer Center continued to host educational classes at no cost for patients and community members faci ng cancer. Through the monthly Lunch and Learn Cancer Education series, community members, patients and families were invited to hear local experts speak about a unique cancer -related topic each month, such as managing anxiety, leaving a legacy, making hea lthy habits stick, mindful eating, the importance of exercise, cancer prevention lifestyle habits and strategies for successful survivorship. Attendees were also invited to participate in a question -and- answer session while enjoying a complimentary lunch. The series was held at the GHD's Dr. William C. Herrick Community Health Library and reached approximately 20 individuals per session in FY 2019. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 176 Throughout the year, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center offered free workshops for patients and communit y members. This included free monthly ACP workshops provided in collaboration with Sharp's ACP program. Led by a trained ACP facilitator, the workshops provided nearly 20 community members with an overview of the ACP process, basic tools to help define the ir personal health care choices, communication tips to begin the conversation with loved ones and guidance on completing an advance health care directive. The David and Donna Long Cancer Center also offered three rotati ng monthly workshops including: a Rel axation and Quieting the Mind workshop to help cancer patients and their loved ones manage the stress, anxiety and difficult emotions that may accompany a cancer diagnosis; a Chemo Brain Workshop: Improving Memory and Concentration for patients experiencin g memory problems related to chemotherapy and other cancer treatments; and a Scanxiety: Managing the Fear of Cancer Recurrence workshop to assist patients in understanding and managing anxiety related to tests and scans. The workshops assisted more than 50 community members in FY 2019. To help guide and support patients and their families before, during and after the course of treatment, t he David and Donna Long Cancer Center team offered a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), a dietitian, genetics cou nselors and cancer patient navigators , including a certified breast health navigator . The LCSW offers psychosocial services (assessments, crisis intervention, counseling, bereavement, cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management), support group leadership, and advocacy and resources for transportation, palliative care and hospice, food and financial assistance. In FY 2019, this included improving patient and family connections to community services, such as the ACS, San Diego Brain Tumor Foundation, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Lung Cancer Alliance, Mama's Kitchen, 2-1-1 San Diego (2 -1-1), JFS' Breast Cancer Case Management program and food pantry, as well as other food and financial assistance programs. The LCSW served more than 370 patients and f amily members in FY 2019, while approximately 110 community members contacted the LCSW for consultation regarding support groups and other David and Donna Long Cancer Center services and community resources. The breast health navigator is a registered nur se (RN) certified in breast health who personally assists breast cancer patients and their families with navigating the health care system. The breast health navigator offers support, guidance, education, financial assistance referrals and recommendations for community resources. Through collaboration with community clinics \u2014 including FHCSD, Neighborhood Healthcare and Borrego Health \u2014 the breast health navigator identifies patients who may financially benefit from referral s to the Medi -Cal office for asse ssment of eligibility or the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program (BCCTP). Offered through the California Department of Health Care Services, the BCCTP provides urgently needed cancer treatment coverage for unfunded or underfunded low -income patien ts who do not qualify for Medi -Cal, but whose income may meet its eligibility guideline s. Patients with psychosocial support needs are referred to the David and Donna Long Cancer Center 's LCSW or various local or national resources including JFS' Breast Ca ncer Case Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 177 Management program. The breast health navigator also plays an active role in providing community education at health fairs, including literature about early detection of breast cancer and mammography guidelines, at no charge to the community. In FY 2019, the breast health navigator provided navigation assistance to more than 180 breast cancer patients in need, including many with late -stage cancer diagnoses. Since 2014, a cancer patient navigator has been designated for patients with cancers other than breast, including patients with head and neck cancers, lung cancer, and esophageal cancers as well as any cancer patient with complex ca re needs. The cancer patient navigator supports patients and their family members through care coordination and connection to needed resources, including transportation, translation needs, financial assistance, speech therapy, nutritional support, feeding tube support, social work services and more. In addition, the cancer patient navigator offers psychosocial support and education about the side effects of radiation therapy. Since the inception of SGH's navigator program, the cancer patient navigator has a ssisted approximately 600 patients and their families. Three genetic counselors assist patients and family members at the Cancer Centers of Sharp through risk assessment, counseling, genetic testing for personal and family history of cancer, and referrals for vulnerable patients. The David and Donna Long Cancer Center 's dietitian assists patients receiving radiation therapy or combined radiation and chemotherapy who are at high risk for malnutrition. This most often includes patients with head and neck, es ophageal, lung, pancreatic and pelvic cancers \u2014 including some cervical and rectal. The dietitian provided one -on-one nutrition assessments, education and follow -up to 350 patients in FY 2019. Throughout FY 2019, SGH helped raise community awareness of ca ncer through television interviews on KUSI News as well as through printed articles in El Latino San Diego and The East County Californian . Hospital physicians from a variety of specialties, including oncology, dermatology, hematology and urology, shared cancer information through these outlets. Topics included breast cancer insights and screening, curing small breast cancer tumors without chemotherapy, skin cancer prevention, lung cancer prevention, shedding light on bladder cancer, and a new breast cancer gene that puts younger women at risk. The Cancer Centers of Sharp conduct oncology clinical trials to support the discovery of new and improved treatments to help individuals overcome cancer and to enhance scientific knowledge for the larger health and research communities. In FY 2019, the Cancer Centers of Sharp approached and evaluated 480 patients for participation in oncology clinical trials. As a result, 111 patients were enrolled in cancer research studies. In FY 2019, clinical trials focused on mu ltiple types of cancer, including but not limited to brain, breast, colon, head and neck, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian, prostate and spinal cord. FY 2020 Plan Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 178 The David and Donna Long Cancer Center will do the following: Provide cancer education, resources and breast self -exam demonstrations at community health fairs and events, as well as through social media Continue to provide a free biweekly breast cancer support group Provide free community support groups, including an art -themed group as wel l as groups for men with cancer and those with advanced cancer and their caregivers Provide monthly workshops on managing scanxiety, relaxation and chemo therapy brain as well as a multi -session couples communication workshop for newly diagnosed cancer pat ients Continue to host a free monthly Lunch and Learn educational series for cancer patients, survivors and their loved ones Continue to provide ongoing personalized education, information, support and guidance to cancer patients and their loved ones Provide education and resources to the community by patient navigators for brain, breast, colorectal, lung, and head and neck cancers, a s well as cancer patients with complex care needs Connect individuals to community resources to help them manage their illn ess In collaboration with the Sharp ACP program, continue to provide an ACP workshop for patients and community members with cancer and their loved ones Provide legacy planning workshops on various topics, including creating memory boxes, scrapbooks, writi ng a life story and ethical wills Screen and enroll cancer patients in clinical trials Provide education on cancer and available treatments through community residents and physician lectures Provide internships to NU radiation therapy students Provide a f ree seminar to educate community members about lifestyle choices for reducing breast cancer risk Continue to partner with community clinics to share best practices in the care of cancer patients and to help patients establish medical services Identified Community Need: Women's , Prenatal and Postpartum Health Services and Education Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The SGH 2019 CHNA identified maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SGH. According to data presented in the SGH 2019 CHNA, among women admitted to SGH in 2017 with a high-risk pregnancy, the top three diagnoses were classified as pregnancy in a mother over the age of 35 (40.9%), pregnancy with ins ufficient prenatal care (26.0%) and pregnancy with a history of preterm labor (12.3%). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 179 This data analysis also indicated th at, while babies identified as b lack or African American represented 8.1% of all inpatient discharges for infants (under one year) at SGH in 2017, they accounted for 19.6% of low birth weight (LBW)71 discharges. In addition, in 2017, 39.0% of inpatient dis charges at SGH related to a premature birth were financially covered by Medi -Cal. As part of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, facilitated discussions with S harp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns case managers, social workers and a nurse educator identified the f ollowing health conditions that impact Sharp's maternal and prenatal patients: diabetes; preterm pregnancies; short interval pregnancies; substance use; and mood disorders, including postpartum depression and anxiety. Discussions also identified the follow ing SDOH affecting their patients: limited access to behavioral health services, even for the insured; lack of access to transportation; and economic stress related to childcare and maternity leave. Participants also identified the following strategies to improve women's health: build awareness of the importance of preconception and prenatal care; establish more options for home health care for postpartum women; increase lactation consulting and services; increase availability of services; creat e an interdisciplinary care team; provide inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services; and improve communication between physicians and pharmacists. In 2017, SDC's east region had 396 LBW births, which accounted for 6.1% of total births for the reg ion. When compared to all other racial groups, t he proportion of LBW births in the east region was highest among Asian/Pacif ic Islander (10.7%) and African American/ black infants (10.5%). There were 4,629 hospitalizations due to maternal complications in SDC's east region in 2017, a 2.7% increase from 2016. The region's age -adjusted rate was 2,125.7 per 100,000 population, higher than the rate for SDC overall (1,843.0 per 100,000 population) .72 In 2017, 5,321 live births received early prenatal care in SDC' s east region, which translates to 82.4% of all live births in the region. This was lower than the percentage of live births receiving early prenatal care in SDC overall (85.6%), and the second lowest among all SDC regions. Proven strategies to increase t he use of prenatal care include affordable health coverage, expedited health coverage for pregnant women , insurance coverage that includes health education and risk counseling , outreach and assistance with health coverage enrollment and accessing affordable prenatal services , use of safety net health providers , culturally and linguistically appropriate prenatal services , home visits for high -risk pregnant women , coaching and support from trained and certified doulas and community health workers , group care a pproaches to reduce costs and enhance care , and transportation assistance (Children's Initiative, 2017). In 2017, SDC ranked 18th out of 50 California counties for in -hospital exclusive breastfeeding at 78.9% (California WIC Association and UC Davis Human Lactation 71LBW refers to birth weight less t han 2,500 grams (approximately 5 pounds, 8 ounces). 72The definition of maternal complications is based on analysis of ICD -10 codes conducted by the County of San Diego HHSA Community Health Statistics Unit. In 2018, the definition of maternal complications included 666 ICD -10 codes, however it was expanded in 2019 to include 1,827 ICD -10 codes. Notable conditions now included in this definition include: supervision of high -risk pregnancy, gestational or preexisting diabetes, preterm labor and/or delivery, c omplications related to sexually transmitted infections, maternal alcohol or drug use, and sexual, physical or psychological abuse of the mother. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 180 Center, A Policy Update on California Breastfeeding and Hospital Performance, San Diego County: 2017 Data , 2019). According to the 2017 San Diego County Report Card on Children and Families , breastfeeding enhances immunity to disease, decreases the rate and severity of infections in children, is associated with improved development and decreased risk of childhood obesity, and reduces lifelong risks for chronic health problems. Mothers who breastfeed may have a reduced risk of breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers, quicker postpartum recovery time, and less work missed due to child illness (Children's Initiative, 2017). According to 2018 CHIS data, 32.8% of women ages 18 to 65 years in SDC's east region were obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30), highe r than SDC overall (24.7%). According to the CDC, being overweight increases the risk of complications during pregnancy, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth and cesarean delivery. (CDC, 2018). Factors associated with preterm birth inc lude maternal age, race, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, substance abuse, stress, prior preterm births, carrying more than one baby, and infection (CDC, 2019). Findings from the California Department of Public Health's ( CDPH's ) 2018 Maternal and Infant Health Assessment indicated that in 2015, 20.5% of California mothers experienced depressive symptoms during pregnancy or postpartum. Black and Latina women, women with low socioeconomic status, and Medi -Cal insured women are all at higher risk for depress ive symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period (CDPH, 2018). Maternal depression is the most common pregnancy complication, occurring more frequently than gestational diabetes and preeclampsia combined (California Task Force on Status of Maternal Mental Health Care, 2017). According to the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare, an estimated 15% of infants are affected by prenatal alcohol or illicit drug exposure each year. Substance use during pregnancy increases the risk of negative health outcomes, such as stillbirth, miscarriage, LBW, preterm birth, birth deformities, behavioral impairments and withdrawal syndrome (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2017). Objectives Conduct outreach and education activities for women on a variety of health topics, including prenatal care and parenting skills Demonstrate best practices in breastfeeding and maternity care, and provide education and support to help new mothers meet their personal breastfeeding goals Collaborate with community organizations to help raise awareness of women's health issues and services, as well as provide critical prenatal services to low- income and underserved women in SDC's east region Participate in professional associations and disseminate research related to women's services and prenatal health Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 181 FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 201 9, the SGH Women's Health Center provided education, outreach and support to help meet the unique needs of women, mothers and newborns throughout SDC's east region . The SGH Women's Health Center includes the SGH Prenatal Clinic, which provides services and resources specifically to SGH's underinsured patients. The SGH Prenatal Clinic offers comprehensive obstetric services , postpartum assessments, and individualized care plans to determine and address patients ' strengths, risks, needs and goals . Free support groups helped women and families adapt to caring for their newborn. Offered twice per week, the breastfeeding support group provided a comforta ble environment to assist mothers experiencing breastfeeding challenges , as well as an opportunity to weigh their babies to assess weight gain after feeding. Facilitated by RN lactation consultants, the group served nearly 20 attendees per session in FY 201 9, including fathers who were welcome to attend. The weekly postpartum support group, led by social workers, supported nearly 30 mothers per session in FY 201 9. Through the support group, mothers with babies up to 12 months of age who are experiencing symptoms of the \" baby blues, \" depression and/or anxiety can share their experiences, learn coping strategies and receive professional referrals. A variety of educational classes were provided to prepare mothers and families for their baby's arrival . Through the breastfeeding class, mothers -to-be learned about the advantages of breastfeeding and basic breastfeeding tips, such as positioning and the use of breast pumps. Designed for first -time parents, the Baby Care Basics class provided ed ucation on infant care, including car -seat safety, signs and symptoms of illness, infant nutrition and bathing, as well as provided hands -on practice with diapering, dressing and swaddling. Other offerings by the SGH Women's Health Center in FY 201 9 includ ed classes on caesarean delivery preparation, labor comfort measures and relaxation skills, childbirth preparation, infant and child CPR, and preparing new siblings and grandparents. The SGH Women's Health Center continued to host its annual neonatal int ensive care unit ( NICU) reunion for patients and families whose babies have spent time in the NICU to celebrate their care long after they leave the hospital. The event reached more than 200 former NICU patients and their families and included a variety of activities such as face painting, a photo booth (including framed pictures for the families), games, and arts and crafts. During World Breastfeeding Week in August, SGH's breastfeeding support group hosted an annual celebratory event for more than 20 fami lies that included raffles and prizes, massages for mothers and refreshments . The event also recogniz ed mothers who provided a year's worth of breastmilk to the Mother's Milk Bank . The SGH Women's Health Center has implemented several critical process improvements to increase breastfeeding rates among new mothers and continues to explore and participate in opportunities to share these best practices with the broader health care commu nity. Following the implementation of the 10 Steps to Successful Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 182 Breastfeeding initiative in 2012, the SGH Women's Health Center has pursued various quality strategies to promote exclusive breastfeeding and exclusive breast milk in the NICU. In addition, ed ucational resources provided at community clinics and in the hospital's childbirth education classes have been updated to reflect best practices in breastfeeding for mothers and their families. NICU nurses also continued to encourage mothers to use a pump log to document and increase accountability of their 24 -hour breastmilk volumes. In addition, staff worked with mothers of NICU babies to incorporate early intervention strategies that promote the establishment of a sufficient breastmilk supply in the week s following a premature birth . The SGH Women's Health Center also continued to track mothers of premature infants (28 to 34 weeks gestation) who had established breastmilk supply at two weeks. As a result of these comprehensive efforts, the SGH Women's Hea lth Center increased the exclusive newborn breastfeeding r ate at discharge (for all newborns) from 49% in 2011 to 57% in 2019. In addition, in 2015, the SGH Prenatal Clinic joined the Breastfeeding -Friendly Community Health Centers projec t (BFCHC) \u2014 an initiative of LWSD and funded through a grant from the First 5 Commission of San Diego. Through the BFCHC collaboration, the SGH Prenatal Clinic was selected out of six participating clinics as the pilot location to help establish Baby -Friendly USA guidelin es around breastfeeding education and support during the prenatal period and after discharge, and to support other prenatal clinics in achieving Baby -Friendly USA standards. The pilot program ended in 2016, however SGH maintains its collaboration in the BF CHC to ensur e sustainability of the model. The SGH Prenatal Clinic offers a variety of prenatal support for underserved and vulnerable women in SDC. Throughout FY 201 9, SGH Prenatal Clinic midwives provided in -kind help at Neighborhood Health care in El Ca jon to support the underserved population in SDC's east region. This included approximately 1,050 hours of care for pregnant women , with midwife coverage five days per week. The SGH Prenatal Clinic also continued to participate in the CDPH Comprehensive Pe rinatal Services Program to offer comprehensive prenatal clinical and social services to low - income, low -literacy women with Medi -Cal benefits. Services included health education, nutritional guidance, and psychological and social issue support as well as language translation services. Nutrition classes were offered to help reduce the number of women who meet the criteria for gestational diabetes and improve the quality of food choices to support healthy weight management . Women with a current diabetes diagnosis were referred to the SGH Diabetes Education Program, while those with nutrition issues were either referred to an SGH registered dieti tian (RD) or the SGH Diabetes Education Program as appropriate. Women with eleva ted BMIs received education and glucometers in order to measure their blood sugar and prevent the development of gestational diabetes. Further, in FY 2019, the SGH Prenatal Clinic provided education on gestational diabetes to expecting patients at Neighbor hood Healthcare in El Cajon . The SGH Women's Health Center continued its partnership with Vista Hill ParentCare to assist women with substance use, psychological or social issues during pregnancy. The Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 183 SGH Prenatal Clinic screen ed women for high -risk conce rns including mood disorders, domestic violence, homelessness, trauma, legal problems, substance use, sexual abuse and the acculturation process for refugees and immigrants. If concerns are identified, a treatment plan is developed with follow -up from a n SGH Prenatal Clinic social worker throughout the remainder of the pregnancy and up to 10 weeks postpartum . These approaches have been shown to reduce both LBW rates and health care costs for women and infants. The SGH Women's Health Center also provided wom en with referrals to a variety of community resources, including, but not limited to California Teratogen Information Service (CTIS), WIC, and the County of San Diego Public Health Nursing. In FY 201 9, the SGH Women's Health Center participated in and pa rtnered with several community organizations and advisory boards for maternal and child health, including San Diego Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting Program; California School -Age Families Education; WIC; CTIS; Partnership for Smoke -Free Families; San Di ego County Breastfeeding Coalition Advisory Board; Beacon Council's Patient Safety Collaborative; ACNL; the regional Perinatal Care Network; the local chapter of AWHONN; California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative; California Perinatal Quality Care Coll aborative; American Association of Critical -Care Nurses - Clinical Scene Investigator Academy and the County of San Diego Public Health Nursing Advisory Board. FY 20 20 Plan SGH will do the following: Provide free breastfeeding, postpartum and new parent support groups Provide parenting education classes Participate in wellne ss events for women with a focus on lifestyle tips to enhance overall health Share evidence -based maternity care practices through presentations at professional conferences Provide pr enatal clinical and social services as well as education to vulnerable community clinic patients through the SGH Prenatal Clinic Provide a NICU graduate reunion for former NICU patients and their family members Identified Community Need: Health Education and Wellness Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging concer ns, behavioral health, cancer, chronic conditions, community and social support, economic security, education, homelessness and housing instability, and Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 184 unintentional injury and violence as the priority health issues affecting members of the communities se rved by SGH. In addition, maternal and prenatal care, including high-risk pregnancy was identified in the SGH 2019 CHNA as a priority health need. HASD&IC focus group participants also identified health literacy as a barrier to care, and recommended several strategies to address this issue, including: culturally sensitive education about preventive care, including immunizations and health screenings; education about lifestyle choices that promote health, such as smoking cessation, nutrition and exerci se; and assistance understanding and navigating the health care and insurance systems, particularly for those who have received a serious health diagnosis. As part of the SGH 2019 CHNA, a focus group comprised of members of Sharp's Patient Family Advisory Council described lack of health education and health literacy, particularly surrounding preventive care (including immunizations), illness and disease as barriers to health care. Participants also noted that many patients and community members do not unde rstand how to navigate the health care system, especially identifying the appropriate sites of care to meet their needs. Participants in the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs identified the following as being in the top five most important health conditions for east region residents: aging concerns (73%); obesity (69%); cancer (67%); behavioral/mental health issues (63%); and heart disease (59%). In addition, the SDOH most frequently identified as having the greatest imp act on east region residents were: health insurance issues (80%); access to care (70%); economic security (60%); health behaviors (58%); and homelessness (44%). Data analysis in Sharp's 2019 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to CVD and Type 2 diabetes communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges within SDC's east region, such as El Cajon and Spring Valley.70 In 2017, hea rt disease was the second leading cause of death for SDC's east region. According to 2018 CHIS data, the self -reported obesity rate for adults ages 18 and older in SDC's east region was 30.4%, higher than the self -reported obesity rate for SDC overall (26. 3%). In 2018, between 25% and 30% of California adults self -reported being obese. Obesity levels decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates (CDC, 2019). According to the CDC, som e of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. In 2016, 39.8% of Americans were obese (CDC, 2018). According to an article titled Social and Envir onmental Factors Influencing Obesity , obesity prevalence is significantly associated with sex, racial or ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status. Higher odds of obesity are attributed to multiple factors, including: environments experi encing deprivation, disorder, or high crime; proliferation of high calorie, energy dense food options that are perceived as more affordable; and reductions in occupational and transportation -related physical activity. Both objective and subjective measures of social status a nd inequality are associated with increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure, which Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 185 could place individuals of low social status at greater risk of developing obesity (Lee, Cardel & Donahoo, 2019). In 2018, 20.0% of adults in SDC's east regio n reported that fresh fruits and vegetables were only sometimes affordable in their neighborhood (CHIS, 2018). Objectives Provide a variety of health and wellness education and services at events and sites throughout the community Offer health and wellness education to the community through various media outlets FY 2019 Report of Activities Throughout FY 2019, SGH participated in community events, offered presentations at neighborhood sites and partnered with local media sources to educate community members about a variety of health and wellness topics. In May, staff from a range of hospita l departments participated in Sharp's annual Women's Health Conference held at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina, where they offered wellness education and services to approximately 1,000 attendees. This included the provision of nutrition education, h andouts, recipes and healthy food samples as well as answering nutrition -related questions from the SGH Clinical Nutrition Department. Also at the conference , the Sharp Ortho -Neuro Service Line, including staff from SGH, provided osteoporosis heel scans \u2014 a quick and painless method to measure the risk of low bone mass; orthopedic education and materials on calcium and vitamin D requirements; and exercise tips for osteoporosis treatment and prevention to approximately 100 attendees. Furthermore, SGH conduct ed six blood drives throughout FY 2019 where approximately 200 SGH team members donated nearly 190 pints of blood. SGH provided education and resources at multiple community events in FY 2019. In February, team members provided a nutrition booth for more than 50 attendees of GHD's Kid's Care Fest, an event that offered free health screenings as well as medical and wellness resources for children and families. In April, SGH offered behavioral health resources to approximately 500 community members at the Na tional Alliance on Mental Illness' (NAMI's) annual NAMI Walks/Runs San Diego County event to raise awareness and reduce stigma around behavioral health. Also in April, SGH provided various health resources at Crisis House's Project Homeless Connect - East County, a resource fair that provides individuals and families experiencing homelessness with immediate access to necessary services in one location. The event seeks to end chronic homelessness, and provides attendees with connections to housing, employmen t, haircuts, hygiene kits, State of California Department of Motor Vehicles services including identification cards, legal aid, clothing, a mobile medical clinic, behavioral health counseling, pastoral care, substance use treatment, access to showers, pet sitting and more. At Parkway Plaza's Health Fair Saturday \u2014 hosted by the San Diego East County Chamber of Commerce, GHD, SGH and Grossmont Center in September Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 186 \u2014 SGH provided a nutrition booth, newborn screenings to identify genetic disorders, and resource s on diabetes, hospice, palliative care, behavioral health, pharmacy, pulmonary care, senior resources, and cardiac care to nearly 80 community members. In January, an SGH RD presented on eating well in the new year to more than 20 seniors at GHD's Dr. W illiam C. Herrick Community Health Care Library . In September, SGH provided education on suicide prevention, including identifying the warning signs of suicide, how to talk with an individual believed to be at risk, and how to seek help through appropriate resources to approximately 20 community members at Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos Branch Library. SGH helped increase awareness about current news and trends impacting the health and safety of community members through television, printed news, digital news and various radio outlets. Television interviews were given to KUSI News, KPBS, FOX 5 San Diego, ABC 10 News San Diego, and NBC 7 San Diego. Printed articles appeared in The San Diego Union -Tribune, The Coronado Times, The East County Californian, Times of San Die go and El Latino San Diego . Digital content included websites such as Good Housekeeping, Bustle digital magazine, Mic \u2014 a millennial -focused news website, Reader's Digest , and Better digital magazine . Information was shared through these outlets by physica l therapists , a recreational therapist, an RD and a nurse, as well as hospital physicians from a variety of specialties, including dermatology, sleep medicine, neurology, cardiology, gastroenterology and oncology. Topics included, but were not limited to: breast cancer insights and encouragement for screening; curing small breast cancer tumors without chemotherapy; heart rhythm problems; shedding light on bladder cancer; coping with the loss of a loved one during the holidays; best shampoos for dry scalp; e levated risk of heart attack on Christmas Eve; sleep teas for relaxation; sleep medicine physician insights on over -the-counter sleep aids; heart attacks occurring in younger individuals and individuals who are obese; foods to avoid eating at buffets; stro ke risk factors; new breast cancer gene that puts younger women at risk; exercise -based treatment for osteoporosis; easing the mental shift into retirement; living longer with Sharp's Care Transitions Program (provides care, support and resources for vulne rable patients to transition home safely); facts and myths about sunscreen; coffee and arterial heart health; encouragement to enroll local children in swim lessons; choosing sunscreen that is safe for both skin and sea life and helping older dog owners av oid injury. Throughout FY 2019, staff at SGH regularly led or attended various health boards, committees, and advisory or work groups. Community and professional groups included AHA, Angels Foster Family Network, Association of Fundraising Professionals - San Diego Chapter, CAHHS, California Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics - San Diego District, California Hospital Association (CHA) Workforce Committee, CHA San Diego Association of D irectors of Volunteer Services, California Society for Clinical Social Work Professionals, Cameron Family YMCA, Committee on Volunteer Services and Directors' Coordinating Council, County of San Diego EMCC, County Service Area - 69 Advisory Board, Emergenc y Nurses Association - San Diego Chapter, Grossmont College Occupational Therapy Assistant Advisory Board, GHD's Community Grants and Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 187 Sponsorships Committee and Independent Citizens' Bond Oversight Committee, Health Sciences High and Middle College (HSHMC) Board, HASD&IC, La Mesa Parks and Recreation, Lantern Crest Senior Living Advisory Board, National Association of Orthopedic Nurses, San Diego East County Chamber of Commerce, San Diego Freedom Ranch, San Diego -Imperial County Council of Hospital Voluntee rs, and Santee -Lakeside Rotary Club,. FY 2020 Plan SGH will do the following: Continue to provide health and wellness education and services to community members at a variety of community events and sites Continue to provide health and wellness educati on through local news sources Identified Community Need: Prevention of Unintentional Injuries Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified unintentional injury and violence as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SGH. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of ED visits for motor vehicle injuries in SDC increased 9.3% from 2014 to 2016, while deaths due to motor vehicle injuries increased 1.1%. According to data presented in the SGH 2019 CHNA, in 2017, 66.2% of inpatient injury discharges at SGH were due to a fall, 21.2% were due to natural or environmental causes and 5.4% were due to motor vehicle traffic. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA emphasized the importance of a safe environment as a contributor to good health. Lack of a safe environment may enco urage physical inactivity, which contributes to chronic health conditions. In addition, focus group participants described homeless individuals and refugees as two groups at increased risk of exposure to violence. In 2017, accidents (unintentional injuries ) were the fifth leading cause of death for SDC's east region. Unintentional injuries (i.e., motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian -related, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosions, poisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic s ubstances), choking/suffocation, cut/pierce, exposure to electrical current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and workplace injuries) are one of the leading causes of death for SDC residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. In 2017, there were 210 deaths due to unintentional injury in SDC's east region. The region's age -adjusted death rate due to unintentional injury was 39.9 deaths per 100,000 population, the highest of all regions in SDC.69 Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 188 In 2017, there were 7,052 hospitalizations related to unintentional injury in SDC's east region. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations was 1,299.4 per 100,000 population, which was the h ighest of all SDC regions and above the county age - adjusted rate of 1,003.7 per 100,000 population. In 2017, there were 32,358 ED visits related to unintentional injury in SDC's east region, an 11.6% increase over 2016. The age -adjusted rate for the east r egion was 6,683.3 per 100,000 population, which was the second highest of all regions and above the SDC age -adjusted rate of 5,606.3 ED visits per 100,000 population. According to a report from the County of San Diego Department of the Medical Examiner, in 2018, 49% of sudden and unexpected deaths in SDC were attributed to accidental causes, including poisoning, falls, traffic or train related injuries, drowning, asphyxiation or environmental exposure. CDPH and Office of Statewide Health Planning and Develo pment (OSHPD ) injury data indicates that, in 2017, unintentional injuries caused more than 13,600 deaths, 2.5 million ED visits, and 260,000 hospitalizations in California (CDPH, Safe and Active Communities Branch, 2017; SpeedTrack, Inc., 2017). In 2016, t he CDC recorded approximately 29.2 million ED visits in the U.S. for unintentional injuries (CDC, 2016). In 2017, unintentional injury was the third leading cause of death across all age groups in the U.S., accounting for nearly 170,000 deaths. Unintention al injury was the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people ages one to 44, the third leading cause of death for ages 45 to 64, and the seventh leading cause of death for those over the age of 65 (CDC, 2018 -2019). According to data from National Center for Health Statistics , in 2017, nearly 140,000 deaths in the U.S. were attributed to three causes: poisoning (46.3%), motor vehicle traffic accidents (22.7%), and falls (21.4%). According to LWSD's 2017 Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, SDC has focused its injury prevention efforts on the most vulnerable populations, including children of all ages (especially older children) as well as Native American and rural children. Successful interventions include safety campaigns, educational strateg ies and changes in parenting practices (LWSD, 2017). According to HP2020, most events resulting in injury, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behavior s and choices, such as alcohol use or risk - taking; physical environment both at home and in the community; access to health services and systems for injury -related care; and social environment, including individual social experiences (e.g., social norms, e ducation and victimization history), social relationships (e.g., parental monitoring and supervision of youth, peer group associations and family interactions), community environment (e.g., cohesion in schools, neighborhoods and communities) and societal f actors (e.g., cultural beliefs, attitudes, incentives and disincentives, laws and regulations). Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death among children, with many survivors enduring the consequences of brain and spinal cord injuries (SCIs) . The physi cal, emotional, psychological and learning problems that affect injured children, along with the associated costs, make reducing traumatic injuries a high priority for health and safety advocates throughout the nation. Educational programs like ThinkFirst Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 189 increase knowledge and awareness of the causes and risk factors of brain and SCI, injury prevention measures, and the use of safety habits at an early age (www.thinkfirst.org/kids, 2019). Objectives Offer an injury and violence prevention program for children, adolescents and young adults in SDC's east region Provide presentations and opportunities to Health and Science Pipeline Initiative (HASPI) high school students around injury and violence preve ntion and health care career readiness FY 2019 Report of Activities Sharp 's ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival program is a chapter of the ThinkFirst National Injury Prevention Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing brain, spinal cord and other traumatic injuries through education, research and advocacy. In FY 2019, ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival provided injury prevention education to approximately 1,900 east region residents in a variety of settings. More than 1,300 of these community members were students in grades nine through 12 who are part of the HASPI program. HASPI is a network of educators, community organizations and health care industry representatives who collaborate to increase awareness of health and medical career opportunities, improve science proficiency in schools and prepare students for future health care careers. Through the partnership and financial support from HASPI, in FY 2019, the ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival program offered a variety of services to schools in the east region , including classroom presentations, assemblies and off-site learning expos. HASPI school -site programs consisted of one- to two-hour classes on topics such as the modes of injury (i.e., automobile accidents, violence and sports/recreation), disability awareness, and the anatomy and physiology of the brain and spinal cord. These programs were enhanced by powerful personal testimonies from individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) or SCI, known as Voices for Injury Prevention (VIPs). Also through the HASPI program, in FY 2019, 24 students from El Capitan High School and Granite Hills High School with an interest in pursuing careers in physical rehabilitation participated in a half-day, interactive tour of the SMH Rehabilitation Center. Students rotated through three stations that provided hands -on practice in adaptive dressing techniques, wheelchair mobility, and various memory and problem - solving activities used in therapy. The experience provided students with a better understanding of physical rehabilitation and the challenges that patients might face following an injury. ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival provided additional outreach to east region schools through presentations to approximately 100 students at Avocado Elementary School. Offered during two school assemblies, these presentations focused on TBI, SCI, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 190 disability awareness, and the permanence of certain injuries. In additio n, a group of fourth grade students received education on booster seat safety. Following the presentations, students engaged in hands -on learning and disability education through the exploration of wheelchair accessible vans. The goal of this activity was to show students that individuals are more alike than different, regardless of physical ability. In October, ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival provided injury prevention education to approximately 300 youth and their parents at the GHD's annual Kids Care Fest at the Lemon Grove Recreation Center. Education included proper helmet fitting, booster seat use, TBI, SCI, and state safety laws. In April, ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival provided planning support and guest speakers for the 2019 ThinkFirst Conference on Injury Prevention at the Wyndham San Diego Bayside hotel. Attended by ThinkFirst professionals from across the nation, the annual conference aims to reduce injury among all age groups by: improving knowledge of the impact of injury and the need for preventio n education; increasing awareness of injury prevention programs; and disseminating information to injury prevention specialists through presentations, networking and the sharing of program methodologies. Sharp Rehab ilitation Services provided presentations during the conference, including Mindfulness in Rehabilitation and Vestibular Therapy for Improving Balance. On the day preceding the conference, ThinkFirst /Sharp on Survival assisted in the fitting and dissemination of one hundred bicycle helmets for community children, teens and adults at the San Diego Waterfront Park. The event concluded a day of training for eight new ThinkFirst Chapter Directors, extendi ng their education to include how to fit a helmet and how to conduct an impromptu helmet fitting event in their own communities. FY 2020 Plan ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival will do the following: With grant funding, provide and expand educational program offerings to schools and organizations, including but not limited to SDC's east region and Imperial County With grant funding, increase community awareness of ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival through attendance and participation in community health fairs and events As part of the HASPI partnership, continue to evolve program curricula to meet the needs of health career pathway classes Expand HASPI education within the east region through presentations for students at Mountain Empire High School With grant funding from GHD, collaborate with the San Diego Brain Injury Foundation to recruit and train a VIP speaker with a TBI to speak at east region schools Grow partnership with HASPI through participation in conferences, round table events and collaboration on letters of support for various funding opportunities Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 191 Continue to provide booster seat education to elementary school children and their parents with funding support from grants Explore further opportunities to provide education to health care professionals and college students interested in health care careers With grant funding, continue to link injury prevention with career readiness and career paths Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration wi th Local Schools to Promote Interest in Health Care Careers Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and S GH 2019 CHNAs identified education as one of 10 priority health conditions and SDOH affecting members of the communities served by S GH. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 31% of respondents rank ed education, including access, health literacy, workforce development and economic mobility, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. According to participants in a focus group conducted during the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, when resid ents are unable to attain high er levels of educational achievement, individual and community health are impacted in the following ways: limited or low wage employment opportunities for those with low educational attainment; constant stress related to housi ng or food among families who are not economically secure, which contributes to poor health; and limited career mobility in low-wage jobs, creating little potential for promotions or higher wages. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, i n 2018, there were 157,756 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 9% of all jobs countywide (SDWP, 2019). According to a 2017 report from the SDWP titled San Diego's Priority Sectors: An Update on Labor Force and Training Needs , the health care industry in SDC experienced net employment growth of 40.4% between 2006 and 2016 \u2014 considerably higher than the growth rate in the state of California (27%) and the nation (21%) (SDWP, 2017). The report also found that health care employers identified RNs, physicians and surgeons, and health technologists and technicians as the most difficult positions to fill. The most frequently cited reasons for hiring difficulties were lack of experience, small applicant pools and insufficient non -techni cal skills (SDWP, 2017). According to SDWP, a major challenge faced by education and training programs in the health care sector is accommodating the number of clinical training hours required for students in California to become certified. In addition, th e health care industry is facing significant changes due to uncertainty related to legislation and Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 192 technology, as well as the growing demand for services to support California's aging population (SDWP, 2017). Total employment in California is projected to grow 10.7% between 2016 and 2026, reflecting an increase of 1.9 million jobs statewide over the decade. The health care and social assistance sector is expected to be the fastest growing industry in California, with 24.9% growth anticipated (California Emp loyment Development Department (EDD) , 2018). In its Employment Projections - 2018 -2028 report, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that health care support occupations and health care practitioners/technical occupations will contribute about 30% of all new jobs and account for 18 of the 30 fastest growing occupations. Increased demand for health care services for an aging population and people with chronic conditions will drive much of the expected employment growth (BLS, 2019). As of 2018, S DC was one of 28 counties in California designated as a Registered Nurse Shortage Area by the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission (OSHPD Registered Nurse Shortage Areas Update , 2019). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Bureau o f Health Workforce (BHW) projects that the demand for RNs in California will increase 71% by 2030 if current levels of health care are maintained. The report projects that California will need to hire an additional 26,270 nurses to meet the demand (BHW, 20 18). According to forecasting performed by the Healthforce Center at University of California, San Francisco ( UCSF ), the demand for primary care clinicians in California will increase 12% to 17% by 2030. These forecasts predict that the southern border region will experience some of the highest levels of clinician shortages in the state. UCSF recommends a comprehensive and holistic targeted strategy to enhance the education pipeline, improve recruitment and retention, maximize the existing workforce and leverage workforce data (UCSF, 2017 -2018). According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) titled California Physician Supply: Headed for a Drought?, the total supply of active patient care physicians in California declined slightly between 2013 and 2015, a trend that appears to be driven by the aging of the physician workforce. In SDC, nearly a quarter of practicing physicians were ages 60 and older in 2015 (CHCF, 2018). The same report found that 32% of California's active patient care physicians were primary care physicians. In SDC, there were 112.3 specialty physicians practicing per 100,000 residents in 2015, compared to 49.8 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents (CHCF, 2018). According to a report from PolicyLink, a nati onal research institute dedicated to advancing economic and social equity, building a diverse health care workforce in California \u2014 one that reflects the state's racial, ethnic and linguistic diversity \u2014 is a critical strategy for increasing access to cult urally and linguistically appropriate services, eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities, improving the quality of care and reducing preventable costs ( Building an Inclusive Health Workforce in California: A Statewide Policy Agenda, 2018 ). A report by the California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) titled Meeting the Demand for Health identified several strategies to recruit and maintain California's health care workforce, including but not limited to: offer health career Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 193 pipeline programs for students from low -income backgrounds; provide academic, advising and health career development support to underrepresented college students; expand educational programs that train students to provide health care in underserved communities; and provide scholarships for low -income students (CFHWC, 2019). Objectives Collaborate with local middle and high schools to provide opportunities for students to explore health care professions Collaborate with colleges and universities to provide internsh ips and other professional development opportunities to students Offer professional development opportunities for community health professionals FY 201 9 Report of Activities Throughout the academic year, SGH provided more than 800 students from colleges and universities throughout San Diego with various placement and professional development opportunities. Approximately 580 nursing students spent nearly 63,000 hours at SGH, including time spent both in clinical rotations and individual preceptor training, while more than 220 ancillary students spent more than 63,500 hours on the SGH campus. Academic partners included APU; A.T. Still University; California State University (CSU) Chico; University Diego City College; San Diego Fire Department; San Diego Mesa College; San Jose State University of Redlands; University of San Diego (USD); University of Southern California; University of St. Augustine; University o f the Pacific; University of Utah; University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire; West Coast University - Los Angeles campus; Western Governors University ; and Western University . Further , the SGH Cancer Center provided internships to two NU radiation therapy stude nts. SGH continued to collaborate with the Grossmont Union High School District (GUHSD ) in the Healthcare Exploration Summer Institute (HESI), providing high school students with opportunities for classroom instruction, job shadowing, observations and select hands -on experiences. In FY 201 9, 19 students shadowed staff for two weeks in a variety of hospital specialties, including women's health, laboratory, pulmonary, interventional radiology, pre - and post -operative surgery, the progressive care unit, radiology and diagnostic imaging , pharmacy, supply chain/distribution, nutrition, infection control, the surgical waiting area/concierge, occupational and physical therapy, and the catheterization and hyperbaric laboratories. At the conclusion of the program, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 194 students presented their experiences as case studies to family members, educators and hospital staff. Those completing the program received high school credits for an elective course. SGH also continued its participation in the HSHMC program in FY 201 9, providing early professional development for approximately 96 students in ninth through 12th grades. Students spent more than 26,350 hours shadowing staff in various areas throughout the hospital, including but not limited to progressive care units, ED, f ood and nutritional services, behavioral health, acute care medical -surgical nursing, sterile processing, engineering, occupational and physical rehabilitation, endoscopy, women's health, cardiology, pharmacy, medical intensive care unit, surgical intensiv e care unit, and the hand clinic. In addition, SGH staff provided students with instruction on educational requirements, career ladder development and job requirements. At the end of the academic year, SGH staff provided the students, their family members , community leaders and hospital mentors with a symposium that showcased the lessons learned throughout the program. SGH continued to provide HealthCare Towne in FY 201 9, an early outreach program for middle and junior high school students designed to build the health care workforce of tomorrow through a field trip to the SGH campus . This unique event encouraged students to connect what they learn in the classroom to real -life career opportunities in health care. Healthcare Towne has fou r major componen ts that include World of W ork, the Puzzle Room, Scenario Tour and In -the-Round Activity. The first component, World of Work, empowered students to develop self -awareness by exploring their strengths, interests and values. Students were divided into three g roups to solve three different scenarios. In the P uzzle Room, students collaborated to diagnose a hypothetical patient before the patient arrived at the hospital by interpreting clues to find the answer and reveal the nex t piece. In the Scenario R oom, stud ents learned about and walked through clinical areas where the patient would receive care, including the ambulance bay, ED, operating room, catheterization laboratory, imaging and intensive care unit. During the final component, In-the-Round Activity, students applied clues, lab results and what they learned throughout the day to help fully diagnose the patient with several conditions . From April to August 2019, more than 100 middle school students from three local schools participated in HealthCare Towne. In FY 2019, SGH sponsored Ethics in Business, a program of the San Diego East County Chamber of Commerce and the GUHSD Career Technical Education Department. The program is designed to train high school students to become principled leaders through curri culum and case studies focusing on good ethical behavior. The program is the result of a cooperative effort by a group of business, education and community leaders. SGH staff were on -site to assist during the event, which was attended by approximately 120 high school student s. To help address projected shortages in the health care workforce, SGH continued to offer I Inspire, a weeklong program that encourages high school students from underrepresented backgrounds to consider careers in health care . The program Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 195 provides students the opportunity to learn about nursing directly from those in the field. To qualify for the program, students must be in good academic standing and enter their senior year within SDC's east region . Applicants must also have permanent resident status or U.S. citizenship, and speak fluent English in addition to either Arabic, Farsi, Kurdish, Turkish or Dari. SGH partnered with License to Freedom , a local nonprofit tha t advocates for and empowers immigrants and refugees in SDC , to recruit participants. Students shadowed nurses in outpatient, acute and critical care; women's health and surgical services ; and administrati ve settings. In addition, daily meet -and-greet luncheons with representatives from local colleges and universities including PLNU , NU, USD and others exposed students to a wide variety of nursing programs and degrees, as well as the processes for pursuing each educational track. Lastly, students created community -based education projects on topics chosen from the most recent SGH CHNA . In small groups, the students performed research and created poster presentations and handouts on obesity, behavioral health, diabetes and h eart health and shared these projects at both SGH and a community health fair in El Cajon. In FY 2019, 21 students participated in the I Inspire program. FY 20 20 Plan SGH will do the following: In collaboration with GUHSD, participate in HESI Continue to participate in the HSHMC program Continue to provide internship and professional development opportunities to college and university students throughout SDC Continue to collaborate with local universities to provide professional development lectures fo r students Continue to offer HealthCare Towne to middle and junior high school students Continue to offer the I Inspire program Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care and Community and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2019 CHNAs identified community and social support, economic security, and homelessness and housing instability among the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SGH, particularly underserved and underfunded patients who face inequities. Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified five primary barriers to accessing health care in San Diego: (1) lack of insurance; (2) economic insecurity; (3) transportation; (4) fear related to Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 196 immigration status and (5) lack of culturally competent/linguistically appropriate care options. According to th e results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 72% of respondents identified access to care, 60% identified economic security, and 35% identified care management, including disease management and community social servi ce linkage, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. Participants in the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group conducted as part of the SGH 2019 CHNA identified a lack of: family support; caregiver upon discharge; and chi ldcare assistance as priority SDOH related to community and social support that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants also identified economic security as a significant barrier to c are. In particular, the cost of housing, taking time off work for medical appointments, the cost of medication and food insecurity were highlighted. Further, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants identified the following hospital discha rge challenges and barriers for patients: transportation support; a shortage of recuperative or respite care options; a lack of short -term caregivers and in -home support services; and a need for a streamlined process from the hospital to the County of San Diego HHSA for those who qualify for wraparound support. Participants in Sharp's 2019 CHNA community engagement activities identified the following strategies to address economic security in patients: prioritizing the hiring and training of social workers; offering free post -surgery visits; providing follow -up phone calls to patients following discharge; making in -home care more accessible; ensuring access to 2 -1-1 Community Information Exchange (CIE) and other community resources at all Sharp facilities; establishing more patient -centered initiatives; and creati ng on -site resources to assist patients in finding and applying for affordable housing. According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7 San Diegans experienced food insecurity in 2017. Half of adults experiencing food insecurity are living with a disab ility (San Diego Hunger Coalition, 2019). As of October 2019, the average unemployment rate in the east region cities of El Cajon, La Mesa, Lakeside, Lemon Grove, Santee and Spring Valley was 3.2%. This is slightly higher than the rate for SDC overall (2.8 %), but lower than the state average (3.9%) (Labor Market Information, California EDD , 2019). The Regional Taskforce on the Homeless' January 2019 WeAllCount campaign estimated that there were 8,102 homeless individuals in SDC, roughly 55% of whom were uns heltered. In 201 9, 13% of SDC's homeless population resided in the east region. A 2016 report by the County of San Diego HHSA titled Identifying Health Disparities to Achieve Health Equity in San Diego County: Socioeconomic Status found that low-income communities in the county are disproportionately affected by numerous health issues, including injury, chronic and communicable diseases, poor maternal and child health outcomes, and behavioral health outcomes. Four such low -income Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 197 communities \u2014 El Cajon, La Mesa, Lemon Grove and Mountain Empire \u2014 are located in SDC's east region. According to a report from the CHCF titled Mental Health in California: For Too Many, Care Not There , the prevalence of serious mental illness varies by inc ome level, with lower -income individuals experiencing higher rates of mental illness. Although the number of adults with mental health coverage in California increased nearly 50% between 2012 and 2015 because of Medi -Cal expansion, in 2015, approximately t wo-thirds of Californian adults with mental illness and adolescents who experienced major depressive episodes did not receive treatment (CHCF, 2018). According to the same report, ED visits resulting in inpatient psychiatric admissions increased 30% from 2 010 to 2015. More robust community behavioral health services for low -income and uninsured patients may decrease unnecessary ED use (CHCF, 2018). Objectives Connect vulnerable, underfunded patients and community members to local resources and organizatio ns for low -cost medical equipment, housing options and follow -up care Assist economically disadvantaged individuals through transportation and financial assistance for pharmaceuticals Collaborate with community organizations to provide services to people e xperiencing chronic homelessness Through the CTI program, provide vulnerable, under - and unfunded patients with health coaching, support and resources to address SDOH and ensure a safe transition home and continued health and safety FY 2019 Report of Acti vities In FY 2019, SGH continued to provide post -acute care facilitation for vulnerable patients, including individuals who experience homelessness or lack a safe home environment. Individuals received referrals to and assistance from a variety of local resources and organizations. These groups provided support with transportation, placement (medical home, housing, etc.) , medical equipment, medications, outpatient dialysis and nursing home stays. SGH referred vulnerable patients, families and community mem bers to churches, shelters and other community resources for food, safe shelter and other resources. SGH is committed to providing medically necessary DME to vulnerable patients upon discharge. This included standard or bariatric wheelchairs, front wheel walkers or canes; cardiac life vests; a car key re placement ; and car towing services for under - and uninsured patients, or for those who simply cannot afford the expense of DME due to a fixed income. SGH RN case managers and social workers actively seek DM E donations from the community and SGH Volunteer Services, providing more than 200 DME items in FY 2019 at a cost of more than $25,000. In addition, SGH covered the costs for more Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 198 than 15 patients to receive continued short -term rehabilitative care in a sk illed nursing facility (SNF) to improve patient mobility and stability. To assist economically disadvantaged individuals, SGH provided more than $214,000 in free medication, transportation, lodging and financial assistance through its Project HELP funds. These funds assisted more than 9,100 individuals in FY 2019. Further, Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including SGH. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. SGH continued to collaborate with community organizations to provide services to patients experiencing chronic homeless ness . Through its collaboration with the San Diego Rescue Mission ( SDRM ), SGH discharged these patients or patients who have exhausted other community housing resources to the SDRM's Recuperative Care Unit (RCU). This program allowed these patients to convalesce and receive home health care services through SGH in a safe and secure space. The RCU provided behavioral health care , including psychiatric services and substance use counseling , and guidance from SDRM's programs to help patients re cuperate and get back on their feet. The SDRM assists patients with FSD and CalFresh applications; connects patients to community resources, including St. Paul's PACE and JFS; assists with permanent housing; provides programs that support continued sobriet y and residential treatment; and collaborates with St. Vincent de Paul Village to assist with the SSI application process through HOPE (Homeless Outreach Program s for Entitlement) San Diego \u2014 an effort to increase access to SSI for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. In January 2019, SDRM closed their RCU, thus ending this partnership . Further, in collaboration with Sharp Global Patient Services, SGH transferred four homeless patients, with their consent, to their native countries to contin ue medical treatment and reunite them with family and friends. Two of the patients were in hospice and were able to pass away surrounded by loved ones. Beginning in 2014, SGH piloted the CTI program for its vulnerable populations, including Medi -Cal, Medi -Cal pending/presumptive, self -pay, no -pay, refugee populations, homeless and Medicare A or B only patients. The CTI program is m odeled after the countywide C ommunity -based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) established by CMS to serve the Medicare fee -for-service patient population at risk for readmission . CCTP concluded several years ago, but its success inspired the development of SGH's CTI program. The CTI program uses a comprehensive risk assessment tool to identify vulnerable patients , who are offered 30 days of coaching by an RN or med ical social worker at no cost . The assessment tool evaluates patients for multiple factors including isolation, co -occurring health issues, food insecurity, behavioral health issues and other conditions that impact their he alth and safety. The CTI program utilizes a collaborative team of SGH and other Sharp professionals, including nurses, case managers, social workers and disease specialists , as well as team members from community benefit, Patient Financial Services (PFS), the SGH Senior Resource Center and others. CTI Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 199 health coaches include an RN and a medical social worker who devote hundreds of hours directly to CTI patients. The team ensures that vulnerable patients are connected with the community resources and support they need to safely transition home and remain safe and healthy in the community. Partnerships with community organizations connect these patients to critical social services upon discharge, and have included FSD, Food Bank, 2 -1-1, FHCSD, various churches, and refugee and other social support organizations. This outreach is critical for sustaining the health and well -being of vulnerable patients and empowering them to manage their care outside the hospital. Food insecurity is a key factor in the health sta tus of CTI patients. Since its inception, hundreds of CTI patients were identified as food insecure and provided a direct referral to 2-1-1. 2-1-1 then conducted proactive phone calls to CTI patients in order to connect them to resources such as federal as sistance food commodity programs (through the Food Bank), free food distribution sites throughout San Diego, and assistance with CalFresh enrollment. In addition, the CTI program worked closely with SGH's PFS to evaluate patients for CalFresh benefits prio r to hospital discharge, which dramatically increased the likelihood that patients completed CalFresh applications and received benefits. Since 2016, more than 720 Sharp patients have been granted CalFresh benefits. Further, the CTI program provides medi cally tailored emergency food bags for CTI patients without sufficient food in their homes. The food bags are supported by funding from the Grossmont Hospital Foundation and include nutritious items specifically designed with guidance from an SGH dietitian for the complex health conditions and nutritional needs of CTI patients, in order to sustain their health until they are connected to food assistance. The food bags provide CTI patients with nonperishable, nutritionally dense foods during the first few da ys of discharge, when proper nutrition is critical. The coaches provide food bags during their home visit and combine this delivery with a review of the patient's hospitalization and a plan for self -management. Since inception, the CTI program has provided hundreds of food bags to CTI patients in SDC's east region. In addition, a significant number of CTI patients have diabetes and are challenged with adherence to their care plan because they cannot afford diabetes equipment. To address this barrier, the C TI program works with Sharp Diabetes Educators who assemble and provide \"diabetes kits\" \u2014 including a three -month supply of strips, lancets, glucose monitors, etc. These kits help to keep CTI patients safe and managed until their insurance is activated. In addition, CTI patients were provided with other supplies, including blood pressure cuffs and batteries, pill boxes and can openers. The CTI pilot has demonstrated a powerful impact over the past several years. To date, the CTI team has approached more th an 3,300 patients and succeeded in enrolling more than 2,500 individuals in the program. Since its inception in May 2014, the average readmission rate for CTI -enrolled patients is less than 11%, compared to an average readmission rate of 27% among individu als who refused CTI coaching services. In FY 2019, the average readmission rate for CTI patients was 10%. It is the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 200 focus on both coordinated care management and SDOH that contributes to the success of the CTI program. The CTI program's partnership with 2 -1-1's Health Navigation Program has proven to be one of its most innovative and impactful collaborations, and a best practice in delivering care to vulnerable community members. 2-1-1's Health Navigation Program provides in -depth care coordination to bett er connect, empower, educate and advocate for clients with health needs. 2-1-1 Health Navigators work with community members experiencing issues in accessing care, managing chronic conditions, and those who are under- or un insured. The navigators assess sp ecific needs, which are unique to the individual's health condition and situation; refer and educate them about options and community resources; and advocate on their behalf when needed. Further, the navigators ensure access and utilization of the services that community members are referred to and then conduct follow -up communication with them over time. Through the partnership between SGH and 2 -1-1, select CTI patients are referred to the 2-1-1 Health Navigation Program to address health and social need s and leverage 2 -1- 1's enrollment services, housing coordination and advocacy. SGH health coaches determine the need for referral to the 2 -1-1 Health Navigation Program during the course of their assessment and discussion with CTI patients. At intake and a gain at completion of care coordination for CTI patients referred to the 2 -1-1 Health Navigation Program , 2-1-1 uses a risk rating scale to measure and address: changes in vulnerability related to SDOH (access to food, housing, transportation, etc.); hospi tal readmission risk; and patient satisfaction and self -efficacy to both demonstrate program impact and identify areas for improvement. Based on the rating scale, CTI patients fall into one of six categories as shown in Figure 21 that allow the 2-1-1 Health Navigators to tailor the services to the individual and connect patients with the appropriate community resources. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 201 Figure 21: 2 -1-1 SDOH and Risk Rating Scale73 CTI patients who are referred to 2 -1-1 are assessed on a variety of measures suc h as housing, nutrition, primary care, health management, social support, activities of daily living, ambulance use, transportation, income and employment. The risk assessment tool has identified the top needs as housing, food assistance and primary care s ervices. Funded by the Grossmont Hospital Foundation, the CTI program's partnership with 2-1-1 continues to successfully demonstrate the value of SDOH support for vulnerable patients post hospital discharge. In FY 2019, 90 patients were referred to 2-1-1. In the fourth year of this partnership, 98.9% of CTI patients that completed the 2-1-1 Health Navigation Program reduced their vulnerability in at least one SDOH domain (e.g., housing, nutrition, etc.). See Figure 22 for a descr iption of this impact on SDOH: 73 2-1-1, 2017 . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 202 Figure 22: Decrease in SDOH Vulnerability for CTI Patients Completing 2-1-1's Health Navigation Program \u2014 Year 473 In its fourth full year of implementation, the partnership with 2 -1-1 continued to demonstrate significant decreases in vulnerability in the domains of nutrition and housing. In addition, the partnership has had a significant impact on readmission rates among participants. Since the inception of the partnership with 2 -1-1 Health Navigation, the overall readmission rate for CTI patients decreased to below 9%, a dramatic decrease from the readmission rate of nearly 30% associated with patients who qualify f or CTI, but do not enroll in the program. In addition, survey outcomes from the partnership revealed that 100% of CTI patients expressed confidence in the care plan to manage their health following completion of the 2 -1-1 Health Navigation Program. These outcomes support the ultimate goal of the CTI program \u2014 to empower patients and community members with resources and skills to maintain their health and well -being. New in FY 2019, SGH joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1's CIE to better understand and address the SDOH that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH \u2014 the conditions where people live, learn, work and play \u2014 have a significant impact on the ability for community members to access care and maintain their health. SGH joined the CIE pilot partnership in order to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with SDOH needs, and to connect them directly to community resources specifically for those needs. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 203 More than 70 CI E community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared community member records enable CIE partners to evaluat e an individual's SDOH needs and current use of community programs and services, and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. Beginning in summer 2019, SGH case managers and social workers received training on CIE as a tool to serve vulnerable patients in the acute care setting, including those patients experiencing food insecurity and homelessness. Metrics of this partnership, including demographic and utilization data, as well as volume and successful community referrals, are curre ntly being collected and will help to assess the impact and value of the partnership at the end of its pilot year in early summer 2020. FY 2020 Plan SGH will do the following: Continue to provide post -acute care facilitation to vulnerable patients Cont inue to provide and expand the DME donations project to improve access to necessary medical equipment for vulnerable patients who cannot afford DME Continue to administer Project HELP funds to those in need Continue to collaborate with community organizati ons to provide medical care, financial assistance, and psychiatric and social services to chronically homeless patients Continue to provide vulnerable, Medi -Cal and unfunded patients with care transitions support, including connection to health care servic es and resources that address SDOH Maintain and strengthen partnerships with FSD and 2 -1-1 to strengthen the services of the CTI program and support expansion of the program Continue to work with 2 -1-1 to expand and implement 2 -1-1's CIE Evaluate the impact of the pilot year of the Sharp -CIE partnership to inform next steps in collaboration with community organizations to address SDOH Explore opportunities to improve communication with community clinics Continue to work with SGH Volunteer Services to p rovide weather -appropriate clothing and shoes to homeless patients upon discharge Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 204 SGH Program and Service Highlights 24-hour emergency room and critical care center, with heliport and paramedic base station \u2014 designated STEMI Center Acute care Breast I maging Center, including mammography Cardiac Training Center Care Clinic for minor medical needs Classes, events and physician referral through 1 -800-82-SHARP CTI program David and Donna Long Cancer Center , including clinical trials, genetic counseling, radiation therapy and medical oncology Electrocardiogram Electroencephalography Endoscopy FollowMyHealth\u00ae, a secure on -line patient website that gives patients convenient, 24-hour access to their personal health information Grossmont Medical Plaza Outpatient Surgery Center Group and art therapies Heart and vascular care \u2014 recognized by the AHA Home health74 Home infusion services Hospice75, including BonitaView, LakeView and ParkView hospice homes Intensive Care Unit Interventional Neuroradiology Services Level III NICU Mental Health Inpatient and Outpatient Services Neurosurgical Services Orthopedics, including total joint replacement surgery and minimally invasive procedures with Mako robotic -arm assisted surgery Outpatient Infusion Center Outpatient nutrition and diabetes services, recognized by the ADA Palliative care services Pathology services Pediatric services76 Pharmacy services Pre-Anesthesia Evaluation Services Pulmonary services Radiology and diagnostic imaging, i ncluding c omputed tomography (CT) positron emission tomography (PET) scan, digital mammography and DEXA bone density scan Rehabilitation services (inpatient and outpatient) Senior Resource Center 74 Provided through SMH Home Health Agency . 75 Provided through Sharp HospiceCare . 76 Inpatient services are provided through an affiliation with Rady Children's Hospital .

This includes first responders, such as firefighters and paramedics, who are often called to assist these patients, but may not have the necessary expertise to respond properly. As a result, many end- of-life patients are taken to the hospital where they receive care that conflicts with the treatment plan they established with their hospice team. In collaboration with local fire stations, Sharp HospiceCare teaches first responders when medical attention is most appropriate for end-of-life patients and, conversely, when it is more suitable for the hospice team to intervene. Through this education, community first responders are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to effectively assist an end-of-life patient in distress. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 207 Section 7 Sharp HospiceCare Communities are made healthier when we come together to find solutions to everyday problems. We solve problems through collaborative partnerships and ongoing dialogue, and by providing education, resources and tools that support one another . \u2014 Suzi Johnson, Vice President of Hospice, Sharp Hosp iceCare Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Community Benefit Program Highlights Sharp HospiceCare provides programs and services to all of Sharp HealthCare's (Sharp's) hospital entities. However, Sharp HospiceCare is licensed under Sharp Grossmont Hospital (SGH) and as such, the financial value of its community benefit programs and services are included in Section 6 of this report. The following description highlights various programs and s ervices provided by Sharp HospiceCare to San Diego County (SDC) in FY 2019 in the following Senate Bill 697 community benefit categories: Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations included contribution of time to Stand Down for Homeless Veterans and the San Diego Food Bank. Other Benefits for the Broader Community included a variety of end -of-life and advanced illness management (AIM) support for seniors, families, caregivers and veterans throughout SDC , such as education, support groups and outreach at community health fairs and events. Sharp HospiceCare staff actively participated in community boards, committees and civic organizations, including San Diego County Coalition for Improving End -of-Life Care (SDCCEOLC), Caregiver Coalition of San Diego (Care giver Coalition) , San Diego County Hospice Veteran Partnership ( San Diego County HVP), California Hospice Palliative Care (CHAPCA) , National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), San Diego Regional Home Care Council, East County Senior Service Providers (ECSSP), San Diego Chapter of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association, San Diego Coalition for Compassionate Care (SDCCC) /San Diego Physician Orders for Life -Sustaining Treatment (POLST) California Health Care Fou ndation's (CHCF's) California POLST eRegistry Evaluation Team, San Diego Health Connect POLST e - registry workgroup , and San Diego County Medical Society Bioethics Commission. See Appendix A for a listing of Sharp's involvement in community organizations in FY 201 9. The category also incorporated costs associated with community benefit planning and administration, including community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation. Health Research, Education and Tr aining Programs included time devoted to education and training for health care professionals and student and intern supervision. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 208 Definition of Community Sharp HospiceCare is located at 8881 Fletcher Parkway in La Mesa, ZIP code 91942. Sharp HospiceCare provides comprehensive end -of-life hospice care, specialized palliative care and compassionate support to patients and families throughout SDC. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries in SDC. For Sharp's 2019 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) was utilized to identify communities with greater health disparity within the county. The CNI identifies the severity of health disparity for every ZIP code in the United States (U.S.) based on specific barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care, and preventable hospitalizations. According to the CNI, communities served by Sharp HospiceCare with especially high need include, but are not limited to, East San Diego, City Heights, Linda Vista , the College Area and Downtown San Diego. Figure 23 presents a map of the CNI scores across SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 209 Figure 23: CNI Map \u2014 SDC77 Description of Community Health In 2019, there were 504,267 residents ages 65 and older in SDC, representing 15.1% of the population. Between 2019 and 2024, it is anticipated that SDC's senior population will grow by 22.4%.78 In 2017, 13.3% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemployment rate was 6.8% and 5.0% of households received Supplemental Security Income.79 According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7, or 14% of the SDC population experienced food insecurity80 in 2017. An additional 1 in 5 San Diegans were food secure but relied on supplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget.81 In 2017, 7.2% of households in SDC participated in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 19.9% of the population lived at or below 77 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018. 78 SpeedTrack Inc.; U.S. Census Bureau. 79 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency , Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit (2019), 2017 Demographic Profiles: San Diego County ; U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -year estimates 2013 -2017. 80 Food security means access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food -nutrition -assistance/food -security -in-the-us/. 81 San Diego Hunger Coalition (2019), Hunger Free San Diego Issue Brief: 2017 San Diego County Food Insecurity .

Each Sharp acute care hospital, including Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center (SCVMC), Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center, SGH and SMH, completed their most recent CHNA in September 2019 . Sharp's 2019 CHNA was significantly influenced by the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC ) 2019 CHNA process and findings. Please refer to Section 3: Communit y Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process and findings. In addition, this year, each hospital completed its most current implementation strategy \u2014 a description of programs designed to address the priority health needs identified in the 2019 CHNAs. The most recent CHNA and implementation strategies are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Through the Sharp 2019 CHNA process , the following priority health needs were identified for the communities served by Sharp HospiceCare (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Concerns Behavioral Health (including Substance Use) Canc er Chronic Health Conditions (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes and Obesity) Community and Social Support Economic Security Education Homelessness and Housing Instability Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy Unintentional Injury a nd Violence The following pages detail Sharp HospiceCare programs, activities and services that specifically address aging concerns, chronic health conditions, community and social support (these programs also help address access to health care, economic securit y and homelessness and housing instability) and education. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to healt h care. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 213 Sharp HospiceCare 's community programs and services feature a special focus on aging concerns, including provision of: End-of-life and AIM education for community members Advance care planning (ACP) education and outreach for community member s, students and health care professionals Hospice and palliative care education and training programs for students and health care professionals Bereavement counseling and support For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2019 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s) and FY 2020 Plan. Identified Community Need: End -of-Life and AIM Education for Community Members Rationale references the findings of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified aging concerns as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by Sharp . Aging concerns are defined as those conditions that predominantly affect seniors \u2014 people who are 65 and ol der \u2014 such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, falls and limited mobility. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC and Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified the following health conditions that impact older adults: Alzheimer's and Parkinson' s diseases, dementia, arthritis, loss of mobility, opioid abuse, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, depression, lung disease, obesity, and poor oral health. According to the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 83% of responde nts ages 65 and older ranked aging concerns among the top five conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. In 2017, the top 10 leading causes of death among adults ages 65 and older in SDC were (in rank order): diseases of the h eart, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular diseases, including stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes, accidents or unintentional injuries, essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, Parkinson's disease and influenza or pn eumonia. In 2017, hospitalization rates among seniors were higher than the general population due to coronary heart disease , stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , nonfatal unintentional injuries (including falls), overall cancer and arthritis. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 214 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7 San Diegans experienced food insecurity in 2017. Half of adults experiencing food insecurity are living with a disability (San Diego Hunger Coalition, 2019). While chronic diseases place significant burdens on individuals and health care systems, community -taught self -management of symptoms is possible. Managing symptoms of chronic diseases can improve quality of life and reduce health care costs (National Council on Aging, 2018). According to a 2018 report from the California Task Force on Family Caregiving, there are 4.5 million Californians providing unpaid care to individuals ages 18 and older. Informal caregivers face many challenges in this role, including balancing employment with caregiving; accessing culturally relevant and competent services; paying for supportive services; and attending to their own health and well -being (California Task Force on Family Caregiving, 2018). According to AARP, more than 40 million people in the U.S. currently act as un paid caregivers to people ages 65 and older. More than 10 million of these caregivers are millennials with separate part - or full -time jobs, and one in three employed millennial caregivers earns less than $30,000 per year (AARP, 2018). According to AARP's report titled Home Alone Revisited , nearly one -third of caregivers (30.9%) take their family member home from the hospital without home health support, and almost half of family caregivers provide intense and complex care, including per forming medical/nursing tasks and managing multiple health condit ions often accompanied by pain. In addition, nearly half of caregivers who perform medical/nursing tasks reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless, compared to a third of caregivers who do not perform those tasks (AARP, 2019) . According to research published in Health Affairs, an estimated 15 million family caregivers in the U.S. provide unpaid care for a loved one with dementia. Caregiver burden and fatigue can result in increased use of hospital and emergency services for dementia patients (Slaboda et al, 2018). The same stud y identified the following as the biggest challenges facing family caregivers of individuals with dementia: dealing with memory loss and the disease's impact; handling the stress and emotional toll; having patience with their loved one; handling mood swing s or behavior changes; and managing daily activities, including bathing, bathroom, dressing and meals (Slaboda et al, 2018). According to the Let's Get Healthy California Task Force \u2014 an initiative developed to advance a 10 -year plan to make California the healthiest state in the nation \u2014 hospice patients receive better symptom control, are less likely to receive aggressive care at the end of life, and their families are more likely to be satisfied with the care they receive (Let's Get Healthy California Ta sk Force, 2018). Data presented by the Let's Get Healthy California Task Force indicated that 48.5% of SDC decedents utilized hospice services in 2014. This was higher than the rate for the state of California overall (43.3%) but fell short of the group's 2022 target (54%). Among all demographic groups in SDC, the Asian population had the lowest rate of hospice utilization (27.6%) (Let's Get Healthy California Task Force, 2018). Research from the CHCF shows that in 2014, just 25% to 50% of palliative care needs were being met statewide. By 2017, capacity across the state had increased Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 215 for both inpatient palliative care (43% to 66% of needs met) and community -based care (33% to 51%) (CHCF, 2018). In January 2018, California became the first state to provide c ommunity -based palliative care services as part of Medicaid coverage, expanding the availability of palliative care into every county in the state. Despite this expansion, barriers to use of this new Medi -Cal benefit exist, including: lack of education for patients and referring physicians; the absence of standardization in billing practices, care delivery models and quality assessment methods; and a need to understand and accommodate the variation in needs seen across geographic areas and patient populatio ns (CHCF, 2018). According to an article published in Palliative Care: Research and Treatment, many people living with a chronic life -threatening illness either do not receive any palliative care service or receive services only in the last phase of their illness . Research has shown that palliative care programs can improve outcomes for both patients and caregivers, and demonstrate cost effectiveness by transferring care from acute settings to patients' preferred locations. Current barriers to effective end -of-life care include lack of professionals with specialized training; clinician ignorance and lack of awareness of resources; physician reluctance to refer patients; patient and family reluctance to accept referrals; and restrictive program eligibility re quirements (Hawley, 2017). Objectives Provide education and outreach to the San Diego community concerning AIM and end-of-life care Collaborate with community organizations to provide education and outreach to community members, caregivers and loved ones Support the unique AIM and end -of-life care needs of military veterans and their families Provide resources to improve access to car e and support for AIM and end -of-life patients and community members FY 201 9 Report of Activities Sharp HospiceCare supports the San Diego community in the areas of end -of-life care, aging and caregiving through collaboration with a variety of local org anizations , including the San Diego Community Action Network (SanDi -CAN) ; Southern Caregiver Resource Center (SCRC); San Diego County HVP, Caregiver Coalition and ECSSP. In partnership with these and other community organizations, in FY 201 9, Sharp Hospice Care provided education and outreach on a variety of end -of-life and AIM topics \u2014 including hospice, palliative care and caregiving \u2014 to more than 1,600 San Diegans at community health fairs, conferences and other events. Locations included churches, libraries, senior living centers, and community health agencies and organizations throughout SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 216 Sharp HospiceCare partnered with the Sharp Senior Resource Centers to provide three aging conferences for community seniors, family members and caregivers in FY 2 019. Titled Health and Wellness in Aging: Know Your Options, the free conferences were held at the Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church and the La Mesa Community Center in April, and at the Elks Lodge in Chula Vista in August. The conferences provided approximately 300 community members with education and resources to promote healthy aging, including staying healthy in an aging world, improving emotional wellness through aging, the End of Life Options Act (EOLOA) and estate planning . In FY 2019, Sharp HospiceCare shared resources on palliative care, end -of-life care and ACP with approximately 225 caregivers and families at several free community conferences. This included SanDi -CAN 's annual conference titled Planning for Your Future held at the Balboa Park Club in October, which focused on helping seniors and famil ies cope with life changes and navigate their end -of-life options; the SCRC's The Economics of Caregiving Conference held at First United Methodist Church of San Diego in November, which addressed a variety of financial planning topics to support community caregivers; and the Caregiver Coalition's The Pathway to Mindful Caregiving conference held at the Chinese Community Church in Tierrasanta in May to help answer questions and provide res ources to help ease the stress of caregiving. Sharp HospiceCare provided planning support as well as end-of-life and AIM education and resources to more than 1,100 community members at a variety of health fairs and events throughout the year. Senior and c aregiver audiences included members of the San Diego Oasis older adult wellness program at Grossmont Center and community members at St. Paul's Programs of All -Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) in El Cajon, as well as attendees of Spring Into Healthy L iving at the McGrath Family YMCA; ECSSP's East County Senior Health and Information Fair; SGH and the San Diego Association of Government's Senior Transportation and Housing Expo at the La Mesa Community Center; Jewish Family Service of San Diego College A venue Center's annual health fair ; Sharp Senior Resource Centers' Senior Health & Information Fair at the Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church and St. Paul's Senior Services Spring Open House at St. Paul's Villa. Outreach at additional community events took place at the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference , the Grossmont Healthcare District (GHD) Dr. William C. Herrick Community Health Care Library's Wellness Wednesday monthly educational series, and San Diego Gas & Electric's bi -annual employee healt h fairs. Sharp HospiceCare supports the needs of military veterans and their families through collaboration with local and national organizations that advocate for quality end -of-life care for veterans as well as through participation in veteran -oriented community events. As a part ner in We Honor Veterans (WHV) \u2014 a national program developed by the NHPCO in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to empower hospice professionals to meet the unique end -of-life needs of veterans and their families \u2014 hospice org anizations can achieve up to five levels of commitment. Sharp HospiceCare has achieved WHV Partner Levels I, II and III. Through Level I, Sharp HospiceCare is equipped to provide veteran -centric education to staff, volunteers and Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 217 community professionals, i ncluding training them to identify patients with military experience. Level II indicates that Sharp HospiceCare has built the organizational capacity needed to provide quality care for veterans and their families. With Level III, Sharp HospiceCare has deve loped and strengthened relationships with VA medical centers and other veteran organizations. Sharp HospiceCare is currently working towards becoming a WHV Level IV Partner, which focuses on improving access to and quality of care for community veterans. As part of its WHV commitment , Sharp HospiceCare conducted a variety of veteran recognition activities in FY 2019. Team members held special pinning ceremonies throughout the year during which Sharp HospiceCare volunteers presented veterans with a WHV pin and a certificate of appreciation for their service. More than 90 Sharp HospiceCare veteran patients were recognized through these pinning ceremonies in FY 2019, in addition to 40 veteran community members at various community events , including the Caregiver Coalition's Navigating Caregiving for Veterans and Military Families conference in October and the City of San Diego's Veterans Appreciation Dance in November. In addition, i n December , Sharp HospiceCare honored veterans through the annual Wreath s Across America wreath -laying ceremon ies at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, Greenwood Memorial Park and Miramar National Cemetery. Sharp HospiceCare has been a member of the San Diego County HVP since 2010. Through the partnership, the VA San Diego He althcare System and San Diego's community hospice organizations collaborate to promote quality care for veterans with a life-limiting illness as well as serve as a voice and resource for veterans and their families. Sharp HospiceCare continued to provide a wig donation program in FY 2019. Through the program, Sharp HospiceCare receives new, unused wigs from manufacturers, which are cleaned and styled for donation to individuals experiencing hair loss as a result of cancer treatment or other illnesses. During private appointments, t eam members help community members select their wig and provide personalized fitting, styling and maintenance instructions. In FY 2019, Sharp HospiceCare donated 44 wigs to community members, as well as approximately 75 surplus w igs to cancer patients at the Douglas & Nancy Barnhart Cancer Center at SCVMC (Barnhart Cancer Center) . New in FY 2019, Sharp HospiceCare joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2-1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE) to better un derstand and address the social determinants of health ( SDOH ) that influence the health and well - being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH \u2014 the conditions where people live, learn, work and play \u2014 have a significant impact on the ability for community members to access care and maintain their health. Sharp HospiceCare joined the CIE pilot partnership in order to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with SDOH needs, and to connect them directly to community resources specifically for those needs. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 218 More than 70 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared community member records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and current use of community programs and services, and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. Beginning in summer 2019, Sharp HospiceCare's case managers and social workers received training on CIE as a tool to serve vulnerable patients, including those patients experiencing food insecurity and homelessness. Metrics of this partnership, including demographic and utilization data, as well as volume and succe ssful community referrals, are currently being collected and will help to assess the impact and value of the partnership at the end of its pilot year in early summer 2020. FY 20 20 Plan Sharp HospiceCare will do the following: Continue to collaborate wi th a variety of local community organizations to provide end-of-life and AIM education and resources to community members Collaborate with the Sharp Senior Resource Centers and SCVMC to host a free aging conference in La Mesa, Point Loma and Chula Vista, reaching 100 community members per conference Continue to support the needs of military veterans and their families through the provision of education and resources at veteran -oriented community events and collaboration with local and national organizatio ns advocating for quality end -of-life care for veterans Achieve WHV Partner Level IV to improve access to and quality of care for community veterans Continue to provide a wig donation program Evaluate the impact of the pilot year of the Sharp -CIE partnership to inform next steps in collaboration with community organizations to address SDOH Identified Community Need: ACP Education and Outreach to Community Members and Health Care Professionals Rationale references the findings of Sharp's 201 9 CHNA s, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified aging concerns as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by Sharp. Aging concerns are defined as those conditions that predominantly affect seniors \u2014 people who are 65 and older \u2014 such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, falls, limited mobility, isolation and other challenges. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 219 The Sharp 2016 CHNA process identified care at the end of life as a critical issue for the senior population. End -of-life conversations with oncology patients were specifically identified as a significant challenge to quality care. According to the Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention ( CDC ), Americans now experience mortality at a much later age and largely due to chronic disease. Planning for end -of-life care increases individual autonomy, ensures individuals feel their voices are h eard and relieves stress for those surrounding elderly individuals. In 2017, only 30% of Americans had advance care plans. With the largest generation of Americans now aging, education on end -of-life care is a public health issue (CDC, 2017). A 2017 systematic review published in Health Affairs found that 36.7% of Americans had completed an advance health care directive ( advance directive ), and 29.3% had living wills. Factors contributing to low ACP completion include tedious legal formalities in executing an a dvance directive; lack of clinician support for advance directives; and the lack of depth and tailoring of documents to fully represent patients' preferences (Kuldeep et al., 2017). Research suggests that barriers to engaging patients in ACP exist at the p atient, provider and system levels. Barriers identified by ph ysicians included: insufficient time; inability to electronically transfer documentation across care settings; decreased interaction with patients near the end of life resulting from transfer of care; and patients' difficulty understanding limitations and complications of treatment options. Other health professionals additionally identified their own lack of knowledge and difficulty accessing the physician as barriers. Themes identified as enabler s of ACP included greater public engagement, clinician attitudes, creating capacity for clinicians, integrating ACP into practice, and system and policy supports (Howard et al, 2018). Despite evidence that ACP can improve the quality of the end of life, it is most likely to be completed by white, socially integrated, higher income adults compared to other demographic groups. Advance directive completion rates are two to three times higher among whites when compared to blacks and Latinos, underscoring a need to expand public awareness and access to ACP (Gerontological Society of America, 2017). While 92% of Americans say it is important to discuss their wishes for end -of-life care, only 32% have had this conversation. In addition, 95% of Americans say they would be willing to talk about their wishes, and 53% even say they would be relieved to discuss it ( The Conversation Project National Survey , 2018). According to a study published in the Journal of Palliative Medicine, 1 in 8 bereaved family members reported that care in the last month of life was not consistent with the decedent's wishes. Decedents whose care was described as inconsistent with their preferences were more likely to have died in a hospital setting, while those who received care consistent with their wishes were more likely to have died at home (Khandelwal et al , 2017). Advance directives should be completed while people are healthy, which gives them time to think about the end -of-life care they would choose if they were unable to communicate th eir own wishes. It also allows time to discuss these wishes with loved ones (NHPCO, 2015). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 220 As the end of life approaches for people with serious, chronic or progressive illnesses, it is important for health systems and health care workers to provide suppor t and guidance to patients and families on the role of ACP, palliative care and hospice. Open communication between patient and provider, as well as between the patient and loved ones, can help ensure that all parties are aware of the patient's preferences (The Five Trajectories: Supporting Patients During Serious Illness , California State University ( CSU ) Institute for Palliative Care, 2018). According to Health Affairs , creating and utilizing a conversation guide for health care providers and community le aders can raise awareness and educate patients and their loved ones about the importance of ACP (Peters, Kim & Udow -Phillips, 2016). The Aspen Institute Health Strategy Group suggests five changes to improve the quality of end -of-life care: build the devel opment and updating of an advance care plan into the fabric of life; redefine Medicare coverage in a way that meets the complex needs of people with serious illness; develop a set of quality metrics related to end -of-life care that can be used for accounta bility, transparency improvement and payment; increase the number and types of health professionals who can meet the growing needs of an aging population; and support model communities that embrace fundamental change in the design and delivery of care for people with advanced illness ( Improving Care at the End of Life , 2016). Objectives Provide education, engagement and consultation for community members on ACP and POLST Educate community health care professionals on ACP and POLST Empower community members to make informed health care decisions FY 201 9 Report of Activities Sharp offers a free and confidential ACP program to support community members as they consider their future health care options. Facilitated by Sharp HospiceCare, the ACP program empowers adults of any age and health status to explore and document their beliefs, values and goals as they relate to health care. The program consists of three stages. Stage one, community engagement, focuses on bringing awar eness to healthy community members about the importance of ACP. This stage includes basic education and resources, identification of an appropriate health care agent, and completion of an advance directive. Stage two, disease -specific outreach, focuses on education for community members with a progressive chronic illness, including decline in functional status, co -morbidities, potential for hospitalization and caregiver issues. With a goal of anticipating future needs as health declines, this stage focuses on developing a written plan that identifies goals of care and involves the health care agent and loved ones. The third stage, late -life illness outreach, targets those with a disease prognosis of one year or less. Under these circumstances, individuals mu st make specific or urgent decisions, and these decisions require conversion to medical orders that will guide the health care provider's actions and remain consistent with goals of Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 221 care. The focus of this stage is to assist the individual or appointed hea lth care agent with navigating complex medical decisions related to immediate life -sustaining or prolonging measures. Such measures include completion of the POLST form, a medical order designed for individuals with advanced progressive or terminal illness that identifies the appropriate informed substitute decision maker as well as describes preferences for care and treatment when important health care decisions must be made. Since 2014, Sharp has offered its own Advance Health Care Directive to guide the public in outlining their health care decisions. The document is publicly available on sharp.com in both English and Spanish and uses easy -to-read language to describe what an advance directive is and how and why to complete one. The form allows individua ls to put their health care wishes into writing and appropriately sign the advance directive. With this witnessed signature, the advance directive becomes a legal document that identifies the appropriate informed substitute decision maker and serves as a t ool for health care decision -making. Additional contact information is provided for community members who are interested in speaking with a Sharp ACP facilitator. Throughout the year , the Sharp ACP team provided more than 140 phone and in - person consultat ions to community members seeking guidance with identifying their personal goals of care and health care preferences, appointing an appropriate health care agent, and completing an advance directive. In FY 201 9, the team engaged more than 770 community me mbers in education on ACP, POLST and the EOLOA . In honor of National Healthcare Decisions Day (NHDD) \u2014 a nationwide initiative celebrated every April to educate adults of all ages about the importance of ACP \u2014 Sharp HospiceCare provided presentations to se niors at Fredericka Manor Retirement Community and Country Hills Health Care Center, as well as during Sharp Senior Resource Centers' and Sharp HospiceCare's Health and Wellness in Aging: Know Your Options conference s at the La Mesa Community Center and th e Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church . Education provided throughout the year to senior s and caregiver s took place at Silvercrest Senior Residence , Casa de Ma\u00f1ana La Jolla retirement community, La Costa Glen retirement community , and the San Diego Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Community Center. Education for the general community occurred at the Descanso Branch Library, the Live and Let Live Alano Club (LGBT sober clubhouse), the North Park Lions Club, Salvation Army offices in Downt own San Diego and Escondido, the Sharp Women's Health Conference, and during a community presentation at Balboa Park through Sharp's wellness partnership with the City of San Diego . Sharp's ACP team reached an additional 65 community members through free , monthly ACP workshops held in collaboration with the David and Donna Long Center for Cancer Treatment at SGH, the Barnhart Cancer Center at SCVMC, and the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute at SMH. During the workshops, individuals impacted by cancer receiv ed guidance on identifying their personal health care choices, communicating their wishes to loved ones and developing their advance directive. In addition, in Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 222 August, the ACP team participated in SCVMC's free Advance Health Care Directive Seminar, which e ducated approximately 40 community members about the importance of completing an advance directive and available community resources to support the ACP process. Sharp HospiceCare provided resources, presentations and trainings on the EOLOA, POLST and ACP to approximately 175 local community health professionals throughout the year . Audiences included members of the Caregiver Coalition, social workers at St. Paul's PACE El Cajon, staff at Stanford Court Skilled Nursing & Rehab Center, the County of San Dieg o Aging and Independence Services (AIS) Long -Term Care Ombudsman Program, and long -term care professionals at the Cultural and Ethical Challenges in Long -Term Care Advance Care Planning seminar. In FY 2019, Sharp's ACP team continued to partner with San Diego Health Connect, County of San Diego AIS, Health Services Advisory Group (HSAG) , County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services, and various health care providers in SDC to ensure that community providers have access to POLST forms through the San Die go Healthcare Information Exchange, a countywide program that securely connects health care providers and patients to private health information exchanges. The Sharp HospiceCare ACP team participates in this initiative \u2014 funded by the CHCF and supported by the Coalition for Compassionate Care of California ( CCCC ) and California Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA) \u2014 to create an electronic POLST registry (POLST eRegistry). When a paper POLST form is not readily available during an emergency, the pati ent's care may be hindered or conflict with their wishes. The POLST eRegistry will improve access to critical information through a cloud -based registry for completed POLST forms to be securely submitted and retrieved. Sharp demonstrates community leadersh ip in the effort to establish quick and safe provider access to patient medical orders. In March 2018, Sharp became the first health care system in SDC to begin electronic uploads of patient POLST forms to the POLST eRegistry. As of December 2019 , more tha n 40,800 POLST forms faxed by Sharp hospitals, Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Group, Sharp HospiceCare and other patient care departments have been uploaded to the POLST eRegistry. FY 20 20 Plan Sharp HospiceCare will do the following: Provide free ACP and POLST education and outreach to community members through phone and in -person consultations Collaborate with community organizations to provide educational classes and events to raise community awareness of ACP Both independently and in collaboration with SDCCC and SDCCEOLC, provide community events to promote the importance of ACP in honor of NHDD Continue to provide ACP education and outreach to local, state and national health care professionals Serve as a community resource regarding the EOLOA Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 223 In coll aboration with the CSU Institute for Palliative Care at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM), explore strategies to bring advance directives to the county's homeless community Continue to collaborate with community partners to provide community m embers with access to advance directive and POLST forms through the San Diego Healthcare Information Exchange Continue to participate in the CHCF's POLST eRegistry initiative with CCCC and EMSA As participants in Sharp's ACP Work Group, update Sharp's Advance Health Care Directive to include simplified language and new interactive and video -based components Identified Community Need: Health Professions and Student Education and Training Rationale references the findings of Sharp's 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified education as one of 10 priority health conditions and SDOH affecting members of the communities served by Sharp. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 31% of respondents ranked education, including access, health literacy, workforce development and mobility, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. According to participants in a focus group conducted during the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, when residents are unable to achieve higher levels of education, individual and community health are impacted in the following ways: limited or l ow-wage employment opportunities for those with low educational attainment; constant stress related to housing or food among families who are not economically secure, which contributes to poor health; and limited career mobility in low -wage jobs, creating little potential for promotions or higher wages. According to a 2017 report from the San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP ) titled San Diego's Priority Sectors: An Update on Labor Force and Training Needs , the health care industry in SDC experienced net em ployment growth of 40.4% between 2006 and 2016 \u2014 considerably higher than the growth rate in the state of California (27%) and the nation (21%) (SDWP, 2017). Total employment in California is projected to grow 10.7% between 2016 and 2026, reflecting an inc rease of 1.9 million jobs statewide over the decade. The health care and social assistance sector is expected to be the fastest growing industry in California, with 24.9% growth anticipated (California Employment Development Department , 2018). In its Emplo yment Projections - 2018 -2028 report, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that health care support occupations and health care Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 224 practitioners/ technical occupations will contribute about 30% of all new jobs and account for 18 of the 30 fastest growing occupations. Increased demand for health care services from an aging population and people with chronic conditions will drive much of the expected employment growth (BLS, 2019). As of 2018, SDC was one of 28 counties in California designate d as a Registered Nurse Shortage Area by the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission (California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development ( OSHPD ) Registered Nurse Shortage Areas Update , 2019). According to a report from PolicyLink, a n ational research institute dedicated to advancing economic and social equity, building a diverse health care workforce in California \u2014 one that reflects the state's racial, ethnic and linguistic diversity \u2014 is a critical strategy for increasing access to c ulturally and linguistically appropriate services, eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities, improving the quality of care and reducing preventable costs (Building an Inclusive Health Workforce in California: A Statewide Policy Agenda, 2018). Accord ing to a report from the Elder Workforce Alliance (EWA) titled Building a State Eldercare Workforce Coalition , the number of Americans reaching retirement will double by 2030, representing an 8% increase in the population requiring a wide range of professi onal health, home care and social services. B y 2030, an estimated 3.5 million additional health care professionals and direct -care workers will be needed to care for older adults (EWA, 2018). According to research published in the Journal of American Geria trics Society , the demand for geriatricians is projected to increase 45% by 2025 with a projected national shortage of almost 27,000 geriatricians (Flaherty & Bartels , 2019) . In addition, almost half of U.S. physicians experience burnout, which has been connected to lower patient satisfaction, overuse of resources, higher costs of care, increased chance of prescribing the wrong medications, lower levels of empathy, and reduced patient outcome and safety ( Flaherty & Bartels , 2019). The American Academy of Ho spice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) states that high-quality palliative and hospice care improve quality of life as well as patient and family satisfaction, and may prolong survival at a lower cost than typical medical care (AAHPM, 2018). AAHPM notes tha t lack of provider training and knowledge of palliative care results in many patients with serious illness receiving painful or ineffective treatments that do not prolong or enhance their lives. Expanding hospice and palliative care training opportunities can help ensure clinicians across disciplines and specialties who care for people with serious illness are competent in \"basic palliative care,\" including communication skills, interprofessional collaboration and symptom management (AAHPM, 2018). According to AAHPM, in 2015, just 44% of hospital palliative care programs met national staffing standards set by the Joint Commission. Current training capacity for hospice and palliative medicine physicians is insufficient to provide hospital -based care and keep pace with growth in the population of adults over 65 years old. If the rate of physicians entering and leaving hospice and palliative medicine maintains, there will be no more than 1% absolute growth in this physician workforce in 20 Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 225 years, by which time t he number of persons eligible for palliative care will grow by over 20% (AAHPM, 2018). Analysis published in Health Affairs estimates that there is currently one palliative care physician for every 808 eligible patients. To meet current demand for patient evaluation, each physician would need to perform 10 patient visits per day over 48 weeks per year. Assuming no policy changes, by 2038 it is estimated that each physician would need to perform 23 patient visits per day to meet demand, highlighting the need to increase the use of interdisciplinary palliative care team members in the assessment and management of patient and caregiver distress (Kamal et al, 2019). Objectives Provide education and training opportunities around end -of-life care and ACP for students and interns Through education, training and outreach, guide local, state and national health care organizations in the development and implementation of appropriate services for the needs of the aging population, including individuals in need of A IM Maintain active relationships and leadership roles with local and national organizations FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 201 9, Sharp HospiceCare provided training opportunities for five students studying nursing and ancillary disciplines. Academic institution partners included CSUSM, San Diego State University (SDSU), and University of California San Diego . Students dedicated more than 530 hours to shadow ing nurses and providers during their work day, including at Sharp HospiceCare's three hospice ho mes. Sharp HospiceCare supports San Diego's future health care workforce through classroom -based lectures designed to enhance students' understanding of hospice and palliative care. In FY 201 9, education was provided to more than 300 nursing students from Azusa Pacific University, SDSU and CSUSM, as well as to more than 30 social work students from SDSU. Topics included ACP, goals of care, hospice, bioethics and bereavement. In February, Sharp HospiceCare hosted its 2019 Resource and Education Expo at t he San Diego Performing Arts Center. Themed #Compassion: Being Human in a High Tech World, the event provided approximately 100 community health care professionals \u2014 including nurses, social workers, physicians and spiritual care providers \u2014 with tools to balance modern -day technology and the provision of compassionate patient care. The expo aimed to help attendees achieve the following educational objectives: understand therapeutic communication strategies to support difficult end -of-life conversations; di scuss how technological advances have changed palliative and end -of- life care; and analyze the role of technology in changing provider -patient interactions in health care. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 226 Sharp HospiceCare provided education and training on end -of-life topics, including bioethics at the end of life, spiritual care in hospice, palliative care and WHV, to approximately 425 local community health professionals throughout the year . Audiences included attendees of the SGH Heart and Vascular Conference , members of the Caregiver Coalition and members of the Professional Chaplains Education group. In addition, team members provided planning support for the CSU Institute for Palliative Care at CSUSM and SDCCC's Fourth Annual Professional P alliative Care Conference , as well as conti nued to participate in the HSAG/Sharp Grossmont Care Coordination Collaborative \u2014 a group of community nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies that convene to develop strategies to reduce hospital readmissions and improve patient care coordination. In addition, Sharp HospiceCare partnered with fire departments in SDC's south and east regions to train approximately 70 community first responders how to more effectively respond to emergency calls involving end -of-life patients. Ofte ntimes, end -of- life patients are taken to the hospital where they receive care that might conflict with the treatment plan established with their hospice team. Sharp HospiceCare teaches first responders to determine whether an end -of-life care patient shou ld receive medical attention, or if it is more appropriate for the patient's hospice team to intervene. Sharp HospiceCare leadership provided education, training and outreach to nearly 3,700 state and national health professionals throughout the year. The se efforts sought to guide industry professionals in achieving person -centered, coordinated care through the advancement of innovative hospice and palliative care initiatives. Audiences included the 19th annual Population Health Colloquium; The Doris A. Ho well Foundation for Women's Health Research; Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) National Seminar; CPAC NHPCO; Coalition to Transform Advanced Care National Summit; Geriatrics and Pain Management for Primary Care Conference; AAHPM ; Los Robles Regional Medical Center; American Hospital Association; and Baylor Scott & White Health . Presentation topics included palliative care, prognostication and innovative approaches in advanced illness care. Sharp HospiceCare leadership also continued to serve on the board of directors for NHPCO and CHAPCA in FY 2019 . FY 20 20 Plan Sharp HospiceCare will do the following: Continue to provide education and training opportunities for nursing and ancillary students Provide students with an end -of-life learning environment in community -based hospice homes Continue to partner with fire departments in SDC to educate first responders about appropriate responses to emergency calls involving end -of-life patients Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 227 Continue to provide education, training and outreach to local, state and national organizations to support the development and implementation of specialized services to meet the needs of the aging population Maintain active relationships and leadership roles with local and national organizations Identified C ommunity Need: Bereavement Counseling and Support Rationale references the findings of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale A study on the end -of-life priorities of terminally ill older adults and their caregivers identified seven major themes: quality of life as a priority; maintaining a sense of control; how to manage putting life on hold during a loved one's life -limiting illness; challenges in navigating the heal th system; preference for remaining at home as long as possible; a need for open and honest discussions about death; and the importance of a consultative, patient -centered care approach by health professionals (Health Expectations , 2019). Bereavement care is one of the core services provided by hospice. Under Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regulations, hospices must provide support to family members for 13 months following the death of a loved one. These services can take a variety of forms, inc luding telephone calls, visits, written materials about grieving and support groups (NHPCO, 2018). According to the NHPCO, grief may be experienced in response to physical losses, such as death, or in response to symbolic or social losses, such as divorce or loss of a job. The grief experience can be affected by one's history and support system. Engaging in self -care practices and accessing counseling and support services can be a guide through some of the challenges of grieving as a person adjusts to his o r her loss (NHPCO, 2018). According to research presented by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the following variables were associated with complicated grief \u2014 a state of persistent and pervasive grief causing distress and disability: age younger than 60 years; lack of perceived available social support; history of depression and current depression; lower income; pessimistic thinking and severity of stressful life events (NCI, 2019). According to the Journal of Psychosocial Oncology Research & Practice, care and death at home contribute to family members' perceptions of a \"good death,\" leading to less bereavement -related distress. However, some features of a palliative care death may be uniquely traumatizing for vulnerable individuals, with the potential to impact bereavement. Family caregivers need access to flexible services to support care and death at home, together with ongoing assessment of their needs (Lobb et al, 2019). Unpaid caregivers contribute $450 billion of health care labor each year, ofte n in addition to full - or part -time employment. Over half (55%) of caregivers report feeling overwhelmed by the demands of caregiving, and many experience intense feelings of loneliness and social isolation. In the aftermath of a care recipient's death, ma ny Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 228 caregivers report feeling guilt, depression, lack of purpose and loneliness (Crossroads Hospice Charitable Foundation, 2016). A 2016 study published in the Biomedical Care Journal of Palliative Care identified two core bereavement issues for family care givers: the consequences of traumatic deathbed experiences on caregiver grief and feelings of guilt; and a 'void' effect caused by withdrawal of professional support immediately after death. These core issues have implications for clinical practice, emphas izing a need for improved communication between health care professionals and families, including education on broader aspects of the physical dying process as well as more effective engagement and discussion with families on end -of-life care planning and decisions. In addition, health providers must strengthen bereavement support resources for caregivers prior to death, and provide more effective follow -up approaches following the care recipient's death (Harrop et al, 2016). According to a study published in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, caregivers who receive support and resources from health professionals prior to the death of their loved one may report a more positive death experience for the care recipient, a s well as greater satisfaction with the clinical care team. Pre -bereavement interventions may also affect caregivers' level of grief as well as physical and mental health following their loved one's death (Aoun et al, 2018). Objective Provide bereavement education, resources, counseling , support and referrals for community members who have lost loved ones FY 201 9 Report of Activities Sharp HospiceCare offers a variety of bereavement services to help grieving community members cope with the loss of a lo ved one. Services include professional bereavement counseling for individuals and families as well as free community education, support groups and monthly newsletter mailings. In FY 201 9, Sharp HospiceCare's licensed clinical therapists with specific tra ining in grief and loss devoted nearly 2,400 hours to home -, office - and phone -based bereavement counseling with people who have lost loved ones. Referrals to community counselors, mental health services, bereavement support services and other community resources were also provided as needed. Sharp HospiceCare continued to offer its eight -week Healing After Loss support grou p series, which addressed the concerns of adults who were grieving the loss of a loved one and reached approximately 220 attendees in FY 201 9. This included Sharp HospiceCare's traditional quarterly support group held at Sharp's corporate office in Kearny Mesa, as well as a new group offered during the fall and winter quarters at the John D. Spreckels Center and Bowling Green in Coro nado. Support groups focused on the following themes : Introduction to the Grief Process; Communicating with Family and Friends; Strategies for Coping with Grief; Mind -body Tools for Grief; Dealing with Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 229 Challenging Emotions in Grief; Guilt, Regret and Forgi veness; Use of Ceremony and Ritual to Promote Healing and Who Am I Now?/What Does Healing Look Like?. Sharp HospiceCare also continued to offer The Widow's and Widower's support group , which addressed the concerns of men and women who lost their spouse and served approximately 130 attendees in FY 2019 . Participants had the opportunity to share their emotional challenges and learn coping skills from group members facing similar life situations. In recognition of Mother's Day and Father's Day, Sharp Hospice Care hosted two Remembering Our Parents classes for adults who have lost a parent. Held at the Point Loma/Hervey Branch Library in April and the GHD in May , the classes focused on the unique aspects of parent al loss, as well as strategies to cope with grie f and discover a sense of hope during these holidays . Nearly 30 community members attended the Remembering Our Parents classes in FY 2019 . Sharp HospiceCare supported approximately 90 community members grieving the loss of a loved one during the 201 8 holiday season. In November, Sharp HospiceCare held its annual Healing Through the Holidays event at Sharp's corporate office, which included presentations focused on helping community members cope with grief during the holiday season . That same month, two si milar events titled Coping with Grief During the Holiday Season were offered at the Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church and the GHD . These events provided practical suggestions for community members to manage the painful feelings of loss that often ar ise during the holidays. Sharp HospiceCare also continued to mail its monthly bereavement support newsletter, Healing Through Grief, to community members for 13 months following the loss of their loved one. More than 1,300 newsletters were mailed each mo nth during FY 201 9. FY 20 20 Plan Sharp HospiceCare will do the following: Continue to offer individual and family bereavement counseling for community members who have lost a loved one Continue to provide referrals to community services Continue to provide a variety of free bereavement support groups Continue to provide events and support services for individuals grieving the loss of a loved one during the holiday season Continue to mail monthly bereavement support newsletters to loved o nes of patients who have passed Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 230 Sharp HospiceCare Program and Service Highlights ACP Bereavement care services Caregiver and family support Classes, events and physician referral through 1 -800-82-SHARP Homes for Hospice program , including Hospice Hospice nursing services therapies Management for various hospice patient conditions, including: Alzheimer's disease Cancer Debility Dementia Heart disease Human Immunodeficiency Virus Kidney disease Liver disease Pulmonary disease Stroke Music therapy Social services support Spiritual care services Volunteer program WHV programSharp Metropolitan Medical Campus Providing Comprehensive Medical Care Sharp Metropolitan Medical Campus Sharp Metropolitan Medical Campus, centrally located in the County of San Diego, offers a range of specialty hospitals and medical services.

Through the San Diego Food Bank's Diaper Bank Program, Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns helps provide free diapers to families facing economic hardship. Since joining the Diaper Bank Program in July 2019, Sharp Mary Birch has distributed nearly 1,000 diapers to patients in need. The impact is significant; not only does an adequate supply of diapers reduce a child's risk of health problems, but children also become eligible for day care, which enables their parents to return to work. As a Diaper Bank Program partner, Sharp Mary Birch is proud to help low-income San Diegans achieve financial security and care for their families.

Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 234 Figure 25: Percentage of Community Benefit by SB 697 Category Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns \u2014 FY 2019 Key highlights: Medical Care Services included uncompensated care for patients who were unable to pay for services and unreimbursed costs of public programs, such as Medi -Cal, Medicare and CHAMPVA/TRICARE. In FY 2018 , the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services a pproved a Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019. This resulted in recognition of net supplemental revenues for SMBHWN totaling $ 18.2 million in FY 201 9. These supplemental revenues were funded through SMBHWN's traditional Medi -Cal program, which was only in a shortfall position of $10.2 million prior to the fee. As such, the net impact of the program was to reduce SMBHWN's shortfall in traditional Medi -Cal to $0.00 (zero ). This reimbursement helped offset prior years' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 2019 understate the true unreimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year . Other Benefi ts for Vulnerable Populations included financial assistance for van transportation for patients to and from medical appointments ; contribution of time to Stand Down for Homeless Veterans, Feeding San Diego and the Sharp Humanitarian Service Program ; and ot her assistance for vulnerable community members.

SMBHWN staff actively participated in community boards, committees and other civic organizations, such as the American Heart Association (AHA), Council of Women's and Infants' Spec ialty Hospitals (CWISH), Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN), Perinatal Social Work Cluster, March of Dimes and the National Institute for Children's Health Quality (NICHQ) Best Fed Beginnings Learning Collaborative . See Appendix A for a listing of Sharp's involvement in community organizations in FY 201 9. The category also included costs associated with planning and operating community benefit programs, such as community health needs assessmen t (CHNA) development and participation . Health Research, Education and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training for health care professionals, student and intern supervision, and generalizable health -related research projects that were made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community SMBH WN is located at 3003 Health Center Drive in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. As a specialty hospital, SMBHWN serves all of San Diego County (SDC) ; however, the primary communities served by the hospital include the City of San Diego, Chula Vista, the east regi on and the north inland communities surrounding Rancho Bernardo. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries. For Sharp Memorial Hospital's (SMH's) 2019 CHNA process (which included the processes and findings addressing needs identified for communities served by SMBHWN), the Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) was utilized to identify communities with greater health disparity within the county. The CNI identifies the severity of health dispa rity for every ZIP code in the United States (U.S.) based on specific barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and pr eventable hospitalizations. According to the CNI, communities served by SMBHWN with especially high need include, but are not limited t o, Southeast San Diego, East San Diego, City Heights, Linda Vista and Downtown San Diego . Figure 26 presents a map of the CNI scores across SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 236 Figure 26: CNI Map \u2014 SDC93 Description of Community Health In 2019, there were 585,707 women ages 18 to 44 residing in SDC, representing 17.5% of the population. Between 2019 and 2024, it is anticipated that the number of women of childbearing age in SDC will decline by 0.4% .94 In 201 7, 13.3% of the SDC population reported living below 100 % of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemp loyment rate was 6.8% and 5.0 % of households received Supplemental Security Income (SSI) .95 According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7, or 14% of SDC's population experienced food insecurity96 in 2017. An additional 1 in 5 San Diegans were food secure but relied on supplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget.97 In 2017, 7.2% of households in SDC participated in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 19.9% of the population lived a t or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program.95 Please refer to Table 38 for SNAP participation and eligibility in SDC. 93 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018. 94 SpeedTrack, Inc; U.S. Census Bureau . 95 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency , Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit (2019), 2017 Demographic Profiles: San Diego County ; U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -year estimates 2013 -2017 96 Food security me ans access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food -nutrition -assistance/food -security -in-the-us/. 97 San Diego Hunger Coalition (2019), Hunger Free San Diego Issue Brief: 2017 San Diego County Food Insecurity .

In addition, this year SMH completed its most current implementation strategy \u2014 a description of programs designed to address the priority health needs identified in the 2019 CHNA. Again, in alignment with federal regulations, the SMH 2019 implementation strategy includes programs and services provided by SMBHWN. The SMH 2019 CHNA and implementation strategy are available http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Through the SMH 2019 CHNA, the following priority health needs were identified for the communities served by SMH and SMBHWN (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Concerns Behavioral Health (including Substance Use) Cancer Chronic Health Conditions (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes and Obesity) Community and Social Support Economic Security Education Homelessness and Housing Instability Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy Unintentional Injury and Violence SMBHWN is a specialty hospital providing care for expectant mothers and newborns as well as women's services. Therefore, in alignment with these identified needs, the following pages detail programs that specifically address maternal and prenatal care, including high-risk pregnancy . This section also describes programs tha t address access to health care, community and social support, economic security and education. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs desig ned to address access to health care. As a specialty hospital, SMBHWN lacks the resources to comprehensively address the elements of community education and support for the remaining identified needs . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 241 Consequently, the programs and services that address these health issues are provided through SMH. Please refer to Section 10 of this report for details on those programs. The community education and support elements of behavioral health (including substance use) are addressed through the programs and services provided through Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use services in SDC. Please refer to Sectio n 11 of this report for details on those programs. For additional details on SMBHWN programs that specifically address the needs identified in the 2019 CHNA, please refer to SMH's implementation strategy available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health - needs -assessments.cfm . For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2019 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s) and FY 2020 Plan. Identified Community Need: Maternal and Prenatal Care, Including High -Risk Pregnancy Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The SMH 2019 CHNA identified maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SMH. According to data presented in the SMH 2019 CHNA, among women admitted to SMBHWN in 2017 with a high -risk pregnancy, the top three diagnoses were classified as pregnancy in a mother over the age of 35 (80.0%), pregnancy resulting from assistive reproductive technology (8.4%) and pregnancy with insufficient prenatal care (4.8%). This data analysis also indicated that, while babies identified as Hispanic or Latino represented 33.5% of all inpatient discharges for infants (under one year) at SMBHWN in 2017, they accounted for 37.9% of LBW discharges.106 In addition, in 2017, 38.7% of inpatient discharges related to prematurity at SMBHWN were paid for by Medi -Cal. As part of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, facilitated discussions with SMBHWN case managers, social w orkers and a nurse educator identified the following health conditions that impact Sharp's maternal and prenatal patients: diabetes; preterm pregnancies; short interval pregnancies; substance use; and mood disorders, including postpartum depression and anx iety. Discussions also identified the 106 In OSHPD's inpatient hospital discharge and emergency department datasets, patient race and ethnicity are two distinct characteristics. Patients s elf-identify their race as one of the following: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; White; or Other Race. The ethnicity category is used to determine whethe r a patient is of Hispan ic origin, and an individual identified as Hispanic may be of any race (OSHPD 2019; U.S. Census Bureau, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 242 following social determinants of health (SDOH ) affecting their patients: limited access to behavioral health services, even for the insured; lack of access to transportation; and economic stress related to childcare an d maternity leave. Participants also identified the following strategies to improve women's health: build awareness of the importance of preconception and prenatal care; establish more options for home health care for postpartum women; increase lactation c onsulting and services; increase availability translation services; create an interdisciplinary care team; provide inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services; and improve communication between physicians and pharmacists. In 2017, SDC had 2,658 LBW births, which accounted for 6.5% of all live births. When compared to all other racial groups, t he proportion of LBW b irths in SDC was highest among b lack infants (10.1%). In 2017, 149 infants in SDC died before their first birthday. The infant mortali ty rate was 3.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births . There were 28,147 hospitalizations due to maternal complications in SDC in 2017, a 2.1% decrease from 2016. The age -adjusted rate was 1,843.0 per 100,000 population.107 In 2017, 34,946 live births received early prenatal care in SDC, which translates to 85.6% of all live births in the region. According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), prenatal care has been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes, and is among the most frequently used health care services in the U.S. Experts recommend prenatal care with early and ongoing risk assessment for all women, with content and timing tied to the needs and risk status of the woman and her fetus (NCHS, 2018). A 2017 report from the Children's Initiative titled San Diego County Report Card on Children and Families identified the following barriers to utilization of prenatal care: financial barriers, such as a lack of health insurance; the context of care, such as biased treatment from providers or low cul tural competence; and access issues, such as transportation, difficulty obtaining an appointment or inconvenient hours. In 2016, 77.1% of pregnant women in the U.S. initiated prenatal care in their first trimester (NCHS, 2018). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), health -related factors known to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes include uncontrolled diabetes around the time of conception, obesity and heart disease, smoking during pregnancy and high blood pressure (CDC, 2018). According to 2018 CHIS data, 24.7% of women ages 18 to 65 years in SDC were obese (Body Mass Index > 30), lower than the state of California overall (27.2%). According to the CDC, being overweight increases the risk of pregnancy complications, including pree clampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth and cesarean delivery (CDC, 2018). 107 The definition of maternal complications is based on analysis of ICD -10 codes conducted by the County of San Diego H ealth and Human Services Ag ency Community Health Statistics Unit. In 2018, the definition of maternal complications included 666 ICD -10 codes, however it was expanded in 2019 to include 1,827 ICD -10 codes. Notable conditions now included in this definition include: supervision of hi gh-risk pregnancy, gestational or preexisting diabetes, preterm labor and/or delivery, complications related to sexually transmitted infections, maternal alcohol or drug use, and sexual, physical or psychological abuse of the mother. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 243 Factors associated with preterm birth include maternal age, race, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, substance use, stress, prior preterm births, carrying more than one baby, and infection (CDC, 2019). According to March of Dimes data, the rate of preterm births \u2014 the largest contributor to infant death in the U.S. \u2014 increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2018 to 10.0%. Racial disparities related to early labor persist: 11.3 % of American Indian/Ala ska Native babies and 13.6% of b lack babies were born preterm. Black women are 49% more likely to deliver preterm compared to women of all other racial/ethnic groups (March of Dimes, 2019). In 2018, the average societal cost of a preterm birth in California was $75,000, including medical care for premature children, maternal delivery costs, early intervention services, special education services and lost productivity (March of Dimes, 2019). Strategies for reducing preterm birth and maternal death include protecting comprehensive health care coverage for moms and children; providing women with affordable, quality p ublic health insurance programs; extending Medicaid coverage to postpartum women; expanding group prenatal care; research ing the causes of maternal death; addressing racial disparities in health outcomes for moms and babies; removing barriers to care in underserved communities; and investing in public health promotion programs that focus on moms and babies (March of Dimes, 2019). Objectives Develop, coordinate and provide educational programs for the community on maternal and prenatal care topics, including preterm labor and births Provide education as needed to community members who are susceptible to high - risk pregnancy Educate community members about available hospital resources through participation in community events Identify and disseminate evidence -based best practices to improve outcomes of at - risk newborns through the Sharp Mary Birch Neonatal Research Institute ( NRI) FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 201 9, SMBHWN conducted a variety of efforts to support healthy pregnancies for expectant mothers, including teenagers and other high -risk populations, and improve outcomes for at -risk newborns. The hospital offered a free, monthly Preterm Birth Prevention class, which taught approximately 80 expecting parents about the warning signs of preterm labor and how to help prevent a premature birth. Through Sharp's health and wellness partnership with the City of San Diego, SMBHWN's perinatal educator led three session s of the Preterm Birth Prevention class at community sites in SDC, including the Mission Valley Branch Library in April, the Valencia Park/Malcolm X Branch Library in June, and the Otay Mesa - Nestor Branch Library in September . In addition, in April, SMBHWN taught a Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 244 free, four -class Child Birth Preparation series for community members at the North Park Branch Library. Additional prenatal education was offered throughout the year on the Sha rp Metropolitan Medical Campus as well as at the Sharp Mary Birch Education Center in Carlsbad. New in FY 2019, this included six free Planning for Pregnancy events , which provided pre -pregnancy education to more than 100 community members. Topics included preparing for pregnancy, tips for conceiving, and becoming pregnant following a previous pregnancy loss, as well as when to see a specialist, natural fertility, and other reproductive options. Other educational classes provided at both locations in FY 2019 covered topics includ ing, but not limited to: sibling preparation; preparing families with dogs for a baby; how the body prepares for birth and delivery; hospital procedures; medication choices; caesarean delivery; labor comfort and relaxation skills; ba sic infant care; breastfeeding; preparing for multiple births; and prenatal yoga. In FY 201 9, SMBHWN provided financial support to March of Dimes, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality throug h community and global outreach programs and research. SMBHWN also provided fundraising support for the AHA 201 9 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk, while hospital leadership helped organize the annual AHA Go Red for Women Luncheon to support greater research a nd action to address women's heart health. In addition, in April, team members provided information about the hospital's community programs and services at the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference , held at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina . In 2013, the Sharp Mary Birch NRI was launched to discover new, leading -edge treatments and practices in newborn care, and disseminate its research findings to improve outcomes for at -risk newborns throughout the world . Led by a multidisciplinary team of physician s, nurses, respiratory therapists, researchers and data analysts, the NRI has participated in more than 40 clinical trials with over 2,000 newborns enrolled . The NRI values the community's perspective in shaping the future of care provided in the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ). Through the NRI Parent Advisory Board (NRI- PAB) , parents and grandparents of infants who have been in the NICU offer the NRI their unique point of view as parents of a NICU baby, including feedback on proposed and curre nt clinical trials to help ensure that other parents understand and feel comfortable participating in them. In addition, NRI -PAB members may participate on Sharp's Institutional Review Board when a new trial involving babies is presented and may be involve d in the decision to either approve, change or disapprove of a trial. The NRI shares its expertise and groundbreaking research developments throughout the greater health care and research communities. In February , the NRI presented on umbilical cord mana gement for newborns who may need additional support at birth at the Society for Maternal -Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada . The NRI also presented at multiple international conferences throughout the year, including: Internationa l Neonatology Association Conference in Tijuana, Mexico; Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 245 Neonatal Cardiology & Hemodynamics Conference in Durham, England; and the Conference on Neonatology, Gynecology and Obstetrics in Panama City, Panama. In addition, t he NRI continued to offer a Bedsid e Ultrasound Training for Neonatologists course \u2014 a multi -week training that consists of hands -on, one -on-one training sessions and expert lectures on theoretical and practical ultrasound technique for neonatologists. Open to local, regional, national and international neonatologists, the course is one of only a few similar training programs in the country. The NRI's medical discoveries have been featured by multiple news networks and publications , including ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX 5 San Diego, KNSD, KPBS, KSW B, The San Diego Union -Tribune, Del Mar Times , American Association for Respiratory Care, and National Institutes of Health (NIH). In addition, its research findings have been shared in several distinguished medical journals . In FY 2019, this included the Journal of the American Medical Association , American Journal of Perinatology , The Journal of Pediatrics and Frontiers in Pediatrics . The NRI has received funding support from personal donations as well as from various foundations and organizations , including Gerber Foundation, Thrasher Research Fund, Little Giraffe Foundation , Alexander and Eva Nemeth Foundation, Cushman Foundation, and Will Rogers Institute. In addition, the NRI has received four grants from the NIH, including most recently in July 2018 to support its leadership of an international, multi -hospital (including Sharp Grossmont Hospital) study on umbilical cord milking and its benefits to the long -term health of infants who need resuscitation at birth. This is the largest and most compr ehensive study of its kind with the potential to improve how babies are cared for worldwide. In addition to its groundbreaking research, the NRI works closely with SMBHWN's Nemeth NICU Follow -Up Clinic, which provides neurodevelopmental assessments, testing and early interventions to promote optimal growth and success for babies born preterm or with other conditions that place them at risk for developmental delay. The services and interventions provided by the Nemeth NICU Follow -Up Clinic help validat e the results of the NRI's innovative research studies. FY 20 20 Plan SMBHWN will do the following: Continue to o ffer monthly Preterm Birth Prevention classes at the hospital Provide at least one Preterm Birth Prevention class at a community site in SDC Continue to provide fundraising support for March of Dimes Provide education and outreach at community health fairs and events Continue the work of the NRI to identify and disseminate evidence -based best practices for newborn care to the health care commu nity Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 246 Identified Community Need: Maternal Care - Meeting the Needs of New Mothers and their Families Rationale references the findings of the SMH 201 9 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The SMH 2019 CHNA identified maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SMH. As part of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, facilitated discussions with SMBHWN c ase managers, social workers and a nurse educator identified the following health conditions that impact Sharp's maternal and prenatal patients: diabetes; preterm pregnancies; short interval pregnancies; substance use; and mood disorders, including postpar tum depression and anxiety. Discussions also identified the following SDOH affecting their patients: limited access to behavioral health services, even for the insured; lack of access to transportation; and economic stress related to childcare and maternit y leave. Participants also identified the following strategies to improve women's health: build awareness of the importance of preconception and prenatal care; establish more options for home health care for postpartum women; increase lactation consulting and services; increase availability of translation services; create an interdisciplinary care team; provide inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services; and improve communication between physicians and pharmacists. Further, participants in the Shar p Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs provided the following suggestions specific to maternal and infant care to improve community health: offer fun preventative care opportunities, such as outdoor activities to promote healthy die ts or mother/mother -to-be informational events with a socializing component; provide prenatal care and delivery for mothers who cannot afford it; and advocate for improved access for the underserved, such as insurance coverage, particularly for stigmatized services like behavioral or sexual health. In 2017, SDC ranked 18th out of 50 California counties for in -hospital exclusive breastfeeding at 78.9% (California Women, Infants, Children ( WIC) Association and University of California ( UC) Davis Human Lactation Center, A Policy Update on California Breastfeeding and Hospital Performance, San Diego County: 2017 Data , 2019). According to data presented by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) , in 2018, 95.9% of SDC mothers began breastfeeding in the hospital, higher than the state of California overall (93.8%). Mothers in SDC were also more likely to exclusively breastfeed in the hospital (79.3%) when compared to all California mothers (70.4%). According to the 2017 San Diego Coun ty Report Card on Children and Families , breastfeeding enhances immunity to disease, decreases the rate and severity of infections in children, is associated with improved development and decreased risk of childhood obesity, and reduces lifelong risks for chronic health problems. Mothers Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 247 who breastfeed may have a reduced risk of breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers, quicker postpartum recovery time, and less work missed due to child illness (Children's Initiative, 2017). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for approximately the first six months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding with complementary foods for one year or longer ( AAP, 2017). According to a report titled Sustaining Change in Challeng ing Times, while breastfeeding is a natural process, most mothers need support during the ir hospital stay to overcome common challenges. Mothers who experience supportive practices during the ir hospital stay are more likely to breastfeed exclusively than t hose who do not (California WIC Association and UC Davis Human Lactation Center, 2019). Findings from the CDPH's 2018 Maternal and Infant Health Assessment indicated that in 2015, 20.5% of California mothers experienced depressive symptoms during pregnancy or postpartum. Black and Latina women, women with low socioeconomic status, and Medi -Cal insured women are all at higher risk for depressive symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period (CDPH, 2018). Maternal depression is the most common pregnancy complication, occurring more frequently than gestational diabetes and preeclampsia combined (California Task Force on Status of Maternal Mental Health Care, 2017). The American Psychological Association (APA) identifies several risk factors for developing postpartum depression, including a change in hormone levels after birth; prior experience with or family history of depression, anxiety or mental illness; stress related to caring for a newborn; having a baby who is difficult to comfort, or who has challe nging sleep and hunger needs; having a baby with special needs; first -time, very young or older motherhood; emotional stressors such as the death of a loved one or family problems; financial or employment problems; and isolation or lack of social support ( APA, 2016). According to research published in the Zero to Three journal, the \"fourth trimester\" refers to the transition period after childbirth when infants are adjusting to life outside the womb and mothers are adjusting to new parenthood. This critical period is marked by significant biological, psychological, and social changes, which are currently insufficiently supported. Issues may overlap and include maternal mood and emotional well -being; infant care and feeding; sexuality, contraception and birth spacing; sleep and fatigue; physical recovery from childbirth; and medications, substances and exposures. By addressing these needs, service providers can improve health across two generations (Verbiest, Tully & Stuebe, 2017). A 2018 committee opinion pap er from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) titled Optimizing Postpartum Care recommends that physicians treat postpartum care as an ongoing and tailored process between mother, provider and community resources, beginning within the first three weeks postpartum and concluding with a comprehensive postpartum visit no less than 12 weeks after birth (ACOG, 2018). Objectives Demonstrate best practices in breastfeeding and maternity care Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 248 Provide education and support to new mothers on the importance of breastfeeding Provide postpartum education and support to new mothers and their families Provide resources for vulnerable patients and families FY 201 9 Report of Activities In November 2015, SMBHWN received Baby -Friendly USA Designa tion through the Baby -Friendly Hospital Initiative \u2014 a global program launched by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund to encourage and recognize hospitals and birthing centers that offer an optimal level of care for infant feeding and mother -baby bonding. The hospital earned the five -year designation through participation in the NICHQ Best Fed Beginnings Learning Collaborative, supported by the CDC, and through implementation of the 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the International Code of Marketing of Breast -milk Substitutes. SMBHWN received this designation in partnership with First 5 San Diego, which provided grant funding needed to fulfill the staff training hours required for the designation. The Baby -Friendly U SA Designation requires specific competency training for registered nurses (RNs) who work with both mothers and babies. At the close of FY 2019, 97% of the RNs currently employed by SMBHWN had completed this training who were required to do so, while the remaining 3% were in progress with their training. In total, more than 430 SMBHWN RNs have completed Baby -Friendly USA competency training from the time the hospital was designat ed. Since SMBHWN started its Baby -Friendly journey in 2011, the rate of exclus ive breastfeeding at discharge has increased from a baseline average of 47 % to a current rate of 60%. In FY 201 9, SMBHWN served nearly 1,700 new mothers through a free breastfeeding support group. Facilitated by an experienced lactation educator, the grou p was offered three times per week to teach participants techniques to improve breastfeeding and allow participants to share their personal breastfeeding joys and challenges. SMBHWN continued to offer the Baby and Me Time support group to ensure new parents safely transition from giving birth at the hospital to returning home. Understanding that it can be difficult to retain information received at the hospital, this free, weekly support group provides valuable resources to help new parents adjust onc e leaving the hospital. The group provides an opportunity to share the experiences and responsibilities of new parenthood as well as develop new friendships. All parents from the community are invited to participate in Baby and Me Time, which includes a mi x of working moms, military families with a parent stationed overseas, single parents and stay-at-home parents. Serving more than 180 new parents in FY 201 9, this unique group has evolved into a community -centered place of support during an often - challengi ng time. SMBHWN provided specialized education and support during the year through free postpartum support group s led by licensed clinical social workers . A weekly group provided emotional support to mothers in the community with babies of newborn age up to 12 months who were dealing with feelings of anxiety or depression related to the challenges associated with new motherhood. A range of topics were addressed during Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 249 the groups, including feelings of isolation, parenting struggles, postpartum mood disord ers, how to seek support, professional referrals, and coping strategies. Understanding that postpartum depression and anxiety can also affect fathers, SMBHWN offered a monthly postpartum support group for couples . Together, the hospital's postpartum suppor t groups engaged nearly 470 parents in FY 2019. Throughout the year, SMBHWN offered a variety of educational classes for new mothers and their families covering numerous aspects of postpartum care, including infant sleep patterns and strategies, infant massage, mom and baby yoga and Pilates , and the body's recovery process following pregnancy and birth . Additionally, SMBHWN staff devoted approximately 500 hours to daily Family Home Care classes that provided critical information and support to nearly 4,0 00 new mothers and family members. Topics included car seat safety, sudden infant death syndrome, shaken baby syndrome, breastfeeding, jaundice, and signs and symptoms of illness among mothers and babies. Free NICU cardiopulmonary resuscitation education w as also provided to nearly 700 family and friends of the hospital's NICU babies. In October, SMBHWN hosted its 23rd annual NICU Little Graduate Reunion a t the Naval Training Center in Liberty Station . The hospital hosts the special event for families to reunite with the team members who cared for their child during their stay in the NICU, and celebrate the health of their child. The same families often return to the reunion year after year, with many of the graduates now in their teens. In FY 201 9, approxi mately 8 00 parents, grandparents, siblings and NICU graduates attended the reunion where they enjoyed food, games and activities while reuniting with SMBHWN team members. Scientific evidence shows that exclusive breastmilk feeding provides the healthiest start for a newborn's life, especially very premature babies. However, exclusive breastfeeding is not possible for mothers who experience challenges with breastmilk supply and feeding. Pasteurized donor human milk can make breastfeeding possible for these mothers. For more than 13 years, SMBHWN has been a donor breastmilk depot, regularly shipping donated breastmilk to the Mother's Milk Bank in San Jose, CA, where it is screened, pasteurized and distributed to community hospitals for infants whose mothers h ave an insufficient breastmilk supply. In 2015, SMBHWN started SDC's first Donor Breastmilk Drive to help increase the supply of breastmilk for the Mother's Milk Bank. During the FY 201 9 milk drive in August , nearly 130 community members donated approximat ely 45 gallons of breastmilk, which is expected to provide more than 22,600 feedings to premature infants and others with specialized health needs. To date, the annual drive has collected approximately 330 gallons of breastmilk from nearly 180 donors. SMBHWN expands its support for community mothers and families through the New Beginnings Boutique & Gift Shop. Located within the hospital, the boutique provides easy access to needed supplies, such as nursing bras and breastfeeding pumps. The boutique's l actation educators are available to answer questions and provide breastfeeding resources and support to anyone who calls or visits the shop. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 250 New in FY 2019 , SMBHWN collaborated with the San Diego Food Bank's (Food Bank's) Diaper Bank Program to help solve a critical challenge \u2014 namely, the expense of diapers, which are often required to enroll a child in daycare \u2014 for families facing economic hardship . Since becoming a Diaper Bank Program distributor in July, SMBHWN has provided nearly 1,000 free diapers for patients in need . In summer 2015, SMBHWN launched a program to evaluate eligibility for SSI for newborns who have been diagnosed with a disabling medical condition or extremely low birth weight .108 This benefit is offered to both unfunded patients as well as insured families to assist with the cost of care for their newborn within and outside of the hospital. Since the inception of the program, Sharp's Public Resource Specialists have assisted more than 280 families through the SSI application process. In addition, Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SMBHWN . Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. New in FY 2019, SMBHWN joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE) to better understand and address the SDOH that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH \u2014 the conditions where people li ve, learn, work and play \u2014 have a significant impact on the ability for community members to access care and maintain their health. SMBHWN joined the CIE pilot partnership in order to provide more informed, holistic maternal, pre - and post -natal care to pa tients with SDOH needs, and to connect them directly to community resources specifically for those needs. More than 70 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology p latform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared community member records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and current use of community programs and services, and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. Beginning in summer 2019, SMBHWN case managers and social workers received training on CIE as a tool to serve vulnerable patients in the acute care setting, including those new mothers and families experiencing economic and food insecurit y. Metrics of this partnership, including demographic and utilization data, as well as volume and successful community referrals, are currently being collected and will help to assess the impact and value of the partnership at the end of its pilot year in early summer 2020. FY 20 20 Plan SMBHWN will do the following: Continue to offer free postpartum, breastfeeding and new -parent support groups Continue to offer educational classes covering a variety of postpartum care topics 108 Extremely low birth weight is defined as birth weight less than 1,000 grams (approximately 2 pounds, 3 ounces). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 251 Host a donor milk drive to collect breast milk for the San Jose Mother's Milk Bank to support infants whose mothers have an insufficient supply Participate in the Food Bank's Diaper Bank program to provide diapers for families facing economic hardship Continue to evaluate eligibility of high -risk newborns for SSI benefits and provide referrals for application assistance Evaluate the impact of the pilot year of the Sharp -CIE partnership to inform next steps in collaboration with community organizations to address SDOH Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest in Health Care Careers Rationale references the findings of the SMH 201 9 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified education as one of 10 priority health conditions and SDOH affecting members of the communities served by SMH . According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 31% of respondents ranked education, including access, health literacy, workforce development and economic mobility, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. Accordin g to participants in a focus group conducted during the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, when residents are unable to achieve higher levels of education , individual and community health are impacted in the following ways: limited or low -wage employment opportunities for those with low educational attainment; constant stress related to housing or food among families who are not economically secure, which contributes to poor health; and limited career mobility in low -wage jobs, creating little potential for promotions or h igher wages. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, in 2018, there were 157,756 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 9% of all jobs countywide (SDWP, 2019). According to a 2017 report from the SDWP titled San Diego's Priority Sectors: An Update on Labor Force and Training Needs , the health care industry in SDC experienced net employment growth of 40.4% between 2006 and 2016 \u2014 considerably higher than the growth rate in the state of California (27%) and the nation (21%) (SDWP, 2017). The report also found that health care employers identified RNs, physicians and surgeons, and health technologists and technicians as the most difficult positions to fill. The most frequently cited reasons for hiring difficulties we re lack of experience, small applicant pools and insufficient non -technical skills (SDWP, 2017). According to SDWP, a major challenge faced by education and training programs in the health care sector is accommodating the number of clinical training hours required for students in California to become certified. In addition, the health care Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 252 industry is facing significant changes due to uncertainty related to legislation and technology, as well as the growing demand for services to support California's aging population (SDWP, 2017). Total employment in California is projected to grow 10.7% between 2016 and 2026, reflecting an increase of 1.9 million jobs statewide over the decade. The health care and social assistance sector is expected to be the fastest growi ng industry in California, with 24.9% growth anticipated (California Employment Development Department , 2018). In its Employment Projections - 2018 -2028 report, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that health care support occupations and hea lth care practitioners/ technical occupations will contribute about 30% of all new jobs and account for 18 of the 30 fastest growing occupations. Increased demand for health care services for an aging population and people with chronic conditions will driv e much of the expected employment growth (BLS, 2019). As of 2018, SDC was one of 28 counties in California designated as a Registered Nurse Shortage Area by the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission (OSHPD Registered Nurse Shortage Areas Update , 2019). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) projects that the demand for RNs in California will increase 71% by 2030 if current levels of health care are maintained. The report projects that California will need to hire an additional 26,270 nurses to meet the demand (BHW, 2018). According to forecasting performed by the Healthforce Center at U niversity of California , San Francisco (UCSF) , the demand for primary care clinicians in California will increase 12% t o 17% by 2030. These forecasts predict that the southern border region will experience some of the highest levels of clinician shortages in the state. UCSF recommends a comprehensive and holistic targeted strategy to enhance the education pipeline, improve recruitment and retention, maximize the existing workforce, and leverage workforce data (UCSF, 2017 -2018). According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) titled California Physician Supply: Headed for a Drought?, the total supply of active patient care physicians in California declined slightly between 2013 and 2015, a trend that appears to be driven by the aging of the physician workforce. In SDC, nearly a quarter of practicing physicians were ages 60 and older i n 2015 (CHCF, 2018). The same report found that 32% of California's active patient care physicians were primary care physicians. In SDC, there were 112.3 specialty physicians practicing per 100,000 residents in 2015, compared to 49.8 primary care physician s per 100,000 residents (CHCF, 2018). According to a report from PolicyLink, a national research institute dedicated to advancing economic and social equity, building a diverse health care workforce in California \u2014 one that reflects the state's racial, eth nic and linguistic diversity \u2014 is a critical strategy for increasing access to culturally and linguistically appropriate services, eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities, improving the quality of care and reducing preventable costs ( Building an In clusive Health Workforce in California: A Statewide Policy Agenda, 2018 ). A report by the California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) titled Meeting the Demand for Health identified several strategies to recruit and maintain Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 253 California's health c are workforce, including offer health career pipeline programs for students from low -income backgrounds; provide academic, advising and health career development support to underrepresented college students; expand educational programs that train students to provide health care in underserved communities and provide scholarships for low -income students (CFHWC, 2019). Objectives Collaborate with local schools, colleges and universities to provide opportunities for students to explore and train for a variety of health care professions Provide education and training for students interested in health care careers Provide obstetrical, gynecological and neonatal education and training for health care professionals Participate in local and national organiza tions to share specialty expertise and enhance learning for the broader health care community FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 201 9, SMBHWN served as a training site for more than 170 nursing students and seven ancillary students who spent approximatel y 19,300 hours on the SMBHWN campus. Academic institution partners included California College San Diego, Concorde Career College, Grand Canyon University, Grossmont College, Keck Graduate Institute, Pima Medical Institute, Point Loma Nazarene University, San Diego State University, University of San Diego, University of Victoria , U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Dietetic Internship Program and Western Governors University . In FY 201 9, SMBHWN completed its 1 3th year of participation in the Health Scien ces High and Middle College (HSHMC) program, providing valuable health care experience, including job requirements and career ladder development, to ninth through 12th grade students. During the school year, 24 HSHMC students devoted nearly 5,200 hours to rotations with maternal infant services, the NICU and the transport team. In September, SMBHWN collaborated with SMH to provide the annual Nursing Career Development Fair to support the professional development of students who are interested in pursuing a career in nursing as well as nurses within the community. Held at the SMH Outpatient Pavilion , the fair provided approximately 100 attendees with advice and coaching from professional nurses as well as information on financial aid and scholarships, clinical certifications, student loan forgiveness and medical library services. In addition, representatives from California and State un iversities offered information about their nursing and allied health programs. In FY 201 9, SMBHWN continued to share its expertise in women's and newborn care with local and national health professional s. In September, a nurse from SMBHWN represented the hospital at the annual CWISH Conference in Denver, Colorado through participation on a panel discussion focused on best practices in leadership rounding. In addition, SMBHWN team members participated in organizations such as March of Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 254 Dimes, AWHONN, Perinatal Social Work Cluster and the NICHQ Best Fed Beginnings Learning Collaborative. FY 20 20 Plan SMBHWN will do the following: Continue to collaborate with colleges and universities on internships, exter nships and other professional training opportunities for students Continue to participate in the HSHMC program Provide a career development fair for current and future nurses Continue to participate in local and national collaboratives and share specialty expertise at professional conferences Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 255 SMBHWN Program and Service Highlights Breastmilk donor program in collaboration with the Mother's Milk Bank Classes, events and physician referral through 1 -800-82-SHARP Cord blood banking (private and public) Doula program FollowMyHealth\u00ae, a secure online patient website that gives patients convenient, 24 - hour access to their personal health information Gynecologic oncology High-risk pregnancy care (Perinatal Special Care Unit) Hearing screening program (inpatient and outpatient) Lactation services (inpatient and outpatient) Labor and delivery Level III NICU Maternal Infant Services Unit Nemeth NICU Follow -Up Clinic NRI Newborn critical congenital heart disease screenings New Beginnings Boutique & Gift Shop Obstetrical and women's triage services Postpartum support groups Pregnancy, childbirth and parent education programs Prenatal/Antenatal Diagnostic Center Sharp Baby mobile pregnancy tracking app and education platform Spiritual care services, includi ng Arts for Healing program Women's and infants' pathology services Women's surgery, including minimally invasive robotic gynecology surgery Sharp Memorial HospitalEmpowering Pregnant Women With Diabetes Sharp Memorial Hospital Living with diabetes can be challenging, especially during pregnancy. As a California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program Sweet Success affiliate, Sharp Memorial Hospital helps improve outcomes for underserved pregnant women with preexisting or gestational diabetes. Through the Sweet Success program, the hospital's diabetes educators are trained to provide psychosocial and nutrition interventions for these high-risk women. The diabetes educators collaborate with community clinics to teach women how to manage their blood sugar through meal planning, exercise and self-care. Women also learn how to properly check their blood glucose levels and administer insulin. And through education about the risks associated with uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy, women are empowered to make important lifestyle changes for the long-term health of themselves and their babies. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 257 Section 10 Sharp Memorial Hospital To me, being an exceptional community citizen means that no one is a stranger. Each patient receives equal care, respect, and consideration because our community thrives when we flourish together . \u2014 Tim Smith, Chief Executive Officer, Sharp Memorial Hospital Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Community Benefit Program Highlights Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH) provided a total of $173,689,097 in community benefit in FY 2019. See Table 4 4 for a summary of unreimbursed costs based on the categories specifically identified in Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), and Figure 27 for the distribution of SMH's community benefit among those categories.

Costs for patients paid through the Medicare program on a prospective basis also include payments to third parties related to the specific population. 110 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for services at the time the services were rendered. 111 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured , underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children's Program, or costs may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits, plus costs for supplies, materials and other purchased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of providing service s. Unreimbursed costs wer e estimated by each department responsible for providing the program or service. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 258 Figure 27: Percentage of Community Benefit by SB 697 Category Sharp Memorial Hospital \u2014 FY 2019 Key highlights: Medical Care Services included uncompensated care for patients who are unable to pay for services and unreimbursed costs of public programs, such as Medi -Cal, Medicare , CMS and CHAMPVA/TRICARE. In FY 2018, the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servi ces approved a Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of January 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019. This resulted in recognition of net supplemental revenues for SMH totaling $1 3.9 million in FY 201 9. This reimbursement helped offset prior years' u nreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 201 9 understate the true unreimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year . Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations included van transportation for patients to and from medical appointments; flu vaccinations and specialized education and information for seniors offered by the SMH Senior Resource Center and Sharp Senior Health Centers; Project HELP , which provides fundi ng for specific needs (e.g., medications, etc.) to assist lower -income patients ; contribution of time to Stand Down for Homeless Veterans, Feeding San Diego and the San Diego Food Bank (Food Bank); the Sha rp Humanitarian Service Program and other assistanc e for vulnerable community members.

In addition, SMH donated meeting room space to community groups as well as collaborated with local schools to promote student interest in health care careers. SMH staff actively participated in community boards, committees and other civic organizations, including the Serra Mesa Planning Group Board, San Diego Blood Bank Board of Directors, American College of Healthcare Executives, San Diego Organization of Healthcare Leaders, Association of California Nurse Leaders, San Diego Chapter of the American Association of Critical -Care Nurses, Emergency Nur ses Association - San Diego Chapter, County of San Diego Emergency Medical Care Committee, Trauma Center Association of America Board of Directors, Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, National Association of Catholic Chaplains, San Diego County St roke Consortium, Adult Protective Services, San Diego County Regional Human Trafficking And Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Advisory Council , Serving Seniors, Community Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired, San Diego Brain Injury Foundation (SDBIF) Board of Directors, Caregiver Coalition of San Diego (Caregiver Coalition) and San Diego County Council on Aging (SDCCOA) . See Appendix A for a listing of Sharp HealthCare's (Sharp's) involvement in community organizations in FY 2019. The category also incorporated costs associated with community benefit planning and administration, including community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation. Health Research, Educa tion and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training of health care professionals, student and intern supervision, and time devoted to generalizable health -related research projects that were made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community SMH is located at 7901 Frost Street in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. Sharp Memorial Outpatient Pavilion (OPP) is located at 3075 Health Center Drive in San Diego, ZIP code 92123.

See Appendix B for a map of community and re gion boundaries in SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 260 For SMH's 2019 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) was utilized to identify communities with greater health disparity within the county. The CNI identifies the severity of health disparity for every ZIP code in the United States (U.S.) based on specific barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care, and preventabl e hospitalizations. According to the CNI, communities served by SMH with especially high need include, but are not limited t o, East San Diego, City Heights, Linda Vista, the College Area and Downtown San Diego. Figure 28 presents a map of the CNI scores across SDC.

Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 261 Description of Community Health In 2019, there were 504,267 residents ages 65 and older in SDC, representing 15.1% of the population. Between 2019 and 2024, it is anticipated that SDC's senior population will grow by 22.4%.114 In 2017, 13.3% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemployment rate was 6.8% and 5.0% of households received Supplemental Security Income.115 According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7, or 14% of SDC's population experienced food insecurity116 in 2017. An additional 1 in 5 San Diegans were food secure but relied on supplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget.117 In 2017, 7.2% of households in SDC participated in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 1 9.9% of the population lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program.115 Please refer to Table 45 for SNAP participation and eligibil ity in SDC.

SMH's 2019 CHNA was significantly influenced by the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) 2019 CHNA process and finding s. Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process and findings. In accordance with federal regulations, the SMH 2019 CHNA also includes needs identi fied for communities served by Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 264 (SMBHWN), as the two hospitals share a license, and report all utilization and financial data as a single entity to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD ). In addition, this year SMH completed its most current implementation strategy \u2014 a description of SMH programs designed to address the priority health needs identified in the 2019 CHNA. The most recent CHNA and implementation strategy for SMH are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Through the SMH 2019 CHNA, the following priority health needs were identified for the communities served by SMH (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Concerns Behavioral Health (including Substance Use) Cancer Chronic Health Conditions (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) , Diabetes and Obesity) Community and Social Support Econo mic Security Education Homelessness and Housing Instability Maternal and Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy Unintentional Injury and Violence The following pages detail SMH programs, activities and services that specifically address aging concer ns, cancer, chronic health conditions, community and social support (these programs also help address access to health care, economic security and homelessness and housing instability), education and unintentional injury. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. SMH does not have the resources to comprehensively address the identified need of behavioral health (including substance use). Consequently, this identified need is addressed through the programs and services provided through Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital (SMV ) and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use services in SDC. Please refer to Section 11 of this report for details on those programs. SMH and SMV are conveniently located on the Sharp Metropolitan Medical Campus (SMMC). The identified need of maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, is addressed at SMBHWN, a specialty hospital providing care for women, newborns and expectant mothers in SDC, also located on the SMMC campus. Please see Section 9 of this report for details on SMBHWN's services that address this identified community need. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 265 Obesity is addressed through general nutrition and exercise education and resources provided at SMH as well as programs that address a healthy lifestyle as part of care for heart disease, cancer, diabetes and other health issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Group (SRSMG) clinics throughout SDC provide community members structured weight management and health education programs such as smoking cessation and stress management , long-term support for weight management and fat loss , and personalized weight -loss programs. For additional details on SMH programs that sp ecifically address the needs identified in the 2019 CHNA, please refer to SMH's implementation strategy available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessm ents.cfm . For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2019 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s), and FY 2020 Plan. Identifie d Community Need: Diabetes Education, Prevention and Support Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified chronic conditions, including diabetes, as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SMH. Data analysis in the SMH 2019 CHNA revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to Type 2 diabetes in communi ties within SDC facing greater socioeconomic challenges.121 According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of emergency department ( ED) visits for diabetes in SDC increased 7.2% from 2014 to 2016, with the most significant increases in individua ls ages 27 to 44 ( 13.9%) and those identified as b lack/African American (15.1%). According to data presented in the SMH 2019 CHNA, in 2017, the top three ED and inpatient Type 2 diabetes diagnoses at SMH included Type 2 diabetes (uncomplicated), Type 2 dia betes with Chronic Kidney Disease, and Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 51.0% of respondents ranked diabetes (Types 1 and 2) among the top five health conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditi ons such as diabe tes, including lack of access to healthy food; lack of transportation; physical 121 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson 2018; OSHPD via SpeedTrack\u00a9, Inc., 2017 . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 266 limitations or limited mobility; high health care costs; economic insecurity; low health literacy; poor health behaviors, such as unhealthy diet or lack of physical activity; medication management; unsafe neighborhoods and unstable or complete lack of housing. Participants in the Sharp diabetes educator focus group conducted as part of the SMH 2019 CHNA process identified several barriers to effective diabetes management, includ ing challenges associated with pharmacies, insurance policies and finances (including co -pays, loss of income due to time off work and the cost of transportation to medical appointments); fear related to job loss or immigration status; and lack of knowledg e or cultural beliefs about food and illness. The Sharp diabetes educator focus group also identified the following barriers associated with diabetes management: isolation and loneliness; stigma, particularly when it is reinforced by physicians; lack of su pport from family members; and difficulty managing co -morbidities including cardiovascular issues, kidney issues, neuropathy and vision issues. In 2017, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in SDC. In 2017, there were 799 deaths due to diabetes in SDC overall , an 8.9% increase when compared to 2016 (734 deaths). The age -adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 21.5 per 100,000 population.122 In 2017, there were 4,292 hospitalizations due to diabetes in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalization w as 122.9 per 100,000 population in 2017, which was slightly higher than the age -adjusted rate in 2016 (120.9 per 100,000 population). In 2017, there were 5,717 diabetes -related ED visits in SDC, a 10.6% increase from 2016 (5,168 ED visits). The age -adjuste d rate of diabetes -related ED visits was 165.0 per 100,000 population in 2017, which was higher than the age -adjusted rate in 2016 (151.9 per 100,000 population). According to 2018 CHIS data, 9.8% of adults living in SDC indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was slightly lower than the state of California (10.1%). Diabetes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 20.5% of SDC adults over 65 reporting that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes. According to 2018 CHIS data, 17.3% of SDC residents had been told by their doctor that they have pre - or borderline diabetes. A study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Health Policy Research estimated that 13 million adults in California (46%) have p rediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes, while another 2.5 million (9%) have already been diagnosed with diabetes (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2016). Data presented by the United Health Foundation (UHF) indicates that, in 2017, diabetes prevalence i n California was highest among American Indian/Alaska Natives (24.8%), followed by individuals of other race (16.4%), non -Hispanic blacks (14.8%) and Hispanics (12.1%) (UHF, 2018). 122 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death usin g methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2017. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all rankable causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile. \" (County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2019; Heron, M., Deaths: Leading causes for 2017. National Vital Statistics Reports; vol. 68 no 6. Hyattsville, Maryland: NCHS. 2019 ). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 267 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than tripled in the last 20 years (CDC, 2019). According to the CDC's 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report , 87.5% of adult s diagnosed with diabetes were overweight or obese. To prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, the CDC recommends lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthier and getting regular physical activity. The CDC estimates that 30.3 million people in the U.S. have diabetes. Of those individuals, 1 in 4 is not aware they have the disease (CDC, National Diabetes Statistics Report , 2017). The CDC identif ies diabetes as the leading cause of kidney failure, non -traumatic lower -limb amputations and new cases of blindness among adults (CDC, 2017). Objectives Provide diabetes education, prevention and support in the central and north central regions of SDC Collaborate with community organizations and projects to p rovide diabetes education to SDC's vulnerable populations Participate in local and national professional conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community FY 2019 Report of Activities The SMH Dia betes Education Program is recognized by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) for meeting national standards for excellence and quality in diabetes education covering blood sugar monitoring, medication and nutritional counseling as well as insulin pump and other device training. The program is led by certified diabetes educators who provide individuals and their support systems with the skills needed to successfully self -manage various conditions, including prediabetes, gestational diabetes (diabetes dev eloped during pregnancy), and Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Small group and one -on-one education options are offered in English and Spanish. In FY 2019, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program (Sharp's systemwide diabetes program) offered diabetes education and support to approximately 1,000 attendees at the Sharp Women's Health Conference. This included diabetes risk assessments using the ADA's Diabetes Risk Test questionnaire as well as resources on the different types of diabetes; diabetes prevention; sign s, symptoms and complications of diabetes; the connection between diabetes and CVD; nutrition and reading food labels; exercise; medication; and diabetes self -management. Also during the conference, a Sharp diabetes expert presented on the prevention and m anagement of Type 2 diabetes, including helpful diets, physical activity and the power of lifestyle change. In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided fundraising and team participation for the San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk at Balboa Park i n September. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 268 The SMH Diabetes Education Program provided education and lectures to a variety of community groups in FY 2019. In November, the SMH Diabetes Education Program educated nearly 15 seniors on diabetes and the power of lifestyle change at the Peninsula Family YMCA in Point Loma. At Point Loma Nazarene University's (PLNU's) Festival of Health event, the SMH Diabetes Education Program provided health education in English and Spanish, as well as diabetes risk assessments using ADA's Diabetes Risk Te st questionnaire to 20 community members. Through Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego, the SMH Diabetes Education Program discussed exercise and diabetes as well as navigating the road to health with 10 community members at the Lopez Ridge Recre ation Center in March. In addition, the SMH Diabetes Education Program presented on how to check blood sugar levels as well as the latest in diabetes medication and nutrition to more than 20 seniors at Balboa Park in April. Also in April, the SMH Diabetes Education Program educated 10 community members at OPP's Cushman Wellness Center on using a holistic approach to manage diabetes, diabetes risk factors and ways to reduce risk. The SMH Diabetes Education Program is actively involved with San Diego's renal health community. In FY 2019, the program collaborated with the Balboa Institute of Transplantation and the Sharp Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program to provide ongoing diabetes education and support to more than 150 community members who are either an ticipating or have undergone kidney transplant or have experienced kidney disease. In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to collaborate with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) to provide education to patients with diabetes at multiple FHCSD sites , including those in the central region of SDC, through the organization's Diabetes Management Care Coordin ation Project (DMCCP). Through DMCCP, Sharp's diabetes educators provide weekly group health and nutrition education, healthy cooking demonstrations, physical activity classes, and one -on-one support from a nurse practitioner to the clinics' diabetes patie nts. Further, project \"graduates\" offer peer support and education to current enrollees in both English and Spanish. The project monitors participants' physical activity as well as their A1C and blood glucose levels, which it has proven to successfully mai ntain and lower. At FHCSD's Logan Heights, City Heights and Diamond Neighborhoods locations, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided more than 20 lectures in English and Spanish to more than 180 community members. Topics included creating an active lifestyle; nutrition, including the effect of food groups and serving sizes on blood sugar levels; and diabetes risk factors, symptoms, treatment, self -management and goal setting. In 2019, 32.5% of those enrolled in DMCCP saw a decrease in their overall A1 C results. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program is an affiliate of the California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program's Sweet Success Program, which provides comprehensive technical support and education to medical personnel and community liaisons to promote improved outc omes for high -risk pregnant women with diabetes. As an affiliate, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 269 the Sharp Diabetes Education Program teaches underserved pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with Type 1, Type 2 or gestational diabetes how to manage their blood sugar levels. In colla boration with community clinics, in FY 2019, the team provided these patients with a variety of education and resources to support a healthy pregnancy. Education covered the following topics: gestational diabetes statistics; new diagnostic criteria; treatm ent and management of blood glucose levels; goals for blood sugar levels before and after a meal; insulin requirements; self -care practices; nutrition and meal planning; exercise and weight management; monitoring fetal movement; and the risks and complicat ions of uncontrolled diabetes. Clinic patients also received logbooks to track and manage their blood sugar levels. In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program evaluated patients' management of their blood sugar levels and collaborated with community clinics' obstetrician -gynecologists to prevent complications. At SMH, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided services and education to nearly 400 underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women with diabetes. Throughout the year, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to provide services and resources to meet the needs of culturally diverse populations within SDC. Educational resources included How to Live Healthy With Diabetes; What You Need to Know About Diabetes; All About Blood Glucose fo r People With Type 2 Diabetes; All About Carbohydrate Counting; Getting the Very Best Care for Your Diabetes; All About Insulin Resistance; All About Physical Activity With Diabetes; Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Seven -Day Menu Plan; and Food Groups. Resou rces were provided in Arabic, Somali, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish, and food diaries and logbooks were distributed for community members to track their blood sugar levels. In addition, live interpreter services were available in more than 200 languages via the Stratus Video Interpreting iPad application. Further, Sharp team members received education regarding the different cultural needs of diverse communities to improve the delivery of inclusive and culturally competent care. In FY 2019, the Sharp Dia betes Education Program supported the professional health care community through participation in various conferences and meetings. At the Liberty Station Conference Center in May, team members gave a presentation titled Obesity, Diabetes and Cardiovascula r Disease to approximately 250 health professionals during Sharp's Obesity Crisis Conference. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program's presentation cov ered multiple topics, including the history and prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in the U.S.; testing for diabetes; the link between diabetes, CVD and obesity; decreasing risks; and weight management. In June, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program attended the ADA's 79th Scientific Sessions conference in San Francisco, California. The conference shared res earch advances to improve the lives of people with and affected by diabetes with more than 15,000 international attendees. In addition, in August, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program presented on the Use of Outcomes Data and Marketing Strategies to Sustai n Diabetes Programs to approximately 200 health professionals at the American Association of Diabetes Educators' 2019 Annual Conference in Houston, Texas. In November, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program hosted a diabetes conference for Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 270 physicians, nurse s, pharmacists, laboratorians, clinical and managerial leaders and other community health professionals interested in optimizing inpatient diabetes care. The conference provided 150 participants with specific tools and strategies for creating a culture tha t supports and encourages emerging therapeutic trends in glycemic management in a hospital setting. Topics included treating patients with Type 2 diabetes; cardiovascular risk for patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes; new insulin products and their pote ntial benefits; metabolism and weight loss in those using insulin; automated insulin infusion algorithms; and insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring. In addition, in FY 2019 the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided diabetes education \u2014 includ ing the different types of diabetes, diagnoses, current technology and medication, and careers in diabetes education \u2014 to more than 20 nurse practitioner students at San Diego State University (SDSU), as well as mentored two dietetic interns from the San D iego Women, Infants , and Children program.

FY 2020 Plan The SMH and Sharp Diabetes Education Programs will do the following: Provide community members with prediabetes and diabetes information at various community venues in the central and north central regions of SDC Explore collaborations to assist and educate food insecure community members Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide diabetes education and resourc es to residents in the city's nine districts Explore additional opportunities to provide community -based diabetes education classes Continue to collaborate with FHCSD to provide education and resources to their patients with diabetes Continue to provide ge stational diabetes services and resources to underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women, both at the hospital and in collaboration with community clinics Participate in Tour de Cure \u2014 the ADA's signature fundraising event to fight diabetes \u2014 as well as t he San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk Maintain up -to-date resources to provide community members support with diabetes treatment and prevention, particularly foreign language and culturally appropriate resources for diverse populations Continue to participate i n local and national professional conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community Conduct educational symposiums for health care professionals focused on improving outpatient and inpatient diabet es care Continue to host a diabetes conference for health care professionals Explore collaboration with SMH's Cardiac Rehab and Cardiac transplant teams to offer quarterly diabetes education to community members Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 271 Explore collaborations with community servi ce organizations that focus on diabetes prevention and care Partner with community physicians to help them improve patient outcomes using technology, including insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors Identified Community Need: Education, Support and Screening for Stroke Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified chronic conditions (including CVD and cerebrovascular diseases/stroke) as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SMH. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, r ates of ED visits for stroke in SDC increased 11.0% from 2014 to 2016, with the most significant increases in individuals ages 27 to 44 (20.0%) and those identified as \"other\" race (28.9%). Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of th e HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNA identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions, including: limited access to healthy food; lack of transportation; physical limitations or limited mobility; high health care costs; economic insecurity; low health li teracy; poor health behaviors, such as unhealthy diet or lack of physical activity; medication management; unsafe neighborhoods; and unstable or complete lack of housing. Participants in the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group conducted as part of the Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified the following hospital discharge challenges and barriers for patients, including those with chronic conditions: transportation support; a shortage of recuperative or respite care options; a lack of short -term caregivers and in-home support services; and a need for a streamlined process from the hospital to the County of San Diego H ealth and Human Services Agency (H HSA) for those who qualify for wraparound support. In 2017, cerebrovascular diseases including stroke were the f ourth leading cause of death for SDC overall. In 2017, there were 1,376 deaths due to stroke in SDC. The age -adjusted death rate due to stroke was 37.0 per 100,000 population, which was higher than the HP2020 target of 34.8 deaths per 100,000.122 In 2017, there were 6,078 hospitalizations for stroke in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations for stroke was 166.9 per 100,000 populat ion, a 7.4% decline from 2016. In 2017, there were 2,603 stroke -related ED visits in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits was 71.4 per 100,000 population. According to 2018 CHIS data, an estimated 26.3% of SDC adults were obese, 11.0% were current smok ers, 9.8% reported that they were not physically active at Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 272 all, and 17.7% reported that fresh fruits and vegetables were only sometimes affordable in their neighborhood. According to the CDC, more than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke each year, an d strokes are responsible for approximately one out of every 20 deaths (CDC, 2017). The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) reports that 25% of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within five years (NINDS, 2019). The CDC estimates that up to 80 % of strokes are preventable through the recognition of early signs/symptoms and the elimination of stroke risk factors. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include choosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate -intensity aerobic physical activity each week, refraining from or quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake (CDC, 2018). Objective Provide stroke educati on, support and screening services for the central region of SDC FY 2019 Report of Activities SMH is certified by the Joint Commission and the American Heart Association (AHA )/ American Stroke Association (ASA) as a Primary Stroke Center (recertified in 2017). The program is nationally recognized for its outreach, education and thorough screening procedures, as well as documentation of its success rate. SMH is also a recipient of AHA/ ASA's Get With The Guideline s\u00ae (GWTG) \u2014 Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award for excellence in stroke care as well as the Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation. The AHA/ASA's GWTG is a national effort focused on ensuring the use of evidence -based therapies to improve outc omes for stroke patients. The AHA/ASA's Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation focuses on improving the timeliness of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t -PA) administration to eligible patients. During Stroke Awareness Month in May, Sharp' s systemwide stroke program participated in Stroke Awareness Day at the Padres, held at Petco Park. This annual event is organized by the San Diego County Stroke Consortium, the County of San Diego HHSA, the San Diego Padres and other key partners to promo te stroke prevention, awareness and recovery, as well as celebrate stroke survivors. During the baseball game, Sharp offered stroke and blood pressure screenings, education about the warning signs of stroke and how to respond using B.E. F.A.S.T. (Balance, Eyes, Face, Arms, Speech, Time) \u2014 an easy technique to detect and enhance responsiveness to a stroke. Giveaways were provided throughout the evening, while stroke educa tion was displayed on the Jumbot ron to the entire stadium of nearly 30,000 community mem bers. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 273 In FY 2019, SMH participated in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide stroke education and resources to residents in the city's nine districts. In March and July, three classes led by a stroke program nurse provided 50 community members with education on risk factors, treatment options, and preventing and recognizing the signs of a stroke. Lecture locations included Logan Heights Branch Library, Balboa Park Senior Lounge and Serra Mesa -Kearny Mesa Branch Library. In addition, in O ctober, SMH provided more than 110 community members with stroke education, including the warning signs and symptoms and what to do in the event of a stroke, at a senior health and resource fair at Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church. At the event, approximately 25 attendees were screened according to their personal risk factors. The SMH Stroke Program also collaborated with the Sharp Grossmont Hospital ( SGH ) Senior Resource Center to provide stroke education and resources to seniors in February. Through this collaboration, the SMH Stroke Program and a Sharp -affiliated vascular neurologist delivered a presentation on emergency treatment for stroke and strategi es to prevent a stroke, as well as provided stroke resources to approximately 30 community members at Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church in May. The SMH Stroke Program also conducted personal health interviews as well as blood pressure and pulse chec ks for 11 seniors at the event. The SMH Rehabilitation Center continued to provide meeting space for Young Enthusiastic Stroke Survivors (YESS), a free monthly support group for survivors of stroke and head injuries and their loved ones, as well as profe ssionals and educators. Educational topics included brain function, coping skills, adjustment, disaster preparedness, driving, health and wellness, medications, stress management, family and intimacy, work and school re -entry, and support. More than 20 com munity members attended the YESS support group each month in FY 2019. In addition, SMH actively participated in the quarterly San Diego County Stroke Consortium, a collaborative effort with other SDC hospitals to improve stroke care and discuss issues im pacting stroke care in SDC. SMH also continued its 14 -year collaboration with the County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to provide data for the SDC stroke registry. FY 2020 Plan SMH Stroke Program will do the following: Provided stroke s creening and education at events in SDC, including those targeting seniors and high -risk adults Continue to provide a community presentation on stroke education and prevention featuring a Sharp -affiliated physician Provide education for individuals with i dentified stroke risk factors Continue to participate in Stroke Awareness Day at the Padres Continue to participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide stroke education and resources to residents in the city's nine districts Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 274 Contin ue to offer stroke support groups through the SMH Rehabilitation Center Continue to participate in the San Diego County Stroke Consortium Continue to provide data to the SDC stroke registry Identified Community Need: Health Education, Screening and Supp ort for Aging Concerns Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified aging concerns as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SMH. Aging concerns are defined as those conditions that predominantly affect seniors \u2014 people who are 65 and older \u2014 such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, falls and limited mobility. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of inpatient discharge in SDC increased for Alzheimer's disease (35.1%) and dementia (16.3%) from 2014 to 2016. According to data presented in the SMH 2019 CHNA, in 2017, se niors represented 54.1% of discharges for unintentional injury at SMH, with fall -related injuries occurring in 85.3% of those discharges. Data analyzed as part of the SMH 2019 CHNA indicated that seniors admitted to SMH with a behavioral health d iagnosis were more likely to have dementia (31.4%) when compared to all behavioral health inpatient discharges (14.8%). Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified the following health conditions that impact older adults: Al zheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, dementia, arthritis, loss of mobility, opioid misuse, diabetes, heart disease, anxiety, depression, lung disease, obesity, and poor oral health. In addition, the focus group s identified the following social determinants of health (SDOH) that impact seniors: lack of accessible or reliable transportation options; difficulty accessing fresh food; social isolation and inadequate family support; economic insecurity; and environmental pollutants. According to the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 83% of respondents ages 65 and older ranked aging concerns among the top five conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. As part of the SMH 2019 CHNA, focus groups comprise d of Sharp Senior Health Center staff and patients, as well as community members, identified the following SDOH that impact seniors: few transportation options; lack of access to fresh food; social isolation and inadequate family support; economic insecuri ty; housing issues; and environmental pollutants, including sound. Participants indicated that these issues contribute to a loss of independence, leading to increased stress, isolation, loneliness and poor mental health. Sharp senior health focus group par ticipants suggested the following strategies for increasing health care access for seniors: establishing a centralized communication Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 275 database so that patient information can be shared across health care systems; creating and promoting programs to assist se niors with transportation to medical appointments and grocery stores; expanding meal delivery services; expanding behavioral health care options for Medi -Cal and Medicare patients; and increasing the availability of translators. In 2017, Alzheimer's diseas e was the third leading cause of death in SDC for all age groups. In 2017, the top 10 leading causes of death among adults ages 65 and older in SDC were (in rank order): diseases of the heart, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular diseases (includin g stroke), chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes, accidents or unintentional injuries, essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, Parkinson's disease and flu/pneumonia. In 2017, hospitalization rates among seniors were higher than the ge neral population due to coronary heart disease , stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ), nonfatal unintentional injuries (including falls), cancer and arthritis . The top three causes of ED utilization among SDC residents ages 65 and older in 2017 were unintentional injuries, falls and COPD/chronic lower respiratory diseases. According to the CDC, 2.8 million older adults are treated in the ED for falls every year. One in five falls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones or a head injury, and each fall doubles the chance of falling again. These injuries may result in serious mobility issues and difficulty with everyday tasks or living independently. The direct medical costs for fall injuries are estimated at $31 billion annually (CDC, 2018 ). In 2015, more than 84,400 San Diegans ages 55 and older were living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), which accounted for 10.7% of this age group. Assuming current trends continue, by 2030, nearly 115,000 residents 55 years and olde r will be living with ADRD, representing a 36.5% increase from 2015 ( Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in San Diego County , 2018). In 2017, 69.4% of the influenza hospitalizations and 75 of the 90 influenza deaths in SDC occurred among residents ag es 65 and older. The age -adjusted rate of influenza death among this group was 16.2 per 100,000 population. According to the California Department of Aging (CDA), in 2019, 11.1% of SDC residents ages 6 0 and older were considered low income, and 17.1% were eligible for Medi -Cal coverage. In addition, 17.5% of SDC seniors were identified as living alone (CDA, 2019). According to research published in Health Affairs, an estimated 15 million family caregivers in the U.S. provide unpaid ca re for a loved one with dementia. Caregiver burden and fatigue can result in increased use of hospital and emergency services for dementia patients (Slaboda et al, 2018). The same study identified the following as the biggest challenges facing family careg ivers of individuals with dementia: dealing with memory loss and the disease's impact; handling the stress and emotional toll; having patience with their loved one; handling mood swings or behavior changes; and managing daily activities, including bathing, bathroom, dressing and meals (Slaboda et al, 2018). According to AARP, more than 40 million people in the U.S. act as unpaid caregivers to people ages 65 and older. More than 10 million of these caregivers are Millennials Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 276 with separate full - or part -time jobs, and 1 in 3 employed Millennial caregivers earns less than $30,000 per year (AARP, 2018). Objectives Provide a variety of senior health education and screening programs Produce and mail quarterly activity calendars to community members In collaboration with community partners, offer seasonal flu vaccinations for seniors and other high -risk populations Provide education and community resources to family caregivers Maintain and grow partnerships with community organizations to expand communit y outreach and provide seniors and caregivers with updated information on available services and resources FY 2019 Report of Activities Sharp Senior Resource Centers meet the unique needs of seniors and their caregivers by connecting them to a variety of free and low -cost programs and services through phone and in -person consultations.

Further, seniors, caregivers, individuals who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 278 individuals with chronic illnesses, and vulnerable adults with limited access to care, including those without transportation, were notified about flu vaccine events through activity calendars, collaborative outreach conducted by the flu clinic site, sharp.com, and paper and electronic newspaper notices. In FY 2019, the SMH Senior Resource Center and the Sharp Senior Health Centers sponsored five community seasonal flu clinics, serving more than 210 seniors and other vulnerable community members. Flu clinics were held at the Senior Health & Information Fair at Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church, Orchard Apartments low -income senior housing, Holy Trinity Catholic Church (homeless outreach), and Serving Seniors sites, including the Potiker Family Senior Residence and the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center. At many of these sites, the SMH Senior Resource Center and Sharp Senior Health Centers provided Vials of Life, information on advance health care directives (advance directives) and depression, and activity calendars detailing upcomin g blood pressure screenings, flu clini cs and other community events and programs for seniors. In FY 2019, the Sharp Senior Health Centers collaborated with SMV to provide a physician -led presentation on medications and memory loss as well as two memory loss screenings, serving approximately 2 0 community members. The Sharp Senior Health Centers also collaborated with the SMH Senior Resource Center throughout the year to provide hearing screenings to more than 20 seniors.

In addition, every participant agreed that they would recommend the classes to a friend. Sharp Senior H ealth Centers also utilized a validated, two -item food insecurity screening tool to identify food insecure participants. As a result of this program, Sharp Senior Health Centers began providing food insecurity screenings as part of annual wellness visits a s well as nutrition resources for those in need. In FY 2019, Sharp Senior Health Centers collaborated with the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP), which ensures ongoing networking among community professionals and quality programs fo r seniors. The collaboration included the provision of ongoing counseling and education by a HICAP representative to more than 70 community members at the Sharp Senior Health Center Clairemont. HICAP staff offered objective counseling on Medicare rights, b enefits and insurance policy options to address seniors' questions and concerns. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 280 Throughout the year, the SMH Senior Resource Center and Sharp Senior Health Centers maintained active relationships with numerous community organizations, including the Penin sula Shepherd Senior Center, Serving Seniors (including the Potiker Family Senior Residence and the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center), Bayside Community Center, Westminster Manor (senior housing), JFS, Caregiver Coalition, AIS, Adult Protective Se rvices, Southern Caregiver Resource Center, Alzheimer's San Diego, SanDi -CAN, SDCCOA, National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, Community Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired, Cabrillo Credit Union Supervisory Committee, Paradise Vil lage, Peninsula Family YMCA, Point Loma/Hervey Library, San Diego Square, Clairemont Lutheran Church, St. Paul's PACE, St. Peter's by the Sea Lutheran Church, Downtown San Diego Silvercrest Residence and HICAP. In addition, the Sharp Senior Health Center s provided internships to four nurse practitioner students from various universities including SDSU, University of San Diego (USD) and APU in FY 2019. Further, a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) with Sharp Senior Health Centers provided Sharp Health News (Sharp's online news center) with expert advice on when older adults may need help. FY 2020 Plan The SMH Senior Resource Center and the Sharp Senior Health Centers will do the following: Provide information, resources and support to address relevan t concerns of community seniors and caregivers, including senior behavioral health issues, ACP, memory loss, advanced illness management, caregiving, senior services, nutrition, healthy aging, and balance and fall prevention Provide community health inform ation and resources through educational programs, monthly blood pressure clinics and a variety of health screening opportunities Produce and distribute quarterly calendars for approximately 3,300 San Diego households, highlighting events of interest to sen iors and family caregivers Provide 2,500 Vials of Life to community seniors Provide seasonal flu vaccinations at four sites to seniors and community members who face challenges in accessing care, specifically vulnerable adults Participate in community health fairs and conferences, including the SanDi -CAN end-of-life conference In collaboration with the Caregiver Coalition, coordinate a conference dedicated to family caregiver issues In collaboration with Sharp HospiceCare, host an aging conference for seniors in Point Loma Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide senior health education and resources to employees and residents in the city's nine districts In collaboration with SMV's Senior Intensiv e Outpatient Program, provide education on depression, senior behavioral health , and loneliness and isolation Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 281 Continue to collaborate with Serving Seniors and SMV to provide memory screenings and education Maintain active relationships with organizations that serve seniors in Point Loma, SDC's north central and central regions, and Downtown San Diego Continue to participate in a monthly Sharp Speaker Series at the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center Explore opportunities to provide medication screeni ngs by a pharmacist for vulnerable seniors Expand programs offered to senior residences in the downtown area Continue to collaborate with the Food Bank to provide quarterly Senior Nutrition & Wellness Classes at both Sharp Senior Health Center locations Provide quarterly educational presentations to community seniors at Sharp Senior Health Center Clairemont and Potiker Family Senior Residence Continue to serve lunch to community seniors at Serving Seniors Explore educational opportunities with Paradise Vill age Retirement Community Provide free education to new Medicare enrollees at various SDC locations, including Pacific Beach and North Park Provide a presentation to community members in collaboration with Harmony Home Medical Explore opportunities in culin ary medicine123 Serve as a resource for senior health and well -being though various media sources Identified Community Need: Health Education , Support and Wellness Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer, chronic conditions, community and social support, economic security, educat ion, homelessness and housing instability, and unintentional injury and violence as the priority health issues affecting members of the communities served by SMH. In addition, maternal and prenatal care, including high-risk pregnancy was identified in the SMH 2019 CHNA as a priority health need specifically for SMH. HASD&IC focus group participants also identified health literacy as a barrier to care, and recommended several strategies t o address this issue, including culturally sensitive education about preventive care, including immunizations and health screenings; education about lifestyle choices that promote health, such as smoking cessation, nutrition and exercise; and assistance with understanding and navigating the health care and insurance systems, particularly for those who have received a serious health diagnosis. 123 Culinary medicine is a new evidence -based field in medicine that blends the art of food and cooking with the science of medicine. Culinary medicine is aimed a t helping people reach good personal medical decisions about accessing and eating high -quality meals that help prevent and treat disease and restore well -being. Population Health Management . 2016 Feb 1; 19(1): 1 -3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4739343/ . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 282 As part of the SMH 2019 CHNA, a focus group comprised of members of Sharp's Patient Family Advisory Council described lack of health education and health literacy, particularly surrounding preventive care (including immunizations), illness and disease as barriers to health care. Participants also noted that many patients and community members do not understand how to navigate the health care system, especially identifying the appropriate sites of care to meet their needs. Participants in the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNAs ranked the following health conditions and SDOH as the top 10 items with the greatest impac t on the health of community residents: understanding, securing and using health insurance; access to care, particularly primary, dental, behavioral health and specialty care; aging concerns; behavioral/mental health onomic security; heart disease; health behaviors (diet, physical and sexual activity, tobacco and substance use); and diabetes. Data analysis in Sharp's 2019 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to CVD and Type 2 diabetes in communitie s facing greater socioeconomic challenges throughout SDC.121 In 2017, diseases of the heart were the second leading cause of death for SDC. According to 2018 CHIS data, 29.0% of SDC residents had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure. Data from the 2018 CHIS also shows that 26.3% of SDC adults reported being obese. In 2018, between 25% and 30% of adults in California self -reported being obese. Obesity levels decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates (CDC, 2019). According to the CDC, some of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, su ch as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. In 2016, 39.8% of Americans were obese (CDC, 2017). According to an article titled Social and Environmental Factors Influencing Obesity , obesity prevalence is significantly associate d with sex, racial or ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status. Higher odds of obesity are attributed to multiple factors, including environments exp eriencing deprivation, disorder or high crime; proliferat ion of high -calorie, energy -dense food options th at are perceived as more affordable; and reductions in occupational and transportation -related physical activity. Both objective and subjective measures of social status and inequality are associated with increased energy intake and decreased energy expend iture, which could place individuals of low social status at greater risk of developing obesity (Lee, Cardel & Donahoo, 2019). In 2018, 17.7% of SDC adults reported that fresh fruits and vegetables were only sometimes available in their neighborhood (CHIS, 2018). According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), more than 53 million people in the U.S. either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass. Along with the financial costs, osteoporosis can reduce quality of life for man y people who suffer from fractures. It can also affect the lives of family members and friends who serve as caregivers. Preventable risk factors for osteoporosis include smoking, alcohol consumption, and medication and vitamin intake (NIH, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 283 According to research published in the Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice, approximately 80 million adults in the U.S. have limited health literacy. Limited health literacy is associated with poor health outcomes, including more hospitalization s; greater use of emergency care; lower receipt of mammography screening and influenza vaccine; poorer ability to demonstrate taking medications properly; poorer ability to interpret drug labels and health messages; and poorer overall health status among t he elderly, including higher mortality rates (McDonald & Shenkman, 2018). Objectives Host educational classes and support groups for the community on a variety of health and wellness topics Offer health literacy resources through the Cushman Wellness Cen ter Community Health Library and outreach at community events Participate in community -sponsored events and support nonprofit health organizations FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 2019, the OPP and various departments at SMH reached more than 3,400 patients and community members through free health education classes and support groups . This included approximately 1,200 program hours booked on -site at the SMMC campus as well as several opportunities provided at community sites. On-site classes covered various aspects of health and wellness, including diabetes, cancer, integrative medicine topics (e.g., yoga, meditation, food as medicine), and parenting and childbirth. Support groups provided an outlet for community members to share their personal experiences and advice for coping with various challenges, including cancer, stroke, heart transplantation, heart failure, breastfeeding, postpartum mood disorders, and nutrition and support following bariatric surgery. At the Sharp Allison deRo se Rehabilitation Center, Sharp Rehabilitation Services (Sharp Rehab) offered weekly rehabilitative tai chi and adaptive yoga classes for individuals with physical limitations. Sharp Rehab also hosted free support groups, including Women on Wheels (WOW) \u2014 the only support group in SDC for women with mobility impairments \u2014 as well as the Sharp Players and Men's Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) support groups . Twenty -five individuals participated in the Sharp Players weekly support group in FY 2019, which uses musi c and drama to facilitate emotional healing and support for individuals with a range of conditions, including brain injury, SCI, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, post -encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, amputation, mental illness, blindness, cancer and stroke. Throughout the year, members performed for approximately 175 community members at St. Paul's Villa assisted living community, SDBIF , Merrill Gardens Senior Living and the Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church senior Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 284 program . Further, the monthly Men's S CI support group offered guest speakers and special outings for its members in FY 201 9, including a trip to a Padres game. Group members also offered their own peer support to recently injured patients at SMH. The group served approximately 75 meeting atte ndees in FY 201 9 and included an additional 100 community members through an electronic resource and support network. As the official health and wellness partner of the City of San Diego, SMH hosted educational classes at sites within the SDC community. Classes included A Brief Introduction to Suicide Prevention, held at the North University Community Branch Library in September, as well as Barriers and Motivations to Exercise in Older Adults, held at the Rancho Bernardo Branch Library in May. In addition , in April, Sharp Rehab's orthopedic therapists led a class at the Peninsula Family YMCA on self -treatment strategies to ease and prevent lower back pain. The OPP offers the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library, which features a range of resou rces \u2014 including DVDs, CDs, books, pamphlets and internet access \u2014 in various languages to help patients and community members locate reliable health information. The library is led by a consumer health librarian with specialized training in community heal th as well as a store manager with expertise in health -related gifts, assistive devices and community health resources. The library publishes and distributes a quarterly newsletter to keep the public informed of pertinent health news and information as wel l as upcoming community education classes and support groups. Each quarter in FY 2019, the library mailed ap proximately 400 newsletters and electronically delivered approximately 200 newsletters to members of the community. Community members can also learn about the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library through sharp.com and may contact the consumer health librarian by email, phone or through the library's webpage. Further, t he library serves as an informational resource for all Sharp entit ies as needed . Community outreach is a high priority of the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library. In FY 2019, the consumer health librarian provided education and resources on health literacy topics as well as health -related giveaways \u2014 includ ing monthly inspirational calendars , activity tracker s, MyPlate nutrition guide magnets, and senior health resources \u2014 to library visitors as well as to approximately 3,000 individuals at community health fairs and events. This included the Sharp Senior Resource Centers' Senior Health & Information Fair at Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church , the County of San Diego AIS Vital Aging 2019 conference at the San Diego Convention Center, and the Sharp Women's Health Conference at the Sheraton San Diego Hote l & Marina . Throughout the year, the consumer health librarian also provided health literacy education to approximately 50 legally blind adults at the San Diego Center for the Blind. The consumer health librarian shares health literacy best practices wit h industry professionals through presentations and journal articles. In April, this included a poster presentation at the 2019 Community Information Exchange (CIE) Summit titled Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 285 Partnering for Health Literacy: Adding the Consumer Health Librarian into the Mix, which described the valuable resources and support that consumer health librarians can provide for both patients and their health care providers. The consumer health librarian also published two book reviews in the Journal of Hospital Librarianship in FY 2019. In FY 2019 , SMH provided health screenings, resources and support to hundreds of individuals at community health fairs and events. In June, Sharp Rehab shared information about its adaptive sports and recreation programs and community support groups at the San Diego Festival of the Arts. Throughout the year, SMH's prehospital/EMS team provided first -aid stations at various events, including the San Diego Crew Classic, the Padres Pedal the Cause cycling fundraiser for local cancer research, and th e Jazz on Tap event supporting safe drinking water and sanitation in developing countries. In addition, SMH provided coordination, support and related fundraising activities for the 201 9 AHA Heart & Stroke Walk as well as served as a blood donation site fo r Sharp's FY 2019 systemwide blood drive to collect life -saving blood for those with medical needs. SMH also supported a variety of Sharp -sponsored community events in FY 201 9. At the Sharp Senior Resource Centers' Senior Health & Information Fair in October, Sharp Rehab occupational therapists provided screenings to detect medical conditions of the hands, wrists, elbows and fingers (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, dislocations). In April, the employee safety team participated in Sharp's Drug Take Back, Document Shredding and E -Waste Event at SCVMC , which provided a safe and confidential opportunity for community members to dispose of unwanted prescription drugs, paperwork and electronics. In May, various hospital departments provided community members with a range of health education and screenings during the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference. Offerings included cancer -related education and resources; osteoporosis education and screenings; wellness services, including acupuncture, chair ma ssage and body composition testing; sports medicine and physical therapy services, including musculoskeletal screenings, posture education and walking and footwear analysis; and obstructive sleep apnea assessments. Further, in August, SMH phlebotomists sup ported SMBHWN's efforts to collect breastmilk for infants in need during the 2019 Donor Breastmilk Drive. Team members drew blood from breast milk donors that would be shipped to the San Jose Mother's Milk Bank and screened for safety. FY 20 20 Plan SMH will do the following: Continue to offer educational classes at the SMMC on a variety of health and wellness topics for community members As part of Sharp's wellness partnership with the City of San Diego, provide educational classes at community sites th roughout SDC Continue to provide support groups for community members on issues such as cancer, rehabilitation, stroke, heart transplantation and heart failure Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 286 Develop and distribute quarterly newsletters to inform the community of health education and sc reening opportunities Continue to partner with local and national organizations to provide health literacy education and resources at a variety of community sites, and share health literacy best practices with industry professionals Continue to increase awareness of the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library and its resources Provide health education, screenings and first -aid services at community events Provide coordination, support and fundraising activities for local nonprofit organizations Identified Community Need: Cancer Education and Patient Navigator Services Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified cancer as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SMH. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, cancer was the leading cause of death in SDC in 2016. Focus group s conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified cancer as a condition that many members of the community fear, particularly brain, colon and breast cancers. Participants also described barriers to receiving cancer screenings and treatment, includin g stigma surrounding a cancer diagnosis; fear about immigration status, particularly for asylum seekers; financial burdens , even for those with health insurance; and practical issues such as transportation to medical appointments. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 67% of respondents ranked cancer among the top five health conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. As part of the SMH 2019 CHNA, focus groups compris ed of Sharp cancer patient navigators and clinical social workers identified the following health conditions and SDOH related to cancer: chronic diseases such as asthma or heart disease, which are often connected to stress; care challenges associated with behavioral health and substance use; barriers to care (cost, delays in receiving care and fear related to diagnosis or immigration status; frustration with navigating health insurance; screening avoidance; logistics such as transportation or childcare; and language barriers); and fear of stigma due to cancer diagnosis. Sharp cancer patient navigator and clinical social worker focus group participants also described the following hospital discharge barriers and support needs: lack of patient or family support and education (particularly for caregivers); homelessness; health insurance issues; lack of follow -up care or access to medication; and a need Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 287 for a \"one -stop shop\" incorporating financial navigators and legal support, as well as other resources like pain management or wigs. The most frequently observed cancers at SMH in 2018 were (in rank order): breast, gynecological, lung, prostate and colorectal cancers. In total, there were 2,511 new cases of cancer at SMH in 2018. According to 2018 Sharp oncology data, 55% of the 1,349 SMH cancer patients who received the cancer psychosocial distress screening scored at a range of moderate to severe distress, and were referred to internal or external resources, such as social workers or community cancer resources. In 2017, cancer was the leading cause of death for SDC residents and was responsible for 23.2% of all deaths . There were 5,033 deaths due to cancer (all types) in SDC in 2017. The age -adjusted rate of death due to cancer was 136.7 deaths per 100,000 population in SDC.122 In 2017, 19.1% of all cancer deaths in SDC were due to lung cancer, 8.4% to colorectal cancer, 8.1% to female breast cancer, 7.6% to pancreatic cancer, 6.2% to prostate cancer, 6.2% to female reproduc tive cancers, 5.8% to liver cancer, and 3.7% to leukemia. According to the American Cancer Society ( ACS) 2017 California Cancer Facts & Figures report, 72.4% of breast cancer cases among non -Hispanic white women in SDC were diagnosed at an early stag e, com pared to 69.3% of African American cases, 68.1% of Hispanic cases and 70.4% of Asian/Pacific Islander cases. Data suggests that early breast cancer detection resources are needed in minority communities. According to findings from the ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2019 report , the 40% decrease in the female breast cancer death rate between 1989 and 2016 is attribut able to improvements in early detection, namely screening and increased awareness. The rates of new cancer cases and cancer deaths vary significan tly among racial and ethnic groups, with rates generally highest among African Americans and lowest for Asian Americans (ACS, 2019). A recent study by the ACS found that 42% of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. are potentially avoidable. Many of the known causes of the cancer \u2014 and other noncommunicable diseases \u2014 are attributable to behavioral factors including tobacco use and excess body weight due to poor dietary habits and lack of physical activity (ACS, 2018). The Journal of Oncology Navigation & Sponsorship (JONS) emphasizes the importance of patient navigators as part of a multidisciplinary oncology team with the goal of reducing mortality among underserved patients. The navigator works with the patient across the care continuum, and often make s suggestions to help manage a patient from a holistic perspective (JONS, 2019). According to the NIH, clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advances. Greater clinical trial enrollment benefits medical research and increases the health of future generations as well as improves disease outcomes, quality of life and health of trial participants (NIH, 2017). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 288 Objectives Provide cancer education and support groups to patients and community members Provide cancer resources and education at community events Provide cancer patient navigation and support services to the community FY 201 9 Report of Activities Note: SMH is accredited by the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers, indicating the highest standard of care for patients with diseases of the breast.

Utilizing the Lebed Method \u2014 an effective therapeutic program of exercise and movement \u2014 Healthy Steps classes hel p increase range of motion and prevent lymphedema among breast cancer survivors, seniors and individuals battling other chronic health conditions. The Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute provided specialized breast cancer education for individuals with an exi sting diagnosis as well as community members interested in reducing their risk. This included a free community event titled Mind, Body and Spirit: A Holistic Approach to Patient Care, held at the OPP in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October . The event educated approximately 50 community members about breast health, strategies to lower the risk of breast cancer, and holistic approaches to healing and caring for oneself and loved ones. In addition, i n October, March and July, free physi cian-led breast cancer education forums helped community members with a recent breast cancer diagnosis understand their pathology reports, the various stages of their individual cancer , and treatment options. In FY 2019, the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institu te and Neuro -Oncology Center hosted special community workshops for the cancer community. This included Living With Hope: A Brain Tumor Workshop in January, and Ignite Your Strength: A Head and Neck Cancer Workshop in April. The free workshops shared infor mation on a variety of topics relative to those affected by a brain tumor or cancer of the head and neck, including genetics and cancer risk; advances in treatment; clinical trials; nutrition; relaxation skills; ACP; and available community resources and s upport. Together, these workshops reached approximately 50 community members. In addition , the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute continued to partner with Sharp HospiceCare to provide free , monthly ACP workshops . Led by a Sharp ACP professional , in FY 2019, the workshops educated 25 Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 290 community members about the ACP process and basic tools for developing an advance health care directive. The Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute participated in several community events throughout the year. In May, team members shar ed cancer education and resources at the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference , including information about nutrition, genetic counseling, self -breast exams, and SMH's cancer support groups. In June, the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute hosted a three -day community event in recogni tion of National Cancer Survivors Day\u00ae.

In FY 201 9, the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute supported the educational development of hundreds of community health care professionals through the provision of speakers and planning support for continuing education conferences at Sharp's corporate office location. This included Procreative Planning - Part of Cancer Treatment, which focused on fertility and family planning as a dimension of cancer treatment, as well as Incorporating Updated Guidelines into the Management of Breast Cancer, which addressed changes made to the American Joint Committee on Cancer guidelines. The Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute includes the Breast Health Center and the Neuro - Oncology Center, with designated LCSWs, nurse patient navigators, genetic counselors and dietitians who support and guide cancer patients and their families from the time of diagnosis through the course of treatment. In FY 201 9, the LCSWs provided fr ee psychosocial counseling and support as well as referrals to community organizations to more than 3,000 patients and family members. Nurse navigators provided ongoing guidance for patients and families impacted by all cancer diagnoses, including breast, brain and spinal tumors, lymphomas and myeloma, melanoma, sarcoma, head and neck, lung, pancreas, stomach, bladder, colorect al, renal, prostate, testicular and gynecological. This included the facilitation of appointment scheduling; explanation of procedur es and test results; provision of educational resources and supportive services; assistance with financial resources; and referrals to multiple community agencies, including but not limited to: San Diego Homecare, Mama's Kitchen, Meals on Wheels San Diego County, JFS, Cancer Angels of San Diego, Nine Girls Ask, Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer, Informed Prostate Cancer Support Group, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, Wigs by Patti Joyce, Hair Unlimited, Women's Health Boutique, My Brigh ter Side boutique, Free to Breathe, San Diego Brain Tumor Foundation, American Brain Tumor Association, Shades of Pink Foundation California, Head and Neck Cancer Alliance, Oral Cancer Foundation, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, ACS, National Cancer Institu te, Breast Cancer Angels and the Cancer Project.

Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified unintentional injury and violence as one of the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SMH. According to data prese nted in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of ED visits for motor vehicle injuries in SDC increased 9.3% from 2014 to 2016, while deaths due to motor vehicle injuries increased 1.1%. According to data presented in the SMH 2019 CHNA, in 2017, 64.1% of inpatient injury discharges at SMH were due to a fall, 9.4% were due to natural or environmental causes, and 17.8% were due to motor vehicle traffic. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA emphasized the importance of a safe environment as a contribu tor to good health. Lack of a safe environment may encourage physical inactivity, which contributes to chronic health conditions. In addition, focus group participants described homeless individuals and refugees as two groups at increased risk of exposure to violence. In 2017, accidents (unintentional injuries) were the fifth leading cause of death for SDC overall. Unintentional injuries (i.e., motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian - related, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosions, poisoning (includi ng drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic substances), choking/suffocation, cut/pierce, exposure to electrical current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and workplace injuries) are one of the leading causes of death for SDC residents of all age s, regardless of gender, race or region. Between 2013 and 2017, more than 5,900 San Diegans died from unintentional injuries. In 2017, there were 1,188 deaths due to unintentional injury in SDC. The county's age-adjusted death rate due to unintentional inj ury was 33.7 deaths per 100,000 population. In 2017, unintentional injury accounted for 5.5% of all deaths in SDC .122 In 2017, there were 35,601 hospitalizations related to unintentional injury in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations due to unintentional injury was 1,003.7 per 100,000 population. In 2017, there were 187,438 ED visits related to unintentional injury in SDC. The age-adjuste d rate of ED visits due to unintentional injury was 5,606.3 per 100,000 population. According to a report from the San Diego County Department of the Medical Examiner, in 2018, 49% of sudden and unexpect ed deaths in SDC were attributable to accidental caus es, including poisoning, falls, traffic or train related injuries, drowning, asphyxiation or environmental exposure. California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and OSHPD injury data indicates that in 2017, unintentional injuries caused more than 13,600 deaths, 2.5 million ED visits, and 260,000 hospitalizations in California (CDPH, Safe and Active Communities Branch, 2017; SpeedTrack, Inc., 2017). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 293 In 2016, the CDC recorded approximately 29.2 million ED visits in the U.S. for unintentional injuries (CDC, 2016). In 2017, unintentional injury was the third leading cause of death across all age groups in the U.S., accounting for nearly 170,000 deaths. Unintentional injury was the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people ages one to 44, the third leading cause of death for ages 45 to 64, and the seventh leading cause of death for those over the age of 65 (CDC, 2018 -2019). According to data from National Center for Health Statistics , in 2017, nearly 140,000 deaths in the U.S. were attribut able to three caus es: poisoning (46.3%), motor vehicle traffic accidents (22.7%) and falls (21.4%). According to Live Well San Diego's (LWSD's) 2017 Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, SDC has focused its injury prevention efforts on the most vulnerable popula tions, including children of all ages (especially older children) as well as Native American and rural children. Successful interventions include safety campaigns, educational strategies and changes in parenting practices (LWSD, 2017). According to HP2020, most events resulting in injury, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk - taking; physical environment b oth at home and in the community; access to health services and systems for injury -related care; and social environment, including individual social experiences (e.g., social norms, education and victimization history), social relationships (e.g., parental monitoring and supervision of youth, peer group associations and family interactions), community environment (e.g., cohesion in schools, neighborhoods and communities) and societal factors (e.g., cultural beliefs, attitudes, incentives and disincentives, laws and regulations). Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death among children, with many survivors enduring the consequences of brain injury and SCI . The physical, emotional, psychological and learning problems that affect injured children, along wi th the associated costs, make reducing traumatic injuries a high priority for health and safety advocates throughout the nation. Educational programs like ThinkFirst increase knowledge and awareness of the causes and risk factors of brain injury and SCI, i njury prevention measures, and the use of safety habits at an early age (www.thinkfirst.org/kids, 2019). Objectives Offer an injury and violence prevention program for children, adolescents and young adults throughout SDC Provide presentations and opportunities to Health and Science Pipeline Initiative (HASPI) high school students around injury and violence prevention and health care career readiness Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 294 FY 2019 Report of Activities Sharp 's ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival program is a chapter of the ThinkFirst National Injury Prevention Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing brain, spinal cord, and other traumatic injuries through education, research and advocacy. HASPI is a network of educators, community organizations and health care industry representatives who collaborate to increase awareness of health and medical career opportunities, improve science proficiency in schools and prepare students for future health care careers. With the partnership and financial support of HASPI , in FY 2019 ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival provided injury prevention education to nearly 750 students from schools throughout SDC, including San Ysidro High School, Bayfront Charter High School, Castle Park High School, Mar Vista High School, San Diego High School of Science and Technology, e3 Civic High School, Rancho Buena Vista High School and Oceanside High School. Education was provided through classroom presentations, assemblies and off-site learning expos. HASPI school -site programs consisted of one- to two-hour classes that covered topics such as the modes of injury (i.e., automobile accidents, violence and sports/recreation), disability awareness, and the anatomy and physiology of the brain and spinal cord. These programs were enhanced by powerful personal testimonies from individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) or SCI, known as Voices for Injury Prevention (VIPs). In addition, 12 HASPI students from Sweetwater High School with an interest in pursuing careers in physical rehabilitation partic ipated in a half-day, interactive tour of the SMH Rehabilitation Center. Students rotated through three stations that provided hands -on practice in adaptive dressing techniques, wheelchair mobility, and various memory and problem -solving activities used in therapy. The experience provided students with a better understanding of physical rehabilitation and the challenges that patients might face following an injury. In October, ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival participated in the Walk & Roll Abilities Festival at the Marina View Park in Chula Vista. Organized by a former ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival VIP, the annual event benefits the Gurmilan Foundation which provides scholarship and grant programs to support and empower people with disabilities. During the event, ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival hosted a booth featuring models of the brain and spinal cord, opportunities to speak with VIPs and educational activities for children. In April, ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival provided planning support and guest speakers for the 2019 ThinkFirst Conference on Injury Prevention at the Wyndham San Diego Bayside hotel. The annual conference aims to reduce injury among all age groups by improving knowledge of the impact of injury and the need for prevention education; increasing awareness of injury prevention programs; and disseminating information to injury prevention specialists through presentations, networking and the sharing of program methodologies. Sharp Rehab provided presentations during the conference, including Mindful ness in Rehabilitation and Vestibular Therapy for Improving Balance. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 295 On the day preceding the conference, ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival assisted in the fitting and dissemination of 100 bicycle helmets for community children, teens and adults at the San Diego Waterfront Park. The event concluded a day of training for eight new ThinkFirst Chapter Directors, extending their education to include how to fit a helmet and how to conduct an impromptu helmet fitting event in their own communities. FY 2020 Plan ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival will do the following: With grant funding, provide and expand educational program offerings to schools and organizations in SDC With grant funding, increase community awareness of ThinkFirst/Sharp on Survival through attendance and participation at community health fairs and events Continue to evolve program curricula to meet the needs of health career pathway classes as part of the HASPI partnership Grow partnership with HASPI through participation in conferences and roundtable events As appropriate and with funding, explore opportunities to incorporate concussion education into school and community -based presentations As grant funding allows, continue to build HASPI partnerships and expand educational presentations to schools in North County, Coronado, and SDC's south region Explore further opportunities to provide education to health care professionals and college students intere sted in health care careers With grant funding, continue to link injury prevention with career readiness and career paths With grant funding from the Grossmont Healthcare District, collaborate with SDBIF to recruit and train a VIP speaker with a TBI to speak to audiences throughout SDC Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest in Health Care Careers Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2019 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified education as one of 10 priority health conditions and SDOH affecting members of the communities served by SMH. Accor ding to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 31% of respondents ranked education, including access, health literacy, workforce development and economic mobility, among the top five SDOH with the greatest im pact on their community. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 296 According to participants in a focus group conducted during the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, when residents are unable to achieve higher levels of education, individual and community health are impacted in the following ways: limited or low -wage employment opportunities for those with low educational attainment; constant stress related to housing or food among families who are not economically secure, which contributes to poor health; and limited career mobility in low -wage jobs, creating lit tle potential for promotions or higher wages. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, in 2018, there were 157,756 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 9% of all jobs countywide (SDWP, 2019). According to a 2017 report from the SDWP titled San Diego's Priority Sectors: An Update on Labor Force and Training Needs , the health care industry in SDC experienced net employment growth of 40.4% between 2006 and 2016 \u2014 considerably higher than the growth rate in the state of California (27%) and the nation (21%) (SDWP, 2017). The report also found that health care employers identified RNs, physicians and surgeons, and health technologists and technicians as the most difficult positions to fill. The most frequently cited re asons for hiring difficulties were lack of experience, small applicant pools, and insufficient non -technical skills (SDWP, 2017). According to SDWP, a major challenge faced by education and training programs in the health care sector is accommodating the n umber of clinical training hours required for students in California to become certified. In addition, the health care industry is facing significant changes due to uncertainty related to legislation and technology, as well as the growing demand for servic es to support California's aging population (SDWP, 2017). Total employment in California is projected to grow 10.7% between 2016 and 2026, reflecting an increase of 1.9 million jobs statewide over the decade. The health care and social assistance sector is expected to be the fastest growing industry in California, with 24.9% growth anticipated (California Employment Development Department (EDD) , 2018). In its Employment Projections - 2018 -2028 report, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that health care support occupations and health care practitioners/ technical occupations will contribute about 30% of all new jobs and account for 18 of the 30 fastest growing occupations. Increased demand for health care services for an aging population and p eople with chronic conditions will drive much of the expected employment growth (BLS, 2019). As of 2018, SDC was one of 28 counties in California designated as a Registered Nurse Shortage Area by the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission (OSHPD Registered Nurse Shortage Areas Update , 2019). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) projects that the demand for RNs in California will increase 71% by 2030 if current levels of health care are maintained. The report projects that California will need to hire an additional 26,270 nurses to meet the demand (BHW, 2018). According to forecasting performed by the Healthforce Center at U niversity of California , San Francisco (UCSF) , the demand for primary care clinicians in California will increase 12% to 17% by 2030. These forecasts predict that the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 297 southern border region will experience some of the highest levels of clinician shortages in the state. UCSF recommends a comprehensive and holistic targeted strategy to enhance the education pipeline, improve recruitment and retention, maximize the existing workforce and leverage workforce data (UCSF, 2017 -2018). According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) tit led California Physician Supply: Headed for a Drought?, the total supply of active patient care physicians in California declined slightly between 2013 and 2015, a trend that appears to be driven by the aging of the physician workforce. In SDC, nearly a quarter of practicing physicians were ages 60 and older in 2015 (CHCF, 2018). The same report found that 32% of California's active patient care physicians were primary care physicians. In SDC, there were 112.3 specialty physicians practicing per 100,000 res idents in 2015, compared to 49.8 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents (CHCF, 2018). According to a report from PolicyLink, a national research institute dedicated to advancing economic and social equity, building a diverse health care workforce in California \u2014 one that refl ects the state's racial, ethnic and linguistic diversity \u2014 is a critical strategy for increasing access to culturally and linguistically appropriate services, eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities , improving the quality of care and reducing preventable costs ( Building an Inclusive Health Workforce in California: A Statewide Policy Agenda, 2018 ). A report by the California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) titled Meeting the Demand for Health identified several s trategies to recruit and maintain California's health care workforce, including offer health career pipeline programs for students from low -income backgrounds; provide academic, advising and health career development support to underrepresented college stu dents; expand educational programs that train students to provide health care in underserved communities and provide scholarships for low -income students (CFHWC, 2019). Objectives In collaboration with local schools, colleges and universities, offer oppo rtunities for students to explore and train for a vast array of health care professions Provide training for local, national and international health care professionals FY 201 9 Report of Activities SMH offered various placement and professional developm ent opportunities for students and interns throughout SDC. In FY 201 9, approximately 330 nursing students and approximately 240 ancillary students from a variety of colleges and universities spent more than 111,400 hours at SMH. Program partners included Alliant International University, APU, Boston University, California College San Diego, California State University ( CSU ), Fresno, Capella University, , Drexel Univer sity, Emory University, EMSTA College, Grand Canyon University, Grossmont College, Grossmont Health Occupations, Healing Hands School of Holistic Health, Keck Graduate Institute, Loma Linda University, McGill University, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 298 Metropolitan State University, Moun t St. Mary's University, National University, Ohio University, Palomar College, Pima Medical Institute, PLNU, Samuel Merritt University, San Diego Fire -Rescue Department, San Diego Mesa College, San Jose State University, SDSU, Sodexo Dietetic Internship s, Southwestern College (SWC), Touro University, University of California San Diego Extension, USD, University of South Alabama, University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences , University of Southern California, University of the Pacific, University of Utah , Western Governors University, and Western University of Health Sciences . The SMH Clinical Pastoral Education program continued to train community clergy members interested in health care chaplaincy , training 12 chaplain students in FY 2019 . In addition, the Spiritual Care and Education Department hosted three education al events for professional chaplains during the year. Events included Healing Stories from Traditions of World Religions: Buddhist Stories ; Praying for Miracles ; and Sharing o ur Spiritual P ractices. The events shared best practices in chaplaincy with more than 100 community chaplains, including graduates of SMH's chaplaincy program as well as chaplains from various hospitals and hospices in SDC . Through affiliations with EMSTA College, Palomar Community College, SWC and the San Diego Fire -Rescue Department's paramedic training program, SMH provided both clinical training and observation hours for nearly 40 community paramedic interns in FY 2019. Each student completed 147 hours of clinical training primarily in the ED, with scheduled rotations in the trauma bay, catheterization lab, operating room, labor and delivery, and pulmonary services. ED staff contributed more than 5,600 hours of clinical training and supervision to these specialized community programs in FY 201 9. SMH continued to provide several mobile intensive care nurse (MICN) training programs in SDC. The MICN program is an extensive , six-week classroom course for any San Diego base st ation in need of new MICN nurses. Participants receive certification through the County of San Diego EMS upon meeting the following criteria: successful completion of the 36-hour classroom component ; a passing score of 85 % or higher on the County of San Di ego EMS protocol examination; and completion of mandatory ride -along hours with a paramedic unit. As a radio base station, the S MH prehospital/EMS department continued to provide field care conferences in FY 2019, including two six -hour Joint Base Regional Care Conferences for local EMS personnel and MICN nurse s throughout SDC. In September, SM H collaborated with SM BHWN and SMV to provide the SMMC Nursing Career Development Fair. Held at the OPP , the annual event support s the professional development of students who are interested in pursuing a career in nursing as well as nurses within the community. The fair provided approximately 100 attendees with advice and coaching from professional nurses as well as information on f inancial aid and scholarships, clinical certifications, student loan forgiveness and medical library services. In addition, representatives from California and other s tate universities offered information about their nursing and allied health programs. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 299 SMH continued to participate in the Health Sciences High and Middle College ( HSHMC ) program to provide early professional development for high school students. During the school year, 51 students in ninth through 12th grade were supervised for approximately 11,000 hours between SMH and the OPP. Students shadowed staff in a variety of hospital departments , including radiology, laboratory, endoscopy, cardiac rehabilitation, case management, patient transport, administration, ED, pharmacy and the cafeteria. Students also learned about the hospital's commitment to person -centered care and the culture of a professional work environment. In addition to placement at SMH, seven HSHMC students devoted 1,500 hours to shadowing team members at SRSMG 's San Diego facility located adjacent to SMMC. Sharp Rehab provided free professional development opportunities for community and Sharp professionals in FY 201 9, including a Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) course and Mindful Self -Compassion (MSC) cours e. Developed by the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education at the Stanford University School of Medicine, CCT is a nine -week course designed to help professionals develop compassion for themselves and others. Through lectures, guided exercises and group discussions, CCT can improve communication, increase resilience to stress and enhance feelings of well -being. Designed by professionals at the University of Texas and Harvard Medical School - Cambridge Health Alliance, MSC is an eight -week course that tea ches mindfulness, self -kindness and self -compassion skills to help health professionals recognize difficult situations and respond with greater stress resilience. In addition, Sharp Rehab led Compassion -Based Training: Promoting Well -Being and Preventing B urnout, a six -week course to help health professionals develop skills to cope with the challenging demands of today's health care environment. Approximately 30 health professionals received training through the se courses in FY 201 9. In FY 2019, SMH provi ded planning support and speakers for Sharp's annual Obesity Crisis Conference. Held in May at Liberty Station, the 2019 conference focused on practical approaches to the care of patients with obesity and attracted more than 200 community health profession als. Three SMH nurses provided expertise during the conference, including a presentation about current health and fitness apps, and participation in a panel on exercise and motivation. In addition, in September, an SMH team member helped moderate a panel o n human trafficking for more than 300 community professionals \u2014 including law enforcement, social workers, behavioral health specialists, and other advocates against sexual assault \u2014 during the 8th annual SART (Sexual Assault Response Team) Summit Multi -Disciplinary Conference held at the Hyatt Regency Mission Bay Spa & Marina. SMH is a Planetree Person -Centered Hospital Designated with Distinction, representing the highest level of person -centered care. The Planetree philosophy upholds that care should be organized first and foremost around the needs of the patient. With this recognition, SMH provides hospital tours to share its exper tise in person -centered care upon request from various local, national and internatio nal hospitals, nonprofit organizations and universities. Guests may use lessons learned during the tours to improve service delivery and customer experience within their own organizations. In FY Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 300 2019, SMH provided four hospital tours , including a tour for SDSU's Master of Public Health students, to share its unique programs and design properties that promote person -centered care, a healing environment, workforce efficiency and effective use of technology. FY 20 20 Plan SMH will do the following: Continue to provide professional development opportunities for health professions students and interns throughout SDC Continue to collaborate with HSHMC to provide opportunities for high school students to explore careers in health care Continue to offer CCT and MS C courses for community health professionals Continue to provide education and hospital tours for the local, national and international health care community on the Planetree philosophy of care Provide continuing education lectures to community physicians, residents, interns and Navy personnel at the SMH Hip Preservation Center Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care and Community and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the SMH 201 9 CHNA, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2019 CHNAs identified community and social support, economic security, and homelessness and housing instability among the priority health needs affecting members of the communities served by SMH, particularly underserved and underfunded patients who face inequities . Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified five primary barriers to accessing h ealth care in San Diego: (1) lack of insurance; (2) economic insecurity; (3) transportation; (4) fear related to immigration status; and (5) lack of culturally competent/linguistically appropriate care options. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 72% of respondents identified access to care, 60% identified economic security, and 35% identified care management, including disease management and community social service linkage, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. Participants in the Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group conducted as part of the SMH 2019 CHNA identified a lack of : family support ; caregiver upon discharge ; and childcare assistance as priority SDOH related to community and social support that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 301 Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants also identified economic security as a significant barr ier to care. In particular, the cost of housing, taking time off work to for medical appointments, the cost of medication and food insecurity were highlighted. Further, Sharp Case Management Leadership focus group participants identified the following hosp ital discharge challenges and barriers for patients: transportation support; a shortage of recuperative or respite care options; a lack of short -term caregivers and in -home support services; and a need for a streamlined process from the hospital to the Cou nty of San Diego HHSA for those who qualify for wraparound support. Participants in Sharp's 2019 CHNA community engagement activities identified the following strategies to address economic security in patients: prioritizing the hiring and training of soci al workers; offering free post -surgery visits; providing follow -up phone calls to patients following discharge; making in -home care more accessible; ensuring access to 2 -1-1 San Diego (2 -1-1) CIE and other community resources at all Sharp facilities; establishing more patient -centered initiatives; and creating on -site resources to assist patients in finding and applying for affordable housing. According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7 San Diegans experienced food insecurity in 2017. Half of a dults experiencing food insecurity are living with a disability (San Diego Hunger Coalition, 2019). As of October 2019, the overall unemployment rate in SDC was 2.8%, which was lower than the unemployment rate for the state of California (3.9%) and the nat ional rate (3.6%) during the same period (Labor Market Information, California EDD , 2019; BLS, 2019). The Regional Taskforce for the Homeless' January 2019 WeAllCount campaign estimated that there were 8,102 homeless individuals in SDC, roughly 55% of whom were unsheltered. According to a report from the CHCF titled Mental Health in California: For Too Many, Care Not There , the prevalence of serious mental illness varies by income level, with lower -income individuals experiencing higher rates of mental illn ess. Although the number of adults with mental health coverage in California increased nearly 50% between 2012 and 2015 because of Medi -Cal expansion, in 2015, approximately two -thirds of Californian adults with mental illness and adolescents who experienc ed major depressive episodes did not receive treatment (CHCF, 2018). According to the same report, ED visits resulting in inpatient psychiatric admissions increased 30 % from 2010 to 2015. More robust community behavioral health services for low -income and uninsured patients may decrease unnecessary ED use (CHCF, 2018). Objectives Collaborate with community organizations to provide follow -up medical care, financial assi stance, and psychiatric and social services to chronically homeless individuals Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 302 Assist economically disadvantaged individuals through transportation and pharmaceutical assistance FY 2019 Report of Activities SMH provides post -acute care facilitation for vulnerable patients, including individuals who experience homeless ness or lack a safe home environment. Advocacy for safe discharge from the hospital is a top priority, regardless of funding. In FY 201 9, SMH provided assessments for those at risk for ps ychiatric and developmental disorders and substance use issues, as well as referrals for housing, medication management and supportive community services as needed. In addition, SMH continued to participate in the County of San Diego's Whole Person Wellnes s pilot program to help provide comprehensive care management for homeless Medi -Cal beneficiaries who experience high utilization of medical services. SMH assists high -risk, underserved patients with transportation home from the hospital as well as with connections to community resources for food, clothing and housing. Each year the SMH Auxiliary provides approximately 200 new items of clothing to patients who lack usable clothing at discharge , including homeless individuals, trauma patients from the ED and any other patient who lacks clothing when leaving the hospital. The hospital may also provide uninsured patients with financial assistance for medication and medical equipment. In FY 201 9, SMMC assisted economically disadvantaged individuals through th e provision of approximately $105,000 in free medications and transportation through its Project HELP program. Further, Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients a t all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SM H. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. New in FY 2019, SMH joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's CIE to better understand and address the SDOH that influence the health and well-being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH \u2014 the conditions where people live, learn, work and pla y \u2014 have a significant impact on the ability for community members to access care and maintain their health. S MH joined the CIE pilot partnership in order to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with SDOH needs, and to connect them directly to community resources specifically for those needs. More than 70 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared community member records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and current use of community programs and services, and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. Beginning in fall 2019, SMH's case man agers and social workers received training on CIE as a tool to serve vulnerable patients in the acute care setting, including Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 303 those patients experiencing food insecurity and homelessness. Metrics of this partnership, including demographic and utilization d ata, as well as volume and successful community referrals, are currently being collected and will help to assess the impact and value of the partnership at the end of its pilot year in early summer 2020. FY 20 20 Plan SMH will do the following: Continue to collaborate with community organizations that provide medical care and case management services to the homeless Continue to partner with the Whole Person Wellness program to provide care management to homeless Medi -Cal patients who are high users of me dical services Continue to administer funds to those in need of transportation assistance or financial support for medications With funding from the SMH Auxiliary, provide 200 items of clothing to patients who lack usable clothing at discharge Continue to provide financial assistance for prescription copayments and other personal items Evaluate the impact of the pilot year of the Sharp -CIE partnership to inform next steps in collaboration with community organizations to address SDOH Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 304 SMH Program and Serv ice Highlights Sharp Memorial Hospital: 24-hour Emergency and Trauma Center, including heliport and base station \u2014 designated ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction \u2014 acute heart attack (STEMI ) center Advanced Heart Care Center Arts for Healing and Integrative Therapies Medical/surgical care, including a dedicated inpatient oncology unit Bioethics consultations Cancer treatment including genetic counseling, diagnostic imaging, infusion services and radiation therapy Cardiovascular and pulmonary rehab ilitation Catheterization lab, including a hybrid procedure room Classes, events and physician referral through 1 -800-82-SHARP Clinical trials, including cancer, heart and vascular, neurology and orthopedics Care Partner and CCP programs Critical care FollowMyHealth\u00ae, a secure on -line patient website that gives patients convenient, 24-hour access to their personal health information Head and neck services, including cancer treatment and surgery Health Information Ambassadors Heart and vascular care, includ ing mechanical circulatory support devices and heart transplantation Heart Valve Surgery Center Home health with home infusion services124 Hospice125 Imaging services, including interventional radiology Infection Prevention services Intensive Care Units Interp reter services Laboratory services Mindful Caf\u00e9, offering healthy and nutritious food options for patients, family and staff Neuro -Oncology Center specializing in brain and spinal cord cancer treatment Open medical records program Organ transplantation, in cluding kidney, heart and pancreas Orthopedics, including joint replacement surgery Pain management program Palliative care Pathology services Pharmacy services for inpatients Pre-Anesthesia Evaluation services Robotic surgery 124 Provided through Sharp Home Health, located at: 8080 Dagget Street in San Diego, ZIP code 92111. 125 Provided through Sharp HospiceCa re.

The Practicum Program seeks to enhance Sharp's mission by adding the \"best place to train.\" Though small at its inception, it has grown to partner with six universities in training over 30 students each year. The Practicum Program trains high-achieving master's in social work and marriage and family therapy students, offering a training manual, as well as didactics and clinical case discussions using evidence-based practices and measure-based care. By training students to become high-quality behavioral health clinicians, the Practicum Program helps to both fill the gap in behavioral health resources and improve behavioral health care delivery in our community. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 307 Section 11 Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital and Sharp McDonald Center Each time we provide a free lecture, meet with community partners or sit on a new committee sharing the stories of our patients and their path to recovery, not only do we give back, but we receive a true benefit as well. Giving back to the larger community of S an Diego is our responsibility . \u2014 Dara Schwartz, Clinical Program Developer, SMV Fiscal Year ( FY) 2019 Community Benefit Program Highlights Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital (SMV) and Sharp McDonald Center (SMC) provided $22,926,238 in community benefit in FY 2019. See Table 50 for a summary of unreimbursed costs based on the categories specifically identified in Senate Bill 697 (SB 697) and Figure 29 for the distribution of SMV and SMC's community benefit among those categories. Table 50: Economic Value of Co mmunity Benefit Provided Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital and Sharp McDonald Center \u2014 FY 2019 126 Methodology for calculating shortfalls in public programs is based on Sharp's payor -specific cost -to-charge ratios, which are derived from the cost accounting system, offset by the actual payments received. Costs for patients paid through the Medicar e program on a prospective basis also include payments to third parties related to the specific population. 127 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for ser vices at the time the services were rendered. 128 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children 's Services Program, or county indigen costs may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits, plus costs for supplies, materials and other purchased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of providing services . Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providing the program or service.

Definition of Community SMV is located at 7850 Vista Hill Avenue in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. SMC is located at 7989 Linda Vista Road in San Diego, ZIP code 92111. SMV Mid -City Outpatient Programs are located at 4275 El Cajon Boulevard, Suite 100 in San Diego, ZIP code 92105; SMV East County Outp atient Programs are located at 1460 East Main Street in El Cajon, ZIP code 92021 . As specialty hospitals, SMV and SMC serve all of San Diego County (SDC). The primary communities served by SMV and SMC include the City of San Diego, Chula Vista, the east r egion, and north inland communities surrounding Rancho Bernardo. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries in SDC. For SMV's and SMC's 201 9 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) was utilized to identify communities with greater health disparity within SDC. The CNI identifies the severity of health disparity for every ZIP code in the U.S. based on specific barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/ language, insurance and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitalizations. According to the CNI, communities served by SMV with especially high need include Southe ast San Diego, the Co llege Area, City Heights, East San Diego, and Chula Vista . Figure 30 presents a map of the CNI scores across SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 310 Figure 30: CNI Map \u2014 SDC130 Description of Community Health In 2019, there were 504,267 residents ages 65 and older in SDC, representing 15.1% of the population. Between 2019 and 2024, it is anticipated that SDC's senior population will grow by 22.4%.131 In 2017, 13.3% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemployment rate was 6.8 % and 5.0% of households received Supplemental Security Income.132 According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7, or 14% of SDC's population experienced food insecurity133 in 2017. An additional 1 in 5 San Diegans were food secure but relied on supplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget.134 In 2017, 7.2% of households in SDC participated in Supplemental Nutrition 130 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson Company, 2018; and CNI, 2018 . 131 SpeedTrack Inc.; U.S. Census Bureau . 132 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) , Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit (2019), 2017 Demographic Profiles: San Diego County ; U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -year estimates 2013 - 2017 . 133 Food security means access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food -nutrition -assistance/food -security -in-the-us/ 134 San Diego Hunger Coalition (2019), Hunger Free San Diego Issue Brief: 2017 San Diego County Food Insecurity .

Of those needing help, 64.4% received treatment. Overall, 22.0% of SDC adults ages 18 to 64 reported seeing a health care provider for mental -emotional or substance use issues. Among SDC seniors, 10.0% of those surveyed in 2018 reported needing help for mental, emotional or substance use issues in the past year.136 In 2017, 6,344 individuals in SDC visited the emergency department (ED) for a self - inflicted injury, an age -adjusted rate of 192.1 per 100,000 population. This included 188 seniors (an age -adjusted rate of 40.5 per 100,000 population), of whom 98 were hospitalized (21.1 per 100,000 population). During the same year, the age -adjusted suicide rate in SDC was 12.5 per 100,000 population, or 428 deaths. Among seniors, the rate of suicide was nearl y double (24.6 deaths per 100,000 population).132 Both rates are higher than the HP2020 target rate of no more than 10.2 deaths per 100,000 populati on. An analysis of 2017 mortality data for SDC revealed Alzheimer's disease and suicide to be the third and ninth leading causes of death for SDC, respectively.137 See Table 55 for a summary of leading causes of death in SDC.

These CHNAs were significantly influenced by the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties ( HASD&IC) 2019 CHNA process and findings . Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process and findings. In addition, this year SMV and SMC completed their most current implementation strategies \u2014 a description of pr ograms designed to address the priority health needs identified in their 2019 CHNAs. The most recent CHNAs and implementation strategies for both SMV and SMC are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health - Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 314 needs -assessments.cfm . Through the SMV and SMC 2019 CHNA s, the following priority health needs were identified for the communities served by SMV and SMC (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Concerns Behavioral Health (including Substance Use) Cancer Chronic Health Conditions (e.g., Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes and Obesity) Community and Social Support Economic Security Education Homelessness and Housing Instability Maternal and Pren atal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy Unintentional Injury and Violence SMV and SMC are specialty hospital facilities providing behavioral health and substance use programs and services. Therefore, in alignment with these identified needs, the followin g pages detail programs that specifically address behavioral health and substance use needs, including those that impact aging concerns . This section also describes programs that address access to care, community and social support, economic security and e ducation. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. As specialty hospital facilities , SMV and SMC lack the resources to comprehensively address the elements of community education and support for the remaining identified needs . These remaining identified health needs are addressed through programs and services provided by Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women and Newborns (SMBHWN) and Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH). Please refer to Sections 9 and 10 (respectively) of this report for details on those programs. SMV, SMH and SMBHWN are all conveniently located on the Sharp Metropolitan Medical Campus (SMMC). For additional details on SMV and SMC programs that specifically address the needs identified in the 2019 CHNA, please refer to SMV's and SMC's respective implementation strategies ava ilable at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health - needs -assessments.cfm . For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rat ionale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2019 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s), and FY 2020 Plan. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 315 Identified Community Need: Behavioral Health and Substance Use Education for the Community Rationale references the findings of the SMV and SMC 201 9 CHNAs, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2019 CHNAs identified behavioral health (including substance use) as one of the priority health needs affecting community members in SDC. The following health conditions were identified in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA as priority behavio ral health issues among individuals of all age groups in SDC: mood disorders; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD ) and trauma; substance use disorder and suicide or self -harm. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA also identified the following priority behavioral issues for children and youth: mood disorders, specifically anxiety; alcohol and other substance use; suicide and self -harm; and trauma. In addition, the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified the following priority behavioral issues for seniors: Alzheimer's disease; deme ntia; mood disorders, particularly anxiety and depression; and schizophrenia. Participants in the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs ranked behavioral/mental health as the second most important health condition affecting co mmunity members. In addition, only a minority of survey respondents (6%) were very familiar with Sharp's behavioral health support groups, indicating a missed opportunity to support community members with behavioral health issues. This is of particular co ncern for younger adults ages 25 to 44, who were most likely to select behavioral/mental health as a priority health condition but indicated that they were 'not at all familiar' with Sharp's behavioral health support group offerings. Further, survey respon dents ages 25 to 44 were significantly more likely than other age groups to select stigma as one of the five most important social determinants of health ( SDOH ) impacting their community. Research illustrates that although stigma can exist in a variety of contexts, it is one of the largest barriers for individuals who may seek or engage in treatment for behavioral health conditions. According to data presented in the SMV 2019 CHNA, in 2017, 11.2% of inpatient discharges at SMV were seniors ages 65 and older , 56.3% were adults ages 27 to 64, 15.8% were Transitional Age Youth (TAY) and 16.7% were children 17 and under. This analysis also indicated that 48.4% of inpatient discharges for TAY at SMV in 2017 had a principal diagnosis classified as a mood disorder , 20.7% as a substance - related disorder, and 17.8% as schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. Further, 26.1% of children and the majority (52.0%) of TAY discharged from SMV in 2017 had co -occurring behavioral health and substance use diagnoses. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 316 In gene ral, data analysis in the SMV and SMC 2019 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of behavioral health hospital discharges in communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges throughout SDC .138 According to 2018 CHIS data, 16.1% of adults in SDC have ever seriou sly thought about committing suicide, a 71.3% increase from 2014 (9.4%). In 2017, there were 998 hospitalizations due to overdose/poisoning in SDC. The age-adjusted rate of hospitalizations due to overdose/poisoning was 28.4 per 100,000 population. In 201 7, the age -adjusted rate of overdose/poisoning -related ED visits in SDC was 172.1 per 100,000 population. Age -adjusted rates for overdose/poisoning -related ED visits were higher among males, individuals of other race and individuals ages 15 to 24 years in comparison among groups. In 2017, California's state mental health authority provided treatment to 104,410 adolescents ages 13 to 17, representing 15.1% of all individuals treated by the state (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAM HSA), 2018). In 2018, 14.4% of U.S. adolescents experienced a major depressive episode, of whom an estimated 41.4% received treatment for depression (SAMHSA, 2019). SAMHSA estimates that, in 2018, approximately 12.4 million adults in the U.S. had co-occurr ing mental health and substance use disorders (SAMHSA, 2019). According to HP2020, the effects of substance use contribute to costly social, physical, mental and public health problems, including teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, motor vehi cle accidents, physical fights, suicide, and crime \u2014 including domestic violence, child abuse and homicide. During 2018, 19.4% of individuals ages 12 years and older reported that they had used illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs in the past year . Prevalence was highest among individuals ages 18 to 25 (38.7%) and ages 26 to 29 years (34.3%) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), 2019). Approximately 8% of the population will develop PTSD during their lifetime; however, these figures ar e higher among veterans and active duty service members. According to the VA, each year, approximately 11% to 20% of veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom and 12% of Gulf War veterans have PTSD, while it is estimated that 30% of Vietnam veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime (VA, 2018). Organizational and provider -related barriers to veterans accessing high -quality mental health care include shortages in the behavioral health workforce , inadequate availability of appointments , and variability in the use of evidence -based treatments tailored to veterans. Individual level barriers include concern that admitting a mental health problem is a sign of weakness; skepticism about the effectiveness of treatment; concerns about the negat ive side effects of medication and fear of job or career repercussions from seeking behavioral health care (RAND Corporation , 2018). The National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report indicated that, in 2017, the suicide rate for veterans was 1.5 times the rate among non -veterans. Research has shown suicide rates among veterans to be impacted by economic disparities, 138 Truven Health Analytics, 2018; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2018; The Nielson 2018; OSHPD via SpeedTrack\u00a9, Inc., 2017 . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 317 homelessness, unemployment, disability status, community connection, and personal health and well -being. (VA, 2019). Objectives Provide behavioral health and substance use education for patients, their loved ones and the community Support the behavioral health community through sponsorship of and participation in community events FY 201 9 Report of Activities During FY 201 9, SMV and SMC h osted numerous on -site community speaking engagements and workshops to increase awareness of behavioral health and substance use issues. Education addressed a variety of topics, including cognitive therapy, substance use , life transitions, domestic violenc e and child and geriatric psychiatry. This included SMV's monthly lecture series designed to educate participants about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) \u2014 a research -based treatment approach to mood disturbances and behavior problems that is used to trea t depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, phobias, anger , relationship problems, grief and loss, and other difficulties that bring people to therapy. Further, to support family, friends and caregivers of individuals receiving behavioral heal th care , SMV participates in NAMI San Diego's Friends in the Lobby program , through which trained NAMI volunteers provide behavioral health resources to visitors in the hospital's lobby . Throughout the year, SMV's Trauma and PTSD Recovery Intensive Outpat ient Program (IOP) provided specialized services to active duty service members, veterans, military families and the community. This program provided a safe environment for individuals to learn effective methods for coping with and managing symptoms of PTSD, acute stress disorder and mood -related disruption s. SMV's Trauma and PTSD Recovery IOP continued to offer evidence -based therapies designed to address maladaptive coping strategies, assist with recover y from complex post -traumatic stress and decrease mood instability. Team members also provided education and resources to reduce the stigma surrounding behavioral health issues in the military and civilian communities, as well as offered an expedited referral process for IOP services to active duty service members receiving treatment at Naval Medical Center San Diego. During FY 2019, SMV's Trauma and PTSD Recovery IOP supported approximately 250 veterans and community members impacted by trauma. In addition, in August, SMV offered behavioral health resources to approximately 175 community members during a resource fair at the VA San Diego Healthcare System's seventh annual Community Mental Health Summit at Jacobs Center for Neighborhood Innovation. SMV also continued to participate in the SDMFC, which meets monthly to discuss community - based services for milit ary service members and their families. In FY 201 9, SMV provided a specialized TAY Program to provide community services and support for young adults, ages 18 to 26, with behavioral health issues. Through the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 318 TAY Program, SMV offered education and resour ces to empower and support the continued health and well -being of these young adults. In June , SMV provided behavioral health resources to approximately 100 community members and TAY during an event focused on destigmatizing m ental health called Music. Art . Tacos. at Queen Bee's Music and Cultural Center in North Park . The event was sponsored by Urban Street Angels, an organization that provides emergency overnight shelter, supportive housing and job training opportunities to homeless San Diego youth. SMV a lso provided education and resources to 50 TAY at the Oasis Clubhouse youth center's Ducky Awards and Community College Health Resource Fair events. SMV's TAY Program also includes the Sustainable Early Episode Clinic (SEEC) , which is designed to offer early intervention and ongoing support to TAY with newly diagnosed schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and their families. SMV and SMC provided a variety of behavioral health educational opportunities and resources to community groups throughout the ye ar. Through Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego, SMV and SMC clinicians delivered five lectures on various topics, covering the following topics : the basics of behavioral health; cultural perceptions and beliefs around behavioral health; the lin k between opioids and mental health; and overcoming mental illness in conjunction with substance use . Lectures were delivered to approximately 40 community members at Serra Mesa Recreation Center, San Ysidro Community Activity Center, Mary Hollis Center a t the San Diego Central Library and Pacific Beach/Taylor Library . In FY 201 9, SMV and SMC provided behavioral health education, resources and presentations to approximately 1,100 community members through participation in health and wellness fairs, confer ences and events. This included the Mental Health Resource Fair at the San Diego Central Library; Community Alliance for Healthy Minds' 12th annual Forum for Healthy Minds at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) ; the Caregiver Coalition of San Di ego's (Caregiver Coalition's) Caring for an Adult Loved One Living with Mental Health Challenges conference at Saint Gregory the Great Catholic Church; the Gender Odyssey San Diego conference at the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley; the Jewish Family Serv ice of San Diego (JFS) Behavioral Health Committee's annual Behavioral Health Panel and Luncheon; County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency 's (HHSA's) 14th annual Recovery Happens event at Waterfront Park; and the fourth annual Critical Issues in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Conference at the Doubletree Hotel in Mission Valley . In addition, in February and March, SMC staff hosted educational events focused on Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) \u2014 the combination of behavioral therapy and medication to treat substance use disorders \u2014 for approximately 50 behavioral health clinicians, including case managers and social workers, during MAT Roadshow events held at San Diego City College, Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center (SCVMC ) and Alvarado Parkway Institute. A child psychologist also presented to approximately 60 members of the Sweetwater Union High School District Parent Advisory Group at Rancho Del Rey Middle School on topics including adolescent brain development and recognizing behavioral health concerns in teens and young adults. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 319 Throughout the year, SMV provided behavioral health education to the community through interviews with local news outlets, including KUSI News, KSON, CBS 8 San Diego, and KPBS . Interview to pics included pathways to recovery for individuals struggling with addiction; a new blood test to predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease; bullying prevention and coping skills; \"Dry January\" and controlling alcohol intake; a new medication for treatment -resistant depression; behavioral health awareness in the Latino community; orthorexia; setting behavioral health resolutions for the new year; supporting a loved one who has experienced a traumatic event; discussing traumatic events with children; and the impact of racism on children's health. Professionals with expertise in disciplines such as clinical research, psychiatry, marriage and family therapy (MFT) , clinical psychology and clinical child psychology shared information through these news outlets. In FY 201 9, SMV sponsored and participated in several events benefitting behavioral health organizations across SDC. Events included NAMI's 1 5th annual Color Ball and Inspiration Awards at the San Diego Natural History Museum ; Mental Health America's 21st annual Meeting of the Minds Behavioral Health Conference and Resource Fair at Marina Village Conference Center; San Diego Psychological Association's (SDPA's) 2018 Fall Conference at the Doubletree by Hilton Hotel in Mission Valley ; the 1 2th annual Surviv ors of Suicide Loss (SOSL) Day event at St. Gregory the Great Catholic Church; the Behavioral Health Recognition Dinner, which recognizes individuals who work to help community members achieve recovery without stigma; and the Strut for Sobriety event benef itting A New PATH, a nonprofit organization focused on reducing stigma associated with addictive illness through education and compassionate support . Throughout the year, SMV and SMC sponsored and participated in eight walks to increase awareness and rai se funds for behavioral health services, including NAMI Walk s/Runs SDC and County of San Diego HHSA Wellness Expo , San Diego NEDA (National Eating Disorders Association) Walk, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention's Out of the Darkness Community Walk, SOSL and Directing Change's 12th and 13th annual Walk in Remembrance with Hope events , Alzheimer's San Diego's annual Walk4ALZ, and the American Heart Association's (AHA 's) 201 9 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk. With the exception of the AHA 201 9 San Diego H eart & Stroke Walk, SMV and SMC provided a booth with behavioral health resources during these events. SMV continues to maintain a Client Advisory Board, which obtains feedback from the hospital's outpatients, former patients and employees on how to impr ove programs, empower patients, promote advocacy and better serve the community. During FY 201 9, members of the Client Advisory Board encouraged community members, staff, current and former patients, friends and family to join their walking team, the Might y Mesa Vista Movers, in the annual NAMI Walk s/Runs SDC event to raise awareness and reduce stigma around behavioral health. In FY 201 9, SMV continued its collaboration with CHIP and the Independent Living Association (ILA) in support of an important initi ative to improve housing conditions for Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 320 community members living with serious, persistent mental illness. Efforts of the ILA Work Team continue to maintain quality standards and seek improvement of conditions for independent living facilities ( ILFs) and th e community members who reside there. This includes linking residents with essential services and providers , and reducing crime and unnecessary arrest rates. The ILA is an initiative of the CHIP Behavioral Health Work Team, in which SMV is an active partic ipant, and the registry continues to expand to include new participating ILFs. In addition, SMV partnered with Community Research Foundation, PERT, ILA and the CHIP Behavioral Health Work Team to improve collaboration with patients in the community, promot e recovery and decrease the stigma of mental illness and co -occurring substance use problems. FY 20 20 Plan SMV or SMC will do the following: Continue to explore opportunities for outreach to multicultural and vulnerable groups through increased community involvement and education Host and provide a variety of educational events and programs for community members Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide behavioral health and substance use education and resources to employees and residents in the city's nine districts Continue to provide education on MAT to community members and behavioral health providers throughout SDC to address the opioid epidemic Continue serving as the media's go -to exp erts for information on behavioral health conditions and treatment Participate in community events to raise awareness and funds for behavioral health services Participate in key behavioral health events and activities alongside patients Explore and expand collaborations with housing planning committees to provide better outcomes for community members living with mental illness and substance use issues Continue to collaborate with community providers and provide education to ILFs to improve living condition s for individuals with mental illness Identified Community Need: Behavioral Health and Substance Use Screenings and Community and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the SMV and SMC 201 9 CHNAs, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC com munity health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2019 CHNAs identified behavioral health (including substance use) as one of the priority health needs affecting community members in SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 321 The following health conditions were identified in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA as priority behavioral health issues among individuals of all age groups in SDC: mood disorders, PTSD and trauma, substance use disorder, and suicide and self-harm. The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2019 CHNA processes identified the following barriers to accessing behavioral health care: availability of needed services and appointments; insurance issues; logistical problems getting to appointments; and economic security, including inability to pay co-pays and deductibles. In addition, the following types of care were identified as especially difficult to access: urgent care services for crisis situations; inpatient psychiatric beds and substance use facilities; and transitional programs and services following discharge from the hospital. A focus group conducted with the SMC Aftercare Support Group as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process identified numerous barriers to behavioral health care, including the need for more low-cost or free, easily and immediately accessible drug treatment programs, as well as issues related to cost or difficulty obtaining health insurance. Participants also described challenges related to post-discharge care for all health conditions, including lack of adequate support at home, navigating denied insurance claims, and medication management. Participants in the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process ranked behavioral health as the second most important health condition affecting community members. In addition, only 6% of survey respondents were very familiar with Sharp's behavioral health support groups, indicating a missed opportunity for Sharp to provide support to community members with behavioral health issues. Participants in community engagement activities conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNA process identified the following strategies and resources to address behavioral health issues: wider availability of substance use programs; increasing education for health care providers related to addiction, including when and how to intervene, holistic pain management alternatives, and training focused on compassion and empathy; offering senior-focused forums led by health advocates to provide information on health issues and assistance navigating the health care system; implementing faster delivery of behavioral health care, particularly referrals for individuals in need of hospitalization; advocating for improved access and insurance coverage for the underserved; and offering a greater variety of behavioral health services, including classes tailored to specific behavioral health issues. Data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified steep increases in the rates of ED visits (559.3%) and inpatient discharges (195.1%) for chronic substance use in SDC between 2014 and 2016. According to data presented in the SMV 2019 CHNA, in 2017, 11.2% of inpatient discharges at SMV were seniors ages 65 and older, 56.3% were adults ages 27 to 64, 15.8% were TAY and 16.7% were children 17 and under. In addition, 46.6% of inpatient discharges at SMV in 2017 had co-occurring behavioral health and substance abuse diagnoses. In general, data analysis in the SMV and SMC 2019 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of behavioral health hospital discharges in communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges throughout SDC.138 Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 322 In 2017, there were 5,882 ED visits related to mood disorders in SDC , an 18.2% increase from 2013 . The age -adjusted rate of ED visits for mood disorders was 177.4 per 100,000 population. There were 428 deaths due to self -inflicted injury (suicide) in SDC in 2017. The age - adjusted suicide rate was 12.5 per 100,000 population. According to 2018 CHIS data, 16.1% of adults in SDC have ever seriously thought about committing suicide, a 71.3% increase from 2014 (9.4%). Among adults served by Cal ifornia's public mental health system in 2017, 83.2% of those ages 18 to 20, 76.2% of those ages 21 to 64, and 93.9% of those ages 65 or older were not in the labor force (SAMHSA, 2018). In the U.S., approximately 26 % of homeless adults staying in shelters live with serious mental illness, and an estimated 46 % live with severe mental illness and/or substance use disorders (NAMI, 2016). According to the SAMHSA, 21.2 million Americans ages 12 or older (7.8% of the population) needed treatment for a drug or al cohol problem in 2018, but just 1.4% of the population received treatment at a specialty facility (SAMHSA, 2019). According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) titled Mental Health in California: For Too Many, Care Not There , alth ough the number of adults with mental health coverage in California increased nearly 50 % between 2012 and 2015 due to Medi -Cal expansion, in 2015, approximately two -thirds of Californian adults with mental illness and adolescents who experienced major depressive episodes did not receive treatment (CHCF, 2018). Further, ED visits resulting in inpatient psychiatric admissions increased 30 % between 2010 and 2015. More robust community behavioral health services for low - income and uninsured patients may decreas e unnecessary ED use (CHCF, 2018). Objectives Provide behavioral health and substance use screenings to the community Provide community and social support for individuals impacted by behavioral health and substance use issues FY 201 9 Report of Activities In FY 2019, SMV and SMC provided several behavioral health and substance use screening opportunities for the community, both on -site and in partnership with local organizations. Throughout the year, SMV psychiatric evaluation and intake teams provided approximately 17,000 free psychiatric evaluations and referrals for the general community via phone calls, walk -ins and scheduled appointments. In addition , SMC spent more than 1,600 hours offering free chemical dependency assessments, educational materials and community referral resources to more than 850 community members. The free assessments were facilitated by a licensed mental health professional who provided individuals with re commendations for appropriate programs and levels of care. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 323 Check Your Mood Day is an annual event held in conjunction with National Depression Screening Day in October to raise behavioral health awareness, fight stigma and encourage community members to a ssess their emotional well -being. In FY 201 9, SMV partnered with CHIP and Live Well San Diego (LWSD) to provide Check Your Mood screenings \u2014 a brief questionnaire aimed at assessing risk for depression \u2014 and behavioral health resources at San Diego City Co llege as well as various Sharp locations . In May, SMV recognized Mental Health Awareness Month by providing behavioral health resources at events around SDC. This included the I Have a Story Resource Fair and Panel at San Diego City College, as well as a t Petco Park during a Padres baseball game. In addition, team members hosted resource tables at locations throughout the Sharp system. Further, the hospital's behavioral health experts participated in a panel discussion following a fi lm screening of the do cumentary Lift the Mask: Portraits of Life with Mental Illness - a special event at the Ultra Star Mission Valley theater hosted by SMMC and the International Bipolar Foundation. SMV and SMC also provided behavioral health screenings and resources at seve ral community events throughout the year. SMV and SMC continued to assist in planning SCVMC's Changing Minds \u2014 Minds Matter South County Mental Health Fair, a free event during which more than 50 community partners gathered to educate south region communit y members about behavioral health challenges and raise awareness of available community services and resources. During the event, SMV and SMC provided workshops on substance use and behavioral health, as well as behavioral health resources to approximately 150 community members. SMV and SMC also offered Check Your Mood screenings , hourly mindfulness circles and behavioral health resources to approximately 1,000 attendees at the 201 9 Sharp Women's Health Conference in May. SMV clinician s also presented at th e conference on multiple topics, including reducing caregiver stress; achieving balance in work, life and love; and Alzheimer's, dementia and strategies for brain health . Throughout the year, SMV offered a variety of support groups for community members with behavioral health challenges. A weekly Mood Disorders support group was available for individuals, family and friends impacted by depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD or anxiety. A National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders support group was also offered weekly for individuals and families affected by an eating disorder. Further, a biweekly Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) support group helped attendees develop coping skills to manage severe emotional reactions, intense anxiety, impulsivity, self -harm, suicidal thoughts and high -conflict relationships. More than 400 community members attended these support groups in FY 201 9. SMV further supported the community by providing free space for a variety of self -help groups to meet each week. The hospital's meeting spaces were booked for more than 2,000 hours in FY 201 9 for groups including Narcotics Anonymous (NA), the NA Family group, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Al -Anon, AA Dual Diagnosis , Cocaine Anonymous , Pills Anonymous , Project SMILE 12 Step Recovery Workshop , SMART Recovery San Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 324 Diego , Co-Dependents Anonymous , Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance , Obsessive Compulsive Disor der support group , Hoarders Working support group , Shyness and Social Anxiety group , San Diego Phobia Foundation , Concerned United Birthparents , the California Board of Registered Nursing's Nursing support group , A New PATH , and the SMV and SMC Aftercare a nd Lifetime Support meetings. An average of 440 community members received support from these groups each week during FY 201 9. For more than 50 years, the San Diego Rescue Mission (SDRM) has helped homeless individuals in San Diego create better lives fo r themselves through comprehensive programs, including services that address housing, hunger, behavioral health and other education and awareness programs. SMV continued to donate food to the SDRM three times each week to help support approximately 400 men , women and children living in the shelter. Each month during FY 201 9, SMV collected and donated approximately 650 pounds of food for the SDRM. In addition, SMV works with Sharp's Patient Access Services team to connect patients to critical insurance and financial resources that help reduce economic barriers to behavioral health care. Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including pati ents of SMV. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. New in FY 2019, SMV and SMC joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE) to better understand and address the SDOH that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH \u2014 the conditions where people li ve, learn, work and play \u2014 have a significant impact on the ability for community members to access care and maintain their health; particularly community members with behavioral health and substance use challenges. SMV and SMC joined the CIE pilot partner ship in order to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with SDOH needs, and to connect them directly to community resources specifically for those needs. More than 70 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and othe r social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared community member records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and current use of community programs and ser vices, and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. Beginning in fall 2019, SMV case managers and social workers received training on CIE as a tool to serve vulnerable patients in the acute care setting, including those patients exp eriencing food insecurity and homelessness. Metrics of this partnership, including demographic and utilization data, as well as volume and successful community referrals, are currently being collected and will help to assess the impact and value of the par tnership at the end of its pilot year in early summer 2020. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 325 FY 20 20 Plan SMV or SMC will do the following: Provide free psychiatric assessments, substance use screenings and referrals for the community Continue to participate in psychiatric rehabilita tion programs and activities Explore further collaborations and partnerships with community partners Host and facilitate various support groups and provide free meeting space for use by a variety of community self -help groups Continue to provide weekly food donations to the SDRM Evaluate the impact of the pilot year of the Sharp -CIE partnership to inform next steps in collaboration with community organizations to address SDOH Identified Community Need: Improving Behavioral Health Outcomes for At-Risk Seniors Rationale references the findings of the SMV and SMC 201 9 CHNAs, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rational e The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2019 CHNA processes identified behavioral health, including Alzheimer's disease and dementia, as one of the priority health needs affecting community members in SDC. The following conditions were identified in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA as priority behavioral health issues among seniors in SDC: Alzheimer's disease, dementia, mood disorders, and schizophrenia. According to the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 83% of respondents ages 65 and older ranke d aging concerns, including Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and 63% ranked behavioral health among the top five conditions with the greatest impact on overall community health in SDC. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, the rate of ED visits for Alzheimer's increased by 35.1% between 2014 and 2016, while the inpatient discharge rate increased by 16.3%. The rate of ED visits for dementia increased by 10.6%, while the inpatient discharge rate increased by 7.1%. According to data analyzed for the SMV 2019 CHNA, in 2017, half of senior inpatient discharges at SMV had a principal diagnosis that was classified as a mood disorder, while 18.4% of diagnoses were classified as an alcohol -related disorder, and 11.5% as dementia. This data analysis also revealed that, w hile individuals identified as w hite represented 63.7% of all inpatient discharges at SMV in 2017, they accounted for 74.2% of discharges among seniors. In addition, 22.9% of senior females and 33.7% of senior males admitted to SMV in 2017 had co -occurring behavioral health and substance abuse diagnoses. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 326 A focus group conducted with the SMC Aftercare Support Group as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process identified opioid misuse as a growing issue within the senior population. Participants identified a common scenario where a senior is prescribed pain medication for a chronic issue such as back pain, becomes dependent on that medication, and dependence progresses into an addiction. These same focus group participants also identified the foll owing health issues to be of special concern for seniors: behavioral health, arthritis, limited mobility, chronic pain, Alzheimer's disease, social isolation and food insecurity. In 2017, Alzheimer's disease was the third leading cause of death in SDC, the fourth leading cause of death in California, and the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. (County of San Diego HHSA, 2019 ; CDC , 2019). In 2017, adults ages 65 and older experienced the highest rates of hospitalization for Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders and schizophrenia when compared to all other age groups in SDC. In 2015, more than 84,400 San Diegans ages 55 and older were living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), which accounted for 10.7% of this age group. Assuming curre nt trends continue, by 2030, nearly 115,000 residents 55 years and older will be living with ADRD, representing a 36.5% increase from 2015 ( Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in San Diego County , 2018). According to 2018 CHIS data, 8.4% of SDC adul ts over the age of 65 thought about committing suicide in the past year. From 2016 -2018, 69.3% of SDC seniors who reported having mental/emotional or substance use issues sought help for those issues . ED visits for alcohol -related disorders among SDC senio rs increased 58.0% between 2013 and 2017. This was the largest percentage increase among all age groups over the five -year period. The 2017 hospitalization rate for acute substance -related disorders was 8.0 per 100,000 among SDC residents over the age of 6 5. This is a significant decline from 2013 (42.9 per 100,000 SDC residents over the age of 65). Certain circumstances of aging, such as loss of family and caregivers, social isolation and infirmity can be triggers for the onset of mental illnesses, includi ng alcoholism and serious depression, among seniors. Seniors with mental illnesses also face the insufficiency of geriatric health practitioners, including mental health practitioners (NAMI, 2016). According to a 2018 health policy brief by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Health Policy Research, the state's public mental health delivery system does not meet the needs of all seniors it serves. Deficits exist in the involvement of older adults in planning processes, outreach and se rvice delivery, as well as workforce development and the measurement and reporting of outcomes. Recommendations to improve access and utilization of behavioral health services by California seniors include designating distinct administrative and leadership structures at county levels; enhancing older adult outreach and documentation of unmet needs; establishing standardized training for geriatric providers; standardizing data-reporting requirements; and increasing the level of integration between medical, b ehavioral health, aging and substance use disorder services (UCLA, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 327 Behavioral health problems in older adults are often under -identified by health care professionals. Older adults experience unique stressors (e.g., declining functional ability or so cioeconomic status, and bereavement), which can result in isolation, loneliness and psychological distress that necessitate long -term care (World Health Organization, 2017). According to research presented by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), social isolation and loneliness have been linked to a variety of physical and mental conditions, including high blood pressure , heart disease , obesity , a weakened immune system, anxiety, depression , cognitive decline , Alzheimer's disease , and even death. People who find themselves unexpectedly alone due to the death o f a spouse or partner, separation from friends or family, retirement, loss of mobility, and lack of transportation are at particular risk (NIA, 2019). Objectives Provide culturally competent outreach services to vulnerable seniors in SDC's disadvantaged communities Provide education and screening s to senior community members Collaborate with community organizations to address the behavioral health needs of SDC seniors and other community members facing inequities FY 201 9 Report of Activities Throughout FY 201 9, SMV clinicians collaborated with Serving Seniors to provide more than 760 hours of clinical services to senior clients at the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center. Seniors received a variety of early intervention services, including examinat ion by a nurse; referrals for prescriptions or medication adjustment ; referrals or counseling to reduce the risk of hospitalization or homelessness; and behavioral health screenings including Montreal Cognitive Assessments, which detect cognitive impairmen t. SMV also continued to collaborate with the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center beyond the provision of clinical services. At this site, SMV provided free prevention and early intervention initiatives designed to improve the utilization and effectiven ess of behavioral health services for vulnerable , culturally diverse seniors and address barriers to accessing behavioral health care, including stigma, isolation and lack of available services. These services were further enhanced by case management servi ces, free psycho education for staff, seniors and families, and a weekly healthy aging support group led by an SMV clinician, which focused on aging and behavioral health issues, including depression, anxiety and coping with loss. SMV's Senior Intensive Ou tpatient Program (SIOP) is designed for older adults experiencing depression, anxiety, addiction or other behavioral health disorders. Using an educational approach, SIOP clinicians help seniors develop healthy coping strategies, maximize communication and conflict resolution skills, understand and Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 328 change unhealthy thoughts, and use relaxation techniques to manage anxiety and improve sleep. Throughout the year, SMV's SIOP staff provided education and outreach to community members in an effort to debunk th e myths associated with older adulthood, such as 'depression is a normal part of aging' and 'growing old is characterized by loss and pain.' Clinicians delivered lecture s titled Mental Health for Today's Older Adult, Older Adults and Mood Disorders, Health y Aging, and Tips and Tools for Mental Health to approximately 130 seniors and community members at events around SDC, including a Lunch and Learn event at North Park Senior Apartments, an in -service for staff members at Elderhelp of San Diego, a JFS Brunc h Club event at a private residence and an event at Incarnation Lutheran Church in Poway. In addition, SMV staff \u2014 including team members from the SIOP \u2014 offered four educational sessions addressing depression in older adults and c oping with life's transit ions through Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego. Lectures were delivered to approximately 60 community members at City Heights Weingart Library, Mountain View Library, Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos Library and Balboa Park Senior Lounge . Lastly, a clinicia n from SMV's Research team delivered a lecture on seniors and depression to 30 community members at Monarch Cottage senior living community in October. In collaboration with Sharp's Senior Health Centers, clinicians from SMV's SIOP and Research teams del ivered five lectures on topics including managing the holidays, brain health, and the impact of medications on brain function. Lectures were delivered to more than 50 community seniors at Sharp Senior Health Center Clairemont, Gary and Mary West Senior Wel lness Center and Westminster Senior Apartments. Throughout the year, SMV's SIOP provided behavioral health resources, memory screenings, and information about the hospital's senior services at numerous senior health fairs and community events in SDC, inc luding Sharp Senior Resource Centers' Senior Health and Resource Fair at Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church; SCHHC's Spring into Health event at John D. Spreckels Center and Bowling Green (Spreckels Center); the JFS Health Fair and Flu Shot Event at JFS College Avenue Senior Center and San Diego LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) Community Center's 1 3th annual Senior Resource Fair. In FY 201 9, more than 300 seniors and their family members were reached through the SIOP's participation in these community events. SMV's SIOP both provided behavioral health resources and presented at senior health - focused conferences throughout SDC, serving nearly 2,100 community members in FY 2019. Events included: Sharp Senior Resource Centers ' and Sharp Ho spiceCare's annual aging conference s titled Health and Wellness in Aging : Know Your Options at La Mesa Community Center, Elks Lodge in Chula Vista and Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church; Sharp Women's Health Conference at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina; and the County of San Diego Aging and Independence Services ' Vital Aging 201 9: Live Well to Age Well events at the San Diego Convention Center and California Center for the Arts in Escondido. At these conferences, SIOP clinicians Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 329 presented on a variety of topics, including stress management; healthy, mindful aging; and dementia and brain health. SMV also participated in the Sharp -sponsored Union - Tribune PRIME Expo at Town and Country San Diego in October . At this event, SMV offered resources rela ted to behavioral health , Alzheimer's research and enrollment in clinical trials to approximately 10,000 conference attendees. In FY 201 9, SMV partnered with Alzheimer's San Diego to provide a variety of screenings, behavioral health education and resour ces to community members. In May, SMV provided a resource table to 150 attendees at Carlsbad Library following a panel discussion on the link between Alzheimer's and genetics that was co -sponsored by Alzheimer's San Diego and the Caregiver Coalition. In August, SMV sponsored Alzheimer's San Diego's Date with a Cure event at Irwin M. Jacobs Qualcomm Hall as well as provided 500 attendees with behavioral health resources and information about participation in clinical trials. An SMV clinician also participate d in a panel discussion about recent advances in Alzheimer's treatment during the event. In September, SMV partnered with Alzheimer's San Diego to present a screening of Turning Point, an award -winning documentary capturing the drama and dedication of scie ntists and clinical trial volunteers who are working to make Alzheimer's a distant memory . Approximately 100 community members attended the event at Sharp's corporate office location, which also included a panel discussion on Alzheimer's research featuring an SMV clinician. On a monthly basis, SMV and Alzheimer's San Diego provided free memory screenings \u2014 a wellness tool that identifies possible changes in memory and cognition \u2014 to nearly 160 community members who were concerned about memory loss or intere sted in establishing a baseline to detect future changes. Additionally, throughout FY 201 9, SMV clinicians provided educational materials and lectures on advances in Alzheimer's research and opportunities to enroll in clinical research studies to approximately 1,200 community members at locations across SDC, including Glenner Town Square, Carlsbad Tri -City Wellness Center, San Diego Convention Center, California Center for the Arts in Escondido, Spreckels Center, Poway Branch Librar y, Sharp Bernardo, San Diego City College , Fredericka Manor Retirement Community, Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church, La Mesa Community Center, Sharp Grossmont Hospital Senior Resource Center, and Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center . SMV cli nicians also presented on clinical trials and Alzheimer's research throughout the year to nearly 70 attendees at Glenner Centers' Memory Caf\u00e9s, which provide a safe, supportive environment that engage s participants in cognitive activities designed to keep them mentally and socially active. In FY 2019, SMV participated in Memory Caf\u00e9 events at Poway Senior Center, Silvercrest Residences in Chula Vista, Grace Point Church, El Cajon Library, Mission Hills - Hillcrest/Knox Library, and La Jolla Community Center. In addition, in February, an SMV clinician delivered a webinar on the benefits of Alzheimer's research through the Caregiver Coalition's website. Lastly, an SMV clinician provided training on identifying appropriate candidates for clinical trials and the b enefits of clinical research to 10 social workers at Alvarado Parkway Institute in June. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 330 FY 20 20 Plan SMV will do the following: In collaboration with Serving Seniors, provide outreach and education to seniors without stable housing Continue to addres s the behavioral health needs of vulnerable , culturally diverse seniors Through SMV's SIOP, provide education and support to community members around senior behavioral health issues Participate in Sharp's partnership with the City of San Diego to provide s enior behavioral health education and resources to employees and residents in the city's nine districts In collaboration with Sharp Senior Health Center, provide education on senior behavioral health topics, including holiday blues and depression Continue to collaborate with community organizations to address the behavioral health needs of SDC seniors and other community members facing inequities Identified Community Need: Behavioral Health and Substance Use Education for Health Care Professionals and Students, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest in Health Care Careers Rationale references the findings of the SMV and SMC 201 9 CHNAs, HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2019 CHNAs identified education as one of the priority health needs affecting community members in SDC. According to the results of the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2019 CHNAs, 31% of responden ts ranked education, including access, health literacy, workforce development, and mobility, among the top five SDOH with the greatest impact on their community. According to participants in a focus group conducted during the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, when reside nts are unable to achieve higher levels of education, individual and community health are impacted in the following ways: limited or low wage employment opportunities for those with low educational attainment; constant stress related to housing or food amo ng families who are not economically secure, which contributes to poor health; and limited career mobility in low -wage jobs, creating little potential for promotions or higher wages. A key strategy for behavioral health workforce development identified by participants in the SMC Aftercare Support Group conducted as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process involves increasing education for health care providers related to addiction. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 331 This includes providing strategies for identifying when and how to intervene, holis tic pain management alternatives, and training focused on compassion and empathy. According to San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP), a major challenge faced by education and training programs in the health care sector is accommodating the number of clini cal training hours required for students in California to become certified. In addition, the health care industry is facing significant changes due to uncertainty related to legislation and technology, as well as the growing demand for services to support California's aging population (SDWP, 2017). A report from PolicyLink, a national research institute dedicated to advancing economic and social equity, suggests that building a diverse health care workforce in California \u2014 one that reflects the state's raci al, ethnic and linguistic diversity \u2014 is a critical strategy for increasing access to culturally and linguistically appropriate services, eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities , improving the quality of care and reducing preventable costs ( Buildin g an Inclusive Health Workforce in California: A Statewide Policy Agenda, 2018 ). As of September 2019, there were 544 designated Mental Health Care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) in California, representing approximately 7.9 million residents. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 405 new practitioners would need to be added to the behavioral health workforce in order to remove HPSA designation from all areas (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2019). A report titled California's Current and Future Behavioral Health Workforce indicates that many psychiatrists statewide are aging out of the workforce, contributing to a projected 34% decline in the number of practicing psychiatrists between 2016 and 2028. Action is needed to increase diversity in the field of incoming behavioral health care workers, particularly among psychiatrists and psychologists. To ensure that California's diverse population receives culturally, racially, ethnically and linguistically appropriate behavioral health services, increa sed racial and ethnic diversity as well as greater female representation among providers is necessary (Healthforce Center at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), 2018). The same report emphasizes the following strategies for improving access to behavioral health care treatment in California: greater cultural competency in the delivery of behavioral health care; adequate geographical distribution of facilities and training programs across the state; and increased provider participation in both public and private health insurance plans (Healthforce Center at UCSF, 2018). A report from the University of Washington's Center for Health Workforce Studies describes numerous challenges contributing to the nation's behavioral health workforce crisis, inclu ding the aging of certain occupations; low compensation and perceptions of low status for jobs requiring less formal education; and high burnout and stress due to the nature of the work (Center for Health Workforce Studies, 2016). According to a 2017 repor t from the National Council for Behavioral Health, the pool of psychiatrists working with public sector and insured populations declined by 10% between 2003 and 2013, for reasons including aging of the current workforce, low reimbursement rates, burnout, b urdensome documentation requirements and regulatory restrictions that make it difficult to coordinate care. In addition, the supply of psychiatrists who work in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric facilities has Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 332 declined significantly, with 40% of psychia trists now practicing in cash -only private practices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment of behavioral health social workers is projected to grow 11% from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. Emplo yment of substance use, behavioral disorder and mental health counselors is anticipated to increase 22%. Demand for employment in these occupations is expected to increase as greater numbers of people seek treatment for mental illness and substance use dis orders, and as insurance policies provide greater coverage for addiction and behavioral health services (BLS, 2019). As the criminal justice system increasingly recognizes treatment for substance use disorders as a cost -effective alternative to incarcerati on, use of substance use programs is likely to increase as states opt to sentence offenders experiencing drug and substance use issues to treatment and counseling services rather than jail (BLS, 2019). Objectives Collaborate with local schools to provide opportunities for students to explore health care professions Collaborate with the behavioral health community \u2014 including other behavioral health educational institutions \u2014 to provide education and training for health care professionals FY 201 9 Report of Activities Throughout the year, SMV participated in internship and clinical training programs for trainees and students in various health care disciplines, including clinical dietary/nutrition, psychology, clinical social work, social work admi nistratio n, MFT, pharmacy, health information technology (HIT), music therapy, clinical chaplaincy, medicine and nursing.

Throughout the year, SMV provided specialized learning opportunities for its MSW students. MSW students working with inpatients attended an intensive two -day orientation to become familiar with social work in the hospital setting. During the first semester, students spent two months shadowing SMV social worker s before earning Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 334 the opportunity to work under supervision. Students attended case presentations, in - services, staff meetings, treatment team meetings, staff huddles and other learning activities as part of their experience. During the second semester, MSW students rotated for one to two weeks through additional units at SMV. Students also had the opportunity to shadow social workers in various locations throughout the Sharp system. MFT and MSW students working specifically with outpatients also attended qu arterly two-hour trainings. In addition, SMV continued to participate in the Health Sciences High and Middle College (HSHMC) program in FY 201 9. The program provided 19 students in grades 11 and 12 with professional development opportunities within SMV's nursing units (Intensive Treatment Program, Mood Disorders, Senior Behavioral Health, SIOP and Chemical Dependency Recovery) as well as nutrition services. In addition, students received instruction on educational and job requirements as well as career la dder development. During FY 201 9, HSHMC students spent more than 4,100 hours at SMV. In FY 2019 , SMV provided behavioral health resources to more than 175 students at the Mesa College Mental Health Fair and the San Diego City College Health and Wellness Expo. SMV also provided behavioral health resources to more than 100 students at Mesa College and HSHMC in recognition of Suicide Prevention Week in September. At the 201 9 Agency Internship Fair hosted by SDSU, University of Southern California and CSUSM, S MV provided more than 350 behavioral health students, graduate students and clinicians with behavioral health resources and information about student internships. SMV and SMC provided continuing education classes, conferences and trainings for behavioral health care professionals in FY 201 9, including psychologists, psychiatrists, community physicians, social workers, nurses and other health and human service providers.

Behavioral health resources were also provided to more than 400 attendees of the annual Early Childhood Mental Health We Can't Wait Conference in September, which was held at the Crowne Plaza San Diego. SMV clinicians shared knowledge and best practices with the larger professional health care community through the development of educational materials on behavioral health and patient care as well as participation in student research. In FY 201 9, SMV continued to assist with the development of geriatric behavioral health and dementia care curricula for SDSU's Responsi ve Integrated Health Solutions, a County of San Diego Behavioral Health contracted program within SDSU's Academy for Professional Excellence . In addition, clinicians and patients from SMV's SIOP continued to participat e in research to help graduate psychol ogy students from SDSU better understand the needs of people with serious mental illness, as well as barriers preventing this population from accessing cancer screenings.

This year, Friends of Scott hosted the 13th annual Unforgettable Prom, where past and current cancer patients and their guests spent a night at Balboa Park to enjoy a complete prom experience. Sharp Health Plan also supports the Susan G. Komen Foundation through participation on their development committee and support of community events such as the Race for the Cure and their More Than Pink dinner. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 337 Section 12 Sharp Health Plan Sharp Health Plan is committed to making a meaningful difference in the quality of life for our fellow San Diegans. Through financial assistance and volunteerism, Sharp Health Plan supports programs that improve the health and well -being of our community . \u2014 Stephen Chin, Manager of Account Management and Community Relations, Sharp Health Plan Sharp Health Plan (SHP) is located at 8520 Tech Way, Suite 200 in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. SHP is not required to develop a community benefit plan as part of Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), nor is SHP required to conduct a community health needs assessm ent (CHNA). However, SHP partnered with and provided support to a variety of organizations in the San Diego community during fiscal y ear (FY) 2019, a selection of which are highlighted in this section. SHP services include health plans for both large and small employers, individual family plans and Medicare . FY 2019 Community Benefit Program Highlights SHP provided a total of $68,869 in community benefit in FY 2019. See Table 56 in this section for a summary of unreimbursed costs for SHP based on the categories identified in SB 697, and Figure 31 for the distribution of SHP's community benefit among those categories.

Rationale The Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties ( HASD&IC ) and Sharp 2019 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer, chronic conditions, community and social support, economic security, education, homelessness and housing instability, and unintentional injury and violence a s the priority health issues affecting members of the communities served by SHP. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA process described the following strategies for addressing priority health needs: the implementation of overarching strategies to address the health needs ; the development or expansion of resources to meet the needs; and the creation of systemic, policy and environmental changes to better support health outcomes. Each of these approaches require collaboration between health care professionals, community org anizations, residents , and political, health care system, and community leaders . Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified cancer as a condition that many members of the community fear, particularly brain, colon and breast cancers. Participants also described barriers to receiving cancer screenings and treatment, including: stigma surrounding a cancer diagnosis; fear about immigration status, particularly for asylum seekers; financial burdens , even for those with health insurance; a nd practical issues such as transportation to medical appointments. As part of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process, focus groups comprised of Sharp cancer patient navigators and clinical social workers identified the following health conditions and social determinan ts of health ( SDOH ) related to cancer: chronic diseases such as asthma or heart disease, which are often connected to stress; care challenges associated with behavioral health and substance use; barriers to care (cost, delays in receiving , care and fear re lated to diagnosis or immigration status; frustration with navigating health insurance; screening avoidance; logistics such as transportation or childcare; and language barriers); and fear of stigma due to cancer diagnosis. Focus group participants also described the following hospital discharge barriers and support needs: lack of patient or family support and education (particularly for caregivers); homelessness; insurance issues; limited follow -up care or access to medication; and a need for a \"one -stop shop\" incorporating financial navigators and legal support, as well as other resources like pain management or wigs. Participants in the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNA process suggested the following cancer -related s trategies for improving the health and well -being of the community: being more proactive about getting patients screened for cancer; providing free screenings and educational webinars; Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 340 providing more educational programs, including for cancer; increasing a ccess to primary care services; reducing wait times for primary and specialty care appointments; investing more in post -acute care management; providing opportunities for technical education on many areas of medicine; and developing decision -making tools t o assist with complex patient decisions. The American Hospital Association recognizes that collaborations, specifically partnerships between hospitals/health care and community organizations, are essential to addressing community health issues and creating a greater impact on health. Fostering effective and sustainable partnerships is integral for expanding opportunities for community health improvement ( A Playbook for Fostering Hospital - Community Partnerships to Build a Culture of Health , Health Research & Educational Trust, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, American Hospital Association, 2017). According to the Nonprofit Finance Fund, changing incentives, poor health outcomes and rising costs have spurred a wave of partnerships between human services and health care organizations to address pressing issues related to health and SDOH. Because many human services organizations are chronically under -resourced, investments in capacity and capital are necessary to support effective partnership, including: financia l management consulting to assist in mapping the growth and change implications of collaboration; funding reserves to help human services organizations mitigate risk and explore new approaches and partnerships; and data collection and analysis to measure o utcomes and costs associated with new approaches (Nonprofit Finance Fund, 2018). According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, 1 in 7 (14%) San Diegans experienced food insecurity. An additional 1 in 5 San Diegans were food secure but relied on su pplemental nutrition assistance to support their food budget (San Diego Hunger Coalition, 2019). In 2017, cancer was the leading cause of death for San Diego County ( SDC ) residents and was responsible for 23.2% of all deaths . In 2017, 19.1% of all cancer d eaths in SDC were due to lung cancer, 8.4% to colorectal cancer, 8.1% to female breast cancer, 7.6% to pancreatic cancer, 6.2% to prostate cancer, 6.2% to female reproductive cancers, 5.8% to liver cancer, and 3.7% to leukemia. According to the American Ca ncer Society ( ACS) 2017 California Cancer Facts & Figures report, 72.4% of breast cancer cases among non -Hispanic white women in SDC were diagnosed at an early stage, compared to 69.3% of African American cases, 68.1% of Hispanic cases and 70.4% of Asian/P acific Islander cases. Data suggests that early breast cancer detection resources are needed in minority communities. According to findings from the ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2019 report , the 40% decrease in the female breast cancer death rate between 1989 and 2016 is attributed to improvements in early detection, namely screening and increased awareness. The rates of new cancer cases and cancer deaths vary significantly among racial and ethnic groups, with rates generally highest among African American s and lowest for Asian Americans (ACS, 2019). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 341 Objective Participate in community -sponsored events and support nonprofit community health as well as social service organizations that address identified community health needs through financial donations, bo ard service and other contributions FY 2019 Report of Activities SHP supports San Diego's community -based organizations through a variety of activities, including: participation in and coordination of community -sponsored events; service on community boards and committees; and financial support and fundraising for health and social causes. In FY2019, SHP provided financial support to the following organizations : 2-1-1, AHA, Alliance for African Assistan ce, Alliance for Quality Education, ArtWalk, Asian Business Association of San Diego, Barney & Barney Foundation, Chicano Federation, County of San Diego, FHCSD, Food Bank, Friends of Scott Foundation, Girl Scouts San Diego, Hands United for Children, Home Start, Inc., Japanese American Citizens League, La Maestra Community Health Centers, Las Patronas, Lightbridge Hospice, Lions Tigers & Bears, Living it Up LLC, Logan Heights Community Development Corporation, MANA de San Diego, Neighborhood House Associat ion, Pacific Arts Movement, San Diego Association of Health Underwriters, San Diego Humane Society, San Diego Second Chance, San Ysidro Health, SAY San Diego, Serving Seniors, St. Paul's Retirement Home Foundation, Susan G. Komen San Diego, The Arc of San Diego, Union of Pan Asian Commu nities, University of San Diego, the YMCA and more . Among the many health issues addressed through SHP's support of these organizations, the impact of cancer on the San Diego community was a top priority. Each day in SDC, s ix women are diagnosed, and one woman passes, from breast cancer. SHP is dedicated to investing in local organizations that improve health in SDC, including those that provide aid to individuals affected by cancer. Friends of Scott is a local nonprofit fou ndation founded by a former Sharp employee in remembrance of her son who lost his life to childhood cancer. The foundation's mission is to ensure support for children and families' emotional and financial needs while they cope with cancer, as well as bring childhood cancer awareness to the community. In FY 2019, SHP continued to financially support Friends of Scott's 13th annual Unforgettable Prom, where more than 200 past and current pediatric cancer patients and their guests spent an evening at Balboa Park to enjoy a complete prom experience , including free corsages and boutonnieres, prom dresses, accessories and tuxedo rentals. Susan G. Komen San Diego is dedicated to saving lives by meeting the most critical needs in SDC and investing in breakthrough research to prevent and cure breast cancer. The organization is committed to improving laws and systems, removing barriers, and elevating those impacted by the disease . In FY 2019, SHP served on Susan G. Komen San Diego's development committee for the annual More Than Pink Dinner, which brought together 350 survivors, supporters, community members and corporate leaders . At the event, a cancer survivor and her physician \u2014 a Sharp -affiliated Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 342 radiation oncologist \u2014 discussed her journey with cancer . SHP also supported Susan G. Komen San Diego through participation on their development committee for the Race for the Cure event at Balboa Park in FY 2019. SHP also supports community clinics that provide access and assistance to community members impac ted by cancer . This includes La Maestra Community Health Centers , which partners with Every Woman Counts \u2014 a state -funded cancer detection program . The program ensures that low -income , under - or un insured women in California ages 40 and older, have access to free breast health resources and services, including breast and cervical screenings, mammograms and Pap smears. In addition, La Maestra Community Health Centers ' early breast cancer detection program, which is funded by Susan G. Komen San Diego, educate s women at community events and faith -based and educational institutions who might not otherwise receive breast health education or screenings. In May, SHP supported La Maestra Community Health Centers' Treasure Island Casino Night, an annual fundraising e vent with entertainment, international food, dancing, casino games and more. The event benefitted La Maestra's Economic Empowerment Program, which empowers, supports and provides job training for women from low -income and immigrant or refugee households. FHCSD is dedicated to providing affordable, caring, high -quality health care and supportive services to the community, including the uninsured, low -income and medically underserved. FHCSD offers a variety of services and programs to address the health care needs of San Diegans, including individuals affected by cancer , as well as collaborates with Every Woman Counts to provide community members with free cancer screenings and follow -up services. SHP proudly supports FHCSD's bimonthly Spirit of the Barrio lu ncheons, which inform, educate and entertain hundreds of community members through a diverse list of guest speakers and topics such as organ donation, homelessness and housing, community plan updates and more . New in FY 2019, SHP joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1's Community Information Exchange (CIE) to better understand and address the SDOH that influence the health and well -being of their members. Research continues to underscore that SDOH \u2014 the conditions where people live, learn, work and play \u2014 have a significant impact on the ability for individuals to access care and maintain their health. SHP joined the CIE pilot partnership in order to provide more informed, holistic care to their members with SDOH needs, and to connect them d irectly to community resources specifically for those needs. More than 70 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care, food banks, housing and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared community member records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and current use of community programs and services, and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. Beginning in late fall 2019, SHP staff received training on CIE as a tool to serve members who could benefit from connection to community resources. Metrics of this partnership, including demographic and utilization data, as well as volume and Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 343 successful community referrals, are curr ently being collected and will help to assess the impact and value of the partnership at the end of its pilot year in early summer 2020. FY 2020 Plan SHP will do the following: Participate in community -sponsored events to address identified health nee ds for San Diegans and provide health information and education Provide coordination, financial support and fundraising activities for local nonprofit organizations \u2014 particularly organizations that support vulnerable communities throughout SDC Continue to serve on various community boards that support the health and well - being of the community Appendices Appendices Appendix A Sharp HealthCare Involvement in Community Organizations Community boards, committees and civic organizations where Sharp HealthCare executive leadership and staff participated on the organization's behalf.
