Femminella Ph.D., CNS. REIKI Reiki (pronounced ray-key), is a Japanese term for the \"universal Life Force\". In some cultures it is referred to as \"Prana\", \"Chi'', or \"Spirit\". Energy flows through the practitioner's hands and is transmitted to the client. The client absorbs as much energy as needed to rebalance themselve. The healer is a channel that the energy flows through, such as an electrical wire does with electricity. Reiki is not a religion and was re-discovered in the 19th century by Dr. Mikao Usui , a Japanese monk. In Tibet, he found ancient writings that described the keys to healing with touch. Reiki was brought to the United States in the 1930's by Mrs. Hawayo Takata. Mrs. Takata was the first woman and the first in the U.S. to receive Reiki Training. Besides humans, Reiki can be applied to animals and plants. The Reiki session starts at the head and through a series of hand positions, ends at the client's feet. Each position is held until the practitioner feels the energy balance. The total session lasts approximately one hour. The Universal Life Force has its own intelligence and goes where it is needed for the client to heal.
