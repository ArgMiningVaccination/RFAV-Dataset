I will be working alongside Laurence Crutchlow and the editorial team to maintain thehigh production value and quality articles youhave (hopefully) come to expect! \"he real beauty of Nucleus is the amount of student involvement; many of the articles you readin this and every issue are written by you, thestudent body of cMf. It seems somewhat felicitousthen for a student to be part of its production - a step closer to the aim of producing a journal 'by students, for students'. \"o that end, allow me to use my first editorial as a platform for a shameless plug! It truly is a joy forus to receive student submissions, so why not writesomething yourself? perhaps your last publishedwork was in the primary school rag, and thethought of writing an article for the world to seefills you with horror. You could start by reviewing a film or a book. Or maybe you have already established yourself as a prolific wordsmith, your style honed and perfected over the years.could this be another outlet for your talents? In this edition of Nucleus , the focus is physical health. Why should we bother devoting an issue to it when our spiritual health is what actuallymatters? rebecca Horton shows us the importanceof our bodies as exemplified by Jesus (page 4).Many have to deal with disability on a daily basisand it can be difficult to know how to respondappropriately as a christian. Steve Sturman leadsus through both an individual and clinical approach(page 8). In the spiritual domain, faith healing haslong been the subject of controversy. andrewfergusson presents a review of healing miracleswhilst laying down a challenge for all of us. finally, I share my recent personal experience of dieting along with some of the snares I faced along the way. as for our regular features, James adams explains to us the concept of social justice and inspires us to personal action in essentials . In mythbusters , Julie Maxwell deals with many of the myths surrounding transgender in children. leo Hacking helps us be prepared to survive the turmoil we may face in our foundation years. John Greenall writes about the power we gain as leaders and how best to use it. We also have a plethora of reports and reviews on everything from Helen roseveare to p\" barnum, travel from romania to leeds, and from the centuries old daniel fast to our modern-day mobile phones! I hope we all will benefit from thinking about this issue of physical health together. It has motivated me to finish my diet, and maybe a few of you willbe spurred to action too. and on a related note, I especially hope my editorship will keep Nucleus in peak physical health.

Rebecca Horton considers the value of human bodies5 ISSUE 49:2Rebecca Horton is a final year medical student at UEa the debate: why is this contentious? 'Practising medicine is simply a means to bring salvation to people's souls. ' \"his statement immediately feels incorrect, outrageous even... but how do we know that? What is our rationale for healing bodies that will die anywayand be resurrected? What if Jesus' healing ministrywas all about drawing crowds in? If we could getalongside people in a different way, would we? Howmuch does the physical body matter? What is theabsolute value of healthcare today? \"hese initial thoughts are not too far removed from the 'original' mission paradigm. 'You're notstrictly speaking a missionary' 1was the attitude when medical work was first proposed as a part of globalmission. \"his was perhaps due to an extrapolation ofthe dichotomy believed to exist between body andsoul: a concept that is partially true 2but does not mean that man is wholly dichotomous and can beseparated into a physical and spiritual form. \"o put itplainly, we are neither ensouled bodies or embodied souls: but whole people who are greater than the sumof these parts. \"his understanding is important. Ifmankind was regarded as a soul that needed saving with the body almost irrelevant, there would indeedbe no absolute reason to practise medicine otherthan to gain entry to preach the gospel or as someway of demonstrating God's love. \"he whole story of the bible affords dignity, respect and honour to physical human bodies. \"his begins in Genesis, continues throughout the Old \"estament, is made abundantly clear in Jesus'sministry and is revealed fully in biblical descriptionsof the new heaven and new earth. It is indeed truethat healthcare canbe a means of demonstrating God's love and through this some may be brought tofaith. but this is not where all the value lies. \"he biblegives compelling reasons to treat physical humanswith the utmost care and dignity: the eternal, physical nature of human beings is at the core of this.considering the bible as the true story of the entireworld 3explains to us what we instinctively know: physical health matters. created: physically 'The Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being .' (Genesis 2:7) although created for a different purpose to animals, man is of the same continuum, made in unity with the physical universe. physical human bodies are made of the dust of the earth, heavenly bodies from heavenly material.4Each have their own glory. Man is not, therefore, simply a spiritual being trapped in an earthly body. \"he created 'living being'5is a unified body, soul, mind and spirit and this is also the patternfor the resurrection, 6where we will be fully resurrected with our mortal bodies becomingimmortal as well as our souls. God asserts the importance of his physical creation (' and it was very good ', [Genesis 1:31]) and gives man special responsibility over it, known as the creation Mandate. ' God blessed them and said to them, \"be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves onthe ground .\"' (Genesis 1:28) Man is distinguished from the rest of creation by his relationship with God, butnot to the exclusion of his physical body. Man isdescribed as a 'living being': encompassing body,mind, soul and spirit into one seamless being. \"hestewardship commanded over the earth extends tostewardship over the bodies of ourselves and others.In caring for bodies, we also play an important part in God's restoration; the coming of the new (perfect!)creation. \"he story continues when physical brokenness enters with the fall. 7critically, this mandate to care for the earth is not revoked. a new day is promisedwhen evil will be defeated, and the world restored,but in the meantime man and woman are to continuetheir role of stewardship. \"he later promises of re-creation are not a contradiction to the importance of caring for the physical world now, but rather encourage us to work to restore broken physicalbodies as we play a part in foreshadowing God'srestoration. \"he promised re-establishment of peace(in Hebrew, shalom ) refers to wholeness and reiterates the creation of man as mind, body, soul and spirit, beautifully intertwined. neither the storyof creation, nor the promise for restoration of God's people, present an argument for humans beingmerely embodied souls. \"he hygiene and cleansing parts of the law 8 primarily demonstrate God's holiness, and theholiness of his people as a nation set apart. but theyalso protect (and certainly do not jeopardise) theirphysical health. God does not command practices that harm physical health, but he protects the bodieshe's made. He shows his concern for physical needsthrough providing food for his wandering nation inthe desert, 9so his people can be sure he will provide for them. a wonderful example of God's personal,holistic care is found in 1 Kings 19. Elijah is distraught,he ' came to a broom bush, sat down under it and then prayed that he might die ' (1 Kings 19:4). \"he lord reacts with gentleness and first cares for Elijah'sphysical needs by providing sleep, bread and waterbefore meeting his emotional and spiritual concerns. God did not 'give up' on his physical creation after the fall, and indeed is still sustaining it. \"he mandate in creation that we too should care for the physicalbeings of this world still stands. Jesus healed: physically 'Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, \"Yoursins are forgiven\", or to say, \"Get up, take your matand walk\"? But I want you to know that the Son of Manhas authority on earth to forgive sins.' So he said tothe man, 'I tell you, get up, take your mat and gohome.' (Mark 2:9-11) 1. not just to draw the crowds Healing forms a huge part of Jesus' ministry.although he is clear that heavenly matters areparamount, 10we 'do not have a high priest who isunable to feel sympathy for our weaknesses'. (Hebrews 4:15) Jesus himself has a physical human body. as he heals the woman who is bleeding,11weeps with lazarus's sisters12and gives back the sight to the blind man,13Jesus demonstrates that his healing is out of love, not simply to draw crowds to hear his name. His tears for lazarus proclaim that sufferingand death matter. caring for the physical healthneeds of others is an outpouring of godly love. More than that: it is part of the restoration promised, as we get a glimpse of this heavenly restoration inchrist's ministry. 2. command to care physically Whether or not the miraculous healings seen in acts are to be expected today is widely debated.14 but the command to care for those who suffer, and specifically for their physical health needs, is not amatter of debate. Our attitudes towards the physical needs of others reflect our attitude towards God. If we tell people the gospel without attending to theirsuffering, can we really claim to love them? ' For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was ill and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me ' (Matthew 25:35-36). christ loves and cares for the physical needs of his people so much, that when we care for them, it is as though we are caring for him personally. 3. inwardly groan for physical restoration christ attending to both spiritual and physical needsis demonstrated in the story of the paralysed man. 15 We're not told why this man was paralysed, or even much about him. Jesus attended to his spiritual needs first, making it clear that our sin is more serious than our physical sufferings now. Jesus first forgives his sins. but, as Jesus also cares about this man's physical suffering, he then tells him to get up and walk. He came to bring us into relationship with God. but this doesn't mean that he thinks our physical suffering is unimportant. We should also considerwhat this doesn't say about healing. first, we know ISSUE 49:2 6should Christians care about physical health?from the rest of Scripture that physical sickness is not always a result of individual sin16that will disappear when sins are forgiven. physical healing is not promised to everyone who comes to faith,17 nor is it only given to people who have come to faith: natural and supernatural healing can happen to saints and sinners alike. additionally, the bibledemonstrates that physical healing can happenmiraculously, but it is not guaranteed before heaven. \"hat longing for final healing is captured by paul as he 'groan(s) inwardly', awaiting ' redemption of our bodies .'18Healing is promised in the new creation where there will be ' no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order ofthings has passed away ' . Sickness and death will no longer be the order of the day. although in God'sgrace we see a foreshadowing of this healing now,a correct theology will help keep us from stumblingwhen we do not always see the healing that wegroan for on this earth. 4. incarnation demonstrates dignity finally, Jesus being himself fully human proclaims theimportance of physical bodies. In Jesus's incarnation,God bestows his own glory on the human body andthis alone is enough to tell us that all human bodiesshould be treated with honour, respect and dignity. we will be recreated: physically 'Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here, see my hands.Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Stopdoubting and believe.\" Thomas said to him \"My Lordand my God!\"' (John 20:26-28) far from being a reason to ignore our physical bodies, Jesus's resurrection in human form is anendorsement of the physical body, the 'final yes' to the pinnacle of his creation.19If physical matter was just to be done away with in the new creation, something we would no longer see, then the argument for its value is lessened. ' But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep ' (1 corinthians 15:20) and we will also have physical resurrection bodies. as God asserted that the physical body was 'very good' at creation, he now demonstrates that it is good enough for the new creation. Our physical bodies will ' be changed - in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable ' (1 corinthians 15:52) with a physical new creation. concluding thoughts: how does this affect us practically? How we consider the human form has implications for us as doctors and nurses. \"he bible, throughout its story, affords a great deal of dignity and respect for the human form. Yes, the eternal souls of mankind deserve the deepest outpouring of our hearts. but this eternal significance of our souls does not diminish the respect our bodies deserve. Indeed, we were created whole, redeemed whole inchrist, and will be restored whole on that final day. In all these states physical matter plays a part. It iseasy to dismiss the human body when what we seedaily is its weakness. We yearn for the time when'the new is here' (2 corinthians 5:17). let's rejoice inthe beauty of wholeness. let's delight when we seea glimpse of restoration now. and let's look forwardto when the physical world is made new, assertingnow the utmost respect for the human body,knowing that God himself has indeed given it the 'final yes'. 20 7 ISSUE 49:21.

IbidrEfErEncESshould Christians care about physical health?ISSUE 49:2 8HUMAN BEINGS: WHY BODIES MATTER a biblical approach to disability Steve Sturman explores our care for disabled peopleISSUE 49:2Steve Sturman is a consultant in rehabilitation and neurology in birmingham, and cMf's new associate Head of Graduate Ministries We seem to have come a long way in our view of disability. disability is a 'protected characteristic' under the Equality act 2010. a person with a disability can legally expect to have equal access to employment and services. and yet today, many people with disability feel disempowered, vulnerable and even abused in our society. In reality, equal access to employment, transport, leisure and even healthcare facilities is a myth. repeatedly in my practice, patients tell me 'We've had to fight for everything we've got' as they struggle to adjust to the 'new normal' of life withchronic impairments. Some described the experienceof leaving acute care and returning to the communitywith new disabilities as like 'falling off a cliff edge'.\"hey found the brutal reality of life-changingimpairments was combined with the discovery thatsupport and services were often paper-thin or non-existent. for all the fine sentiments about caring for people with disability, society is failing. furthermore,if we look beyond the horizon of our own domain, we see an ocean of suffering worldwide where thedisabling effects of disease are feared and loathed.How should a christian respond? What is the biblical view of disability? Is there a christian distinctive anddoes it matter? what does the bible say? fundamental to biblical theology is the understandingthat we as humans are made in the image of God. 1 Human beings are beautiful, creative, passionate,ingenious and energetic - made to inhabit and subduethe world. but all is not right. \"he image of God ismarred by sin, allowing death and decay to enter. Wefind ourselves sitting in hospitals and clinics the worldover, pondering and struggling with the consequences.but equally fundamental to the biblical narrative is theknowledge that the God we worship is committed torestoration. 2It was not meant to be this way and he has determined that ultimately, by his own sacrificialgiving, perfection will be restored and 'sorrow andsighing will flee away'. 3\"he christian clinician therefore has a world view that asserts that there is an ultimate hope. all this suffering is not in vain. It is not the end of the story. \"his hope gives resilience and endurance - a key factor in being able to care for people with disability, day after day without being overwhelmed with despair. \"his hope is rooted in present reality and not 'make believe' or artificially triumphalist. When impacted with grief for his friend lazarus's premature death, Jesus wept. 4We have a God who intimately knows the pain of abuse, loss andsuffering. Ironically, the Old \"estament law thatseems to discriminate against any form of disabilityin the priesthood 5is in fact there to emphasise that the One who was to come would indeed be perfect,but would then give up that perfection by taking onthe pain, grief and physical consequences of oursinful state. 6but what did this actually look like as Jesus met people with disability, and how mightthat affect our attitudes today? what did Jesus do? repeatedly, Jesus had compassion on men and women who were made in God's image yet suffering with broken bodies. In contrast, healthcare systems today seem to have become self-seeking and populated by clinicians who see patients as 'getting in the way of them doing their job'. \"hat may be stereotypical, but christian clinicians should be different, with the spirit of christ's compassion at their core. Jesus never exploited people with disability. \"here was no media show around those that were healed. 'Keep it quiet' he said on many occasions.7Jesus never used people with disability to gain credibility. How different to the attitude I sometimes cherish - to obtain fame and recognition for my work with the marginalised, even in christian circles. \"rue christlike service seeks no recognition or reward at the expense of those suffering with disability. 9restoring autonomy and control to those who had lost it was central to his ministry. How many times did he ask the person with obvious rehabilitation needs 'What do you want me to do?'8Jesus models servanthood. He takes away the power gradient, making no assumptions about perceived needs. \"he person is central. Jesus was, and is, the ultimate advocate. blind bartimaeus is being silenced as an embarrassment until Jesus asks that he be brought to him.9 Ultimately that spirit of advocacy takes Jesus to the cross. a christian clinician cannot sit idly by and watch a vulnerable fellow human be treated unfairly, simply because they have no voice, or mobility or access to social media. \"he spirit of Jesus's advocacy drives the christian clinician to push the boundaries for access to services and vocation. note too, that Jesus separates guilt from disability. 'neither this man sinned nor his parents', he once said, indicating that disability is part of a bigger picture.10He soundly rules out the primitive notion that 'the disabled are cursed'. \"hat attitude powerfully devalues the person with disability, virtually mandating neglect or disinterest. but Jesus says this is not the case. \"he christian clinician does not struggle with judgmentalism towards the person with disability. but Jesus makes the inextricable link between our fall from grace as humans and suffering, and so makes the declaration that forgiveness is an integralpart of healing. 11a christian clinician will always know that the deepest human need is not restoration of thebody, but restoration of peace with God and so will bepraying for that special grace for those they treat. \"his is the nature of a christlike attitude to disability, derived not just from a cognitiveapprehension of the character of christ, but because we have 'the mind of christ.' 12when I am in the eye of the storm However, for the individual coping with the acute realisation of loss of ability there is a different perspective. One might expect to see a range of reactions. Guilt, either real or imagined, can be framed by questions such as, 'Is it my fault?', 'Is God angry with me?', 'If only I hadn't...'. fear might emerge around what the future holds, coupled with grief for the loss of what was, or might have been. Shame and loss of self-esteem might be expected, particularly in relation to personal care issues such as incontinence. coupled with this may be anxiety about acceptability - 'Will I still be loved?' - andvulnerability with the loss of power. Small wonder then that people predicting their response to being disabled might fearfully say 'I would never want tolive like that.' \"he surprising thing, however, is that in practice these reactions are not usually those immediately seen. \"hey seem only to be brought out as trust is built with the clinician. Such trust is generated by the qualities that we have already mentioned and that Jesus modelled. \"his investment of trust carries huge responsibility, which the christian clinician carries with the fear of God before their eyes, knowing he is intensely on the side of the vulnerable. furthermore, those looking in from the outside may see things very differently from the person dealing with disability. \"he so called 'disability paradox' describes the phenomenon that many people with serious disabilities report that they experience a good or excellent quality of life, when to most external observers they seem to live an undesirable existence. In one study, more than half of a group of interviewees with moderate or severe disabilities reported 'excellent' or 'good quality of life'. 13 In another national survey from australia, 40% of people with profound or severe activity limitation regarded their health status as 'excellent', 'verygood' or 'good'. 14analysis of the factors behind this suggests that a person's impairments and their perceived health are not directly related.15 In practice, this means that the likelihood of ISSUE 49:2 10a biblical approach to disability a christian clinician cannot sit idly by and watch a vulnerable fellow human be treated unfairly'meaningful recovery' from the patient's point of view should not be judged on the simple measure of the severity of a person's impairments; thecontext is all important. another strand of thought in the rehab literature is the tension between 'restoration', that is gettingback to 'normal', and 'transformation', that isworking with the 'new normal'. In practice mostpeople start with the goal of complete restorationbut make a journey towards transformation withtime. a biblical metaphor has even been used toillustrate this idea, that failure to get back tonormal may not be second best. 16 \"here is also growing interest in so called post- traumatic growth, a controversial observation thatpositive psychological effects can be seen followingtrauma. \"hat there seems to be such a phenomenonis clear, but understanding what it really is, and howit comes about is still open to question. but what does the christian clinician make of these counter-intuitive processes? first, theyresonate with biblical thinking that an individual is more than just a perfect physical being. \"here is abigger narrative at work in each of our lives thanthe pursuit of physical perfection and prosperity.people have intrinsic value. Outcomes can beunexpected and don't just depend on 'getting back to normal'. Second, these processes impact care planning. frontline clinicians may see only hopelessness andloss in the acute setting. \"his may wrongly lead toearly conclusions about the futility of treatment.raising awareness of the range of long-termoutcomes is important, and whilst not a purelychristian view, it is an important part of advocacyfor the vulnerable, which our lord expects of us.disability and clinical practice Seeing a patient as 'incurable', or their situation as 'hopeless', profoundly affects clinical practice. for example, the management of disability is simply not seen as the core business of acute medicine. \"eammembers may not be interested in tackling complexneeds, and junior doctors cannot be blamed - rarelydoes disability management figure in examinations.Who has ever heard of an OScE long case looking atneurogenic bowel management? \"hat is someoneelse's job. repeated meaningless entries in the notes like 'awaiting rehab' are evidence of the disconnect.does anyone appreciate what other team membersare actually doing? Or is there a hint of arrogancethat such things are secondary? \"eam relationshipsare understandably not warmed by this and patients suffer. \"his is not the image of christ. negative attitudes toward disability also pervade the upper atmosphere of healthcare planning.Enablement and care services are easy to neglect and slash. people with disability have only limitedresources to fight their corner. \"he christian clinician, however, sees the person in the 'eye of the storm' as absolutely worthy ofequal esteem. It is hard to see how christians cannotspeak up and tackle these deep-rooted distortions in clinical practice, once we understand Jesus's values. what now? It is remarkable that the Gospels give us so much information about how Jesus dealt with people withdisability. Surely this is there for a reason? despite allour best efforts, secular human beings still strugglewith disability in themselves and others. Jesusmodels a different way, in which he invested his bodyand blood. as disciples, we should follow him. 1.

Andrew Fergusson gives a biblical and medical review of healing miracles, and prayer for healing Old \"estament Miracles in the O\" are comparatively rare and are mainly confined to times of deliverance. Most aremiracles of nature, provision, preservation, or are arevelation of God's will. \"he most numerous are ofjudgment. \"here are only eight healing miracles, 1 three of which involve raising the dead.2 new \"estament by contrast, healings appear on almost every pageof the Gospels. \"here are 25 healings of individualsby Jesus and 16 descriptions of him healing largegroups. \"he Gospels and \"he book of acts also describe 18 healings by the apostles and other disciples. 3 20th century after 1,900 years of almost total silence, the charismatic renewal Movement (of the 1960s onwards) revived interest in prayer for healing.controversial claims were made and re-examined.by the new millennium, most churches had settled down into one of two agreed positions. Some leaned towards the cessationist position -13 ISSUE 49:2Andrew Fergusson worked as a Gp and for 15 years at cMf. He is the author of Hard Questions about Health and Healing . that once the canon of Scripture was closed by the end of the first century, God did not need anyfurther accounts of himself and so supernaturalgifts and activities ceased. proponents added thatin any case we now have the 'miracles' of modernmedicine and the nHS. \"he other extreme tended towards the 'blessed are they that expect nothingfor they shall never be disappointed' position. We see no miracles because we don't expect themand therefore don't pray for them. let's explore this continuing controversy by considering two key words in the debate. what do we mean by 'miracle'? a large part of our problem is that we use the word'miracle' very casually. Every brand new parent isawestruck by the miracle of childbirth, but it is avery natural phenomenon. Early risers will beamazed by the miracle of a beautiful new dawn, butone has happened every day for a long time now! any dictionary will help us decide the right use of the word for this debate. Mine defines miracle as: 1. an event contrary to the laws of nature and attributed to a supernatural cause. 2. any amazing or wonderful event. 3. a marvellous example of something: a miracle of engineering .4 We need to stay with the first definition. Years ago, dr peter May analysed the characteristics ofchrist's miracles of healing and found: 5 \"he conditions were not symptoms but obviousexamples of gross physical disease at that time they were incurable and mostremain so today Jesus almost never used physical means \"he cures were immediate restoration was complete and thereforeunarguable \"here were no recorded relapses Miracles regularly elicited faithapplying this biblical gold standard to contemporary claims of miracles, and with the wealth of technology and medical documentation we have today, scientifically trained doctors will be sceptical of frequent modern miracles. why are there inappropriate claims for miracles of healing? leaving aside the few fraudsters and charlatans, well-meaning lay people may sincerely believe a miracle has happened, but a quick review can usually suggest alternative medical explanations:6 Was the original diagnosis wrong? Spontaneous remissions do occur - was this one? Were the symptoms psychosomatic? Have there been simple misunderstandings? Have there been exaggerations and half-truths? So, from an evidence-based consideration of the word 'miracle', let us now turn to the second key word. what do we mean by 'healing'? Most people wanting prayer for healing are actually looking for a cure - for the relief of distressingsymptoms, for their cancer treatment to becompletely effective etc. luke, the physician, wasthe only Gospel writer to record a passage thatshows the difference between cure and healing: ' Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus travelled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosymet him. They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, \"Jesus, Master, have pity on us!\" Whenhe saw them, he said, \"Go, show yourselves to thepriests.\" And as they went, they were cleansed.a large part of our problem is that we use the word 'miracle' very casuallyOne of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him - and he was a Samaritan. Jesus asked, \"Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?

Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil inthe name of the Lord.

Whenever I fancy a snack, I open my fridge, grab my nice olivespread, maybe some breaded ham, mature cheddar and a bit of rocket, and I pull it all togetherinto a rather successful sandwich in under twominutes. \"here's a brilliant video of a man who tries to make a sandwich from scratch. He grows his owngrain and lettuce, milks a cow to make his butter,extracts his salt from the sea and so forth. \"heprocess takes him six months. It takes me just two minutes! You see the ability to make a sandwich isn't predominantly down to your culinary abilities, but instead the ingredients you were given to start with. now imagine the sandwich represents what the world would consider to be a 'successful life'. I'vebeen given all the ingredients I might need, straightto hand. I was brought up in a loving family; I'venever experienced abuse; I've always been caredfor and built up by those around me, and as such I am reasonably confident. I've been given a stablehome and parents who instilled key values in me, but also taught me the importance of boundaries. I had a great education and was shown the value ofhard work. My parents protected my health, neversmoked around me, and ensured I ate healthymeals. I've been given the best possible start in life.all those ingredients I need to make my successful'life sandwich' were handed to me on a plate. now flip that on its head and think about some of the people society loves to judge. for example,John was brought up in a home where he wasabused, resulting in rock bottom self-esteem. He never ate decent meals, so his health suffered.John saw that mum and dad never worked so didn'tsee the need to try hard at school. He got some bad marks and was branded thick, so he started to believe it was true. Mum battled with angerproblems and addiction, which regularly came outat home and so drink, drugs and lashing-out were part of normal life for him. all his life, people have let him down, and he's learnt that trusting people leads to pain. Why don't people like John make successful 'life sandwiches'? Is it because they're lazy, or thick, or they don't want to change? Unfortunately, this is what a lot of people believe. no - it's because they've not been given the same ingredients to make their sandwich. \"hey've had to start from scratch. If you sat a sandwich- making OScE and were given nothing, whereas your colleague was given all the ingredients they could possibly need, and you were judged by the same criteria - wouldn't you be outraged? One of the most common themes in the bible is serving the poor and vulnerable. Some argue that Scripture dedicates more word time to it than other important themes such as giving, leadership,heaven and hell and even prayer! clearly, this is a topic that is on God's heart. We would neversee prayer as an optional part of being a christian,just for those who are 'called to it', so why is socialjustice just for those who 'have that calling'? It seems to me that Scripture suggests serving the vulnerable should be a priority for us all. but where do we start? \"he GMc tells us we should care for patients holistically, but what does that mean for patientslike John? It means we must learn not just to putplasters over superficial problems, but as christianmedics we should learn to look at the broaderpicture. 17 ISSUE 49:2the ability to make a sandwich isn't predominantly down to your culinary abilities, but instead the ingredients you were given to start withduring my intercalated year, I set up a charity called number 11. Our focus is on creating a family and a home, where we address many of the socialdeterminants which dictate the health of ourclients. We work to support clients with issuesaround homelessness, addiction, battles withmental health, benefits and employment, low skilllevels, bereavement and more. Ultimately, we focuson the underlying causes of our client's situation,whether it's abuse, relationship breakdown,isolation or poor self-esteem. Eating together, laughing together, playing stupid games and informal workshops, whetherthey be based on music, art, creative writing or sewing, all have just as much, if not more of an impact than the counselling sessions oremployment workshops we run. Why? because it's not just programmes and services which change people's lives, it's relationship. \"he thing we hear most from clients isn't that they are grateful for support in beating addiction, gaining accommodation or finding employment. \"he thing we hear most is that they are grateful for being given a family. \"he years invested setting up number 11 contained some of the toughest times of my life(managing a building renovation and trying to bringin \u00a3350,000 alongside year four OScEs is somethingI hope never to repeat) - but I'm convinced throughmany of the incredible stories of transformation wehave seen that this is work we absolutely need tobe doing. as christian medics, we are in such a privileged position.

S itting down to write an article on power, I must admit my thoughts drifted to theMarvel franchise and films like them. My favourite superpower? no, not X-ray vision ? I'd like to fly. but seriously, have you attended a lecture on power? Or heard a sermon on the topic? I didn'tthink so. power is 'the ability to make something of the world'. power isn't 'out there' but 'in here';and in the world of medicine we are told we havelots of it. We can prescribe powerful drugs; we caninfluence someone's decision making; we 'control'conversations to break bad news; we hold the keysto restricted investigations. and we learn a lot;indeed, it was a medic, Sir francis bacon, who firstcoined the phrase 'Knowledge is power'. We mightnot be superheroes, but as medics we aresometimes made to feel like it. power as a gift \"his isn't an entirely erroneous view. God delegated power to humanity by commanding us to be fruitful; to multiply, subdue, and have dominion over the earth.1In this sense, we can view power as a gift from God to be exercised wisely in our work and in our leadership. andy crouch in his excellent article It's Time to Talk about Power,2says '[power] is a gift - the gift of a Giver who is the supreme model of power used to bless and serve. Power is not given to benefit those who hold it. It is given for the flourishing of individuals, peoples, and the cosmos itself. Power's right use is especially important for the flourishing of the vulnerable, the members of the human family who most need others to use power well to survive and thrive: the young, the aged, the sick, and the dispossessed. Power is not the opposite of ISSUE 49:2 20John Greenall considers the gift, privilege and responsibility of powerregular features leadership : leadership & powerservanthood. Rather, servanthood, ensuring the flourishing of others, is the very purpose of power. ' In leadership, we will recognise that power means privilege and when we exercise power wellwe build currency. patients trust our decisions.nurses trust our reliability. colleagues trust ourintegrity. building that currency means we aregiven trust and space to work. \"his is a privilegeand a gift to be exercised with care. power distorted and yet the fall of man is a reality; whenunchecked, power can be abused. You will see this as you progress through your training. In mydepartment you will encounter victims of domesticand sexual abuse, which at their heart are abusesof power. You'll encounter patients who you feelare manipulative, and you'll have perhaps alreadyseen 'tugs-of-war' between departments or evenbetween consultants on your placement. power isabused all around us in healthcare, and we have a front row seat to see it play out. but we need to look within as well. as medics we can be proud because of the power we yield, tempted to look down on those with lessknowledge, be it someone in our tutor group or afriend studying another subject. We can also misusepower. Examples of this abound in the world ofhealthcare: researchers falsifying clinical trial datato suit their agenda or to gain financially. andpower can be abused when it is notused to serve others. as James, the half-brother of Jesus writes,' If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it is sin for them .' (James 4:17) doctors are the first to speak out for their ownwelfare, when they could use that power to speakfor others, both their healthcare colleagues andpatients, especially the unborn, the elderly andother vulnerable patient groups. Unfortunately,christians are not immune. \"here is the potential,and often an almost inevitable temptation for thosein christian leadership to abuse and misuse power in cUs, cMf groups, university societies, churches and on the wards. Jesus and power Jesus confronts the issues of power when two of his closest disciples ask him a question in Mark 10:35-38: 'Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"we want you to do for us whatever we ask.\" \"What do you want me to do for you?\" he asked. They replied, \"Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.\" \"You don't know what you are asking,\" Jesus said. \"Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with?\"' \"he disciples want power. and yet they soon realise that Jesus demands something different. Jesus said to them, 'The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority overthem call themselves Benefactors. But you are not tobe like that. Instead, the greatest among you shouldbe like the youngest, and the one who rules like theone who serves.' (luke 22:25-26). He calls them to be servants. \"hroughout his earthly ministry, Jesus displays his power by spending it on others. He trades hisreputation for our shame. He makes himself low tobring us high. rather than be consumed by power,he demonstrates power through serving others. perhaps referring to Jesus washing his disciples' feet 3the apostle paul writes: 'In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality withGod something to be used to his own advantage;rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very 21 ISSUE 49:2John Greenall is cMf national field director and a paediatrician in bedfordshire power is the ability to make something of the worldnature of a servant, being made in human likeness. ' (philippians 2:5-7) so how do I steward power? Whilst we are to seek to imitate christ, we are not christ, and so we are all vulnerable to abusing power. We need to cultivate honest, accountablerelationships with others where we can confess ourpride, our misuse of power and our inaction whenfaced with the powerlessness of others. Second, we need to be ready to share the good news with those who feel powerless. We can sharethat Jesus himself walked in their shoes. He knowswhat it means to be humiliated, shamed, rejectedand abandoned, and he can minister to people'spain. We may have a front row seat to abuses ofpower, but we can interrupt the drama with thegood news of Jesus to a hurting world. \"hird, we need to be ready to be prophetic voices in our land. We are called not to fear power - be itpolitical, professional, cultural or social - more than we fear God. We are called to speak out against the abuse of authority. Making a stand for thepowerless will inevitably challenge individuals or structures who have power. May we chooseboldness and courage over bashfulness andcomfort in those moments, as we live and speak for Jesus in medicine, starting as students as we mean to go on. leadership and power It is a tremendous privilege to be invested withgenuine power, and as a good gift from God,exercising power effectively is the key toleadership. Even though students often feel sopowerless, we need to be aware of the scope ofpower; however subtle our power may be. and weneed to develop the skills to use power well.When we grasp the christian world view that power is a gift, we don't earn it! We will steward it for the good of God's world rather than use it for our own benefit, regardless of its effect on others. Instead of hoarding power and making it work 'for us', we will follow christ's example by humbly spending it on others. \"he christian apologist francis Schaeffer warned christian leaders, ' If we have the world's mentality of wanting the foremost place, we are not qualified for Christian leadership .' \"rue power is multiplied when image-bearers of the all-powerful God empty themselves of the benefits of their power and spread these benefits to others. as medical students you aren't going to gain a superpower, but you will be invested with significant power through your status, knowledge and opportunities. as Uncle ben in Spiderman says, 'with great power, comes great responsibility'.

I ate no choice food; no meat or winetouched my lips and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over ' (daniel 10:2-3). Of course, there is deeper symbolism behind these verses; daniel's choice in chapter one is asubtle protest against his new ruler and may in parthave been explained by observance of Jewish food laws. \"he fast in daniel 10 appears to be a clearerexample of a fast undertaken to hear from God. \"he modern-day 'daniel fast' includes eating fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts, seeds, beansand legumes, whilst giving up meat, dairy products,processed foods, and juices. for the past few years, I have completed a 21-day 'daniel fast' once a year to grow spiritually.

One study showed that bone mineral density scores fell during puberty suppression withGnrHa for trans females, and did not improve withoestrogen treatment. 6 GnrHa treatment was introduced with the aim of reducing the distress of experiencing puberty, to enable the child to explore emotional andpsychological issues surrounding Gender dysphoria.However, virtually all the children who start onpuberty blockers eventually take cross-sexhormones, suggesting that changing their minds is rare once natural puberty is interrupted. puberty is a time not only of bodily changes, but also hormone-mediated structural changes in the brain. neuroimaging studies on hormonetreatments have shown effects on brain structuresuch as ventricular volume and thickness,hypothalamic neuroplasticity, and functional Julie Maxwell is a community paediatrician in Hampshire 27 ISSUE 49:2ISSUE 49:2 28mythbuster: treatment of Gender Dysphoria in children connectivity.7\"he concern, therefore, is that a young person on puberty blockers is left in a developmental limbo and that some young peoplewith Gender dysphoria will be prevented fromfinally becoming comfortable with their biologicalsex by their use. the \"avistock experiment \"he only clinic that prescribes for children in theUK conducted its own trial from 2010. \"heir websitestated that GnrHa treatment 'is deemed reversible'.but the research protocol gained under thefreedom of Information act (2000) suggestedotherwise: 'It is not clear what the long termeffects of early suppression may be on bonedevelopment, height, sex organ development, and body shape and their reversibility if treatment is stopped during pubertal development.' 8 a paediatrician on the study team, russell Viner,frankly acknowledged the risks: 'If you suppresspuberty for three years the bones do not get any stronger at a time when they should be, and wereally don't know what suppressing puberty does to your brain development. We are dealing withunknowns.' 9 at least 1,000 children, including 230 under 14, have been prescribed puberty blockers at \"he \"avistock. Given that this is the only cohort of suchpatients in the UK, after ten years it seems amissed opportunity that there has not been fulldisclosure of the data in peer-reviewed journals.from the limited data released, the single paper to date from this cohort has not been encouragingdespite a misleading abstract. 10'\"here was no statistically significant difference in psychosocialfunctioning between the group given blockers andthe group given only psychological support. Inaddition, there is unpublished evidence that after ayear on GnrHa, children reported greater self-harm,and that girls experienced more behavioural andemotional problems and expressed greaterdissatisfaction with their body - so pubertyblockers exacerbated Gender dysphoria.' 11cross-sex or Gender affirming Hormones (GaH) now more commonly referred to as gender- affirming hormones, oestrogens and testosterone will induce masculine or feminine physicalcharacteristics. \"hey often need to be supplemented by other drugs and there are potential health risks of treatment with these hormones. On the nHS, this treatment can be given to those over 16 years old when criteria are met, and it is deemed that they are capable of giving informed consent 12to this irreversible, life- changing treatment. It has been reported that some children have been able to access cross-sex hormones at a much younger age privately or via the internet. prof Heneghan, in his review of the evidence states: '\"reatments for under 18 gender dysphoric children and adolescents remain largelyexperimental. \"here are a large number ofunanswered questions that include the age at start, reversibility; adverse events, long term effects on mental health, quality of life, bone mineral density, osteoporosis in later life and cognition. We are also ignorant of the long-term safety profiles of the different GaH regimens. \"he current evidence basedoes not support informed decision-making and safe practice.' 13 Giving cross-sex hormones will of course only influence secondary sex characteristics (those thatappear during puberty) and will not alter primary sex characteristics (those present at birth). gender reassignment surgery \"his is available on the nHS for those over 18 only and involves varying degrees of surgery. While surgery may make a person appear cosmetically to be the opposite sex, their genetic make-up and other genetically determined physical and mental characteristics does not change. It is simply not possible to change sex, only to look like the opposite sex.29 ISSUE 49:2mythbuster: treatment of Gender Dysphoria in children 1. butler G et al. assessment and support of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria.

Young people suffering from thesedifficulties need compassion and help. but at present,these children are being experimented on withoutenough evidence of the long-term physical, emotionaland psychological implications of medical treatments.Healthcare professionals are frequently urged topractise evidence-based medicine and to weigh therisks against the benefit of treatments; currentevidence suggests this is not happening in thetreatment of children with gender identity issues. summary risks of puberty suppression and transitioning treatments in adolescents: Medical treatments compound 'developmental limbo' GnrHa impairs bone development and fertility,perhaps irreversibly, before adulthood cross-sex hormones further interfere with brain maturation and cognitive development cross-sex hormones can cause thromboembolism, polycythaemia and raiseblood pressure Surgery cannot be reversed to the natural state : God will always be with you be preparedbe prepared I imagine that many of you will be pondering the time when you leave medical school andstart your foundation years. rather like sailors on a ship leaving the sheltered waters of a harbour embarking on their first voyage across a sea, many of you may be feeling a little nervousabout the next step. However, we need not fear if we remember that the lord will always be with us wherever we go. 1 \"hroughout my foundation years, I found it a huge encouragement to remember the lord'spromises to the Israelites in the Old \"estament.although we are now under a new covenant, I thinkthere are helpful things to learn. \"he Israelitesfaced ever changing environments, threat of enemyattack and lack of normal comforts. 2Often their reaction was to fear, and to question why their position was difficult.3\"hey had to be reminded that the lord would fight their battles4and lead them by day and by night.5What applied to the Israelites is also valid for us today when we face fears, uncertainties and feelings of abandonment by others. We need to take courage and trust that the lord will never leave or forsake us.6 what does it mean that the lord is with us in our work? I remember lying in bed trying to get some rest before my first night shift, whilst I was on a paediatric rotation. My heart was beating rapidlyregular features Leo Hacking reassures us of God's presence during the foundation years ISSUE 49:2 30 with doubts and fears about what I could encounter and whether I could cope with the challengesahead, passed through my mind. doubts like 'will God still be with me?' unhelpfully took hold. I messaged a friend who said they would pray forme and set off to work. after all my fears, I foundthe night to not only be manageable but enjoyable.I could see God's provision in helpful andsupportive colleagues he placed around me, and inthe prayers of other believers. I was thankful forthe peace that he gave me in knowing that I am inchrist. 7 during my first year, I underwent an elective operation. I remember being collected from thepre-op bay and taken to theatres by an anaestheticassistant called naomi. as I walked into theanaesthetic room, I remember looking around at acold, sparse and empty place with white walls, ahard, stone floor and bright white lights (probably an ideal room from an infection control point ofview!). It suddenly dawned on me that I would soonbe in that bed in front of me, in a much weaker,more vulnerable state as a patient. faced with thatthought and coupled with the uncertainties about the operation, I started to feel more anxious. partof me wanted to run away. \"hankfully, I tookcourage remembering that Jesus promised theSpirit to us and that we shouldn't let our hearts be troubled. 8as the anaesthetist was inserting the cannula I spoke briefly to naomi about her nameand it dawned on me that she could be a fellowbeliever. \"hen I was injected with a drug that madethe room spin, which was very unpleasant. \"he onlything I could do was to close my eyes and wait forthe anaesthetic to knock me out. around that time,I felt a hand on the back of mine which wasprobably naomi's, but it was a great comfort as it reminded me of God's presence. during my first rotation in f1, after a very busy day, we had a very poorly patient in his forties withadvanced liver failure and chest sepsis. Earlier on,the consultant had decided that this patient wasn't a candidate for higher level care (such as HdU or I\"U). practically, I understood this to mean that he was not for critical care reviews, if he got more unwell. after 5pm, I was the only doctor left on the ward. I was asked to review the patient as he was deteriorating. I found him to be in significant respiratory distress and understandably very agitated, despite maximal oxygen. I knew I needed help as I was out of my depth. \"he SHO said he was too busy to come to help, and the on-call registrar didn't answer his bleep. I felt abandoned. but just at that moment, my gastro registrar (who had been running late from a clinic) arrived to see how I was getting on. I remember thanking God for his grace in granting me that caring registrar at that time, who helped me come up with a management plan. as with sailors heading out to sea, you know that in foundation years you will get some days that are rougher and other days with calmer seas.

I do a combination of assessments in setups like a Gp surgery, and home-based assessments forpeople who are too unwell to travel. I spend about45 minutes with each client. as in some areas ofpsychiatry, the word patient is usually avoided.Much of what I do is like a medical clerking, with a full medical history, and relevant examination.but unlike a hospital clerking, I will enquire abouttheir 'typical day', which forms a narrative of howconditions affect function, what things theyparticularly struggle with, and what kind of adaptations or assistance is needed. Once the client has left, I spend about 30 minutes writing up a report, which is then sent to the department for Work and pensions (dWp). \"he point is never to dictate specifically that someone is fit to work or not, however there are 17 areas of physical and mental health functions that must be addressed. Much of this can be nuanced, with function varying day-to-day, and so a requirement that each activity can be completed 'repeatedly, reliably and safely' is considered. also considered are those who may be functioning well overall, but for whatever reason may be placed at significant risk if expected to work. \"his could include those on the vulnerable adults register, or in a particularly fragile physical or mental health state. So that's the nuts and bolts of the job, but more commonly people want to know why? Why isn't my Gp deciding this? Why are we bothering to do this in the first place? first, why don't Gps complete the assessment?be inspired a day in the life James Howitt describes a typical working day as a Work capability assessor ISSUE 49:2 32: assessing the sick James Howitt is a doctor who performs Work capability assessments and a cMf associate Staff Worker in Essex Well the Wca was brought in because pre-2008, very few people were required to attend any formof assessment and it was mostly Gp medicalcertificates that were used. However, many of the'disabling conditions' that were presented wereeither minor (such as sinusitis) or generallyasymptomatic (such as high blood pressure), andwere unlikely to cause significant disablement overa period of months or years, but such patients werestill entitled to incapacity benefit (rememberingthose who are off sick with short term conditionsare entitled to statutory sick pay). \"his isn't a knock against Gps, but let's remember their appointments are ten minutes. In all but the most severely disabled, it's unrealisticto expect an assessment in this time frame, andGps rarely get significant information about levelsof function over an extended period. part of theevidence for this is that whilst in many cases a Gpopinion is sought by a letter sent to them beforethe assessment, many are not returned, or simplecome back as 'unknown'. Sadly, for most of us, thedays of family doctors that know us intimately from birth to death are gone. \"he other issue with Gps is that it is a struggle to remain impartial. Whilst the generational Gp may be a dying breed, it is still important to good care thatthey have some form of rapport with, and trustfrom patients. \"his is at odds with a system whichis meant to be impartial. I suspect that some of the'not-known' replies I receive are from Gps who wishto avoid being untruthful, but may also be awarethat their information may not be supportive oftheir patient being awarded ESa. Second, why do it at all? It is widely recognised that work is generally good for people, 3that it meets psychosocial needs and is central toeconomic means, identity and social roles andstatus. Unemployment conversely is associatedwith poor health and higher mortality, and thatthose who move off benefits into work and re-employment gain the health improvements shared by those in work. However, it is also well recognised that for a minority, work is in fact detrimental and systems to identify those people need to be robust and easily accessible. \"his fits with a biblical understanding of work being dignified and given by God, who we see rests following his work of creation in Genesis 1. adam and Eve are given the work of subduing Eden in Genesis 2, and Jesus in John 5 says, ' my Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too amworking '(John 5:17). but we also live in a fallen world and since adam and Eve were cast out fromEden, sickness and death have entered the world. We also live in a society where resources are finite,and decisions about how to manage those resources in a fair and effective way must be made. Some have made complaints that the Wca is a tick box exercise, and that's partly true. but so is getting a mortgage or credit card, antenatal care, or buying groceries, all of which are important parts of livingtogether in society. Without a search for truth, justice for the vulnerable cannot be had, 4either from a system that is too punitive or simply turns a blind eye to exploitation. \"o my mind, this makes this a vitalarea for christian doctors and nurses to be present.Often with a multitude of conditions, disabling effectscan be much more subtle than a missing limb.Without the correct skills and dedication, those unfitfor work can often be unfairly treated ordisenfranchised. In a world where growing greed canbe found in all places, there is a biblical imperativeboth to speak up for the vulnerable 5and resist the wolves among the sheep. 33 ISSUE 49:2 1. dWp benefits statistical summary data to february 2018 (quarterly).

We're careful todistinguish meetings from other bible studieslocally, and hold most meetings in student houses,to enable a more informal and relaxed gathering. (Who wants to be at the medical school past 5pm?) 2018-19 began with a 'give it a go' event, with around 20 students at the cMf Student president's house, socialising (with biscuits, popcorn andsweets) and reflecting on 'Is University lifecompatible with christianity?' We discussed areaswhere stereotypical 'university life' might conflictwith christian principles, and how to tackle theseissues in a godly way.

It is great to meet some of these doctors on the wards whilst on clinical placement and to see a friendly face! a highlight for me was a talk from Mark pickering, '\"aking your next step of faith'. It was around the time when I was choosing whichdeanery to apply to for foundation training, and helped remind me that God has a plan for my life and to trust him with the unknown. noel and laura have also hosted OScE practice sessions and offered emotional and academic support. It is a real privilege to have doctors willing to invite you into their home during periods of exam stress, and for them to listen and help. during my years here, it has been amazing to have a stable sense of support from people that don't merely understand what you're going through on a spiritual level, but also understand the stress of placements and the demands of medical school.

I met many devoted christians and I saw a lot of passion for medicine and for being a light in the medical community. I was amazed by the leadership team at cMf, learning that thegreatest investment is in others, serving them, and following the example of the lord Jesus christ.I took home all these examples, and I try to applythem every day in my ministry. romania is a spectacular country, with beautiful and welcoming people. between 1946 and 1989romania was under a communist regime, whichrepresented a dark era for our nation, especially for christians. after 1989, romania became ademocratic republic, and since 2007 is a member of the European Union. although we have had hardtimes, romanian christians can say loud and clear:'God is my shepherd.' and because of that, christiandoctors united their forces and developed christianMedical fellowship in romania in 1990, the first non-governmental association in romania. \"oday,cMf in romania has more than 200 members across the country.

Insurance is not expensive and that's a good thing, but it can be low in quality in some parts of the country. people are not informed about health prevention, and lots of medication for chronic diseases is not available. We do have very well-trained doctors that fight for changes, and we can see the results of theirwork in some of the biggest hospitals. as achristian organisation, we try to educate futuredoctors to be good practitioners, but more thanthat to take care of their patients' souls and minds. romania is a blessed country and medical students who are part of romania's cMf are verythankful for the privilege of being born here.

I was especially inspired by the talk 'What it means to be light', where the speaker drewparallels between the characteristics of light andthe character of a christian. \"here was also worshipin arabic. It was wonderful to hear worship songssung in a different language and from a different culture; it reminded me that throughout the world we worship in thousands of languages but are united in one faith by one Saviour. We also heard from representatives from different countries in the ME\"na region, who gave us ways to pray for their ministry and their countries. It was humbling to meet brothers and sisters who live sacrificial lives to reach people in a region of the world, which is desperately in need of the gospel. Security means that I cannot write about individual ministries, but clearly God isworking across the Middle East in incredible ways! In the afternoon we had our second meeting withworship and the second of the main talks. We then split into small groups to discuss everything we had heard that day - it was a valuable time of listening and learning from one another, especially given the mix of cultures, ages and experiences! It's hard succinctly to summarise everything that I enjoyed about this conference. \"he main talks were fantastic - challenging us to be bold in our witness for christ and encouraging us with the reminder that God has given us the resources we need to do this. during my time away, I was challenged to 'be light' and to be distinctive in an increasingly secular society. Sometimes in the UK, I feel that the choice between following Jesus or the world can be extremely subtle. I personally recognised the need to discern better when I am being asked to make that choice. \"he time away was one of great blessing, especially meeting (self-professed) ordinary, but godly men and women, who in God's strength live extraordinary lives for his glory. \"he impact of their faith is being seen throughout the Middle East.

We meet barnum, a warm hearted, inclusive individualwho seems to want to bringpurpose and employment tothe lives of the misfits of histime. following the failure ofbarnum's 'museum ofcuriosities', the story begins aswe meet some of the eclecticindividuals who make up thebarnum circus: a beardedwoman, a hair covered man, adwarf, and an eight-foot 'giant'. Song after song spells out the desires of the hearts of those in the troupe. Whether it's thedefiant stance of the bearded woman, happy in her own skin in the song ' This Is Me ', or the struggle against racism in ' Rewrite the Stars ', they are expressions of the fundamental desire to beaccepted and loved. Each musical number isspectacular. \"he costumes are as vibrant and thechoreography as jaw-dropping as the real barnumhimself would have wanted. although the storylinemay be wanting and the character developmentshallow, the theatrical effects are amazing. However, although barnum wants to be a success in his family and business, he loses hisway. \"he success of one act leads barnum far fromthe things he loves most: his household andshowmanship. \"he common denominator of the plot and all the sub-stories is the search for acceptance, welcome and love. barnum brings together people who have been rejected and givesthem something to belong to, ashe himself is accepted by those he's wronged. as the perceptive bearded woman puts it, 'Maybeyou are a fraud. Maybe it wasjust about making a buck. but you gave us a real family.' barnum's circus celebrated diversity, yet it's hard to know what was fake and what wasauthentic. Was barnum analtruistic philanthropist or a shrewd businessman exploiting the people in his show? In 2019, the longing for acceptance hasn't died. \"he way the movie has been celebrated so much shows that people still crave to be welcomed and loved. \"his fundamental striving for belonging is the fallout from the catastrophic fragmentation of our relationship with God at the fall. When we see howchrist welcomes us into God's family, we see howdiffering people can be loved and outsiders can bebrought in forever. It's an astoundingly beautifultruth of the gospel: everyone is welcomed into anunconditional, indiscriminate family for eternity,and the one who welcomes us rejoices over us withsinging. 1What a truth the world wants and needs to know!

Wefollow daniel as he, and youngmother of two, Katie, struggleto negotiate the seeminglycomplex and robotic welfaresystem. \"his is clearly a film with an agenda, so I should be upfrontabout mine straight from the off. as an actualdoctor performing the medical assessments for thebenefit which daniel is refused, there were someparts of the film that left me furious, and othersthat left me heartbroken. I'll address the latter below before dealing with the former. \"his film spotlights rising poverty in the UK, with real world food bank usage rising 13% in 2018 1and some 14 million people said to be living in poverty.2 I applaud how the film challenges the damaging stereotypes of those claiming benefits as lazy,work-shy or 'scroungers'. \"his narrative is pushedby political groups and unfairly shames some of the most vulnerable in society. both the maincharacters are like many, victims of poorcircumstance and timing, and not at fault for their situation. at every turn, daniel is confronted by the bureaucracy of the system he is in, struggling bothagainst his computer illiteracy in a digital age, and the mountain of red tape installed to try todiscourage the dishonest, while protecting thedeserving. I agree with director Ken loach, in his uncompromising portrayal of UK poverty, andabout the flawed system we currently have. He does however, border ondemonising those working in the system, and whilst I'm deeply saddened if this is experienced by even aminority, it is certainly not the norm. \"he way daniel's medical is conducted is frankly appalling and utterly unacceptable.However, I have never seen or experienced anything even close to this. \"he whole thing is a 'how-not-to' example, and while we only see a snapshot of his assessment, it is very clearly aiming to look incompetent. from a job centre employee being disciplined for showing basic human kindness, to the ever-looming government 'decision-maker' used like a damocleansword by staff, it would all be laughable, if it wasn't so insulting to those who try and guide some of the vulnerable through hardship and difficult times. I, Daniel Blake is a film that dramatises events to create the saddest possible narrative with which to make its point. but it is also a stark reminder of the rising gap between rich and poor, and that socialjustice requires more than just paying our taxes.It's a reminder that we need to look at our greed as a society to ask why we feel more comfortable having 'subcontracted' such charity to the state. It's a reminder that we need to love our neighbour,and that as christians our neighbour may not always live next door.

When abortion was illegal,there were christians who spoke against the injustice of making it a criminal offence. but how since its legalisation, those who oppose it arelargely doing so on moral and religious grounds -thinking of the fetus and its right to life rather thanthe woman and her right to 'choice'. consequently,porter believes the debate has become polarised,with people on opposite sides of the abortiondebate 'talking past each other'. Her solution is to correct the 'false assumption' that only pro-lifers are thinking ethically. However,as she her argument that being pro-choiceis equally 'moral', the irreconcilable differences inworld view and underpinning attitudes towardabortion becomes apparent. \"he debate is pushedno further forward. 1.

However, the researchsuggests that some of these conditions, eg. anxietyand substance use disorders were pre-existing (ie.not a result of their experience of abortion) andthat 1.5 - 5.5% of the 30% were directlyattributable to their experience of abortion. It is worth noting that 'none of the other pregnancy outcomes (pregnancy loss, live birthfollowing unwanted pregnancy or a pregnancyhaving an initial adverse reaction, and other live birth) was consistently related to significantlyincreased risks of mental health problems.' not all research agrees with fergusson's conclusion, 2but this ambiguity surely means that the royal college of Obstetricians andGynaecologists (rcOG) and the faculty of Sexualand reproductive Healthcare (fSrH) are notjustified in confidently declaring in a factsheet for schools 3that 'abortion does not cause mental illness.' 1. fergusson d et al. abortion and Mental Health disorders: evidence from a 30 year longitudinal study.

Instead of giving members a clear choice between two options (to legalise or not to legalise), the rcp required a 60% majority for the two main options and introduced a third - that of neutrality around the issue, thus making it much more difficult to get a clear majority for any one of these options.1 In the event, 43.4% voted to maintain opposition - with 25% voting to go neutral. as a result, the rcp has decided that as of 21 March 2019, it will no longer oppose the legalisation of assisted suicide. four doctors, two of whom are cMf members, are taking the rcp to court over this decision, and would welcome your support (visit www.gofundme.com/rcp-poll-challenge for details). 1. no majority view on assisted dying moves rcp position to neutral.

Shemay have been all thesethings, but I suspect shewould not want to beremembered for them.She overcame enormouschallenges, but she would not want us tothink that they wereovercome in her own strength. Helen roseveare'sidentity was firmly rooted in christ; her longing wasto know more of him and to point others to him.She was unashamedly honest about the strugglesshe faced throughout her life. \"hrough thesestruggles, God was able to use her (albeitunwillingly at times) in amazing ways. as we look ather life, we can learn much from her experiences. background Helen roseveare was born in 1925 in Hertfordshire,England. She was the second of five children, anddescribed herself as 'endlessly active, restless withanimal spirits, always in mischief, with an urge toexcel, to be noticed' 1- traits that would remainwith her for life and which would underlie many of her personaltrials as well as successes. She firstresolved to become a missionary at the tender age of eight, whilst hearing about mission work in India 2- 'When I grow up, I will go to tell other boys and girls about the Lord Jesus .' but it was during her teenage years atboarding school in Wales that Helen consciouslybegan searching for God.Yet she later writes that her beliefs at this time were merely superficial: 'I've no idea what I thought of God, or who I thought He was; but there was Somebody, God, who was bigger than everything around me, and I needed Him .'3at that time, she believed: ' I could reach Him only if I were absolutely honest .'4 I imagine many of us can relate to that instinct that we can somehow reach God by our own efforts. Helen was keenly aware that everything in theworld, including life itself, seemed useless and meaningless; there had to be something more. \"his led to further efforts on her own part to reach out after the 'Unseen' - she dabbled in anglo- catholicism and regularly attended confessions and Mass. 5Yet there was still a great sense of emptiness and futility.

Helen went to study medicine at newnhamcollege, cambridge, in 1944.She experienced the samefears of leaving home, thesame loneliness in startinguniversity, and the samefeelings of ignorance in herstudies that many students at medical/nursing school cansurely relate to! during herfirst term, she was struck bythe friendliness and welcomeof a group of christianstudents in her college, andparticularly by their love ofScripture. She writes of these students, ' Their lives and faces radiated a happiness and peace that wasvery nearly infectious, and quite obviouslysatisfying .'6Elsewhere, she writes: ' They had a peace about them that I found very intriguing. '7She began to accompany them to the cambridge Inter- collegiate christian Union. a providential outbreakof mumps at home left her unable to return for thechristmas holidays, and this led her to attend ahouse party for training christian leaders. Here itwas that ' God poured out His grace in forgiveness, in cleansing from all the uncleanness of sin, and inrevealing, at this time, the amazing wonder of thefriendship of Christ .'8 With a renewed determination to become a missionary, Helen joined the WorldwideEvangelisation crusade (WEc) and spent severalyears living at the mission's headquarters. On oneoccasion she overheard herself being described as' proud, always knowing better than others, unable to be told things or warned or criticised, difficult to livewith .'9However, eventually, she was accepted as a member of the mission and following extensivepreparations including a four-month crash course infrench, and another fourmonths studying tropical medicine, she departed forthe belgian congo in 1953. at first, Helen was based at Ibambi where she workedhard to set up a hospital and training centre. She waspassionate to train national workers as 'nurse-evangelists', 10who could use their medical skills as a springboard for taking the gospel to the congolese. In 1955, four of her students passed the state examinations to qualify as assistant nurses. While rejoicing in their success,Helen was informed that the medical programme, and therefore herself, would be moved seven milesnorth, to nebobongo, a disused leprosy colony. Here, she had to begin work from scratch. Initially she resented this change and was filled with anger. Seeing her rage, a fellow-missionary prayed for her,and Helen began to see that it was the lord himselfwho was sending her to nebobongo. 11She fully trusted that God would use this move to make hermore like Jesus, and she submitted willingly to hispurposes. Helen's life as a missionary in nebobongo was filled with daily difficulties - the work thereinvolved building a new hospital, constructing avillage for the workers, teaching orphans based at the station, administrative tasks, medicalresponsibilities and leading bible studies. She facedproblems of understaffing and overworking to theextreme. along with local congolese staff, sheestablished a 100-bed hospital and training centreand set up 48 local clinics. 12Yet this was not the end of her story. Helen roseveare 45 ISSUE 49:2privilege of suffering \"he belgian congo achieved independence in 1960, and a time of great politicalunrest followed. \"heconstant threats,particularly for Westerners,led many of Helen'scolleagues to leave thecountry, but she remainedfaithful to her call andsteadfast to her africanbrothers and sisters. In1964, the Simba rebellionbroke out and Helenendured five months of captivity and savagemistreatment at the handsof the rebels. She was takencaptive, humiliated, beaten and raped on twooccasions. When speaking about this ordeal later, she stated that during the wild panic, horror andunknown fear ' ...suddenly, there was God. I didn't see a vision, I didn't hear a voice, I just knew with every ounce of my being that God was actually, vitallythere... He surrounded me with his love and he seemed to whisper to me, \"Twenty years ago, you asked me for the privilege of being a missionary. Thisis it. Don't you want it?\"... it was as though he clearlysaid to me, \"These are not your sufferings. They'renot beating you. These are my sufferings. All I ask of you is the loan of your body.\" And an enormousrelief swept through me. \"13 after suffering much, Helen became aware again of God's ' wonderful, unchanging love, the full peace of his forgiveness '.14\"his experience shaped her subsequent ministry, as she boldly testified that God's grace is all-sufficient. She was overwhelmed at the privilege ofbeing trusted by God to endure suffering. She knewthat whatever happened was part of God's plan, even if she couldn't see how or why. dependence on grace One of the wonderful themes of Helen's life is herdependence on God's grace: 'My grace is sufficient for you' (2 corinthians 12:9). Yet this is not something which came naturally to her and she is very honest in speaking of her reluctance to fully accept God's grace. during her first furlough in1958, she resigned frombeing a missionary. \"his was partly borne out of frustration that she was a single woman without a husband to help with the work. following this decision to resign, she found ' I had no peace. I knew I had acted rashly and without seeking any guidance from God. ' 15Yet at a christian convention, she wrote: ' God graciously renewed my call to serve him '.16She knew she would need God's grace every day to persevere in the work he hadcalled her to - the grace of God made possible through Jesus's death on the cross. battle against pride linked to this lesson in dependence on God's grace was a battle against pride. In a 1975 sermon entitled '\"he cost of declaring His Glory', Helen said ' The first major cost was to my pride .'17She writes of her early years in the congo, ' I was so often critical and proud in my outlook. Along with this my communion with the Lord shrivelled... I longed for liberation and peace and joy .'18 Helen worked extremely hard to overcome many challenges whilst in the congo, putting in long hours and carrying out a variety of tasks, often with little recognition. She strove for high standards in all aspects of her work. She resolved never to turn anyone away - to ' receive every visitor, whatever the hour, in His name and for His sake, showing His love .'19She was dependent on prayer and walked closely with the lord, prioritisingxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx HEROES + HERETICS My lord Katie. bit.ly/2LH579i ISSUE 49:2 46time with him. Yet despite testifying to the all- sufficiency of God's grace, Helen sensed God saying to her 'you want \"Jesus plus \". Plus a sense of success... '20It was a personal spiritual battle: 'My heart ached. A battle was raging inside me... Yes, I did need others to think of me as a success.Yet, at the same time, my heart knew that Jesus was all I actually wanted or needed .'21 What was the solution to this raging war? 'At last, broken-hearted, I confessed to God my pride, and told him 'Yes, I only want Jesus - not \"Jesusplus. \"' In confessing her pride, and fixing her gaze on Jesus as the one who can meet all our needs,Helen experienced God's peace restored in herheart. longing to know christ better On the night Helen became a christian, a bibleteacher named Graham Scroggie wrote in her bible,philippians 3:10: ' I want to know Christ - yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death. '22\"his became an immense desire for Helen - to knowJesus more deeply, even in the depths of suffering,and therefore grow to be more like him. Herwholehearted and earnest longing to please God,compelled by his love, shone through her life. during an interview for the london Women's convention in 2010, she was asked for any advice to share with the next generation of women. Herresponse is filled with passion and wisdom: ' Have you fallen in love with Jesus? I know you know hedied to save you; I know you know you ought to lovehim. But do you love the Lord Jesus? Not just asSaviour and Friend, but as Lord and Master. Is he allin all to you?... Are you allowing God to be totally incontrol of everything, because of your love for him? '23 conclusion Helen returned from the congo in 1973 due to hermother's declining health. during her later years,she travelled around the world to speak of herexperiences and wrote several books. She went tobe with the lord in december 2016.
