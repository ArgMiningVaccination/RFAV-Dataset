In reality, every farm ought to aspire to th is state of being a self- contained individuality.\" Rudolf Steiner Biodynamic Principles A foundation of the Biodynamic method of farmin g is a Goethean observat ion of nature and its application to a farming system. This encourages a view of nature as an interconnected whole, a totality, an organism endowed with archetypal rhythm. Biodynamic farming involves managi ng a farm utilizing the principles of a living organism. A concise model of a living organism ideal would be a wilder ness forest, where there is a high degree of self- sufficiency in all realms of biologic al survival. Fertility and feed arise out of the recycling of the organic material the system generates. Avoidance of pest sp ecies is based on biologic al vigor and its intrinsic biological and genetic diversity. Water is efficiently cycled through the system. While agriculture takes nature to a state that is one step removed fr om wilderness, the wisdom of the farmer that guides its course can re flect these ancient princi ples of sustainability. The view of the farm organism extends beyond th e fence line and includes the tangible and intangible forces that work through it. Examples include the climate, inherent wildlife of the earth (above and below the ground), the light and warmth from the sun and the more distan t astronomical influences. Biodynamic agriculture attempts to harmonize all these factor s within a holistic, living farm syst em. The food that results is very pure and true to its essence and provid es deeply penetrating nutrition that is essential to an increasingly unhealthy human population. History This special body of knowledge is derived from Dr. R udolf Steiner's \"Agricultura l Course\", held in 1924, when a group of European farmers approached Stei ner (noted scientist, philosopher, and founder of 5the Waldorf School) after noticing a rapid decline in seed fertility, crop vitality and animal health. In response, Steiner held a series of lectures that pr esented the farm as a living organism: self-contained and self-sustaining, responsible for creating and maintaining its indivi dual health and vitality. This was in sharp contrast to the view of the farm as fa ctory, boosting production by importing chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, that was largely responsible for the observations of depleted vitality noted by the farmers who sought Steiner's guidance . Steiner was one of the first public figures to question the long-term benefits of this manufactu ring view of agriculture and to warn of its environmentally destructive practices. In 1928, following Steiner's lectures, Demeter was form ed in Europe to codify his farming principles in the Demeter Biodynamic Farm Standard , and commenced ensuring that it was uniformly applied and monitored through a strict certification process. The Biodynamic Farm Standard is historically significant because it dates to before the beginnin g of the modern sustainable agriculture movement and captures key agronomic principles not compre hensively addressed within any other agriculture certification system. Biodynamic Practices In day-to-day practice, the goal is to create a farm system that is minimally dependent on imported materials, and instead meets its needs from the living dyna mics of the farm itself. It is the biodiversity of the farm, organized so that the waste of one part of the farm becomes the en ergy for another, that results in an increase in the farm's capacity for self -renewal and ultimately makes the farm sustainable. This requires that, as much as possible, a farm be regenera tive rather than degenerative . Carefully consider materials that are import ed onto the modern-day organic fa rm. Where do they come from? Often, they can be tracked back to a natural resource provided by the earth. Examples include petroleum to move materials around, ancient mineral deposits , by-products of unsustainable agriculture-related industry, and the life of the seas and waterways. An important social value of Bi odynamic farming is that it does not depend on the mining of the earth's natural resource base but instead emphasizes contributing to it. Sections of the Biodynamic Farm Standard include necessary elements of the farm organism, soil fertility management, crop protection, greenhouse ma nagement, animal welfare, and the use of the Biodynamic preparations. Biological diversity with in the farm landscape is emphasized and requires that a minimum of ten percent of the total farm ac reage be devoted to biodiv ersity preservation and enhancement. That may include but is not limited to forests, wetlands, riparian corridors, and intentionally planted insectaries. Diversity in crop rotation and perennial pl anting is required: no annual crop can be planted in the same field for more than two years in succession. Bare tillage year- round is prohibited so land needs to maintain adequate green cover. The Biodynamic Farm Standard instructs that the foundation of the fertility system, and strategies for disease, insect, and weed control, must originate fr om the farm itself. Fertility is generated via the integration of livestock, compost and green manure, nutrient catch crops, and careful crop rotation. Disease and insect control are addressed through botanical species diversity, predator habitat, balanced crop nutrition, and attention to light pe netration and airflow. Weed control emphasizes prevention, including timing of planting, mulching, a nd identifying and avoiding the spread of invasive weed species. 6 The use of the Biodynamic prepar ations is a requirement of the Biodynamic Farm Standard . There are nine in all, made from herbs, mineral substances, a nd animal manures that are utilized in field sprays and compost inoculants applied in minute dose s, much like homeopathic remedies are for humans. Timely applications revi talize the soil and stimulate root growth, enhance the development of microorganisms and humus formation, and aid in photosynthetic activity. Animals are a crucial element of a Biodynamic farm, and in addition to their obvious contribution to a farm's fertility, their care and welfare are given ex tensive consideration. Housing must allow animals to move freely and protect them from heat, dust, excess humidit y, and harmful gasses such as ammonia. Poultry cages are prohibited, every animal must be given a dry, soft, and insulated spot where it can lie down and rest, and access to free range forage and the outdoors is required. De- horning, de-beaking, and wing clipping of poultry are prohibited, as is tail cutting of piglets and docking of lambs. Homeopathic remedies in place of va ccines are strongly recommended, and the use of antibiotics is prohibited. If an animal is being raised for the sale of meat, eggs or milk, at least half of their feed must come from the farm (60% mi nimum for ruminants, Equidae and Camelidae). A minimum of 70% of the total ration for ruminant s and 50% for pigs and poultry must be Demeter certified and the remainder must be NOP certified organic at minimum. Relationship to National Organi c Program (NOP) Requirements Biodynamic farming is free of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in the same manner as certified organic farming. To qualify for Demeter Biod ynamic certification, a farm must first meet the requirements of NOP organic as a base, but some inputs permitted by the NOP are not permitted or use is further restricted by Demeter. Demeter also requires a ca reful examination and even tual reduction of the volume of imported materials necessar y to sustain the lif e of the farm. Environmental Message Agricultural land occupies 50% of the earth's habitable surface, about 41% of U.S. land. In the U.S., food production contributes 34% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns of climate change cannot be successfully addressed without addressing agriculture' s contribution to it but, conversely, agriculture can be a potent solution. Because the underlying theme of the Biodynamic Farm Standard is to generate inputs out of the life of the farm system itself rather than importing them from outside, the heart of a Bi odynamic farm's fertility system is the sequestering and recycling of carbon. Crop rotation and integrat ion of animal agriculture also assist in reducing petrochemica l inputs compared to conventional agricultural practices. These factors, in addition to Biodyn amic farming's focus on improvin g soil health, water quality and biodiversity, combine to make it one the highest paradigms of sustai nable, regenerative agriculture. Demeter's vision is to heal the planet through agriculture. Principle of Social Responsibility Social responsibility, which includes respect for and observance of human rights, is one of the basic principles of the Demeter standards. The labor laws in the United States are valid for all people and govern all human resource relation s also in Demeter certified ente rprises. People working on a Demeter operation receive equal op portunities independent of thei r ethnic background, creed, and gender. 7 Management of Demeter certified en terprises have policies in place to address the health and security of the workers. All co-workers have the possibility to avail themselves of their rights. They have the right to congregate, to participate in collective barg aining and to make repres entation to management without discrimination. Demeter enterprises have to e liminate social inequity including lack of social rights, forced or inappropriate child labor, below standard working conditions and/or wages, and to provide occupational safety, and healthy working environments. The enterprise has to inform the workers about their rights. As part of the annual inspection and certification pr ocess all licensees shall make a self- declaration in their Biodynamic System Plan or separately confirming that these guidelines have been met. Demeter Today Biodynamic Federation - Demeter International is the only internationally recognized Biodynamic certifier and consists of a network of individual certification organizations in 45 countries around the world. Demeter Association, Inc. is the Biodynamic certification or ganization in the United States. Demeter was established in 1985 and its mission is to enable people to farm successfully, in accordance with Biodynamic practices and princi ples. Demeter is the owner of the trademarks (certification marks) \"Biodynamic\u00ae\" and \"Demeter\u00ae\", and the related logos using these marks, and is therefore solely responsible for ensuring that farms and products referred to as \"Biodynamic\" meet the Demeter Biodynamic Farm and Processing Standards. No agriculturally based pr oduct or farm may be legally referred to as Biodynamic without having achieved Demeter certification. Fo r more information about the Demeter certification process, please refer to Section VI: \"Administration\". I. AGRONOMIC GUIDELINES Common Good Farm Raymond, NE A. Necessary Elements of the Farm Organism 1. Biological diversity A Demeter certified farm must ha ve a minimum of 10% of its tota l effective land base- clearly documented in a calculated acreage figure- set aside as a biodiversity reserve. This preserves wildlife diversity, endangered species habita t, and provides an over all reserve of diverse life forms to inoculate and inhabit the farm organism. Environmentally beneficial grazing [in compliance with Section I.E.5] and low impa ct wild harvest can take place, but each situation wi ll be handled on a case-by-case basis. In situations where th ere is no potential biodiversity reserve occurring naturally, areas will need to be created. All botanical species established (natural or planted) at a minimum need to be allowed to develop through the flowering stage to be counted towards the 10%. Examples include insectary plantings, hedgerows, flowering cover crops, perennial pl antings along fence lines and roadways, and wildlife corridors. For climates with a winter dormant period the 10% biod iversity reserve requiremen t applies thro ughout the entirety of the growing season (S pring through Autumn). For climates with growth year-round the 10% biodiversity reserve needs to be in place year-round. The clearance of virgin forest for agricultural usag e is forbidden. Other conservation areas of high ecological value must also be protected. 9 Tillable acreage cannot be planted only to a monocu lture. Botanical specie s diversity needs to be maintained via the crop rota tion strategies utilized. In annual crop rotations, a given harvested commodity cannot be planted in the same field for more than 2 years in succession. Close attentio n needs to be paid to the nutrie nt export associated with each harvested commodity. The crop should not return to a given field until there has been adequate time to return exported nutrients to the soil in a manner consistent wi th these standards. Bare tillage year-round is prohibited . Soil carbon (i.e., humus) levels must be maintained and ideally increased over time. During the growing season, ti llage must be kept at a minimum avoiding bare exposed soil for long periods of time. Frequency and type of till age will be documented in the Biodynamic System Plan or other form of documentat ion. Each year at least 20% of annual and perennial cultivated areas must include a soil building crop su ch as sod, pasture, cover crops and green manures. Within the fabric of this Stan dard are requirements to implemen t the following vegetative cover techniques before importation of inputs are perm itted. Also see sections on: Fertility Management - Integration of livestoc k (pasture and fodder) - Green manures - Legumes/ nutrient catch crops - Crop rotation Disease and Insect Control - Botanical diversity - Predator habitat -Crop rotation Weed Control - Shade/ crop canopy - Mulching -Grazing Water and Waterway Conservation -Mulching -Development of soil organic matter Soil must be protected from soil erosion and soil structure degradat ion during periods of the year when it is vulnerable. Adequate crop resi due and, at a minimum, volunteer vegetative cover must protect all fields of cultivation during th ese periods (for example winter months, rainy seasons, etc.). 2. Generating fertility The foundation of the fertility system needs to be based on strategies that emphasize generating fertility from within the life of the farm. When applicable , the following techniques n eed to be demonstrably utilized to their maximum potential for a farm to import allowed fertility materi als. There are also limitations on the amount of fertility that ca n be imported and app lied. [See Section I.B] Livestock integration Green manure Legumes/nutrient catch crops Biodynamic preparations Crop rotation In market gardens, about 1/3 of the crop acres must grow a green manure, green fallow, and/or fodder production in a given year. This requirement does not apply to farms smaller than 5 acres (land in vegetable production) while it is encouraged. 10 3. Disease, insect and weed control The foundation of disease and insect control need s to be based on strategies that emphasize prevention located within the life of the farm itself. When applicable, the following techniques need to be demonstrably utilized to th eir maximum potential for a farm to import pest control materials. [See Section I.D.1] Botanical species diversity Predator habitat Balanced crop nutrition Attention to light penetration and airflow Biodynamic preparations Crop rotation Timing of planting/Understandin g of pest species life cycle The foundation of weed control needs to be based on strategies that emphasize prevention located within the life of the farm itself. When applicable , the following techniques n eed to be demonstrably utilized to their maximum potential for a farm to import weed control materials (including petroleum to run tractors). [See Section I.D.2] Timing of planting/ Understanding of weed species lifecycle Shade/crop canopy Mulching Crop rotation Identifying and avoiding the spread of invasive weed species Grazing Irrigation strategies 4. Use of the Biodynamic preparations The full complement of the Biodyn amic preparations 500- 507 must be used. [See Section I.C] 5. Water and waterway conservation Irrigation needs are required to be met based on st rategies that emphasize water conservation. The following water conservation measures need to be demonstrably utilized to their maximum potential. Development of soil organic matter Mulching, in instances where mulching can be practically applied Efficient irrigation delivery systems where such systems can be practically applied Alternative pumping methods, such as solar pum ps, nose pumps or wind pumps are considered The performance of irrigation system equipmen t is routinely monitored to verify motors, pumps and delivery systems are performing well and according to specifications Irrigation scheduling takes into consideration crop requirements, daily rainfall amounts, soil types and evapotranspiration rates for the area. Soil moisture is monitored to improve irrigation efficiency to avoid excessive water application. 11 Waterways (applies to US farms with fish bearing waterways) When irrigating from native fish bearing wa terways the following needs to be considered: Installing fish screens on diversions in accordance with appropriate state department of fish and wildlife or other similar guidance spec ific to the farm's geographic location Avoiding channel manipulations that could ne gatively impact native fish populations Work on diversions, including installing and servicing pumps and intakes is conducted when sensitive native species are not present. If in stream work is done when there is wate r in the stream in stream sediment control and containment measures to prevent excessive sedi ment and construction debris from entering the water way. Irrigation ponds should not have adverse impa cts on stream temperat ure and water quality. Riparian, wetland, and upland vegetation protec tion (applies to US farms with fish bearing waterways) When year round or seasonal waterw ays that are important habitat for native fish populations are present on the farm the followi ng needs to be considered: Riparian zones or cultivation setbacks of yea r-round and seasonal waterways, potentially harboring native fish, are adequately vege tated and a minimum width of 35 feet. Wetlands are protected and wetl and buffers established to the greatest extent operationally feasible. Wetland protection is prioritized to pr ovide off-channel salmon habitat, improved water quality, additional floodplain stor age, and/or other habitat benefits associated with proper wetland function. In dedicated agricultural pr oduction areas, wetlan ds are protected by a minimum 25 foot uncultivated buffer to the greatest extent operationally feasible. 6. Livestock integration The integration and maintenance of livestock is an invaluable tool of Biodynamic farm management. Within the context of the farm individuality and ec ology, the grower should strive to have a mixed livestock population to help establish and sustain a self-s ufficient system of fertilit y. In situations where the presence of only a small number of livestock is possible it is re commended that a cow be present to provide the manure for making Pr eparation 500 on the farm. Wherever possible the Demeter Associ ation supports the principle of integrating livestock back into agronomic systems verses separating livestock from the land in large indus trial feed lots. Their contribution to the fertility dynamics , crop rotation and vitality of a farm is significant. Certifying a livestock product to the Demeter sta ndard is not something that is easy to do, and it takes significant long-term focus to bring a farming system to a place where livestock certification is possible. It is recognized that many folks who sinc erely want to integrate livestock into their farming system do not have the land base and other resources available to meet the Demeter standard for certified Livestock products (see Livestock Standard below). For this reason, Demeter will allow exemptions not requiring livestock on Demeter farms to be certified to the Demeter standard. The land base on which the animals reside is NOT exempt from the requirements of the Biodynamic Farm Standard . When imported animals are introduced to the farm care mu st be taken to ensure that they ha ve not recently been treated with any prohibited materials to ensure that th eir manure does not contaminate the farm. 12 Not having livestock on the farm and having livestock on the farm that are not managed fully to the Demeter Standard requires approved exemptions. In situations when there are animals not certified to the Biodynamic Farm Standard on a farm, how these animals are managed needs to be considered. Attention must be paid to humane handling of the anim als while they reside on the farm. Also, attention must be paid to avoiding contamination of production land with residue of materials such as veterinary treatments and wormers. To fulfill the livestock integr ation requirement, the following criteria must be met: The minimum stocking rate for agricultural farms wi th less than 25 acres (based on the total area under production) must not fall belo w 0.02 livestock units/acre. The minimum stocking rate for agricultural farms wi th more than 25 and less than 99 acres (based on the total area under production) must not fall short of 0.05 livestock units/acre. The minimum stocking rate for agricultural farms wi th more than 99 acres (based on the total area under production) must not fall shor t of 0.1 livestock units/acre. A livestock unit is 1000 lbs. animal weight. Ma ximum stocking rates can be found in Appendix F If these criteria are not met, an annual exemption must be requested that explains the reason for not fulfilling the livestock integration requirement. An operation requesting an exemption from having livestock must bring in farmyard manure, which must be composted before use, or composted manure from other holdings (see Section I.B.2 for composting requirements) or provid e a detailed plan for enhancing th e wildlife presence on the farm. The quantity must be equivalent to at least 9lbs. N/ acre/year. Where bringing in farmyard manure is not possible or practical, the 9lbs. N/acre/year must be provided by cover crops or other plant or animal composts. All brought in compost material s must meet the requirements of Appendix B. 7. Gentle post-harvest handling Agricultural production is minimally mani pulated after it has been harvested. See Demeter Biodynamic Processing Standard for more information. 13 Frey Vineyards Mendocino, CA B. Soil Fertility Management 1. General principles The aim of Biodynamic fertility management is to ge nerate a farm's fertility from within the farming system itself rather than importing inputs from the ou tside. This generally invo lves the recycling of raw organic materials generated on the farm with the goal of developing soil humus and the related biological activity that such a process ignites. Examples of self-sustaining fertility dynamics include: Use of legumes in crop rotation (pulls nitrogen from the air and incorporates it into the farm's fertility cycle; helps to mobilize phosphorous; builds soil humus) Sod in crop rotation (builds soil humus) Recycling livestock manures vi a composting and pasture mana gement (concentrates numerous crop nutrients/minerals and recycles them back into the farm; builds soil humus) Green manure plow down crops (builds soil humus; supplies concentrated levels of various crop nutrients) Care in planning crop rotation that avoids excess ive and continual loss of crop nutrients in levels that exceed the farm's ability to replenish them Increasing biological activity of soil and catch cropping to help mobilize slow-to-move nutrients such as phosphoric acid Use of the Biodynamic compost preparations and horn manur e (Preparation 500 - orchestrates and stimulates the living processes described above) For more information on fertility material s that are strictly prohibited under the Biodynamic Farm Standard see Section I.B.6. 2. Composting General concerns Demeter approaches raw manure/urine as a restricted material. Excessive app lications of raw manures 14 can lead to ground water contamination and an over load of a given soil's biol ogy. Raw manure can also lead to pathological concerns. Raw manure collected in barns, holding pens, etc. should be composted using the Biodynamic compost preparations be fore they are applied to certified acreage. In situations such as intensive grazing strategies where significant amounts of raw manure and urine are deposited on a land base, effort mu st be made to help the soil assim ilate the manure in a living way before a crop to be certified can be planted or harv ested. Some methods to aid such assimilation include light tillage, harrowing, applied compound preparat ions, applied compost te as, and all the related amplified soil biology techniques (i.e., earthworms, d ung beetles, etc.). Soil te mperatures must be warm enough to allow proper assimilation of manure by soil. Making Biodynamic compost, using the Biodynamic compost preparations , is a very deliberate process. Rudolf Steiner described this as a process of literally making the co mpost pile inwardly sensitive and receptive. In this sense it imparts a cosmic intelligen ce to the pile and ultimately to the soil the compost is applied to. While the composting process upon init ial observation seems to be a breaki ng down process, it is also a building and stabilizing process that moves raw compos t ingredients towards a colloidal humus state. The heat cycle reduces pathogen s and weed seed viability. Biodynamic compost must not present a health risk due to pathogens th at may be present in feed stock materials. The carbon to nitrogen ratio of the ingredients must be in the range of 25:1 - 40:1. Producers using an in-vessel or static ae rated pile system must maintain the composting materials at a temperature above 131\u00b0F for 3 days. Producers using a windrow system must maintain the composting materials at a temperature above 131\u00b0F for 15 days, dur ing which time, the materials must be turned a minimum of five times. While there may be instance s that arise where such a windrow system needs to be used (such as piles that become over saturated with water for example) as a general rule excessive turning of the compost pile should be avoided. A properly built compos t pile should have the Carbon to Nitrogen ratio, porosity, and moisture content to a llow the pile to decompose properly without excessive turning. Temperatures reached by the Biodyn amic compost should not exceed 150\u00b0F. There are instances where quality co mposts that do not m eet such times and te mperatures might be made, such as a high carbon compos t or barrel compost. Note that if such composts are to be used in compliance with the NOP organic regulation, their us e may need to recognize 90-120 day pre-harvest intervals or be shown to be in co ntact/ incorporated with soil for 90-120 days during the process of making the compost. The Biodynamic compost preparations 502-507 must be utilized to ma ke Biodynamic compost. They should be present to guid e each stage of the manure's decomposition cycle to a humus state and at a minimum are utilized upon the initial bu ilding of the pile and with the firs t turning of the pile. It is also recommended that they be used each ti me the pile is turned thereafter. Farm generated fertility materials, such as livest ock manures, are one of a farmer's most valuable fertilizers. Care must be taken not to lose the inherent fertility pres ent in these materials during storage and the composting process. In so me climates, a cover might be need ed to prevent excessive moisture 15 addition or excessive moisture loss. In such instance s, the cover used needs to allow the compost pile to breathe and interact with it s surrounding environment. Ideally, Biodynamic compost p iles are made in direct cont act with the earth if it is possible to do this in compliance with local regulations (state, county, etc.) Environmental concerns The location, design and function of manure/ingredient storage facilities need to comply with all federal, state and local laws governing clean water, clean ai r and health, safety and welfare. Manure/ingredient storage facilities need to be loca ted outside of floodplains and areas of shallow groundwater, as well as outside frequently moist or saturated soils. A manur e/ compost ingredient storage management plan should be developed and put in place, taking into consideration a 25-year 24-hour storm event. Manure/ingredient storage facilities need to be designed to prevent any direct or indirect flow of manure/contaminants into surrounding land, streams, rivers, or other surface waters in the event of sustained heavy rains and runoff, rupt ures in storage tanks, leaching fr om in-ground pits, or breaching of storage lagoons. Clean water run-of f from roofs, surface flows, and overflowing waterers need to be diverted away from manure piles. If manure and/or compost piles are less than 50 feet upland from a waterway, the piles need to be covered during rainy periods and/or a leachate containment system is in place. Active and finished compost piles must be stored up slope from manur e/ingredient storage to prevent contamination. Source materials The effective carbon footprint that results from the movement of compost ingredients from their source to the composting site needs to be considered. Bulk ma nure and feedstock ideally come from the farming system itself or are imported from the general region where the compost is made. Ideally the composting of waste contributes to the overall well-being of a given local community and serves as a solution to local wa ste management concerns. If imported from the outside of a given farming system bulk imported compost ingredients (such as bulk manures and feedstock) should not tr avel long distances to the composting site. Bulk raw ingredients must not travel more than 250 miles to reach the composting site. The use of organic wastes from municipal sources, industrial so urces or synthetic, chemically farmed agriculture can be problematic. Such materi als may be contaminated with environmentally persistent chemicals, heavy meta ls, and genetically modified plant material. Municipal \"green waste\" used as feedstock must not contain comp ostable plastics and must be source separated prior to receipt on the farm. Care should be taken with regard in the choice of sources used as compost ingredients. Attempt to use materials that have not been contaminated with prohibited materials such as prohibited pesticides, GMO's, heavy metals, wormers and antibiotics. In th e event this is not possible, product testing may be required to show that th e finished product is not contaminated with materials suspected to be in the ingredient source. 16 Manure sources should come from certified organic live stock production at a minimum. If this is not possible and conventional livestoc k manure is used, the ma terials used in the co nventional livestock production (e.g., wormers, hormones, GMO feed, antibiotics, persistent pesticides) must be documented. Imported animal manures may not originate from anim als kept in intensive animal husbandry systems, or systems using no floor litter. In this section \"intensive\" includes any animals that do not have regular, reliable, and effective access to the outdoors (e.g., hens kept in barns, etc.); or subject to unethical practices (e.g., beak clipping of hens, tooth cutting of piglets etc.) Appropriate systems must be applied to prevent th e contamination of certif ied land by residues of veterinary remedies, feed additives such as antibiot ics, natural feed contaminants such as mercury in fish meal and other residues such as herbicides in the litter. Animal manures from animals fed gene tically modified fodder must not be brought in. If proof that the manure is free from GMO's cannot be given or GM O-free manure is not available, Demeter USA can give an exemption. Criteria for issuing an exempt ion must include: 1) The manure must be composted for at least a year, 2) must be composted with Bi odynamic preparations, and 3) the compost must be identified and processed as a separate pile. 3. Applied nitrogen, pho sphorous and potassium The maximum amount of nitrogen and phosphorous that may be applied by way of fertilizers used, averaged over the crop rotation, may not exceed the amount that wo uld be produced by those animals which the farm could support by its own ir rigated (if necessary) forage production. Application of this Biodynamic Federation - Demete r International requirement is based on the concept of a \"manure unit\" (mu). Manure unit calculations as they relate to species/stoc king rate and fertility inputs are summarized in Appendix F: \"Calculation of Stocking Rate\". A maximum of .56-mu/acre is allowed. This is the equivalent of 100 lbs. N/acre and 87 lbs. P/acre applied to the total acreage in the crop rotation. Please see Appendix G, Fertility Calculat ion Worksheet, for specific examples. For cropping systems with high nutrient export in the form of harveste d crops (see Table 1 for possibilities), and systems that are inherently nutrient-deficient from previous management or basic inherent geological and biological realities, a maximum of 150 lbs. N/acre and 125 lbs. P/acre can be applied to outdoor production. For nitrogen app lications, the deficit must be substantiated by a nitrogen-balance illustrating signific ant export of N (minimum 100 lbs. N/acre) in the form of harvested/ exported crops. Green manure plow down crops are no t calculated as \"applied fertility\". Calculation of N and P applic ations will be based on th e analysis of the material applied. For example, a 5-5-3 fertilizer represents 5% total N and 5% available P. If 10,000 lbs. of this material is applied over a 17 total acreage of 100 acres, then a to tal of 500 lbs. N and 500 lbs. P are to be divided by 100 acres. This represents 5 lbs./acre applie d N and P which is within th e limits of the Standard. Total application of other crop ma cro and micronutrients needs to be monitored and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Nutrients should not be applie d in any manner that result in a disproportionate nutrient balance or a toxic situation. In addition, the application of nutrients for plants should be targeted for maximum effici ency to avoid leaching and run-off in order to protect ground and surface water. Approved Phosphorus and Potassium Salt fertilizers can only be used when there are documented P and K deficiencies. Permitted forms of potassium sa lts cannot have a chloride content of more than 3%. 4. Imported fertility As discussed in Section I.A: \"Necessary Elements of the Farm Organism: Generating fertility\", a foundation of a Biodynamic farm lies in its ability to generate its own fert ility. Imported fertility needs to be monitored carefully and the need fo r it must be clearly documented (i.e., soil analysis, tissue analysis, visual deficiency in crop, etc.). Allowance for imported fertili ty will be handled on a ca se-by-case basis. Imported fertility is only allowed if it can be clearly demonstrated that items listed in Section I.A: \"Necessary Elements of the Farm Organism: Generating fertility,\" are being applied to their maximum efficiency given a farm's unique set of circumstances. If these factors are not at their full potential efficiency, there needs to be evidence that an evolution towards such ef ficiency is in progress. As is the case for imported comp ost ingredients for on-farm compos ting, when finished compost is imported onto the farm the source must be loca ted within a radius of 250 miles of the farm. Imported nitrogen and phos phorous is permitted to be imported to a maximum of .5 mu/ hectare. This translates to 36 lbs. N/acre an d 31 lbs. P/acre applied to tota l acreage in the crop rotation. In orchards, imported fertility is limi ted to 86 lbs. N/acre and 75 lbs. P/ acre. In grapes for wine, the total amount of fertilizer in 3 consecutive yea rs shall not exceed 134 lbs. N/acre. For cropping systems with high nutrient export in the form of harvested crops (such as horticulture market gardens-see Table 1 below), a maximum of 150 lbs. N/acre and 125 lbs. P/acre can be imported. For nitrogen applications the deficit must be substantiated by a nitrogen-balance illustrating significant export of N (minimum 100 lbs. N/acre) in the form of harvested/ exported cr ops. The amount of concentrated fertilizers* can be up to 72 lbs. N/ac re/year and 36 lbs. P/acre /year, calculated as an average over the vegetable crop rotation and not the entire farm. This can only be considered if the items discussed in Sectio n I.B: \"Soil Fertility Management: Ge neral Principles\" and \"Compost\" are adequately met. For perennial crops in tropical or sub-tropical climates it is allowe d to import up to a maximum of 150 lbs./acre nitrogen if nitrogen export is higher than 100 lbs./acre. The deficit must be substantiated by a 18 nitrogen balance to be approved by Demeter. In this case, the amount of imported concentrated fertilizer can be up to 54 lbs. N/acre/year. Greenhouses are allowed a higher level of nitrogen if they can prove by a nitrogen-balance during inspection that total input of pounds N equals total output of pounds N with a margin of 5%. Exemptions to the maximum fertility application for sm all (case by case) and urban (within city limits) horticulture farms can be considered ca se by case if need can be proven. Please see Appendix E - Fertility Calculat ion Worksheet, for specific examples. Table 1 : Maximum amount of manures and fertilizers in different crops Farm Type Max. Nitrogen Specifics Max. Amount of Concentrated Fertilizers* Agriculture 100 lbs. N/acre/yea r 36 lbs. N/acre/year and 18 lbs. P/acre/year as an average over the farm Horticulture 100 lbs. N/ac re/year Up to 150 lbs. N/acre/year if need can be proven 72 lbs. N/acre/year and 36 lbs. P/acre/year average over the crop rotation Greenhouse No limit Nitrogen ba lance 72 N lbs./acre/year and 36 lbs.

P/acre/year as an average over the orchard area; up to 54 lbs N/acre/year for subtropical perennial crops based on N balance Viticulture 134 lbs. N/acre/three years 36 lbs. N/acre/year and 18 lbs. P/acre/year as an average over the vineyards *Concentrated Fertilizers - bone meal, meat and bone meal, dried blood, ha ir and feather and similar products. The amount of nitrogen from concentr ated fertilizers must be less than the amount from farm manure, imported farm manure, and green manure. 19 5. Fertility Co-operations Co-operation between Biodynamic farms (e.g., the ex change of fodder or animal manures) in the sense of a biological unit is possible. In cases where no Biodynamic farm is sufficiently close by, co-operation can be organized between the certified Biodynamic farm and an organic farm. In either case, there must be a formal agreement on file. Before co-operation with an orga nic farm is permitted, the following conditions must be fulfilled: a) The co-operating partner farm must f eed the animals with 100% organic fodder, b) The co-operating partner farm mu st be converted entirely to organic production. c) An exemption must be requested and approved. d) Farmyard manure must be prepared on the farm where it originates., or at least 6 weeks before application. e) The distance of transportation must be kept at a minimum and will be considered as part of the exemption process. f) fodder-cooperation with organic farms is on ly possible in cases of perennial fodder plant cultivation (at least three years). Application of preparations must start at least one year in advance and must be executed by the fodder absorbing Bi odynamic farm. If crop rotation enables food crops on the cooperation area, application of pr eparations must be continued, if the fodder production is continued in the following years. Food crops produced in co-operation cannot be marketed as Biodynamic. g) Fodder-production in cooperat ion under the previous conditions can be treated as on farm production and part of the Biodynamic amount for the purpose of Se ction IV. G - Feeding. 6. Fertility materials needing special consideration Imported fertility inputs The Organic Materials Review Inst itute (OMRI) and Washington State Department of Agriculture Organic Program lists are used as a standard refe rence for brand name materials, and the National Organic Program (NOP) \"National List of Allowe d and Prohibited Substances\" is the standard reference for generic name material s. Materials approved by OMRI and the NOP are not all allowed in the Biodynamic Farm Standard . Use of off-list products could result in de-certification materials\" section be low and Appendix B: \"Permitted and Restricted Fertilizers and Soil Conditioners\"]. If meals from potential GMO crops ar e to be used as production aids, it must be verified that such materials are non-GMO at th e time of application. Ash may be used as fertility input only if obtained from acceptable sources such as untreated wood or coffee hulls. The source should be plant-base d and free of prohibited substances. Caution is advised in application rates due to unknown mi neral content. The addition of some minerals, part icularly trace minerals, can affect mineral balances in the soil. The importation of any minerals must be based on a documented need. 20 Prohibited materials The use of plant wastes such as lawn clippings, leaves, green chop, or compost from municipal sources may be contaminated with lawn chemicals and/ or petroleum products and consequently are prohibited for direct mulching unless it can be cl early demonstrated that th ey are free of prohibited materials. They may be us ed as fertility ingredient s if they are composted as described above. If there is reason to believe that such materials may be contaminated with prohibited materials Demeter reserves the right to have the materials tested. The use of sewage sludge or biosolids is prohibited. This includes sludge ash. Saltpeter, Chilean nitrate (nitrate of soda), soluble phosphates, chloride-containing potassium salts, and all forms of synthetic fertilizers as excluded by the NOP are prohibited (including nitrate and ammonium salts). Permitted forms of potassium salts must have a chloride content of more than 3%. Off-farm manure sources should come from certified organic livestock producti on at a minimum. If this is not possible and conventional livestock manure is used, the materials us ed in the conventional livestock production (i.e., wormers, hormones, GM O feed, antibiotics) must be documented. No manure that is derived from \"intensive\" confinement operations (animals not having regular, reliable, and effective access to the outdoors) will be allowed. 21 Cowhorn Vineyard & Garden Applegate Valley, OR C. Biodynamic Preparations 1. Description A distinguishing feature of Biodynamic agriculture is the use of nine preparations made from herbs, mineral substances and animal manures that are utiliz ed in field sprays and compost inoculants applied in minute doses, much like homeopathic remedies are for humans. Originally described by Rudolf Steiner in a series of lect ures on agriculture, thes e Biodynamic preparations are numbered 500 - 508. Please see Appendix J for definitions of each of these Biodynamic preparations. Biodynamic preparation use is requir ed for Biodynamic certification. 2. Sources Ideally Biodynamic preparations are made on the farm where they are to be used. The ingredients, such as the plant materials and the animal sheaths are also produced ideally on the farm utilizing the core principles of the Biodynamic method in a comprehensive manner. If you do not have experience making the preparations, it is recommended that you learn how to produce them prior to making them on your own. In the interim or if you choose not to make the preparations, they are available from approved companie s that distribute the preparations nationally or through established regional preparation making gr oups. The Biodynamic community has many farmers who have extensive experience ma king and utilizing the preparatio ns and are eager to share that knowledge. Please contact the Demeter office fo r a list of resources and companies approved to commercially distribute the Biodynamic preparations. 3. Stirring Hand stirring is preferred and should be done consciou sly. Flow forms and stirring machines may also be used but the farmer should still maintain co nscious contact with the stirring process. 22 4. Application The compost preparations need to be applied to acreage to be harv ested either via applications of Biodynamic compost or via an approved field spray or compound preparation. At a minimum, either Biodynamic compost or an approved field spray needs to be applie d at least once every three years. Preparations 500 and 501 n eed to be applied at least annually to all harvested crops. Preparation 500 should be applied in the later part of the day in the fo rm of droplets that come in contact with the earth. Preparation 501 should be ap plied in the early morning hours as a fi ne mist that settles down onto crop foliage. Application rates for the field sprays are \u00be - 4 \u00bc ounces/acre for 500 a nd 1 -2 gram/acre for 501. Typical application rate is \u00bc -\u00bd tsp. of each compost preparation per 13 cubi c yards of compos t or deep litter manure/slurry. Typical application rate of a compo und preparation like Barrel Compost is applied at \u00bd cup/acre. 5. Storage Biodynamic preparations should be stored in a ve ssel that allows for the presence of oxygen. These vessels should be stored in a vessel made of natura l material surrounded by peat or some other similar insulating material. The condition of the stored preps should be checked regularly. The preparation 501 should be stored in a vessel (such as a glass jar or ho rn) in a sunny location. Storage of all the preparations should be placed in a location free of electromag netic fields (such as measured by a Gauss meter). 6. Safety If preparations are made on the farm careful records are kept of the entire pr oduction process so that checks can be made of the following: - The origin of the organ material (abattoir, type and origin of the animal, quantities) - Site where preparations are being made (sketch of site) - Date of insertion in the soil and of its extraction - Record of disposal of any remains. Records will be checked as part of the regular Demeter inspection. Anim al organs used need to be of appropriate quality. 23 Benziger Family Winery Sonoma, CA D. Crop Protection 1. Disease and insect control The foundation of disease and insect control needs to be based on strategies that emphasize prevention located within the life of the farm. When applicable, the following te chniques need to be demonstrably utilized to their maximum potential in order for a farm to import allowed pest control materials. Botanical species diversity Predator habitat Balanced crop nutrition Attention to light penetration and airflow Conscious use of the Bi odynamic preparations Crop rotation Understanding of pest species li fe cycle/ Timing of planting The use of synthetic chemicals to control pests, to pr event or control fungal, vira l, or other diseases, to control weeds, or the use of hormones to regulate or manipulate the growth of crops, is not allowed . Only those measures of co ntrol allowed within the Biodynamic Farm Standard and existing laws may be used. Appendix C lists materials approved for crop protection. Note: there are materials permitted in certified organic production that are not permitted with Demeter certified Biodynamic production. In addition, certain materials pe rmitted as regulated materials by Demeter require specific exemption with criteria for use. See Appendix I for more information. Understanding the life cycle of a pest species is a very important tool in controlling a pest species. By knowing when a pest species is the most virulent lo ss can be avoided by the ti ming of planting and by breaking the life cycle of the pest. Biocides that ar e not selective to the pest spec ies should be avoided. 24 In organic production sulfur is widely used to prevent and control fungal diseases. It should be used only as needed, not according to a schedule. Alternativ es exist which can be used separately or in combination with Biodynamic preparations to greatly reduce the amount of sulfur. Copper products are limited to a maximum of 2.7 lbs. Cu/acre/year averaged over 7 years and, if possible, 1 lb./application. Note: Pay close attention to the brands of pest cont rol materials used concerning all ingredients and inert ingredients in their formulations. Brands used must not contain any materials prohibited for use by these Standards. 2. Weed control The foundation of weed control ne eds to be based on strategies that emphasize prevention located within the life of the farm . When applicable, the following techni ques need to be demonstrably utilized to their maximum potential in orde r for allowed weed control materi als (including petroleum to run tractors) to be imported. Understanding of weed species life cycle/ Timing of planting Adjusting fertility conditions that promote certain weed species Shade/ crop canopy Mulching Crop rotation Identifying and avoiding the spread of invasive weed species Grazing Irrigation Understanding the life cycle of a weed species is a very important tool in controlling a weed species. By knowing when a weed species is the most virulent, loss can be avoided by the timing of planting and by breaking the life cy cle of the weed. If mulching is used, it is preferable that the materials be produced on the farm. If this is not possible, mulching materials from off the farm must be chosen with care. Imported synt hetic mulch materials that restrict oxygen to the soil below ne ed to be used with caution. If sy nthetic mulch materials are used, they must be pulled up annually and not al lowed to break down into the soil. In this case, it is preferable that the materials are durable enough to be re-used annua lly. The materials must not inhibit the biological dynamics of the soil below. E. Protection from Environmental Hazards 1. Buffer zones Buffer zones must be created and maintained between certified fields and chemically treated acres. Hedgerows are recommended for protection and to encl ose the farm organism. It is not possible to quantify here how much of a buffer zone is required, as the need for space will vary depending on the neighboring activity, whether there is a risk for prohibited material co ntamination and, if so, what the prohibited materials are. Each situ ation will be approached on a case -by-case basis. Any necessary buffer 25 areas should either not be plante d to a harvested commodity or such commodities will need to be harvested separately, segregated, and sold as non-certified products. 2. High voltage power lines Because Biodynamic agriculture works with the dynami cs of subtle forces th e impact on crops grown under high voltage power lines that emit significant EM F levels are a concern. Often these power lines cross production areas in a random ma nner so it is generally not practica l to segregate that portion of the harvest. To address these negative impacts, the area s should receive extra ap plications of the full complement of the Biodynamic preparations. 3. Spray drift and run-off Products grown on areas contaminat ed by spray drift or run-off from a neighboring chemically managed field may not be sold as certified. Residue tests may be needed to establish the area of contamination. These areas, if harvested at all, must be kept stri ctly segregated and docume ntation must be provided verifying the sale of the crop as non-Demeter certified. 4. Irrigation water Irrigation water should be free of chemical and biological contaminatio n and may require periodic testing if there are obvious potential sources of measurable contamination. If th e source is chlorinated municipal water, it is recommended that the water be ae rated either by creating a basin or pool or using flow forms or over head sprinklers. 5. Livestock Livestock should not have access to natural bodies of water that are year-round and permanent. Livestock should not be grazed in sensitive ecosystems unless it benefi ts those systems, for example in the removal of noxious weeds. These situations will be approached on a case-by-case basis. Domestic grazing animals must be handled in a way th at will not pose a contamination threat to food for human consumption. Through the entire growth period of the harvested products, it must be demonstrated that it was free from contam ination of domestic raw animal manures. F. Duty to Report In case of severe attack by pests or disease in fiel ds or during storage, whic h cannot be controlled by approved measures and where prohibited measures are unavoidable, a report must be made to a Demeter representative before any prohibited measures are taken. Use of prohibited measures may lead to a loss of certification of the whole farm for a period of up to three years. This situation compromi ses the whole farm concept by creati ng a parallel production issue. Demeter guidelines do not allow parallel production or partial farm certification. Therefore, this situation is viewed very seriously. It is the owner's responsibility to educate field workers regarding acceptable practices and those that would compromise certification. 26 G. Seeds, Vegetative Propagation Stock, Seedlings, and Perennial Planting Stock It is strongly encouraged that seeds, vegetative propagation stock and transplants come from Biodynamic sources. In addition, it is strongly encour aged that as much seed an d propagation material as possible is produced on the farm under Biodynamic management and developing genetics best adapted to its climate and microclimates. Us e of plant species also adapted to the local climate helps to address other concerns of this Standard , such as emphasis on farm ge nerated pest control and water conservation. If imported seed is necessary, preference should be given to open pollinated seed varieties. Hybrid varieties that are the result of protoplasm and cy toplasm fusion techniques are prohibited. Cereal hybrids, except for Corn (Zea Mays), are ex cluded for the production of feed and food. For seed and vegetative propagation stock that is im ported there must first be a search for Biodynamic seed and vegetative propagation stock. If Biodynam ic seed and vegetative propagation stock are not available in the quantity or quality ne eded, then there also ne eds to be a search for certified organic seed and vegetative propagation stock with the same parame ters. In the event Biodynamic or organic seed and vegetative propagation stock are not available in varieties that fit your fa rming system an exception to use nonorganic seed and vegetative propagatio n stock can occur given a documented search for Biodynamic/organic sources has o ccurred and the seed and vegetative propagation stock are shown to be non-GMO and not treated with prohibited materials. The use of genetically engin eered seed, transplants, or rootstock are prohibited. The use of seed, propagation and plant material pr oduced by new plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) is prohibited in production on a Demeter certified en terprise. This comprises all NPBTs considered by IFOAM as techniques of genetic mo dification leading to GMOs according to the existing EU legal definition. These are: Oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis (ODM) Zinc finger nuclease Reverse Breeding Synthetic Genomics The use of plant seeds treated with low-energy el ectrons is prohibited if alternative treatment according to this Standard is available. Transplants of perennial tree and vine crops, if gr own from non-certified Biod ynamic stock, must be grown according to this Standard for 12 months prior to the appearance of flower buds of the crop to be 27 sold as certified. If pr opagation material can be documented as being unavailable in Biodynamic or organic quality conventional propagation material may be imported. Post-h arvest treatment with materials prohibited in certified orga nic production is not permitted. H. GMO and Nanotechnology - Avoidance and Protection The Demeter USA Standard for farm products labele d/sold as BIODYNAMIC is \"none detected\" when tested for suspected GMO contaminants. Demeter will not permit use of transgenic, spliced, or engineered plant or animal products or any derivative in food, feed, or fiber pr oduction. It will be necessary to ve rify that farm inputs, non-certified seed and inoculants used are non-GMO. In regions where the possibility of genetic drift from neighboring GM O crop varieties is high, close attention needs to be paid to timing of planting, flowering et c. to avoid the potential for drift as much as possible. If a crop has the high likelihood of being contaminated by drift (for example - corn, soybean, canola, alfalfa, beets, etc. being grown in a region where GMO production is prevalent) Demeter may require testing prior to sale of these crops labe led as Demeter Certified Biodynamic\u00ae. There is evidence that the post-harvest handlin g of susceptible crops is a primary means of contamination of previously clean crop due to the prevalence of GMO crops that are handled in many cleaning and storage facilities. If possible, use only harvest equipment, storage and post-handling equipment that is dedicated to Biodynamic production. Because the impact on the environment and on human and animal health is unclear, Demeter adopts the precautionary principle concer ning human-made nanoparticles. Demeter does not permit their usage in Biodynamic agriculture, or in any De meter certified products . Particles less than 100 nanometers in size shall be excl uded from farm inputs, ingredients, aids and additives as far as practicable. However, this requirement cannot guarantee freedom from human-made nanoparticles due to the pervasiveness of these materials, the lack of a legal obligation to label them, and the difficulty of analytical determination. 28 Light of Day Farm Traverse City, MI I. Residue Testing This section refers to residues like herbicides and pesticides or farm inputs in general which are not in line with the basic requirements of organic and Biodynamic farming. General environmental contaminants, which can endanger the marketability of products irrespective of their organic status, are not included in the following. In some cases, Demeter may requ ire residue testing of soil and/or crop samples (specifically for prohibited materials including GMO co ntamination) as part of the cert ification process. Demeter must approve who collects the sample, the number and type of samples, and select the testing lab used. GMO tolerance levels permitted fo r Demeter certified farm producti on must be shown to be \"not detected\" via laboratory analys is from an approved lab. Maximum pesticide tolerance levels permitted for De meter certified production are as noted in the USDA National Organic Program. If a product or raw ingredient loses its organic st atus due to exceeding the permitted maximum levels of the USDA National Organic Program or proven targeted use of non-ap proved substances, it automatically loses its Demeter certification. The following addition al factors apply: Analysis results with a value higher than 0.01 mg/kg, based on the unproc essed starting product and considering the measurement uncertainty and the dispersion range usual for the prohibited substance, trigger a search for possible causes. If investigations by Demeter USA show th at the material was undoubtedly not used intentionally but because of unavoidable measures such as contaminated si tes, drift or storage 29 contamination, Demeter USA may release the pro duct concerned even if the orientation value is exceeded. The above does not apply if more than two subs tances per product or ra w material exceed 0.01 mg/kg (each) The licensee concerned must report any materials exceeding 0.01 mg/kg to Demeter USA. If s/he knowingly fails to do so, and the residue findings ar e discovered at a later stage it is not possible to refer to the treatment as an orientation value and there is caus e for the product or raw material to lose its Biodynamic certification. If investigation reveals the source of residues, then a plan must be developed to mitigate future contamination. 30 II. GREENHOUSE MANAGEMENT Common Good Farm Raymond, NE A. General Principle A greenhouse can be an important elem ent within a Biodynamic farm, but it must be seen as part of the greater farm organism or be managed as a whole in dependent system(s) in and of itself. A greenhouse may be used to grow plant starts in containers or for growing crops direct ly in the soil. In all situations the requirements of the Biodynamic Farm Standard apply in full. For ex ample, the requirements concerning imported/applied fertility, pest control, biodiversity, crop rotati on, weed control, water conservation etc. are all applic able to any greenhouse management under Demeter certification. Management of rainwater shed from the area under co ver is mandatory so that is does not erode soil or create a point of pollution. Mulching materials- Organic mulching material is permitted (for cr iteria for imported mulches, see Section I.B.5 - Fertility materials needing special consideration) Biodegradable and oxo-biodegradable plastics are not permitted Plastic mulching material is only permitted if it is reusable for at least 5 years This Standard distinguishes between greenhouses as part of a horticultural enterprise and specialized protected cultivation. The distinction is based on the level of fertilization. Greenhouse within a Horticultural Enterprise For greenhouses as a part of a farm, the respective maximum limits of the respective farm type apply. In this case, the upper limit does not have to be observed for the greenhouse, but for the entire operation. Enrichment with CO 2 inside greenhouses on a horticultural en terprise is not permitted. Heating of greenhouses based on fossil fuel so urces is not permitted after 2028.* The source of energy can come from fossil fuel sources for frost protection for in -ground crops (up to 41\u00b0F/5\u00b0C), raising plant starts including holding planting stock, and curing harvested crops. 31 Energy efficient lighting is permitted for seed lings, herbs, mother plants, and ornamentals. Specialized Protected Cultivation Specialized protected cultivation ha s no upper limits with regards to nitrogen input but must comply with several other requirements in order to compensate for the lack of integration into the overall farm organism. Specialized protected cultivation is a llowed a higher level of nitrogen if they can prove by a nitrogen-balance during inspection that total i nput of lbs. N equals total output of lbs. N with a margin of 5%. Specialized protected cultivation under plastic or glass must meet the following requirements: Systematic year-round enrichment with CO 2 is not permitted. Targeted enrichment to optimize the CO 2 levels during deficit growing period s (e.g., autumn) is permitted. Energy saving techniques, such as the use of sp ecial heating systems (e.g ., ground or vegetation heating) must be introduced to the enterprise wherever possible. In greenhouses, steam sterilization/heat trea tment of the earth is not permitted. Bio-Solarization is permitted by exemption from Demeter USA as a mixture of Solarization (heat development by covering moistene d soil under a transparent film) and Bio-fumigation (adding fresh organic matter to the soil) with the aim of reduc ing nematode pressure and on-site composting of crop residues. Approval of the exemption is base d on satisfaction of the following conditions: - Immediate application of 500 and Biodynamic compost preparations after using this method - Only in combination with a crop rotation concept - May be applied for again at the ea rliest interval of three years. Specialized protected cultivation, must also meet the following requirements*: Biodiversity reserve on the farm area must reach at least 20% of the whole farm area. Biodiversity must be integrated into the green houses with flower strips and green manure. If using compost, buildup of damaging nutrient levels must be avoided. *For this requirement Demeter can grant existi ng licensees a transitional period until the certification cycle 2028. For operations in conversi on, this regulation will already apply from 2022 onward. B. Potting Soils and Growing Media Definitions: Potting soil - The mixtur e used to start seedlings Growing medium - The mixture in wh ich microgreens are grown to maturity Potting soil (a mixture used to star t seedlings) should, if possible, orig inate from the farm's own compost 32 with Biodynamic prep arations. Biodynamic compost must comprise at least 25% of the mix. The use of commercial potting mixes requires the appr oval of Demeter and thes e mixes must have the compost preparations 502-507 applie d to the potting mix prior to germ ination of the seeds. Options for introducing the preparations to th e potting mix include, but are not lim ited to: 1) inse rting the compost preparations to the potting mix at th e time of delivery (at least a month prior to use), 2) a tea made from prepared compost applied as a spray or drench, sti rred Barrel Compost or st irred Prepared-500 to the potting soil before seed germination. Potting mixes with less than 25% Biodynamic compos t may be used for certai n plants (like cactus, succulents, Mediterranean herbs, etc.) due to hort icultural propagation requirements, but must be approved by Demeter USA. Chicory roots should be forced in soil. If water tec hniques are used, the water must have no additives, which are prohibited in these standards. Water forced chicor y must be decl ared as such. Rock wool is not permitted. Potting soils and growing media may be sterilized with steam. To guid e microbial re-colonization, the Biodynamic compost preparations, co mpost tea, Preparation 500, or a compound prepar ation such as Barrel Compost or Pfeiffer Compost Starter, must be used following sterilization. C. Hydroponics and Container Growing Hydroponic growing, crops grown on inert substrates (e.g., scoria) an d container crops are not allowed. Soil-less and thin soil layer growing is not permit ted except for those cultures of sprouts, shoots, microgreens, aquatic plants, such as cress and certain ornamentals. In the latter case, Biodynamic preparations may be added to the water. D. Certified Sprouts and Microgreens For sprouts and microgreens to be Demeter Certified, th e seed must be from a ce rtified Biodynamic source. The growing medium for microgreens ideally originates from the farm . Commercial growing mediums must be approved for use by Demeter a nd be inoculated with Biodynamic Preparations 500 and 502-507. Greening of sprouts and microgr eens must occur by sunlight. The growth must take place in or on food grade surf aces that have no potent ial for contamination with prohibited materials. The room or area in which the sprouts are grown must not pose any contamination threat to the integrity of the product. 33 Water used must meet processing requirements for ch lorine (4ppm) and fluoride (4ppm) and be tested at regular intervals for E. coli and other disease organisms. Consult your local health department for further requirements in your locality. Demeter processing gu idelines apply. 34 III. STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS Light of Day Farm Traverse City, MI A. Treated Lumber A producer must not use lumber treated with arsenate or other prohibited materials- for new installations or replacement purposes- that comes in di rect contact with soil used in certified production or certified livestock. Harvested portion of crops may not touch treated lumber of existing installations. 35 IV. LIVESTOCK GUIDELINES Hawthorne Valley Farm Ghent, NY A. Conversions and Certification -Conditions allowi ng product to be marketed as Demeter certified Stocking rates [See Appendix C: \"Calculation of Stocking Rates\"] The stocking rate considers the maintena nce and development of soil fertility. The maximum stocking rate may not ex ceed .8 Livestock Units/ acre (. 56 manure units/acre) if feed is brought in. Note: This stocking rate might not be possible where climatic conditio ns do not permit it. In this situation, reducing the maximum allowed stocking rate may be necessary to maintain the health of the farm. Milk / Fiber Must be managed to De meter Standard for 12 months. Meat Managed to Demeter Standard from last 1/3 of gestation. Imported meat animals cannot be certified if not already Demeter certified Biodynamic or certified organic at a minimum. If certified organic when brought in, then must be managed to the Demeter Standard for a minimum of 1 year for cattle or \u00bd of life for hogs, goats, rabbits, and lambs. The ideal is for animals to spend their entire life on the farm. Meat poultry and fowl Day old chicks managed to standa rd until slaughte r. On farm hatching preferred. Eggs poultry and fowl Day old chicks. Certif ied organic pullets not over 18 weeks old. 36 C. Breeding stock: Beef and Dairy Imported mature (service or productive age) breedi ng stock, including bulls, rams, etc., from outside sources to the farm, is allowed up to a maximum of 10% of the herd per year. In a milking herd, the introduced cows must be from a cert ified Biodynamic or organic herd. Non-certified animals cannot be intr oduced to the milking herd until they have undergone 12 months of management according to this Sta ndard. Certified cows and heifers, or those which have been fed according to organic rules for 12 months, may be in troduced into the Biodyn amic herd while staying within the 10% per year brou ght-in stock limitation. An exemption allowing up to 40% imported anim als is permitted in the following situations: Rare/endangered breeds When a breed is changed When a new livestock specialization is developed When there is a documented need for an increase in herd size These imported animals must comply with the 12-month certified Biod ynamic feed requirement before their milk can be certified. Meat cannot be certif ied unless the animal was born on a Biodynamic or organic farm and under this type of management fr om the last 1/3 of gest ation (see above table). Mature breeding stock from conv entional sources cannot be sold as certified Biodynamic. D. Slaughter stock Except as specified otherwise, the animals must be born and raised on a Demeter certified Biodynamic farm as part of an indigenous he rd. Feeder stock from certified or ganic sources can qu alify as Demeter Biodynamic when feed according to the Biodynamic Farm Standard for 12 months for cattle and \u00bd the life of hogs, goats, rabbits, and lambs. Poultry must be raised from day old chicks or rais ed on-farm. Only piglets from management systems using floor litter an d with undocked tails may be brought in. Feeder stock from conventional sources cannot be sold as certified Biodynamic. E. Reproduction Natural insemination is strongly recommended. It is recommended that the farm keep its own bulls, rams, etc. Genetically engineered animals are not permitted. Embryo tran sfer is not permitted. F. Record Keepin g and Animal I.D. When practical all animals must be tagged or identified individually in some manner. It is recommended to have a herd book with a page for every reproduc tive age female. Records must be kept as follows. 37 Date and age acquired Source of animal Source and amount of brough t-in feed with certificates Health care measures taken Date of sale For dairy herds, records must be kept of somatic cell count and plate count. A DHIA record is suitable if available G. Feeding Complete self-sufficiency is to be aimed for as a matter of prin ciple. For Demeter Biodynamic certification, a minimum of 60% of the feed ration (on a dry matter basis) must come from on-farm production for ruminants, Equidae and Camelidae. If th e remaining 40% of the feed ration is imported a minimum of 10% must be Demeter ce rtified feed, or In Conversion to Biodynamic as described below, and the remaining 30% must be ce rtified organic at a minimum. When production meets the requirem ents of the NOP Organic regulation s, fodder produced on land In Conversion to Biodynamic can comprise up to 20 % of the annual fodder re quirement for roughage consuming animals and 10% for other animals. The minimum percentage of on-farm feed for pigs and poultry is 50%. The percentage of Biodynamic feed may be reduced to 50% for pigs and poultry with the approval of Demeter. Demeter Certified In Conversion to Biodynamic f eed and organic feed together may not exceed 50% DM of the annual feed ration. Table 2 : On-farm production and average annual ration for all animals in dry matter Animal species Min. Demeter share in the annual ratio* Max. organic share in the annual ratio Min. on farm production** Approval possible for less Biodynamic share in the to 50% Poultry 70% 30% 50% Yes, down to 50% *May contain \"In Conversion to Biodynamic\" feed wh en the feed meets organic requirements. If it is brought in, it can only be 20%, so that still 50 % is fully converted Demeter fodder. **Can be an average calculated for all animals of the farm *** Except for emergency cases with approval of Demeter. 38 With regard to grazing of land that is In Conversion to Biodynamic by Demeter certified livestock (i.e., when a Biodynamic farm brings a dditional land into conversion): Grazing of Demeter in conversion land by Demete r livestock is limited by the requirement that the land must meet the NOP organic Standard at a minimum. Grazing of land that is Demeter in conversion shou ld be restricted to young stock, dry cows and dry ewes wherever possible. Milking livestock, livestock within three months of finishing, and laying hens should be grazed on fully Demeter certified land wherever possible. Feeds from on-farm production which is in the first year of conversion to Demeter and organic can only be fed on one's own farm. In the first year of conversion this feed can be fed up to 100% of the ratio. In the following years or if a farm buys new land, up to 20% of this feed can be fed in the ration. Feeds from on farm production which is in the second year of conversion to Demeter and already organic can be fed on the own farm with out limit. It can be brought in up to 50%, so that at least 50% is fully certified Demeter fodder. See also table 2. In all cases, the corresponding effects on the ce rtification status of the end products must be taken into account. Mineral supplementation is not includ ed in the 50% brought-in limitation . No livestock, ruminant or non- ruminant, may be fed any meat prod ucts, including bone meal, or manure. Feeding milk, milk products, whey and eggs are permitted. The natural behavior of some species, such as poultry and swine, to forage in bedding or compost is acceptable. Ruminants must derive the roughage portion of feed from pa sture during the grazing season. \"Pasture\" is defined as growing plant material that the animal utilizes for nutrition and me dicine. If a livestock operation exists in a region where pasture production is not possible due to climatic conditions, it may not be possible to achieve Demeter certification. [S ee Section IV. B: \"Livesto ck Guidelines- Stocking Rates\"] Calves should be raised on the milk of the herd rather than on a milk replacer. Feed supplementation Fodder for ruminants must comprise of at least 75% roughage on a Dry Matter basis throughout the year. Supplementation with synthetic amino acids is not allowed. Good pasture, Biodynamic or organic feed, and outdoor access are the best a pproach and preclude the need for supplements. Vitamins approved by FDA may be allowed, but only in the forms permitted by the national organic regulation. Ideally, vitamin supplem entation would be temporary while an attempt is made to obtain better feedstuffs or improve environmental conditions . Consider as alternatives to synthetic vitamins pro-biotics, sprouted grains, dried herbs, choppe d root crops, chicory and other herbs seeded in pastures and hay fields. 39 Silage may not be treated with synthetic preservati ves but may be treated wi th organic molasses or whey. Antibiotics are not permitted in feed to any class of livestoc k. This includes the feeding of calves with milk from treated cows. H. Emergency Feed Protocol An emergency exists when weathe r or other circumstances beyond the grower's control affect the outcome of the crop. In such instan ces it may be possible to utilize certified organic feed beyond the current 20% of the ration allowed. De meter must be informed before any action is ta ken. A decision will be made on a case-by-case basis. Criteria used will be: Least amount of certified orga nic feed purchased as possible Fed for the shortest time possible To the livestock least likely to be co mpromised as to Biodynamic integrity Failure to secure approval before feeding em ergency feed may result in decertification. I. Housing an d Outside Access The behavioral and species- specific characteristics of farm animals are given respectful consideration when determining their housing and general living condi tions. Creating an environment that does not unnecessarily restrict their movements and innate be havior, including housing that allows the animals to move freely, is necessary. Totally slatted floors are not permitted. Floors must be stable and permit mobility. Livestock must have protection from excessive heat, dust, harmful gasses (such as ammonia) and excess humidity. Access to free range forage and the outdoors is re quired for all livestock, taking into consideration weather and health. Cattle, sheep, goats and horses These animals should have outside access all year ro und taking into account inclement weather, soil protection, and animal health. Th e animals must have access to pa sture during the grazing months, and during these months the majority of their feed must be fresh green material su ch as grazing pastures. Every animal needs a dry, soft, and insulated spot where it can lie down, rest, and stand up with adequate room to move without causing injury to it or to other animals. Calves are to be given contact with each other as soon as possible. They are to be reared in groups from the second week on if there are sufficient numbers of animals of the same age. Bo xes for calves are permitted only through the first week. 40 Pigs The pigs' rest area should include bedding. Sows sh ould be confined for the shortest period of time necessary for farrowing. Open sows, pregnant sows, and gilts should be kept in groups, with access to the outdoors. Manure handling Demeter certification requires that barnyard manure be carefully co llected, preserved and composted. Collection storage and containment of manure/urine must be done in a manner that does not lead to serious contamination of su rface and ground water. Livestock confinement and manure storage facilities are designed to prevent any direct or indirect flow of manure into waterway s or other surface waters. Storage facilities are not located in floodplains or areas with shallow groundwater tables and/or frequently moist or saturated soils. Clean water run-off from roofs, surface flows, and overflowing wa terers are diverted away from manure piles. There is a manure storage management plan in pl ace, taking into consid eration a 25 year 24-hour storm event. Sufficient manure stor age needs to be in place for 120 to 180 days of manure build- up, unless the operation has access to other environmentally acceptable methods to recycle manure nutrients (such as composting and/or biogas production). If manure and/or compos t piles are less than 50' upland from a waterway the piles need to be covered during rainy periods and/or a leachate containment system is in place. J. Management of poultry 1. For poultry production 50% of the feed ration mu st be on farm Demeter ce rtified feed. An exemption to allow the balance (50%) of the feed to come from certified organic producti on may be granted based on a documented search documenting Deme ter certified feed is not available. Concerning the stocking rate in relation to acre age of forage provided Appendix F - Calculation of Stocking Rate applies. A part of the diet must be given so that the animal s can forage for food. Fowl-like birds must have 20% of their fodder as whole grains in the litter or in th e open-air run. At least 5% must be in the litter. All poultry must get some grit. The animals must be able to drink from open water sources. Geese and turkey need green pasture during the vegetation phase. Demeter pasture geese need at least 35% of the feed dry matter as fresh pasture. Ducks must be able to dabble to take up roughage feed. Note : If operating a Demeter certified poultry operatio n take precaution with certified organic feed as DL Methionine is allowed under the NOP and not under the Biody namic Farm Standard. 41 All poultry species require management that allows their natural behavior. For the improvement of the social structure in poultry flocks, two rooste rs should be kept for every 100 layer hens. Sufficient feeding troughs and water-bowls must be provided. For poultry that normally perches, elevated resting places appropriate to the species must be provided. Sufficient sand-bath area and areas for sun-bathing mu st be supplied, and water poultry must have an adequate water supply. Ducks n eed to have water areas for sw imming; geese need a supply for plunging their heads and necks. Stables, buildings and housing must be constructe d and maintained in a wa y that meets the natural requirements of the birds. Sufficient daylight, good climatic conditions in the housing as well as low dust exposure are indispensable precondi tions for the health and welfare of poultry. Any mutilations of poultry such as beak cutting, trimming, or castration are excluded. The keeping of capons is excluded as well. 2. In their active phase during the day, a maximum of 4.4 layer hens, pa rent stock or 7.1 young layer hens or a maximum of 16 kg of live weight (max. 18 kg live weight in mobile coops) per m 2 can be housed. 3. Daylight can be extended by illu mination to a maximum of 16 hours a day. In the scratching area and in the area for feeding and water supply there must be sufficient daylight. For illumination only lamps without a stroboscopic effect are permitted. The aforementioned requirements are obligatory for all operat ions regardless of the number of poultry kept. The following requirements ar e not obligatory on farms with a total number less than 100 layer hens, 100 chickens fo r fattening, 20 turkeys, geese or ducks. 4. The housing may contain a maximum of 3,000 layer hens (preferably held in flocks of 1000 hens or less) or parent animals for layer hens or fattening an imals, 9,600 young layer hens and their brothers or young parent animals (separat ed into flocks of no greater than 4,800 birds ea ch), 10 flocks of 200 layer quails, max. 1,000 turkeys, 2,500 cockerels or guinea fowl, 1000 geese, 1000 ducks and 10 flocks of 500 quail for fattening. Exemptions may be approved by Demeter for existing buildings. All new facilities must comply with this standard. 5. Depending on the local climate of the country, it makes sense to offer stables with different climate areas (warm inner area and an oute r area called winter garden), with an adjacent poultry run. The adjacent poultry run can be fenced in but not roofed , with pop-holes to the pa sture, and covered with scratchable, humidity absorbing material. It is im portant to protect the pasture close to the housing from excess manure. 6. In housing with very cold climate areas it is po ssible to keep layer hens during the night in the warm climate area at a higher stocking rate. In the immediate poultry yard (winter garden) the ma ximum stocking rate per square meter is: 10 layer hens or parent animals or 16 young hens or 48 kg live weight of poultry for fattening. 42 In the inner part of the housing (warm climate area ), when the pop-holes to the outer part of the structure are open, a maximum of 8 layer hens or 13 young layer hens or 24 kg live weight of poultry for fattening per square meter can be kept. In this case the pop-holes must be self-opening (automated). Only under these preconditions is the winter garden estimated as stable area. 7. Stocking rate, number and widt h of pop-holes, equipment for fe eding and water supply, higher perches, and nests with litter or with a smooth inlay must be adjusted to the weight of the animals. During the active phase the anim als must not be hindered in thei r access to the different housing zones. The width of the pop-holes between the different zones/areas must be a minimum of 1 m per 150 layer hens, 250 young layer hens and 500 kg live weight of poultry for fattening. The height of the pop- holes is to be adjusted so that animals can walk th rough upright. Raised slatted floors must have pits for the manure. There must not be more than thr ee slatted floors one upon the other. At least one third of the accessible housed area must be covered with litter. The pasture area shall meet the natural requirement s of the respective poultry species and must be adequately covered to provide prot ection, for example with bushes, tr ees, or artificial protection. The minimal area required is: 4 m 2 for layer hens and breeding animals, 1 m2 per kg live weight of poultry for fattening, but at least 4 m2 per animal, 10 m2 per turkey, 5 m2 per duck. Geese need a minimum of 4 m2 pasture area per kg live weight, and a minimum of 15 m2 per goose and there is no limitation of fence distance to the stable. Pasture must not be further from the housing than 150 m for layer hens, animals for fattening and turkeys, and 80 m for duc ks. For geese the distances are unrestricted. 8. To minimize the risk of an infection with pathogens like Salmonella, Campylobacter, etc., during the rearing of young layer hens, a large open-air run can be an alternative to pasture access. 9. The breeding and hatching has to be included in the inspection process. Minimum age at slaughter for poultry Species Minimum age (days) Chickens 81 Peking ducks 49 Female Muscovy ducks 70 Male Muscovy ducks 84 Mallard ducks 92 Guinea fowl 94 Turkeys and roasting geese 140 43 K. Veterinary Treatment of Animals Herbal, homeopathic, or Anthroposophical treatm ents are to be given preference. Routine and preventative treatment with allopath ic medication is not allowed exce pt in the case of vaccinations required by law. Legal withholdin g times are to be doubled in case of required vaccinations. It is strongly recommended to use homeopathic nosodes in place of vaccines whenever applicable. Antibiotics are prohibited Any animal treated with antibiotics must be perm anently identified and removed from the certified herd. Meat and milk cannot be sold as certified though the animal may be used as breeder stock to produce certifiable progeny if antibiotics were not administered during the last third of pregnancy or during lactation. Prevention is the best approach to health problems with stress reduction playing a major role. Probiotics are acceptable if documented to be a material in co mpliance with national organic regulations, GMO-free and not produced on GMO substrate. Hormonal treatment The use of hormonal treatments to control estrus, in crease production, or for any other reason is not permitted except that oxytocin can be used in post-p arturition therapeutic applications such as retained placenta. Exact records must be kept of all treatments and made available to the Demeter. Use of prohibited in ternal parasiticides The use of prohibited internal parasiticides is no t permitted in slaughter an imals, but NOP permitted parasiticides are permitted in dairy and breeder an imal emergencies. Parasitical treatment must be done in compliance with the National Organic Program at a minimum. Emergencies are to be minimized using preventative alternatives such as quarantine and fecal exams for all incoming stock, adequate pasture rotation and good pasture manage ment, maintenance of clea n facilities, periodic fecal exams, the culling of seriously infested animals, vector and intermediate host control, biological control methods, and maintenance of dust wallows for poultry. External parasites Primary control of external parasites needs to be ba sed on modifying the livesto ck living situation in a manner that inhibits the parasites' presence and reproduction (i.e., sa nitation, repelling agents, release of predators, etc.). In extrem e cases natural pyrethrum may be used in a dilute form in barns and loading areas. It may not be used directly on li vestock. Concentrated na tural pyrethrum may not be used. Note : With the exception of whole fl ower natural pyrethrum, only ex tracted pyrethrum products with approved ingredients may be used. Mutilation Dehorning of animals and dehorned animals are not permitted to pr oduce Demeter certified livestock products. In well justified cases, an exemption ma y be approved but must be reviewed annually. Species of ruminants polled by proh ibited forms of genetic engineer ing cannot be used to produce 44 Biodynamic milk, meat, and fiber. Historic, land ra ce and heritage breeds of naturally polled ruminants and genetically hornless breed, which no longer exist in horned form (c ompare to the following positive list) are permitted for the production of meat on ly. Those breeds may be us ed for the displacement crossing. Aberdeen Angus Galloway (This list is not exhaustive, further breeds can be requested for ad dition by Demeter.) Genetically hornless breeds in any form and displacement crossing eith er with genetically hornless breeds nor with any other form of hornless bred breeds or crossbreeds in th e production of Demeter milk is prohibited. If an enterprise willing to convert has genetically hornless breeds, the enterprise must begin immediately after the start of the conversion period with displacement crossing of the hornless genetics. During the process of transition, hornless cattle are tole rated on the enterprise, if progress towards horned cattle ca n be shown during insp ection. Within meat cattle, the historic, land race and heritage polled breed s mentioned above can be used for displacement crossing. Tail docking of lambs is not to be carried out systematically. An exemptio n to dock tails is possible if the intention is to improve health, welfare, or hygiene of the sheep. Qualified personnel must carry tail docking out at the most appropriate age and any suffering of the animals must be reduced to a minimum. Consult Demeter for approval prior to dehorn ing or tail docking in all instances. De-beaking of poultry is forbidden as is tooth cutting and tail cutting of piglets. Nose rings or hog rings that prevent pigs from rooting are forbidden. It is permitted to castrate calves and piglets to im prove the health, welfare, or hygiene of the animals. Immuno-castration is not allowed in pigs. Competen t personnel must carry the operation out at the most appropriate age and any suffering of th e animals must be reduced to a minimum. L. Guest Animals Animals of conventional or organic origin not in the possession of the certified farm can be kept on Demeter certified pastures for grazing provided ther e are no Demeter certified animals present at the same time or in Demeter stables under unl ess the following conditions are applied: A written agreement between the owner of the animals and the farm must be in place. All animals must be clearly identifiable by earmarks or comparable marking. All animals must be kept according to this standard concerning the management, medicinal treatment and feeding. If guest animals fulfil these requ irements, they can be integrated in fodder-manure-balance of the certified farm. If guest animals do not fulfill the above-mentioned requirements and are fed organic or non-GMO conventional fodder the followi ng conditions are required: 45 A written agreement between the owner of the animals and the farm must be in place. Animals must be clearly separate d in stables and on pastures. The feeding of the animals must be clearly separated. If guest animals are kept under separate condit ions, they can be integrated in fodder-manure- balance on the basis of a fodder-manure-cooperat ion only if they are kept at least organic. In both cases an exemptio n is required from Demeter. The request for the exemption must have a clear description of the circumstances especi ally regarding sepa ration measures. 46 V. MUSHROOMS A. Origin of spores, cultures, and mycelium It is recommended that a farmer's own mycelium/i noculum material will be developed according to these standards and that this will take over as the starting culture. Spawn may be brought in from organic sources or derived from the wild. When spawn is produced on the Demeter farm the ingredients of agricultural/forestry origin must be Demeter certified, if available. B. Origin of growing substrate Mushroom substrate must consist of materials derived from organi c farming or those permitted for use in organic farming, such as mineral products . Farmyard manure from or ganic farms containing uncertified straw residues and uncertified agricultur al materials, for example green waste and manures from extensive animal husbandry, may be used as s ubstrate provided they have been composted on an organic or Biodynamic holding for at least 6 months prior to use as mushroom compost. At the start of this period Biodynamic compost prep arations must have been added. Straw harvested in the second year of conv ersion may be used in the substrate. In the case of imported wood, for example oak logs (f or shitake), chippings or sawdust, no insecticidal treatments may be utilized since original felling. Peat as a covering material is permitted in mushro om cultures. Other permitte d inputs are listed in the appendices. C. Biodynamic measures The compost preparations must be introduced into the substrate at an appropriate stage prior to inoculation. If sterilization is used, the sets of co mpost preparations should be applied after this has occurred and before subsequent in cubation. The horn manure (500) preparation must be applied at least once per crop cycle, after the substrate has been inoculated. The horn silica (501) preparation must be applied at least once per crop cycle. Timing work activities using astronomic rhythms is encouraged. D. Illumination Mushroom species that are known to react to light, fo r example Shitake, are to be cultivated with light. An exemption may be given by Demeter if climate requires insulated growing sheds. 47 E. Health of crop Prevention is the overriding principle for maintain ing the health of the cultures through hygiene, climate control, mechanical pest repellents and the Biodynamic preparations. Salt may be used to control fungal diseases. Other prod ucts for plant pest and disease co ntrol are listed in the appendices F. Cleaning and disinfection of growing sheds For cleaning mushroom growing rooms and sheds, phy sical procedures must be used, together with water or steam. Permitted detergents , disinfectants, and other sanitizers are listed in part A section 8 of the processing standards. They must be DDAC/BAC free. Equipment may be sterilized with 70% alcohol or wi th agents based on peracetic acid. Formaldehyde must not be used. After cleaning all interior space, surfaces must be rinsed with potable water. This is not required only where the mushroom substrate is introduced afte r complete biodegradation of the cleaning / sterilizing agent. G. Recycling of sp ent mushroom compost There must be a plan for the routine re cycling of all spent mushroom compost . Licensees are encouraged to find Biodynamic operations that can benefit from this material. 48 VI. POST-HARVEST HANDLING & PROCESSING A. Storage and Processing Storage facilities and containers must be clean and adequately protected fr om insect or pest infestation. Post-harvest treatment with synthetic chemicals is prohibited. Shipping arrangements must guard against contamination of produce from other farms and from exposure to prohibited materials that could arise while certified product is in transit. The Demeter Biodynamic Processing Standard applies to all on-farm and farm-contracted processing. B. Labeling and Packaging Product labeling must be approved by Demeter. If changes are made to the ingredients, the label and the Individual Product Profile needs to be re-submitted for approval. Chan ging ingredients without approval is prohibited. Packaging and acco mpanying documents must be labeled in such a way that the product can be traced back to the farm. Demeter may require approv al of promotional materials before publication. Please see the Demeter Labeling Standard for more information. 49 C. On-Farm Processing, Off-Farm Gr ower-Contracted Proc essing, and Packing Processing done on-farm or by a co ntracted processor must meet the Biodynamic Processing Standard . This includes slaughter of livestock, cleaning and ba gging, canning, freezing, drying, roasting, fermenting, culturing, baking, etc. D. Water Quality Tailing water (water that drips off pr oduct after rinsing), or water used as an ingredient cannot exceed 4 ppm chlorine. Water used needs to meet EPA and state safe drinking water standards. 50 VII. ADMINISTRATION The Biodynamic Farm Standard applies to the certification of farms and ranches for the purpose of allowing their farms and ranches and resultin g agricultural products to carry the Demeter certification marks \"Biodynamic\u00ae\" and \"Demeter\u00ae\" and the related logos using these mark s. Processed products must meet the Biodynamic Processing Standard to be referenced as such. These ar e registered certification marks that are vigorously protecte d from misuse by non-certified operators. The Demeter Biodynamic Farm and Processing Standards meet the minimum requirements set by Biodynamic Federation - Demeter In ternational. These base standard s form a common legal foundation and agricultural framework for Demeter Biodynamic\u00ae practice worldwide. The responsibility for adherence lies with each grower and processor. A. Determining What Can Be Certified Since Biodynamic farming principally vi ews the farm as a self-contained organism, only an entire farm will be considered for certification. Indi vidual fields or crops cannot be cert ified. More than one farm may be counted as a single certificatio n unit under certain conditions. Each farm is considered a unique individuality- with its own beginnin g point and inherited environmental and social conditions. What is cr itical is that a farm evolves towa rds its maximum pote ntial as a self- contained individuality. Some app licants' farms may enter this prog ram very close to this maximum potential. Others will require an evolution towards it. While Demeter is here to provide assurance that the Standards are met, it is also here to nurture farmers and their farms towards this ideal. B. Prerequisites The land to be certified must meet the National Organic Program (NOP) stan dard as a base and be managed to the Biodynamic Farm Standard for one year. The one-year conversion to Demeter certification begins with the first Biodynamic preparation application (500, 501 or 502-507 in 51 combination) and may occur concurrently with the fi nal NOP transition year or an additional year after the NOP standard has been met. No prohibited chemicals may have b een applied for a full 36 months. Demeter may request residue tests for prohibited materials. Transition example of a conventional farm: June 1, 2020 Prohibited herbicide applied June 2, 2021 12 months - 1st year transition ends (All Biodynamic preparations may be applied, and farm is managed to the Biodynamic Farm Standard ) June 2, 2022 24 months - 2nd year transition ends (All Biodynamic preparations may be applied, and farm is managed to the Biodynamic Farm Standard ) June 2, 2023 36 months - Crop harvested on or after th is date is eligible for Biodynamic certification (The first Biodynamic preparation must be applied one year prior to certification, Biodynamic preparations 500-507 must be applied within last year of transition, and farm must be managed to the Biodynamic Farm Standard for one full year) Conversion example of a farm that meets NOP organic requirements: On or before June 1, 2022 Entire farm meets NOP organic requirements June 1, 2022 to June 2, 2023 First Biodynamic preparation app lied on June 1, all remaining Biodynamic preparations applied within first year to production areas, and entire farm is managed to the Biodynamic Farm Standard June 2, 2023 12 months - crop harvested on or after th is date is eligible for Demeter Biodynamic certification Any processing and/or pack aging facilities on the farm or contract ed by the grower must be included in the farm certification process, and an additional questionnaire and inspection of the facilities is required. C. Steps to certification 1. Submit comple ted Application A producer planning the transition of a farm from co nventional or conversion of organic to Biodynamic should start the process by requesting an applicatio n from the Demeter office. The application includes the initial application, which asks for the past management of the land to be certified and the proposed plan to move towards Demeter certification. The application documents the current situation of the farm and the plan to meet the Biodynamic Farm Standard . It is recommended, but not required, that new applications be su bmitted prior to April 1 so that the farm inspection can be planned and conducted during the growing season. 52 2. Arrange a farm visit After Demeter receives the completed application an d appropriate fees, the application is reviewed and assigned to an inspector who w ill contact the applicant to arrange a farm visit. During the visit, the information entered on the applicatio n will be verified and clarified. 3. Follow up on th e Findings Report The Inspector's report and the grow er's application will be reviewed by Demeter for compliance with the Biodynamic Farm Standard and Demeter will establish any requirements and recommendations in a Findings Report. The Demeter office will then noti fy the applicant of the ce rtification decision and forward the Findings Report if th ere are suggested actions and/or requirements. The applicant is required to acknowledge the Findings Report and re solve any requirements. If certification is not granted, an explanation will be provided. A licensee wishing to amend the scop e of an existing certification sh ould write to the Demeter office giving details in support of the re quest. The Demeter office will decide what additional information is needed, if any. A revisit to the facility may be required. D. In Transition and In Conversion timeline A farm may be considered \"in transition to Biodynamic\" under the following circumstances: 1) The farm has submitted an application. 2) A Demeter inspector has been to the property. 3) Demeter has reviewed the inspection report and determines that certification could be obtained within a three-year period. 4) The farm has resolved any Findings Repo rt requirements identified by Demeter 5) There is a projected date of certification (month/year). A farm may refer to itself as \"in transition to Biod ynamic\" in its marketing materials, website, and other ways that are not product labeling or at the point of sale to the consumer. If the farm is not already NOP certified, then De meter will conduct yearly inspections up to the three- year date of certification to ascertain that the Biodynamic Farm Standard is being upheld. The final Biodynamic certification must take place within 3 years and 3 months of the initial inspection. If all the above requirements are met and a farm meets NOP organic requirements, Demeter will issue a certificate indicating that a farm is \"Certified In Conversion to Biodynamic\" and the farm can represent itself in this manner in literature, websit e, and other marketing material. Farm crops, fibers, and livestock may be labeled as \"In Conversion to Biodynamic\u00ae\" and included in Demeter certified processed products making an \"In Conversion to Biodynamic\u00ae\" or \"Made with In Conversion to Biodynamic\u00ae\" label claim. See the Biodynamic Labeling Standard . If a farm already meets NOP organic requirements, the full Demeter Biodynamic certification should take place one year from the initial Biodynamic prepar ation application, with an allowance of 3 months 53 in addition to the year. E. Exemptions to whole-farm certification If any crops or land be longing economically to a farm ca nnot be farmed according to the Biodynamic Farm Standard because of serious technical considerations, then exceptions of particular fields, animals or products need the written consent of Demeter. Su ch not-fully-converted products must be clearly separated from the converted fields, animals, or pro ducts, and no interchange sh ould be possible. Such crops, animals and products must be specifically indicated on the applic ation for certification and specified on the certificate. They must be clearly labeled and easily distinguished in farm sales, whether direct or through distributors. Parallel production is not possible under the same farm identity. Animals for home consumptio n can be taken out of certification wi thout violating the conversion of the whole farm but cannot be marketed as Demeter or Biodynamic. F. Newly Acquired Property When a Demeter certified Biodynamic farm leas es or purchases land that has been managed conventionally or organically, these acres must also be converted. Existing farm certification is not forfeited, but crops from the transiti onal areas are to be of a different variety, demonstrably separated in storage, and designated under another name and sold as non-certified. G. Public Disclosure Upon legitimate request, De meter will make available to the public the certificat ion classification and the number of years certified. If a Demeter member wa nts this information kept confidential, the member must inform the Demeter office. Evaluation reports are not made available except to other certifying agencies at the request of the certified party. A certified farm sh ould have available for their customers a copy of their current Certificate. H. Annual Renewal of Certification Following the first year's certificatio n, Demeter sends out a Renewal Pack et annually. A farm must have its certification renewed every year. Certification is co ntingent upon the receipt of a fully filled-out Renewal Packet and the completion of a sati sfactory on-site farm evaluation co nducted during the growing season. Farmers must resolve any issues found to be out-of-compliance. The Renewal Packet includes a declaration by the farmer , given in good faith and to the best of his/her knowledge, concerning the comple teness and correctness of information supplied. Any anticipated changes in agricultural management or any measures that could have a significant influence on the farm must be discussed with Demeter. 54 Note : Demeter may conduct random unannounced visi ts. We acknowledge that this may inte rfere with planned farm activities, and we will do our best to limit the interference. Licensees are requested to cooperate to the fullest extent possible. I. Revisions to Guid elines and Standards Demeter periodically revisits its Standards and makes re visions. Licensees receive notice of all revisions and have one year to fully implement the changes fr om the time of notice. Inspectors and Demeter reviewers will verify that each licensee has made th e needed adjustments. Licensees are responsible for compliance. J. Recordkeeping Adequate records must be kept conc erning all aspects of farm operations for five years and records must be readily auditable. All records must be made available to Demeter upon request. Example Records Field records All materials applied, date an d rate of application, name and source of all inputs, acreage, and type of crops to which inputs are applied. GMO status of seeds, inoculants, and plant protection materials. Labels or other documentation showing potting soils and manure. Harvest records Records of the harvest, segregation, and sale of non-certifie d buffer crops, in transition crops, and In Conv ersion crops. It is advisable to retain documents to support this. Records of all harvested crops, bin storage location, if applicable , sales records. Sales records should have a lot number such as a date or other code and be traceable to the field of origin. Equipment cleaning records, if applicable Livestock Date purchased, source, weight , and age at acquisition. Amount of feed and supplementation purchase d including certificates and feed tags Medications: vaccinations, illness/injury treatments including medicament labels Production records Date, ID number and certification status at time of slaughter or sale of animals Feed emergency documentation Inputs Manure - type, amount, source, quality Other fertility - type, brand name, amount, source, ingredients Seed - type, amount, source, classification as organic, Biodynamic, conventional, treated, untreated, GMO status Plant protection materials, GM O status. Maintain all labels for the annual visit. General Complaint log to register any complain ts against the certified product or production. 55 K. Contract and Use of Certification Marks Only the execution of a written co ntract between Demeter and the applicant and issuance of a Farm Certificate confers the license to use the Demeter certification marks \"Demeter\u00ae\" and \"Biodynamic\u00ae\". Please see the Demeter Labeling Standards for more information. Neither the contract nor the Certificate confers labe ling rights upon packagers and processors to whom certified product is sold. If a packager or processo r intends to sell a Demeter certified product they must apply independently to De meter for a license. 56 Appendix A: COMPOSITION OF VARIOUS MANURES Figures presented as fresh manures.

The maximum amount of nitrogen and phosphorus that may be supplied by way of the fertilization used may not exceed the amount that would be produced by those animals that the farm could support from its own fodder production. Manure Units -measurements of fert ility potential - are used to determine stocking rates for the various animal types. One manure unit is equivalent to 176 lbs. of N an d 154 lbs. of P 205. The stocking rate is calculated utilizing Livestock Un its (LU) and the corresponding annual production of Manure Units (MU), associated with various animals. One LU excretes .7 MU annually. The maximum stocking rate may not exceed 0.8 Livestock Units/ Acre (.56 manure units/acre) if fe ed is imported. This is the equivalent of 100-lb s/ acre of applied N an d 87-lb/ acre applied P 205. Note that this stocking rate might not be possible in all climates. The maximum al lowed may need to be reduc ed if conditions require it in order to maintain the health of the farm. Stocking Rate: Animal type LU/animal Acres/animal Animals/acre Breeding bulls 1.2 1.50 .66 Cows 1 1.25 .80 Cattle over 2 years old 1 1.25 .80 Cattle 1-2 years old 0.7 .87 1.14 Calves 0.3 .38 2.60 Sheep and goats up to 1 year old 0.02 .03 40.0 Sheep and goats over 1 year old 0.1 .13 8.0 Horses under 3 years old and young horses 0.7 .87 1.14 Horses, 3 years and older ponies and small breeds 1.1 1.42 .7 Pigs for meat production (45-110 lb.) 0.06 .08 13.0 Pigs for meat production over 110 lb. 0.16 .20 5.0 Breeding boars 0.3 .3 9 2.6 Breeding sows (including piglets to 45 lb.) 0.55 .6 7 1.5 Breeding sows without piglets 0.3 .38 2.6 Piglets 0.02 .03 40.0 Laying hens (without replacement stock) 0.0071 .009 112.6 Pullets 0.0036 .004 222.0 Table .004 222.0 65 Appendix G: FERTILITY CALCULATION WORKSH EET FOR IMPORTED AND APPLIED MATERIALS Imported Nitrogen and Phosphorous The Biodynamic Farm Standard allows for a maximum of 36 lbs. N/ac re and 31 lbs. P/acre averaged over the crop rotation/ cultivated area to be imported annually. Farm acreage that does not apply to the calculation is acreage that is permanently set aside as biodiversity reserve such as wild areas, permanent insectaries etc. Acreage that is in the rotation but fallow in a given year does apply as does pasture being grazed or hayed. An annually reviewed exception to th is rule, based on documented need , allows for 86 lbs. N/acre and 75 lbs. P/acre of cultivated area to be imported annua lly. Examples of need include newly established farms with inherently low fertility soils, new perennial planti ngs that require higher N levels to get established etc. If a horticulture system is one for which it can be documented that a minimum of 100 lbs. N/acre is exported in the form of the crop leaving the farming system as harvested commodity, a farm may import a maximum of 150 lbs. N/acre and 125 lbs. P/acre. Since this amount is equal to the maximum applied/acre there is no need to do a sepa rate calculation for the imported amounts. Example calculation: A 300-acre farm with 100 acres in its crop rotation in a given year imports 50 tons of approved cow manure for compost and 30 gallo ns of approved fish. a) Cow manure analysis 1-1-1 ( dry matter basis) 100,000 lbs. x 1% N(.01) = 1000 lbs. N imported 100,000 lbs. x 1% P(.01) = 1000 lbs. P imported b) Liquid fish analysis 5-1-1 1 gallon = 8 lbs. 50 gallons = 400 lbs. 400 lbs. x 5% N(.05)= 20 lbs. N imported 400 lbs. x 1% N(.01)= 4 lbs. P imported Imported Nitrogen = 1,020 lbs. (1000 lbs. manure, 20 lbs. fish). 1020 lbs. divided by 100 acres = 10.2 lbs. N/acre imported. Compliant with import fertili ty limit of 36lbs N/acre. Imported Phosphorous = 1,004 lbs. (1000 lbs. manure, 4 lbs. fish). 1,004 lbs. divided by 100 acres= 10.05 lbs. P/acre imported. Compliant with imported fertility limit of 31 lbs. P/acre. 66 Appendix G: FERTILITY CALCULATION WORKSHEET FOR IMPORTED AND APPLIED MATERIALS (cont.) Applied Nitrogen and Phosphorous The Biodynamic Farm Standard allows a maximum application of 100 lb s. of Nitrogen/acre and 87 lbs. of Phosphorous (P 205)/acre averaged annually over the farm 's crop rotation/cultivated area. Farm acreage that does not apply to the calculat ion is acreage that is permanently set aside as biodiversity reserve such as wild areas, permanent in sectaries etc. Acreage that is in the rotation but fallow in a given year does apply as do es pasture being grazed or hayed. An exception to this rule is given when a horticul tural cropping system is one for which it can be documented that a minimum of 100 lbs. N/acre is expo rted in the form of the crop leaving the farming system as harvested commodity. With such documentation a farm may apply a maximum of 150 lbs. N/acre and 125 lbs. P 205/acre annually. Green manures produced and in corporated on farm are excluded from the calculation. Example: Applied Fertility Calculation The same 300-acre farm with 100 ac res in its crop rotation importing fertility calculated as above in addition to supporting 30 cows on farm. a) The imported cattle manure (dry matter basis) and fish as imported above = 10.2 lbs. N/acre and 10.5 lbs. P/acre. b) 30 cows = 30 Livestock Unit s (LU) [per Appendix F of Biodynamic Farm Standard: 1 LU = .7 Manure Units (MU). 1 MU = 176 lbs. N and 154 lbs. P] 1. 30 LU x .7 = 21 MU 2. 21 MU x 176 lbs. N= 3,696 lbs. N applied by 30 cows. Divided by 100 acres= 36.96 lbs. N/acre applied. 3. 21 MU x 154 lbs. = 3,234 lbs. P applied by 30 cows. Divided by 100 acres= 32.34 lbs. P/acre applied. Total applied Nitrogen = 10.2 lbs./acre (imported manure) + 36.96 lbs./acre (30 Manure Units on farm) = 47.16 lbs. N/acre applied Compliant with total applied limit of 100 lbs. N/acre. Total Applied Phosphorous = 10.5 lbs./acre (imported manure) + 32.34 lbs. P/acre (30 Manure Units on farm) = 42.84 lbs. P/acre Compliant with total applied limit of 87 lbs. P/acre. 67 Appendix H: GMO CROPS OF CONCERN If any of the crops below are grown to be Demeter certified assess whether or not there is significant production of genetically engineered varieties of the crops within the following distances: Alfalfa- 2 miles Canola - 2 miles Corn - 3 miles Cotton - 2 miles Papaya- 2 miles Rice- 500 feet Soybean- 500 feet Beets- 5 miles Zucchini/ yellow crook neck squash- 2 miles Please note that this information will be used to assess whether or not testing is necessary based on review of the situation at hand. Some of the crops listed above exist in genetically engineered form but are not grown extensively (such as zucchini and yellow crook neck squash). Some, such as alfalfa, are not currently grown extensively but could be in th e future. Some, such as canola, corn, cotton, and soybean, are grown extensively. For farms located in regions where there is extensive production of genetically engineered varieties of crops, the po tential for contamination needs to be examined closely. 68 Appendix I: EXEMPTION FOR USE Certain pest control materials allo wed/regulated in both certified or ganic and Biodynamic\u00ae production have been shown to have a negative effect on th e ecological balance of a farming system such as inhibiting pollinators and other beneficial organisms. The negative effect is either due to the fact that the material is broad spectrum (killing both the pest species and beneficial species) or applications negatively affect specific importan t beneficial populations such as bees and pollinators. Examples of such materials include copper sulfate, pyrethrum, di atomaceous earth, insecticidal soap, Spinosad and some other broad-spectrum materials allowed in NOP organic production, such as ryania and sabadilla are prohibited in Demeter Bi odynamic production and no exemptio n is available for their use. In addition to current Demeter and NOP Standards concerning the importation and usage of pesticide materials, Demeter USA requires an exemption to use copper sulfate, pyrethrum, diatomaceous earth, insecticidal soap, Spinosad and Beauveria ba ssiana with the following applied criteria. 1) Usage of material must be done at times wh en there is the least likelihood of contact with beneficial organisms. 2) Broadcast blanket applications should be avoided and instead control should be based on spot spraying and the use of traps/attracta nts to lure the pest to the pesticide. 3) Prevention and management strategies noted in the Biodynamic Farm Standard sections on pest control have been implemented. This exemption will be addressed based on the A nnual Update and annual review of all materials proposed in crop production. Adherence to this pl an is verified via the annual farm visit. Thus, exemption approval is on an annual basis, and it is not necessary to seek exemption approval prior to each use. 69 Appendix J: Biodynamic Preparations Defined 500 Sheath Raw cow horn from bovine species. Material Fresh cow manure from bovine species. From a co w that resides on a farm u sing Biodynamic or Organic practices at a minimum. Processing Manure packed into th e horn as tightly as possible.

Finished Product Stored in a sunny location 502 Sheath Stag Bladder (male deer or elk species) Material Yarrow flowers, Achillea millefolium. From a farm using Biodynamic, Organic prac tices or wild crafted. Processing Pick the fresh inflorescences. If fresh is unava ilable, use dried flowers moistened w/juice or infusion of yarrow leaves. Take yarrow, and compressing it so mewhat, take the bladder and enclose the yarrow- substance in this as best you can, th en tie the whole thing shut. Hang it up outside in th e sunniest spot you can find, and let it stay there through the duration of the entire summer. Burial When autumn comes, then take it down and put it in the ground - not too deeply (adjust for local conditions) - and let it spend the winter there. You thus have yarrow flowers enclosed for a full year within the bladder partly above ground and partly below ground. Finished Product When digging up take caution to only harvest the yarrow blossoms that have spent a year in the bladder. Avoid any surrounding material.
