Regular exercise is associated with a slower progression or reduced risk of age-related health conditions as well as overall health improvements in older age, according to a new study appearing in JAMA's Archives of Internal Medicine. Exercise has been associated with beneficial effects on diabetes, obesity, arthritis, falls and fractures, heart disease, cancer, and lung disease, write Marco Pahor, M.D. and Jeff Williamson, M.D., M.H.S., from the University of Florida. These specific health conditions can impair the independence, everyday functioning and task activities of older adults. \"Regular physical activity has been associated with greater longevity as well as reduced risk of physical disability and dependence,\" the authors comment. The new research examines important aging-related outcomes for which exercise has a relevant impact. Health benefits of exercise include: Weight management. Increased energy levels. Improved mood. Chronic disease prevention. Moderate or vigorous physical exercise also appears to be linked to a lowered risk of developing cognitive impairment in older adults. Activities such as aerobic exercise, balance and strength training, and physical activities like dancing can help to prevent or delay cognitive function and are recommended. ...

Qi Sun, M.D., and colleagues assessed 13,535 study participants, at an average age of 60. Those who had increased levels of exercise were less likely to have physical or cognitive impairments, heart surgery or chronic diseases. \"Since the American population is aging rapidly and nearly a quarter of Americans do not engage in any leisure-time activity, our findings appear to support federal guidelines regarding physical activity to promote health among older people,\" the authors write in the report, which appears in JAMA's Archives of Internal Medicine. Exercise has the potential to enhance overall health and well-being with aging. Older adults need at least: 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 1 hour and 15 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week and muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Or an equivalent mix of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. More health benefits can be gained by increasing exercise up to or beyond 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity activity or 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity. Once- or twice-weekly resistance training, such as balance and tone training, can also improve attention and conflict resolution skills among older women. Resistance training can strengthen mental focus as well as improve muscular function.

There can be countless trips to the doctor or chiropractor, pain medications and the difficulty of making it through the day while enduring pain. Massage therapy can relieve the pain of arthritis, muscle strain, tendonitis, and other acute and chronic pain conditions. A recent survey by the American Hospital Association shows that nearly 82 percent of hospitals that offer some form of complementary or alternative care use massage therapy, with 70 percent using massage for pain management and pain relief. More people than ever are seeking massage to manage and relieve pain. A recent AMTA consumer survey shows that nearly half, 47 percent, of those polled have had a massage specifically for pain relief. Massage therapy can: Be more effective for chronic back pain than standard therapies. Promote relaxation and alleviate the perception of pain. Reduce headaches better than cold pack treatments. Stimulate the brain to produce endorphins. Improve confidence by encouraging individuals to effectively cope with pain. Consumers have long suspected that massage helps promote a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Consumers aren't the only people recognizing the benefits of massage. Physicians and other health care providers are increasingly recommending massage therapy to their patients as a supplement to conventional health care.

In a recent survey of American adults, the association found that 39 percent said they believed they had optimal heart health. Over 50 percent said that they had been informed by a health practitioner that they had a risk factor for heart disease and needed to make lifestyle changes to improve their health. Often, individuals don't associate unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as physical inactivity and insufficient diet, with cardiovascular health. Improvements in the areas defined by the seven factors and behaviors can affect ideal cardiovascular health, improving quality of life and life span. The association categorizes cardiovascular health as poor, intermediate or ideal, depending on where individuals are in each of the seven areas. The seven measures to define heart health are: Never smoked or quit more than one year ago. Body mass index less than 25. Exercise of at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity each week. A healthy diet that includes more fruits and vegetables and reduced calorie intake. Total cholesterol less than 200. Blood pressure below 120/80. Fasting blood glucose less than 100. By following these measures, everyone is a candidate to advance at least one stage forward in heart health, from poor to intermediate or intermediate to ideal.

Women and men's brains handle stress differently; altering the way each gender may experience these diseases, according to new research from Brigham and Women's Hospital. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, researchers looked at the brain activity of healthy men and women while they viewed stressful images. Women underwent the scanning twice, once during the beginning of the menstrual cycle and once during ovulation, and their results were then compared to the men's results. Brain activity in response to stress was similar in men and women at the beginning of the women's menstrual cycle. However, the response to stress was much higher in men than women during ovulation. \"We found that women have a natural hormonal capacity to regulate the stress response in the brain that differs from men,\" says lead study author Jill Goldstein, PhD. \"Diseases that are affected by stress often present differently in men and women,\" says Goldstein. \"Understanding gender differences in stress regulation can provide clues to understanding the nature of these chronic health disorders and can provide the basis for sex-specific treatments for these diseases.\" Stress symptoms may include: Concentration difficulties. Moodiness. Irritability. Generalized aches and pains. Fatigue.

New research from Brigham and Women's Hospital has produced findings indicating how short- and long-term sleep loss combine with the body's natural 24-hour internal clock (circadian) rhythm to affect how well an individual performs. Even minimal sleep loss can affect mental performance. The researchers found that chronic sleep loss caused performance to deteriorate at a faster rate for each consecutive hour spent awake, particularly during work extended into late night hours. Individuals with chronic sleep loss have reaction times about 10 times slower with increased risk of errors and accidents. \"Chronic sleep loss renders tasks such as driving or performing surgery dangerous, especially during the hours ordinarily reserved for sleep,\" says Dr. Charles Czeisler, study co-author. Individuals can experience chronic sleep loss due to insomnia, narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome, and other common sleep disorders. Sleep disorder symptoms may include: Difficulty falling or staying asleep. Daytime fatigue. Inability to wake up and fall asleep at regular times. Falling asleep spontaneously. Disturbed sleep patterns can also be caused by medication, stress, cardiovascular conditions, digestive disorders, hormonal imbalances, neurological disorders, and sciatica. ...

Cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes--chronic diseases that together account for most deaths--are largely preventable. \"An impressive body of research has implicated lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical activity, diet, and body weight in the causes of these diseases,\" the authors write. Earl Ford, M.D., of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, and colleagues assessed data from 23,513 adults age 35 to 65. Participants completed an assessment of their body weight and height, an interview that included questions about diseases, a questionnaire on lifestyle habits, and a dietary questionnaire. Responses were assessed for adherence to four healthy lifestyle factors: Never smoking, having a body mass index lower than 30, exercising for at least three and a half hours per week and following healthy dietary principles. Most participants had one to three of these health factors. Over eight years of follow-up, 2,006 participants developed new cases of diabetes, heart attack, stroke, or cancer. Individuals with healthier lifestyle factors were less likely to develop chronic diseases. Participants who had all four factors at the beginning of the study had a 78 percent lower risk of developing any of the chronic diseases. In addition to healthy lifestyle habits, traditional Chinese medicine therapies such as acupuncture and massage can aid in disease prevention by: Promoting natural healing. Treating underlying energy imbalances. Enhancing immunity by stimulating lymph flow. Reducing stress and fatigue. Improving circulation.

Mild cognitive impairment can occur with age and dementia, affecting normal thinking, learning and memory. Each year, 10 to 15 percent of individuals with mild cognitive impairment develop dementia, compared to 1 to 2 percent of the general population. Previous studies have indicated that exercise may improve cognitive abilities. Exercise can benefit health by: Improving mood. Combating chronic disease. Maintaining weight loss. Increasing energy. Regulating sleep patterns. The study, led by Laura D. Baker, Ph.D., of the University of Washington, evaluated findings from a trial involving 33 adults with mild cognitive impairment. A group of 23 were assigned to an aerobic exercise group and exercised at high intensity levels for 45 to 60 minutes per day, four days per week. A second group of 10 individuals performed non-aerobic stretching exercises. The individuals in the high-intensity aerobic exercise group experienced improved cognitive function compared with those in the non-aerobic group. \"Aerobic exercise is a cost-effective practice that is associated with numerous physical benefits. Exercise also provides a cognitive benefit for adults with mild cognitive impairment without the cost and adverse effects associated with most pharmaceutical therapies,\" the authors say. Physical exercise may protect against mild cognitive impairment via production of nerve-protecting compounds, greater blood flow to the brain, improved development of neurons, and the decreased risk of heart and blood vessel diseases.

Vitamin D can affect lung function and asthmatic treatment. \"Our findings suggest that low vitamin D levels are associated with worse asthma,\" says lead researcher Dr. E. Rand Sutherland, from the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at National Jewish Health in Denver. Vitamin D is found in several dietary sources such as milk, fish and fish oils and eggs. In addition, the sun increases production of vitamin D; as little as 10 to 15 minutes of sun exposure can help to prevent deficiencies. Health benefits of vitamin D: Maintains calcium balance. Regulates blood pressure. Strengthens immunity. Prevents viral infections. \"It may be that vitamin D is acting as a modifier of the immune system or a modifier of steroid response in ways that are relevant to people with asthma,\" adds Sutherland. The study appears in the January 28 edition of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. Findings indicate that a vitamin D deficiency may be linked to an increased inflammation and constriction of the airways. Restoring normal vitamin D levels in people with asthma may help to improve the respiratory condition.

Previous research has suggested that the monounsaturated fatty acids in olive oil, used abundantly in the Mediterranean diet, may be associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms. Almudena S\u00e1nchez-Villega., Ph.D., from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, and colleagues studied 10,094 healthy participants who completed an initial questionnaire between 1999 and 2005. Participants reported their dietary intake on a food frequency questionnaire, and the researchers calculated their adherence to the Mediterranean diet based on multiple components: Moderate intake of dairy products, low intake of meat and high intake of legumes, fruit, nuts, cereals, vegetables, and fish. After a midpoint of 4.4 years of follow-up, 480 new cases of depression were identified. Individuals who followed the Mediterranean diet most closely had a greater than 30 percent reduction in the risk of depression than whose who had the lowest Mediterranean diet scores. Components of the diet may improve blood vessel function, fight inflammation, reduce risk for heart disease, and repair oxygen-related cell damage, all of which may decrease the chances of developing depression. In addition to a healthy diet, acupuncture can aid in the treatment of depression by: Increasing cerebral serotonin, which has anti-depressant analgesic effects. Reducing fatigue and other symptoms of depression. Elevating mood. Stabilizing hormonal imbalance.

A vast majority of Americans, 86 percent, agree that massage can be effective in reducing pain, and 85 percent agree that massage can be beneficial for health and wellness. \"Even with the ongoing economic crisis, people are not willing to compromise their health,\" says Judy Stahl, AMTA president. \"It's a clear signal of massage's value when those making less than $35,000 a year are the second most active income bracket getting massage therapy.\" Massage is effective for: Fatigue. Low back pain. Knee osteoarthritis. Boosting the body's immune system functioning. Lowering blood pressure. Reducing headache frequency. For the second year in a row, the survey results show that massage therapy use is fairly steady. Thirty-two percent of stressed out Americans are getting massages to relieve their stress and 57 percent of Americans say they feel more stressed this year than last year, particularly among females (61 percent) and those ages 18-24 (66 percent). \"Consumers understand that massage therapy is essential to a healthy balance between stress and relaxation,\" said Stahl. \"We are pleased to see that consumers are prioritizing massage to help them through these difficult times.\" Acupuncture & Massage College's Community Clinic offers acupuncture, massage and Chinese herbal medicine therapy for the treatment of a wide range of health conditions as well as for overall wellness.

Today there is an increasing emphasis on strengthening the immune system through disease prevention rather than by treating existing illness. Traditional Chinese medicine recognizes that illness is caused by a weakened immune system. Herbal remedies can enhance the body's natural defense mechanisms. Herbs can also allow your body to resist infectious agents without the adverse side effects of conventional medications. The immune system has two defense mechanisms: Natural, which utilizes white blood cells to protect from disease, and acquired, in which specialized cells strengthen and increase antibodies to defend against pathogens. While many individuals depend on pharmaceuticals for health and treatment of illness, over 80 percent of the world's population relies on herbal remedies for healing and health. By allowing the body to combat infections without antibiotics, medicinal herbs can strengthen the immune system against future illness and disease. Herbs that strengthen the immune system: Echinacea activates immune system chemicals which can increase defense mechanisms against viruses and bacteria. Astragalus is a Chinese herb which has anti-viral properties and contains antioxidants. Ginkgo biloba improves circulation and strengthens blood vessels. Goldenseal stimulates the immune and digestive systems. Acupuncture & Massage College's Community Clinic offers acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine therapy for health and disease prevention.
