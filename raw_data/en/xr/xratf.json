Canadian manufacturers, importers and retailers were directed in 2001 to remove all herbal products containing aristolochic acid from their shelves. [1](#ref-1) However, Health Canada recently reissued a warning that consumers avoid such products [2](#ref-2) amid concerns that the products are still widely available through the Internet.

Natural health products containing aristolochic acid are often sold as traditional Chinese medicines meant to effect weight loss, improve the immune system or alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, menstrual complaints, cough and allergies. As with most herbal products, there is little and often no evidence from clinical trials of their efficacy for any of these benefits. No adverse effects related to aristolochic acid exposure have yet been reported in Canada. What to do: Language barriers may prevent many health care practitioners from effectively verifying the ingredients listed on many Chinese herbal products. Instead, patients using Chinese herbal products should be warned to ensure that the products they are using do not contain the ingredients in question ( [Box 1](#F1)) and are not one of the brands that have been recalled (see online appendix).
