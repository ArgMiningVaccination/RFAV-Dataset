In addition to practice, I'm a medical professor at the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in NYC, teaching via a live, online platform: U.S. Healthcare Policy and Systems Based Medicine. I have also collaborated in hospitals to integrate Chinese medicine with allopathic medicine, such as the St. Charles Hospital's Palliative Care Department and the Cancer Center's Integrative Therapies Department. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is my love story. My first exposure to acupuncture was seeking treatment for my low back that was in muscle spasm. The pain was incredibly high and debilitating; I couldn't move or work (and my job at the time required international travel). I went to an acupuncturist and after the first visit, my pain level was lower and I was mobile. After just three visits, my pain level was at zero and I was back at work, traveling and exercising! My mind was blown! From my first hand experience with the healing power of this 3,000-year-old medicine, I fell in love and wanted to know everything about it! I applied to Traditional Chinese Medical school in NYC, quit my high stress traveling job and here I am, 15 years later: practicing my passion. I seek the care of a TCM practitioner as my primary care of medicine and integrate it with allopathic medicine when necessary. For example, in 2016, I fractured the humerus bone (upper arm) due to a road cycling accident and I immediately sought care at an ER and with an Orthopedic MD. My follow up care was with an acupuncturist/Chinese herbalist to support and expedite my body's natural ability to heal. The orthopedic surgeon was surprised at how quickly the bone was healing and wouldn't need surgery! The result was that I had minimal down time, only missed a couple days of work, never underwent invasive procedures, didn't take opioids for pain management, and I've returned to full range of motion. I'm honored to be entrusted with your health and have you experience the positive changes in your body, as I have. My number one priority for you is to obtain optimal wellness!
