COVID-19 vaccine also has the potential to cause acute and long-term cardiovascular effects, which include myocarditis, pericarditis, myopericarditis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, thrombotic thrombocytopenia, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Although uncommon, takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) has also been reported following COVID-19 vaccination. We report a case of TCM following the COVID-19 vaccine in a 59-year-old female who presented with intermittent chest pain and dyspnea following the COVID-19 vaccine booster dose. She had no identifiable triggers for TCM, no risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and normal cardiac enzyme levels, ruling out other causes of cardiac dysfunction. The diagnosis of TCM was supported by imaging findings and the absence of obstructive or thrombotic lesions on angiography.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-08-10", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
