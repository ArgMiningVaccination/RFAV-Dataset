For more information on specific vaccines go to [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/vaccines-diseases.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/vaccines-diseases.html) Babies and young children are vulnerable to diseases, which can cause death and disability. Vaccines can protect against many childhood diseases, such as chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, polio, measles, and many others. Vaccines should be given to children on the [recommended schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf) ( [catch up immunization schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/teens/downloads/parent-version-schedule-7-18yrs.pdf)) so that infants and children are protected as early as possible. Shots are required by law for children to attend public and private schools, preschools, child care facilities, and Head Start programs. For more information, see the Parent [FAQs](https://public.health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/VaccinesImmunization/GettingImmunized/Documents/ParentDataFAQ.pdf) (Frequently Asked Questions) on the state website.
