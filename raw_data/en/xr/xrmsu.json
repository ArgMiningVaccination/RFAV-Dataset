The Travis County Sheriff's Office will be getting free weekly acupuncture treatments by Texas Health and Science University interns. County Commissioners approved the deal between the two on Tuesday. Interns will visit the sheriff's office once a week to treat deputies and staff under the supervision of a licensed acupuncturist. Supporters say the traditional Chinese technique helps treat many mental and physical ailments deputies experience on the job. \"Students benefit because they need people to work on. The deputies will benefit because we're looking at it as a mental health awareness or initiative. So, it will focus on some of the depression, some PTSD, some even physical ailments that most law enforcement or staff members will have,\" said Juan Sandoval with the Travis County Sheriff's Office. Texas Health and Science University interns are required to treat more than 300 patients before they can graduate. For now, the partnership with the Travis County Sheriff's Office will be in place for one year. --- Join the Discussion: Follow Spectrum News Austin on "}
