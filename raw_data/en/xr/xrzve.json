The Advice Nurse is available to Storrs students 24 hours a day/7 days a week. Visit [Eastern Highlands Health District](http://www.ehhd.org/) for local info on vaccines and testing. To keep our community safe and to keep the University open, UConn is employing various methods of testing to stay on top of COVID-19 transmission, preventing outbreaks and reducing the need for large-scale residential quarantines. In addition to testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, UConn is using pooled surveillance screening of both wastewater and saliva samples to identify areas of viral concentration even before individuals in those areas show symptoms or receive positive clinical tests. Visit [covid-testing.uconn.edu](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcovid-testing.uconn.edu%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cmichelle.tirabassi%40uconn.edu%7Cf9627d12b07a4900783e08d8d3862815%7C17f1a87e2a254eaab9df9d439034b080%7C0%7C0%7C637491920432766648%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=UrmqG3AM51yn76l28kchnpuc03Xqs%2F0%2BmVqaU%2B4k6mk%3D&reserved=0) for more information on our surveillance testing efforts. There are three types of monitoring: Wastewater Testing What: Scientists at the University continually test wastewater samples from areas all over the Storrs campus to detect the presence of SARS-Cov-2. How: Use the restrooms in your residential area as normal. No further action is required. Why: Individuals infected with SARS-Cov-2 shed viral particles in their feces even before showing symptoms, allowing us to detect where COVID-19 might be spreading. If a wastewater sample indicates the presence of the virus, we can test further in in that area to isolate cases, catching infections before they become outbreaks and keeping residence halls open. Pooled (Gargle) Testing What: Groups of 10 saliva samples are pooled together and tested for presence of the virus. How: In the comfort and privacy of your dorm room, gargle the solution in your provided test tube, spitting it back into the tube and closing it. Deposit the tube in a designated bucket once per week on a specified day. Why: If the virus is detected in a pooled sample, each individual in the pool can be clinically tested to isolate cases, catching infections before they become outbreaks and keeping residence halls open. Exception: In alignment with Public Health recommendations, students with a positive COVID-19 test result in the past 90 days will not participate in pooled testing. Individual Diagnostic Testing What: Nasal swabs are tested individually for the presence of the virus. Why: Routine, random diagnostic tests of the population help identify asymptomatic cases and isolate them before they spread, keeping residence halls open. How: Storrs students will make a testing appointment through the [SHaW Patient Portal](https://myhealth.uconn.edu/) and report to the Field House at your appointment time to have a swab taken. You may receive an email from SHaW asking you to make an appointment. In addition, residential students and off-campus students with an on-campus commitment can have five self-requested clinical surveillance tests throughout the semester. Off-campus students with no on-campus commitments can have three self-requested surveillance tests in addition to any testing requested by SHaW. Exception: In alignment with Public Health recommendations, students with a positive COVID-19 test result in the past 90 days will not participate in surveillance testing. Submitting External COVID-19 Test Results All students, including those from our regional campuses, who obtain testing results outside of the UConn testing program should upload their results through the [SHaW Patient Portal](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyhealth.uconn.edu%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cmichelle.tirabassi%40uconn.edu%7C9d0b8f093b534ca9b7a408d8ae945990%7C17f1a87e2a254eaab9df9d439034b080%7C0%7C0%7C637451299469142079%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=i%2BLfdaJTtE1%2BTiKLfHtgRhn8pK7SZYQ2pNRJy7qULXo%3D&reserved=0). - Select \"Document Upload\" from the top menu bar. - Select \"COVID 19 Results and Clearance\" in the Document Type drop-down menu. Individual Symptomatic Testing What: Nasal swabs are tested individually for the presence of the virus. Why: Diagnostic testing of symptomatic students helps identify cases before they spread. How: Any Storrs-based student who experiences symptoms of COVID-19 should seek immediate medical evaluation through SHaW before engaging with the campus community. Please call [860-486-4700](tel:860-486-4700) for our Advice Nurse line to make an appointment. What is the difference between quarantine, and isolation? [QUARANTINE](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) keeps someone who has been exposed to the virus away from others. - Quarantine is a period of time when a student who has been exposed to the virus is directed to limit their in-person interactions with others. This period lasts a minimum of 10 days after the exposure. Day 1 - 5: - Stay in your designated quarantine location. - Monitor your health daily and submit your Daily Symptom Check. Day 6 - 10 - - Monitor your health daily and submit your Daily Symptom Check. - If you develop symptoms, isolate immediately and get tested. Continue to isolate until you know your test results. - Wear a well-fitted mask whenever you are not in your designated quarantine space. - Wash your hands frequently. - Do not go to public places where you cannot wear a mask. - Do not eat in restaurants or other public spaces. - Do not travel. - Do not spend time with people who are at high risk from COVID-19 All students should be tested for COVID-19 during their quarantine period on day 5 or later. The quarantine period is calculated based on the timing of the exposure. Students can re-join the campus community once the quarantine period is completed. No clearance is required. House hold contacts with on-going exposures will have a longer quarantine period. [ISOLATION](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html) keeps someone who is infected with the virus away from others, even in their home. - Isolation is required when an individual is diagnosed with COVID-19, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. Individuals in isolation must remove themselves from all face-to-face interactions until they are no longer infectious and are released by their medical provider. - Repeat testing is not recommended. - Students who have completed their isolation and have been medical released by their health care provider are able to return to in-person classes and activities. Students should not be compelled to provide documentation to faculty as private health information (PHI) is protected. Students are trusted to communicate their ability to attend in-person activities. All students are strongly encouraged to have an isolation and quarantine plan. I am a close contact of someone with COVID-19 and have been told to take protective measures for 10 days after the exposure. What should I do? Recommended measures depend on vaccination status or history of COVID-19 in the past 90 days. How can I Quarantine at home safely? If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 and choose to quarantine at home, follow these precautions: - Obtain a COVID-19 test and have the result before you leave campus. - Do not use public transportation to travel home. - Ensure that you have a quarantine space in your home that is not shared by others. - Wear a mask when you are not in your designated quarantine space. - Wash your hands frequently. - Spend time outside and go for walks away from other people. - Monitor your symptoms daily and take your temperature twice a day. - Seek medical care and testing if you develop symptoms of COVID-19 during your quarantine period.

House hold contacts with on-going exposures will have a longer quarantine period. I have been identified as a close contact of an individual with COVID-19 and my SARS-CoV-2 vaccine status is up-to-date. Do I need to quarantine? According to CDC, individuals who are up-to-date with their SARS-CoV-2 vaccine* do not need to quarantine but should follow these preventive measures to protect themselves and others: - obtain a COVID-19 test after 5 days or more after exposure and if you develop any symptoms of COVID-19 - wear a mask in doors in all public places for 10 days after exposure - monitor for COVID-19 symptoms daily for 10 days after exposure - avoid crowds - cover coughs and sneezes - wash hands often Clinical students with academic placements should defer to the guidance of their clinical site. *Up-to-date with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination means 5 months or more after their initial series of mRNA vaccine, or 2 months or more of J&J or boosted when eligible. When do I start and end Quarantine? Quite simply, you should quarantine for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19. See the scenarios below to determine when you can end quarantine and be around others. For all of these scenarios, even if you test negative for COVID-19 or feel healthy, you should stay home (quarantine) since symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Scenario 1: Close contact with someone who has COVID-19\u2014will not have further close contact Scenario 2: Close contact with someone who has COVID-19\u2014live with the person but can avoid further close contact Scenario 3: Under quarantine and had additional close contact with someone who has COVID-19 Scenario 4: Live with someone who has COVID-19 and cannot avoid continued close contact UPDATES & COMMUNICATIONS 01-30-21 | COVID Testing Reminder for Off-campus/Commuter Students For those students who already did their reentry testing, please remember to drop off your completed Vault At Home test in the Student Union Ballroom.

Contact Student Health and Wellness at shaw-covid@uconn.edu with any questions or concerns. Best Regards, Medical Care Staff Student Health and Wellness What are the current guidelines for out-of-state travel? I'm arriving to the U.S. from international travel, what are the requirements? I am submitting gargle samples for pooled testing every week, do I still schedule additional testing when invited by SHaW? - YES! Try to separate your individual surveillance test from your gargle sample submission by two days or more, but if you can't that's OK. It is better to do both tests. How do I choose a mask or face covering and then use it correctly? - CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people. Look here for their [guidance on selection and use](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). How do Storrs residential students get their move-in test results? - Results are available through a CareEvolve portal, usually in less than 24 hours from receipt of the tests at Broad Institute's loading dock. Taking collection and shipping time into account, most results are available at or under a 24-hour turnaround time. - After your test on move-in day, expect an email from CareEvolve@lknotification.com. This email will contain a confirmation code and a link to the CareEvolve portal. You will need to confirm your name, birthdate, and UConn's zip code (06269). You will then fill out your profile, entering demographic information. The Address will be your dorm name and room number, i.e. Keller 303. The exception to that is Werth Tower, where the dorm name was imported into CareEvolve as NextGen. Once you are logged in, click your test date to view your results. For a detailed presentation on this process, [click here](https://studenthealth.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1709/2020/08/CareEvolve-Patient-Experience.pdf). - If you have a positive test result, it is very likely that you have COVID-19. UConn staff will reach out to you to initiate quarantine and isolation procedures to avoid spreading the virus to others. There is a very small chance that this test can give a positive result that is wrong (a false positive result). Student Health and Wellness medical staff will work with you to determine how best to care for you based on the test results, medical history, and your symptoms. - A negative test result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in your sample at the time you were tested. - Unsatisfactory/Tests Not Processed (TNP) or invalid test results indicate an error in collection or an insufficient sample. Up to 5% of tests may result in unsatisfactory/TNP samples under normal conditions. - Common unsatisfactory/TNP results include, but are not limited to:Unsatisfactory_11: Solids are present in sample or viscosity of sample is too high to process. To prevent this, blow your nose thoroughly before collecting the sample.Unsatisfactory_12: The sample is not sufficient to process because something is wrong with the swab. Most commonly, this is because the swab is put in the tube upside-down. The correct placement of the swab is with the soft tip pointing down toward the liquid at the bottom of the tube. Invalid: A test that seemed fine and went through the testing process, but did not indicate the presence human material, which should be present on all swabs. In any of these situations, SHaW staff will contact you to redo your sample collection. - Common unsatisfactory/TNP results include, but are not limited to:Unsatisfactory_11: Solids are present in sample or viscosity of sample is too high to process. To prevent this, blow your nose thoroughly before collecting the sample.Unsatisfactory_12: The sample is not sufficient to process because something is wrong with the swab. Most commonly, this is because the swab is put in the tube upside-down. The correct placement of the swab is with the soft tip pointing down toward the liquid at the bottom of the tube. Will I be required to have additional testing for COVID-19 during the semester? - UConn will be doing random weekly surveillance testing of the residential student population throughout the semester on both the Storrs and Stamford campuses. - Storrs based residential students will undergo weekly pooled testing throughout the spring semester. - Storrs based off-campus students with an on-campus commitment are required to submit weekly surveillance tests through the month of February. - EXEMPTION: Students with a positive COVID-19 test in the past 90 days will not participate in additional testing.
