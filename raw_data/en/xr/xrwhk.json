This study explored parental perceptions and knowledge as they navigate a new reality of keeping their child safe. Methods: Parents of children with food allergies completed an online food allergy survey in 2015. Questions explored health knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) as well as quality of life (QoL) through the inclusion of the Food Allergy Quality of Life \u2014Parental Burden instrument (FAQL-PB). Noti cation of the survey included advertisements to more than 700 randomly selected Australia-wide preschools, 44 allergy specialists, and Allergy & Anaphylaxis Australia.Responses were tabulated and analysed. Results: Of the 400 participants who logged on, 357 commenced the survey and 318 nished. Questionnaire analysis showed that 44.1% of parents (n \u00bc135) hesitated to use an adrenaline auto-injector and may be in fluenced by a classi cation system where symptom severity is not universally understood. While 79% would sign up to a national Anaphylaxis Registry, intention to participate in clinical trials using vaccines was disclosed by only 56%. Allergen labelling andcommunity acceptance continue to be the most challenging aspects of managing a food allergy, and 50% of parents reported that food allergy played a role in choosing a preschool or primary school. Overall, quality of life for participants was in fluenced more by gender (male) and age of the child than where they lived \u2014capital city or regional location; however, regional participants were more frustrated over lack of appreciation relating to the seriousness of food allergy (p \u00bc0.010). Conclusion: Results highlight the need for educational strategies for both the food allergy community and public, particularly in regional areas, since there is a perceived lack of appreciation as to the seriousness of food allergy. Educational resources and relevant networks are required to support parents and caregivers in the management of children with food allergy.

Allergy Organization Journal (2020) 13:100468 http://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100468INTRODUCTION In recent years there has been a rise in the number of people experiencing food allergies to common foods, with more allergic reactions occurring earlier in life.1-4With no current cure for food allergy, parents must learn new strategies to prevent food allergic reactions, and this createsquality of life (QoL) challenges as parents learn to navigate the new reality of allergen avoidance. 5 In this study, Australian parents reveal what it islike to live with a child who has a food allergy. To normalise behaviour around food, parents need to be vigilant, yet guard against inadvertently creating an environment of fear, as this can impact self-con dence in their children and lead to social withdrawal and abnormal eating patterns. 6,7One starting point is to improve health literacy across the community to engender support and awareness as health messages can in fluence behaviour.5,8 However, to keep children safe, parents must rely on third parties, including food manufacturers, restaurant staff, other parents, and teachers. As studies show allergic reactions occur more frequently outside the home, there is a need for specialised training and greater awareness of foodallergies in the hospitality and food industries. 9-11 Exploring knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSA) this study offered many insights into the chal-lenges of managing a child with a food allergy. Topics included social engagement, medical knowledge, and schooling. The authors believe this is the rst comprehensive study of Australian parents living with a child who has a food allergy, offering not only insight to daily challenges but also comparative analysis across metropolitan (capital cities), regional, and remote areas of Australia. METHODS This study was conducted between 2015 and 2017, using an online platform and parental in- terviews. Phase one was a cross-sectional online survey hosted on the cloud-based platform, SurveyMonkey/C210(San Mateo CA USA) involving participants either living with food allergy (under 8 years, 8 -12 years, teenagers under 19 years) or parents of children with food allergy. While phasetwo encouraged parents who had completed the online survey to opt-in for a phone interview, and this process is deconstructed in Fig. 1 . Recruitment of participants (online survey) Participants were recruited from across Australia between May and December 2015. Formal distri- bution channels included letters to over 700 Australian preschools (53.8% in regional locations) and 44 allergy specialists requesting promotion of the survey at the time of consultation. The survey was also promoted via the public social network site (Facebook) and private membership domains of the Australian patient support organisation, Al-lergy & Anaphylaxis Australia. Regional media presentations on Radio (ABC Bega and Orange, NSW) and Television News (Prime 7 and WIN Television) invited prospective participants to complete the questionnaire. Prospective participants were encouraged to log-on and read the Participant Information Sheet(refer Supplementary File -Participant Information Sheet -Food Allergy Quality of Life ). For those without internet access, contact details (email and mobile) were provided. Collection of demographic data included: age group, gender, year, and attendance at school and presence of concomitant atopic diseases such ashay fever, asthma, and eczema. Questions also sought information on where participants lived \u2014 capital city or regional location \u2014and who diag- nosed their child 's food allergy. For parents who reported living in a regional location, the results were subdivided into small or large regional cen- tres. Large regional centres were the top 20 most populous cities or towns (population /C2152,000) based on the 2016 Australian Census. 12 Survey design Questions measured QoL and KSAs (refer to Supplementary File - Survey Questions ) with a focus on social interaction, medical awareness, labelling practices, and decisions around schooling. To underpin validity, the questionnaire also incorporated, with permission, the internationally validated (Cronbach a\u00bc0.95) Food Allergy Quality of Life Parental Burden(FAQL-PB) questionnaire. 13This offered the2 Stockhammer et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2020) 13:100468 http://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100468opportunity to discriminate responses, with higher scores indicating a worsening QoL. Communication and encouragement to partici- pate complemented other strategies designed to mitigate concerns over potential non-responsebias associated with online surveys and the inability to calculate response rates. 14These strategies included letters to preschools and allergy specialists explaining the importance of completing the survey as well as a follow-up let- ter to allergy specialists announcing an extension of the survey closing date from October to December 2015. Support from Allergy & Anaphy- laxis Australia was ongoing and included featuringthe WIN TV interview in July 2015, noti cation ofthe extension from October to December, and a \"nal call\" out one week before the survey closed in mid-December. Interview scope and process On completion of the online survey, parents were offered the opportunity to participate in an informal follow-up phone interview. To explore attitudes and perceptions, the interview included both structured and unstructured questions. Topics covered rating precautionary allergen la- bels (PALs) based on risk, the giving of advice to parents starting the food allergy journey and interaction with general practitioners (GPs) whenfood allergy was the de ning criteria. IntervieweesExpressed Interest in F/U Phone Interview (n=202) Interviewed (n=104)Completed Online (n=318) Interviews Scheduled (n=155)Commenced (n=357)Logged Eligible/ to Proceed (n=43) Uncontactable (n=5)No Further Contact (n=116) Declined / Not Available (n=51)Did Not Respond to Invitaon (n=42)Did Not Complete (n=39) Fig. 1 Recruitment of participants (leading to nal interview)Volume 13, No. 10, October 2020 3also considered peripheral issues, such as designing an advertising slogan to enhance public awareness of food allergies. The nal question asked participants to re flect and report on something positive about living with a child who has a food allergy. This strategic change was a deliberate inclusion to protect psy-chological wellbeing and minimise negative sen- timents that may continue well after the cessation of the interview. 15,16Where the interviewer perceived personal issues or distress, interviewees were reminded that not only could they decline and end the interview, they could also seek professional help through medical and auxiliary services. Interview process Interviews were scheduled from September 2015 to March 2016. To ensure consistency in approach, language and style, the principal researcher conducted all interviews. Both purpose and suitability of interview time were reaf rmed along with an option to reconvene if not suitable. All interviewees gave formal verbal consent. Tran- scription (hand-written) of responses was as close to verbatim as possible though occasionally some words were indecipherable or missed. Interviewswere scheduled for 45 min, although averaged 55 min. On conclusion, all were thanked for their time. Statistical/data analysis Non-parametric tests, including chi-square goodness-of- t test, frequency statistics, and ANOVA tests were performed for comparative analysis between participants from capital cities and regional locations, age, and gender as well as allergen. Inclusion of the FAQL-PB questionnaire 13 permitted both ordinal logistical regression andindependent t-tests in the exploration of relationships between QoL scores and demographic attributes. Principal Axis Factoring was performed using the Promax with Kaiser Normalisation rotation method to determine variance and relevant factors in the questionnaire data. To compensate for missing data and remove potential inaccuracies, calculation of frequency and valid percentageswere based on the number of responses dividedby the number who completed the speci c ques- tion. This approach accounts for the different \"N\" values represented throughout. Statistical signi cance was measured using a\u00bc0.05 (SPSS IBM Statistics V24.0, a popular distinguisher for non-parametric tests and cate- gorical data. In contrast, the data from the inter-view narratives were transcribed and coded using NVivo Pro 11 qualitative data analysis software (version 11; QSR International Pty Ltd) to assist in the identi cation of relationships to uncover the interviewee 's perception of reality. Narratives were then assigned into preliminary themes before rereading each data set to ensure the narrative was accurately assigned. 17 RESULTS Of the 400 parents who logged on, 377 pro- ceeded past the rst question, 18 were ineligible as they did not reside in Australia, while 2 did not have an immediate family member with food al- lergy. All data from ineligible participants were removed from the analysis, leaving 357 partici- pants included in the study, with 318 completing the survey. Table 1 presents the demographic prole of the study population. QoL indices - FAQL-PB questionnaire Results showed that internal consistency and reliability were high (Cronbach 'sa\u00bc0.96) with a mean total FAQL-PB score of 3.61 ( 'somewhat of an impact ') out of a possible score of 7 across all 3 domains (a: going on vacation/holiday [mean total\u00bc4.82], b: social activities in social events [mean total\u00bc5.10]), and c: worries and anxieties over the past week [mean total \u00bc3.53]). Differences in QoL are highlighted in the following quotes, including the importance of family support: /C15\"become so anxious about my son 's life threat- ing allergies that we rarely attend any family functions ..either singled out, accused of be- ing over obsessive or face criticism for not 'just letting them give him a bit of his allergens to cure him 'awareness is lacking & most are not willing to listen which is so frustrating. \"[Regional Participant No:16, Male, Under 8 years] -QoL score of 74 Stockhammer et al.

Overall results identi ed 2 factors, ac- counting for 64.1% of the variance in the ques- tionnaire. Factor 1 related to general wellbeing and health, including psychological wellbeing, whereas Factor 2 aligned more with social interaction. Factor analysis also showed differences across locations. For those living in capital cities, 2 fac- tors emerged, accounting for 66.2% of the vari- ance. At the same time, regional participants ' differentiation identi ed 3 factors accounting for 66.8% of all variances, although there was a strong focus on psychological wellbeing. Table 2 details the factors across each group. Although location did not signi cantly in flu- ence QoL, small differences emerged betweencapital cities (n \u00bc189) and regional locations (n\u00bc134). For those living in capital cities, the mean total QoL was better at 3.58 compared to 3.66 for regional locations (p \u00bc0.723). Small regional towns had the best mean total QoL score of 3.54 compared to 3.80 for those living in large regional towns. Although regional locations were not statistically signi cant when an independent t- test was performed (p \u00bc0.464), different parental challenges may exist when managing a child with a food allergy, including access to support ser-vices. However, with 8 participants excluded in this analysis between large and small regional towns, further research is warranted.

Here loca- tion was not signi cant. However, a lack of appre- ciation by others in the community was also influenced by age, and Fig. 2 illustrates this. Mean total QoL scores were also worse for participants managing 4 or more of the top 7 allergens (peanut, tree nut, egg, dairy, wheat, soy, and seafood) compared to those needing tomanage either 1 (p <0.001) or 2 of these aller- gens (p \u00bc0.001). Similarly, parents who concur- rently managed peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, and dairy, the mean QoL score was 4.11 compared to 3.09 for those managing peanut and/or tree nut allergies, and this was statistically signi cant. However, signi cance was not found between parents managing these 4 allergens and those managing an egg and/or dairy allergy and this may be why, all but 1 of the 17 FAQL-PB ques- tions, was signi cant when a one-way ANOVA test was performed. For parents managing an egg allergy (n \u00bc156), the one FAQL-PB question where participants were less concerned was \"not being able to help their child if they were having an allergic reaction \"(p\u00bc0.069). For those man- aging a dairy allergy (n \u00bc126), the trend was toward being less concerned about \"food al- lergies becoming more serious \"(p\u00bc0.059). In contrast, parents who reported a peanut allergy(n\u00bc225), the only signi cant question was \"how troubled have you been by sadness regardingthe burden your child carries because of their food allergy? \"(p\u00bc0.007), while there was no signi cant difference for those managing a tree nut allergy (n \u00bc197). However, irrespective of the type or number of allergens, one of the most influential characteristics, when a factorial ANOVA test was performed, was age (p \u00bc0.002). Fig. 3 shows the distribution of parental mean QoL scores based on age and location, while Table 3 shows the signi cant differences across all FAQL-PB questions for the different age groups. In contrast, Table 4 shows distribution and CI intervals across the 3 FAQL-PB domains: goingon holidays, social activities, and worries/anxieties over the preceding week. However, for some par- ticipants, they acknowledge that their answers maynot have re flected their \"normal \"feelings in the preceding week: /C15\"My feelings about a lot of the questions .will change once my child starts preschool/school. At the moment he is around me all the time so i don 't seem stressed about it all. But once he is out of my care, it will be a totally different story \". [Regional Participant No: 78, Male, Under 8 years ] /C15\"Asking about fears in 'the last week 'is not necessarily indicative of the 'norm '. Fears tend to Fig. 2 Frustration as to lack of appreciation of food allergy seriousnessVolume 13, No. 10, October 2020 9escalate around events or situations .\". [Capital City Participant No: 289, Male, Teenager] While these comments highlight individual circumstances, they also show that food allergymanagement is both situational and time dependent. By capturing multiple responses, the real impact of food allergy on QoL emerges. Importance of food labelling Parents reported allergen labelling, access to medical services and a safe school environment as the most important considerations when managing a child with food allergy. These factorswere more important than research into nding a cure, the costs associated with managing food allergy or establishing an anaphylaxis register, notwithstanding 262 (n \u00bc332, 78.9%) who thought a register was in fluential in raising com- munity awareness and in fluencing government policies. Precautionary allergen labelling (PAL) is a voluntary code adopted by Australian food man- ufacturers to alert consumers on the likelihood of a trace allergen being present. One of the most common PALs in Australia is \"may contain traces of [allergen] \", yet 262 parents (n \u00bc338, 77.5%) re- ported purchasing products with this warning. For127 who selected they \"sometime \"purchasedproducts with this label, 40 (31.5%) provided qualifying comments, including only purchasingproducts if manufactured in Australia. While for 34 participants (13.0%), the perception was that this label was only there to protect the manufacturer against legal action and had nothing to do with the actual risk, As expected, distribution across the 4 possible responses of \"never \",\"sometimes \",\"often \" and \"always \"was signi cant For parents buying products with the label \"made on the same equipment \"the number dropped to 67.7% (n \u00bc226/337) inferring the wording in fluenced a change in purchasing behaviour. This change was statistically signi cant (chi-square test, p \u00bc0.004) as parents placed more weight on this PAL wording compared to \"may contain traces of \". For those that said they \"some- times \"purchased products with this label (n\u00bc137), the most common reason was that they had \"eaten it before \"(n\u00bc35). Others quali ed the risk, reporting they only purchased one or two \"safe \"products with this label, such as pasta or biscuits; if the product was manufactured in Australia; on contacting the manufacturer to assess\"actual risk \"; and on advisement from their allergy specialist. This change in risk pro ling was corroborated during the interview process, with 50% of Fig. 3 Parental mean QoL by age and location10 Stockhammer et al.

The least risky for interviewees was the label \"manufactured in the same facility \"as only 30% assigned this as a \"high \"or \"extreme \" risk. Fig. 4 shows how interviewees pro led the risk associated with common Australian PAL labels. Medical challenges Of the 314 parents who said their child possessed an adrenaline auto-injector, 292 (93.0%) correctly identi ed the sequence needed to acti- vate. Nine parents gave an incorrect response, and 13 chose not to answer this question. For the 306 who had used an adrenaline auto- injector, 135 (44.1%) reported they had hesitated. While multiple reasons exist why parents delay administering adrenaline, the main reason for hesitancy was \"not wanting to over-react \"(n\u00bc80, 59.3%), followed by \"symptoms have settled in the past \"(n\u00bc61, 45.2%) and the \"inability to decide \" (n\u00bc51, 37.7%). Although fear was not a major reason (n \u00bc12, 8.8%), it did surface for those who selected \"other reasons \"who also expressed un- certainty as to when to use an auto-injector, how long one should wait before administering, and at what time does a reaction become critical. /C15\"Confusion over whether to administer before symptoms worsen, or to wait for near death! \" [Regional Participant No: 172, Male, Teenager] /C15\"When the reaction is on the cusp of moderate to severe, it is trying to decide if antihistamine will be enough. Administering adrenaline is not the challenge, so much as the resulting trip to the hospital, and organising care for siblings for a delayed onset reaction during the middle of the night. \"[Capital City Participant No: 250, Male, 8 -12 years] One reason why such indecision exists could be the lack of a universal classi cation scheme lead- ing parents to assess symptoms subjectively. Such differences in classifying symptom severity were conrmed, and these results are published.

Analysing GP engagement using a thematic approach, aided by NVivo Pro 11, identi ed 3 primary themes: limited assistance, power/control and trust, and support- ive relationships. When responses were coded and thematically analysed, 58 (56.8%) interviewees perceived little or no assistance from their GPs in managing their food-allergic child. Regional participants were more likely to report limited GP assistance (n \u00bc29/ 42, 69.0%), while 2 never visited GPs; instead, they relied on naturopathic interventions. For this group of interviewees, the perception was that they were not an equal partner in the relationship as they needed to overcome frustra- tion and ridicule: /C15\"Did not take it seriously .I was almost laughed at and told that reactions were highly unlikely. \"; [Interviewee No: 16, Regional VIC, Mother of Child aged 3 years, Male, Diagnosed at 7 months] However, it was not only the need to convince GPs that food allergy was likely but also the concern over the perception that GPs lacked the requisite knowledge in how to deal with food al-lergy. To overcome these perceptions,interviewees identi ed the need for ongoing pro- fessional development. In contrast, the perception for 42 interviewees (41.2%) was that GP interaction focused not only on the clinical nature of symptoms but also on QoL as food allergy is more than just about managingfood. For these interviewees, the doctor-patient relationship focused on equality, respect, trust, and support, with 1 interviewee reporting their GP was: /C15\"Aware of problem and reactions .supportive, provides advice about trial availability .not made to feel silly .understands it is challenging as a parent \"; [Interviewee No: 33, Regional NSW, Mother of Child aged 2 years, Male, Diagnosed at 11 months] The key difference was whether the relationship was akin to a health partnership or a \"revolving door \"experience. Food challenges For 188 parents (n \u00bc334, 56.3%) who reported their child had been through a food challenge, 161 reported this was supervised.

World Allergy Organization Journal (2020) 13:100468 http://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100468fearful \"(n\u00bc44, 23.4%). Despite parents reporting these feelings, there was an overwhelming need to conrm or refute their child 's food allergy, with only 6 reporting they would not go throughanother food challenge. For 94 parents, there was a positive outcome to the food challenge, as their child could now eat that food. However, distribution of feelings ( \"relief \", \"excitement \",\"anxious/uneasy \"or \"scared \") was not equal (chi-square test, <0.001), with the overwhelming response being No parent reported feeling \"scared \". Despite being able to eat the food, 7 of the 53 participants who reported feeling \"nervous \"or\"apprehensive/fearful \"at the time of the food challenge remained \"anxiou \"' when reintroducing the allergenic food into their child 's diet. Regional participants were more likely to feel \"anxious \"about their child being able to eat that food (n \u00bc5/33, 15.2%) compared to those living in capital cities (n \u00bc6/61, 9.9%) although this was not statistically signi cant (chi-square test, p \u00bc0.449). However, further research is warranted as the un- derlying differences could be in fluenced by gender as the 5 regional children were all males, by limited access to medical services or by the small sample size. Immunotherapy Preventing or reducing the severity of an allergic reaction is the goal of immunotherapy. For 334 participants, they responded to the question of whether parents would enrol their child in a clinical trial aimed at desensitisation. For this protocol, increased doses of the food allergen would be given, and 234 parents (70.1%) would participatein the hope of increasing the threshold before reacting (n \u00bc177). However, of the 100 who declined, 51 thought it was \"too risky \", and 22 selected they could \"live with food avoidance \", while nine selected both reasons. Surprisingly, those from capital cities were more likely to decline (n \u00bc64/199, 32.2%) compared to those from regional locations (n \u00bc36/135, 26.7%), even though it was not signi cant (chi-square test, p\u00bc0.282).However, there was a signi cant drop (chi- square test, p <0.001) when 332 participants were asked if they would enrol in a clinical trial using a vaccine. Of these, 186 (56.0%) said \"yes \"they would enrol their child in a vaccine trial, with 149 (80.1%) in the hope of a cure. However, 71 from the 146 who declined thought this was \"too risky \". Regional participants were more likely to decline (n\u00bc65/134, 48.6%) compared to those from capital cities (n \u00bc81/198, 40.9%). While this was not signi cant (chi-square test, p \u00bc0.122), there is the tyranny of distance and the need to travel to participating clinics. Managing an egg allergy also surfaced as a distinguishing factor with 74 (n \u00bc155, 47.7%) declining the opportunity to participate in a vac- cine trial, compared to 93 (n \u00bc234, 39.8%) of participants reporting an allergy to peanut (chi-square test, p \u00bc0.124). While speci c allergens may have in fluenced the decision to participate, parents who reported multiple allergies to 3 or more allergens the declination rate of 77 (n \u00bc146, 52.7%) was high, although not signi cant (chi- square, p \u00bc0.300). Anaphylaxis register Signing up to a national Anaphylaxis Register was recognised as a positive step by 262 (n \u00bc332, 78.9%). The ability to select multiple reasons saw 2 primary reasons emerge. These were to \"influence government policies in health and education \" (n\u00bc232/262, 88.5%) and report on \"how many people are affected by food allergy \"(n\u00bc224/262, 85.5%). For those who declined, \"privacy \" remained the most prominent barrier (n \u00bc32/69, 46.4%) as parents did not know who would have access to such a register. Location played no consideration for those who declined to partici- pate when percentages were weighted (chi- square, p \u00bc0.624). Increasing public awareness of food allergies To improve education and awareness, in- terviewees were asked to create an advertising slogan. The purpose was left to the interviewee, and different themes emerged when analysed. Theme 1 used \"shock tactics \"to convey the mes- sage that food allergy can kill, and with this, par- ents resorted to analogies including \"like holding a gun, it can kill! \"or'like stepping in front of a semi-Volume 13, No. 10, October 2020 15trailer doing 100 km/h\". Both have graphical ele- ments designed to shock others into taking care. Theme 2 looked at the need for education to improve awareness and revolved around \"foodallergy is not a myth, it is real \"while Theme 3 looked for support and inclusiveness with the focus around the fact that food allergy \"can be managed with your help\". Role of school in managing a child 's food allergy The transition to school is an important milestone, and for 157 parents (n \u00bc301, 52,2%), food allergy had in fluenced their choice of preschool. For many (n \u00bc116/157, 73.9%), a primary consideration was school policies. This transition away from 24/7 parental care to pre- school was challenging as they reported feeling \"apprehensive/fearful \"(n\u00bc70/157) or \"nervous \" (n\u00bc60/157). Knowing their child had food allergy also in flu- enced the decision of 119 parents (n \u00bc119/247, 48.2%) when considering which primary school to enrol in. With 96 (80.7%) of the 119 parents reporting reliance on school policies, this was signi cant (chi-square test, p <0.001). Choosing a primary school known to have other children with food allergy was also a consideration for 57 (47.9%) parents, however, less so for high school(n\u00bc13, 43.3%). The number of children in public government schools (n \u00bc43, 42.6%) was lower than those in private schools (n \u00bc53, 55.8%), with 4 preferring not to answer and 1 leaving the question blank.While there was no difference between whether the school was public or private (chi-square test, p\u00bc0.307), distribution was signi cant (chi-square test, p \u00bc0.046) with more parents living in a capital city (n \u00bc40/64, 62.5%) choosing a private school. DISCUSSION Managing food allergy is challenging as parents navigate not only different social contexts but also contextualise risk, which is dynamic and situa- tional.4,18One concern that parents repeatedly identi ed when managing food allergy was the need to trust third parties, whether this was in the school environment, social interaction withmembers of the public, or manufacturers. Thisloss of control and the need to rely on others highlights the quandaries parents face in social situations when going on holidays, eating out at restaurants, and/or leaving their child in the careof others. 6,10,19However, when parents are shunned, labelled a \"helicopter parent \"or worse still, not believed, this creates a heightened sense of anxiety and fear and can signi cantly impact QoL, increase social isolation, and lead to feelings of guilt.6,20 Not only do parents need to convince others of the seriousness of allergens they must also rely on manufacturers to notify whether trace allergens are present, either throu gh cross-contamination during the manufacturing process or throughthe supply chain. 21-23However, even where manufacturers voluntarily adopt PAL, Zurzolo et al (2018) found that the risk of an adverse food reaction to unlisted ingredients in packaged food was no lower for foods with PAL than for foods with no PAL.24This failure to accurately declare allergens may account for why participants in our study chose to ignore these labels. However, risk pro ling based on PAL labels is not unique. Noimark et al (2009), Hef flee ta l (2007), and Zurzolo et al (2016) reported up to 50% of parents ignored the label \"may contain traces of nuts \",22,25,26and although lower than our study, such differences may be in fluenced by the type of allergen or changing specialist advice to maintain tolerance.26In contrast, He flee ta l (2007) and Zurzolo et al (2013) reported more parents ignored the PAL \"made on the same equipment \",25,27and this con flicted with results from our study as fewer parents purchased products with this label. To determine if resultsreflect a change in behaviour over the reporting period, from pre-2013 to 2015 or a sampling er- ror, this contradiction to previous results would bene t from further research. However, where a food-related allergic reaction does occur, all too often parents delay using an adrenaline auto-injector. In Song et al (2014), barriers to adrenaline use were identi ed, including different perceptions on symptom clas- sication. 28In another study, Kim et al (2005) found there was a positive correlation betweenempowerment and the ability to not only make16 Stockhammer et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2020) 13:100468 http://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100468informed decisions (P <0.0005) but also the comfort level when using an adrenaline auto- injector.29With 37.7% of parents reporting the \"inability to decide \"as the main reason they delayed using such a device, empowering parents is crucial. To improve outcomes, medical professionals also have an important role as they support pa- tients, acknowledge concerns, and address infor- mation needs.30,31However, medical professionals need to overcome ndings reported by Baricic et al (2015) and Lozinsky et al (2015) where parents were made to feel as though they were overreacting and GPs failed to correlate or consider the described symptoms as food allergy.32,33It is these perceptions that also resonated with interviewees. However, managing a child 's food allergy is also about personal conviction and how to manage uncertainty and risk. One area of interest is how locus of control (LOC) applies to parental strategies.34,35Parents with an internal LOC could naturally be better at managing in a crisis when compared to those who rely externally on others to take control of the situation.34,35Knibb et al (2016) found a strong self-ef cacy was an important determinant in managing food allergy, possibly accounting for over one-third of QoL variance in social activ- ities.34Fedele et al (2016), also identi ed 4 patterns of adaption based on food allergy management strategies and psychosocial functioning as parents who were optimistic had a better QoL score compared to those who reported high anxiety, a sense of loss, and hyper- vigilance.35Results from our study support these ndings as worsening scores referenced \"guilt \"and \"burden \", while better QoL scores identi ed positive aspects such as healthy eating. Despite worsening QoL, participation rates for a vaccine trial for those managing an egg allergy was low. This low uptake may be due to hope given Peters et al (2014) demonstrated infants who could regularly tolerate baked egg were more likely to outgrow their egg allergy.36Alternatively, it may also be that current strategies are already inducing tolerance. However, exploring the underlying reasons why worsening QoL37,38did not equate to a search for a cure is an area forfurther investigation.A key strength of this Australia-wide study was the inclusion of participants outside large metro- politan centres. The exploration of multiple topics uncovered current perceptions around health be-haviours, knowledge, and perceptions, which are fundamental in safeguarding against psychosocial stressors. 39However, an open survey has limitations and included the inability to determine response rates and motivation behind those who, not only completed the online survey but also chose to be interviewed, and this may limit generalisations. Nor were we able to conrm IgE-mediated allergy status; however, the use of an adrenaline auto-injector served as a proxy. The length of the survey and only being in En- glish may have discouraged participants from completing the survey. To maximise participation rates in future studies, researchers should consider translated versions of the survey. Finally, as per- ceptions change over time, a longitudinal approach should be considered to elucidate further the parental burden of managing a child with a food allergy. CONCLUSION This study adds value to the current knowledge of QoL in managing food allergies, offering a uniquely Australian perspective. A key nding of this study was the importance of social acceptanceas parents internalised risk when navigating chal- lenges in keeping their child safe. The importance of health literacy, 5,40empowerment29,37and external support from community members,41 and food manufacturers,21builds con dence and overcomes parental fear as parents tackle the reported challenges when managing a child with food allergy.
