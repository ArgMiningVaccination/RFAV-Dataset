It examines the essential functions of the components of the reproductive tract. The chapter presents a list the major female sex hormones, the four stages of follicular development and the phases of the menstrual cycle. The female sex organs are located in the lower abdomen. The components of the female reproductive tract: Fallopian tubes, Fimbria, Uterus, Cervix and Vagina. The menstrual cycle is a periodic sequence of endocrine-driven events in non-pregnant, sexually mature women, directed towards the production and release into the reproductive canal of a fertilisable egg cell or ovum, and creation of an endometrium able to effect the successful implantation of a fertilised egg. There are four main stages of follicular development: the primordial follicle, early and late primary follicles, secondary follicles, and mature follicles. Structures and Mechanisms [Jean F. Brisou](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=Jean%2BF.%2BBrisou&tab=books) in [Biofilms](https://www.routledge.com/isbn/10.1201/9781315149998), 2017 All living cells are limited by a membrane that plays an important role in adherence phenomena. Membrane proteins are traditionally broken down into two groups: structural proteins and enzyme proteins intimately linked to the membranes. Cellular membranes are composed of an assembly of intrinsic proteins located inside a lipidic layer and of extrinsic proteins emerging at the surface. Polycations have mainly been studied in adherence mechanisms of vegetal viruses. The membrane lectins of hepatocytes fix, in many mammals, galactose to form asialoglycoprotein complexes where galactose terminal residues have been identified. These lectins certainly play a role in the metabolism of sialic acid and glycoproteins in general. The type I fimbriae are slightly lipophilic and contribute to the formation of aggregates, masses, and angular packs, the specialized structures of which provide excellent, demonstrative images. The antigenic properties of the fimbriae are widely confirmed. Bacteria [D Davies](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=D%2BH%2BDavies&tab=books), [M in [Infection and Immunity](https://www.routledge.com/isbn/10.1201/9781482267884), 1999 In a clinical situation, bacteria and viruses are by far the most common causative agents of human diseases. The bacteria are single-celled organisms with both DNA and RNA (which contrasts them with viruses). Unlike eukarya, the chromosomes of bacteria are not enclosed within a nuclear membrane and they have no membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum. A cell wall is usually present which may possess appendages such as pili, fimbriae and flagella. At the simplest level bacteria can be divided into groups depending on their staining characteristics and their morphology, although biochemical, molecular and genetic techniques are also applied. Fimbriation and curliation in Escherichia coli a variety of fimbrial and afimbrial adhesins which have emerged as important contributors to intestinal colonization. E. coli O157:H7 possesses two chromosomal operons encoding long polar fimbriae (Lpf), which have been found to influence adherence in vitro and colonization in vivo. In a recent Infection and Immunity paper, we further explored the role of Lpf in E. coli O157:H7 intestinal colonization by using the infant rabbit model of STEC infection. We found that an E. coli O157:H7 Lpf-deficient mutant was outcompeted in the rabbit intestine by its parental strain, which may suggest that Lpf contributes to colonization. In contrast, the Lpf-deficient mutant showed an increased adherence to cultured intestinal epithelial cells, and we discovered that this strain overexpressed curli fibers. In this addendum article, we provide a continued perspective on the predicted roles of Lpf and curli, both in vivo and in vitro. Proliferation, Migration, and Neuronal Differentiation of the Endogenous Neural Progenitors in Hippocampus continues throughout adult life and can be regulated by the local microenvironment. To determine whether denervation stimulates neurogenesis in hippocampus, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of local neural stem cells (NSCs) in dentate gyrus the hippocampus, NSCs proliferated markedly and migrated along the subgranular layer, and more newborn cells differentiated into neurons or astrocytes. After denervation, more newborn cells in the deafferented hippocampus expressed Brn-4 and differentiated into -Tubulin III positive neurons. It is concluded that the local NSCs in hippocampus may proliferate and migrate into granule cell layer, in which changes in the deafferented hippocampus provided a suitable microenvironment for hippocampal neurogenesis and the increased Brn-4 in denervated hippocampus may be involved in this process. Prevention of pertussis: An unresolved problem Published in [Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/KHVI), 2018 [Susanna Esposito](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Susanna%2BEsposito), [Nicola Principi](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Nicola%2BPrincipi) Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. However, after the introduction of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine (wP), the annual incidence rates of the disease progressively declined. Despite this result, the inclusion of wP in the national immunization schedule of infants and young children was debated regarding its safety. Several efforts to produce vaccines based on B. pertussis components capable of evoking protective immunity with no or limited adverse events were made. Of these others, five pertussis antigens were considered possible components of acellular vaccines (aPs): pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin (PRN) and fimbria proteins 2 and 3. However, the introduction of aPs was followed by a slight but progressive increase in the incidence of pertussis. This paper discusses the potential reasons for reduced aPs efficacy. Moreover, it attempts to evaluate the real effectiveness of aPs and the potential differences between available preparations. Data analysis showed that several boosters are needed to maintain protection against pertussis and additional studies are needed to confirm the antigens that should be included in aPs to improve the prevention of pertussis.
