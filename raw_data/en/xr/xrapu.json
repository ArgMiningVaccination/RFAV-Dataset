Indeed, in the early days of the pandemic m uch of the public discussion about regaining our health and our wealth was centered on the successful development of a vaccine. Two years from the first reports of the emergence of a novel infectious disease, multiple vaccines that are safe and effective in preventing COVID -19 infection and reducing deaths from infection are available. As of December 31 , 2021 there are 33 emergency authorized or approved vaccines , including four widely distributed in Western countries and numerous others available in other c ountries. Many other vaccine candidates are still in development worldwide. T he current public discourse has now moved on to consider how best to allocate vaccines to all who might benefit from initial and ongoing access to them. The rapid development of multiple safe and effective COVID -19 vaccines appears to be both testament to the unparalleled current state of scientific expertise and quite curious. Successful vaccine development, like other therapeutics, is known to be costly, risky and uncertain. Moreover, some market failures uniquely plague vaccine development in the midst of an emergent pandemic caused by a heretofore unknown virus. This report examines the conditions of COVID -19 vaccine success from an economic perspective. I specifically s eek answers to two questions: first, what are the d rivers of successful COVID -19 vaccine creation and converse ly, the drivers of vaccine failure ; and, second, how do these d rivers matter in the spe cific experiences of COVID -19 vaccine candidates? To answer these 5 questions, between May 2021 and December 2021, I conducted an in- depth literature review, interviewed key stakeholders and conducted case studies on specific COVID -19 vaccines . Stakeholders were selected for interview from public documents of COVID -19 vaccine candidate developers, funders, and a mix of multidiscipline scholars in biology, immunology, virology, economics, law, manufacturing and regulatory science. I selected vaccine case study candidates to investigate using public documents drawn from the gr ay literature and shareholder reports. I took care to choose candidates among those that are currently approved, abandoned or still in development and from a cross section of vaccine platforms and originating countries and geographical regions. The nine drivers of COVID -19 vaccine success I ultimately identified characterize the current organization, financing and regulation of vaccine development. They include: pre- pandemic investments in open science related tools and collaborations, pre -pandemic knowledge of coronaviruses and technological development of vaccine platforms ; regulatory infrastructure ; collaboration and harmonization across agencies and countries ; the ability to hold intellectual property, license intellectual property across entities and enter into partnership arrangements across universities and private firms ; the willingness of funders to underwrite the significant costs and risks entailed in t he development of new vaccines across technologies ; innovator activities and countries; advanced purchase arrangements to guarantee revenue to innovators for vaccines after deve lopment and regulatory approval ; and innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale and \"at risk\" including through partnerships with external contract manufacturers before and after regulatory approval. Each of these drivers were repeatedly raised as important by the developers and funders of these efforts themselves. Once raised, I endeavored to place these drivers first into the wider context of previous work on the determinants of vaccine success in both non- emergent 6 and emergent settings and second as a framework for assessing the experiences of specific vaccine candidates. Details of how each of these factors related to specific vaccine candidate development efforts are described in a standalone \"Case Study \" section of the report. In none of these activities did I endeavor to quantitatively weigh the relative importance of some factors over others in determining success or failure of candidates. Instead, t he report, including the case studies , make clear that some drivers are important across efforts, while others are more relevant to selected vaccine candidates. Generally , I found in the case of COVID -19 that there has been both private sector willingness to rise to the challenge of bringing a new vaccine to market to address an emergent infectious disease threat and a public sector willingness to support pull and push incentives for vaccine success. The response by private sponsors and public institutions to COVID -19 has been unusual in the magnitude of the financing made available, the ir 'portfolio' approach to the support of multiple candidates across disparate platform technologies and previous developer successes and the cooperation between many disparate actors to support all as pects of basic science and applied research, vaccine development, production and manufacturing scale up a nd scale out to meet the needs of global populations. Moreover, all of the case study vaccine candidates took advantage of preexisting scientific knowledge of coronaviruses and how to d evelop vaccines to address them that was already documented and to a large extent available in the public domain . I discovered that intellectual property and in particular the licensing of patents between various corporate, university, nonprofit and other actors within the context of other economic incentives and institutions have played important roles in the successful development and production of currently available COVID -19 vaccines. Specifically, patents granted to governments, university based researchers and private 7 companies provide much of the knowledge of coronaviruses, the opportunities and challenges inherent in designing vaccines to address these infectious agents and the platform technologies upon which successful COVID -19 vaccines are built. Much of this knowledge predated the COVID -19 pandemic. Patents also have played a role in the development of specific ingredients critical for successful COVID -19 vaccine production. Licensing arrangements between entities holding patents appear to be important drivers of vaccine success, but existi ng evidence suggests they are highly varied, complex and largely hidden from public scrutiny. Conversely, I have not identified any credible evidence that patents per se have forestalled innovation or COVID -19 vaccine success . Several institutions appear to have play ed outsized rol es in hastening vaccine candidate successes . I provide details of these institutions in the report. Conceptually, t he need for additional opportunities for public sharing of intellectual property associated with vaccine development and production, facil itated by third parties, became more apparent as the scale of the global crises and the tendency for the pursuit of national interests over global interests emerged. Notably, various governments and multi-stakeholder institutions provided additional push and pull incentives , including the underwriting of clinical trials, advanced purchasing commitments, the de -risking of manufacturing activities and indemnifying vaccine sponsors and producers. Additional efforts to address the COVID pandemic built upon the existing edifice of formal contracts and well established scientific, regulatory, financing and governance institutions appears critical to success by providing assurances and building trust among highly diverse entities in a complex and rapidly evolving ecosystem. Among the vaccine candidates that \"failed, \" decisions by innovators to abandon development of these candidates appear largely driven by scientific and business rationales. M y 8 review of the extent empirical evidence also suggests there have been some missteps in COVID - 19 vaccine development , including but not limited to procurement activities. The results of this study are relevant to current discussions regarding access to currently available COVID -19 vaccines. They are also of importance for the future development of novel therapeutics to address emergent infectious disease. I identify several important questions for further investigation. First, I discuss the importance of additional transparency among private companies and public sector institutions and multilateral organizations to further characterize drivers of COVID -19 vaccine success. Second, while I do find that the case of COVID-19 pull and push incentives were used in combination and at massive scale, i t is possible certain combinations of push and pull activities taken alone or together may be more impactful under specific conditions. Third , vaccine success under current conditions may h ave uncertain effects on follow on innovation to address emerging variants or new disease targets. Finally, t he results of this study suggest there may be a role for forgivable loans, non-dilutive financing and other types of public finance techniques to be further developed and deployed to address emergent endemic and pandemic threats. 9 List of tables Table 1: COVID -19 Vaccines: Selected Successes and Abandoned Candidates Table 2a: COVID -19 Vaccines by Development Stage Table 2b: Summary Statistics of Current COVID -19 Vaccine Pipeline Table 3: Number of COVID -19 Vaccine Manufacturing Agreements by Vaccine Sponsor and Data Source Table 4a: Total Doses Agreed to by COVID -19 Vaccine Sponsor Table 4b: Schedule of COVID -19 Vaccine Doses Delivery Table 5a: Drivers of COVID -19 Vaccine Success Table 5b: Vaccine Case Study Characteristics Table 6a: Drivers of COVID -19 Vaccine Failure Table 6b: COVID -19 Vaccine Case Study Characteristics, Drivers of Failure 10 Section 1 : Introduction The novel disease caused by the SARS -CoV-2 virus ( COVID -19) is a shock to both our health and our wealth, with more than 5 million dead worldwide as of December 31 , 20211,2 and economic disruption that some have estimated as high as more than $16 trillion .3,4 These enormous and unprecedented costs in lives and economic disruption suggest that there are incalculable social returns to the development of therapeutics t hat effectively prevent or treat COVID -19 infections. Much of the public discussion about regaining our health and our wealth in the COVID - 19 era is centered on the successful development , production and distribution of an effective vaccine to all who might benefit from access . The first part of vaccine success is generally understood to mean the d evelopment of a product that is proven safe and efficacious, and consequently given emergency authoriz ation or approval for use in various countries ; whereas the second part of success is scaling up vaccine production and scaling out distribution to meet demand for all who may benefit from access. The first part of vaccine success, what I term \"development,\" is subject to multiple well- described market failures that are largely not unique to a disease with pandemic potential. Specifically, ex ante vaccine development is expensive, risky and highly uncertain. Nevertheless, t he degree of difficulty should be understood as being especially great in successfully bringing to market a vaccine for a newly identified infectious disease with pandemic potential. The second part of success, what I term \"production\" to meet demand for all those who would benefit, is also expensive and technically challenging . Here again, t he challenge lies in part because the process of vaccine production is the product itself; this is not unique to infectious diseases with pandemic potential but is unique to vaccines and other therapeutics that are biologically -based, including non- small molecule drugs and 11 monoclonal antibody-based products. In the midst of this current pandemic, the rewards to successful vaccine development and production are justifiably expected to be great both for innovators and society at large since demand for the product appears assured. However, as we will see ex ante\u2014in the early stages of infectious dise ase identification and characterization \u2014 demand for a successful vaccine was less certain and , as a consequence, vaccine development and production could still be underinvested in by private for-profit biopharmaceutical companies. As of December 31 , 2021, there are 33 emergency authorized or approved vaccines, four widely distributed in Western countries and numerous others available in other countries (Table 1). There are also seven vaccines which were developed through the late stages of clinical trials but then discontinued. 5 While they may be considered 'failures' by some, I discovered that some of these products have contributed to currently ongoing efforts to develop vaccines as I will discuss later (Table 1 ). Although the numbers differ slightly by s ource, more than 100 vaccine candidates were in development as of September 2021 (Table 2) .6 This is a remarkable amount of vaccine success in a relatively short period of time and strikingly so, considering past examples. For context, consider, t he mumps vaccine was the fastest vaccine developed in the modern era and took four years from isolation of the mumps virus to licensure in 1967.7 Moreover, t he COVID -19 vaccines already available for use are notably diverse in their platform technologies, including more established traditional vaccine methods such as inactivated viruses and newer methods including viral vector and mRNA methods, which have been rarely or never successfully applied to produce a vaccine to market before COVID -19 (Table 1). Vaccines for COVID -19 which were ultimately abandoned are also diverse in their platform technologies and sponsors, including some private for-profit companies that have had previous success in bringing vaccines to market (Table 1, Table 2). Vaccine 12 candi dates in the pipeline are also diverse in their platform technologies and primary sponsorship, entailing private companies , academics and other multilaterals, as well as numerous government efforts, especially in their country of origin (Table 2) . While availability and production of vaccines has scaled up considerably since the first vaccines became available (Table 3) , global equitable access to COVID -19 vaccines and the health and economic assurance of productivity they bring remains foremost in the th oughts among many stakeholders.8 Statistics on dose production delivery and capacity ( Table 3 ) and estimated vaccine dose delivery (Table 4 ) suggests a significant increase in vaccine availability over the past year . Based on these statistics, the World He alth Organization (WHO) has suggested that substantial global access to COVID -19 vaccination may be achieved sometime between 2022 and 2024.9 The remarkable s uccess of these vaccines and concerns about access to them raises many questions. This report investigates two: first, what are the d rivers of successful vaccine creation and the convers e the drivers of vaccine failure, and, second, how do these d rivers matter in in the specific experiences of successful COVID -19 vaccines ? Answers to these questions are relevant to current discussions regarding access to currently available COVID -19 vaccines and also of import ance for the future , as the COVID -19 pandemic is a warning of the public health and economic crises awaiting if we do not address the threat of antimicrobial resistance ,10 among other concerns. Several authors have already discussed likely determinants of COVID -19 vaccine success and specifically the factors that enabled acceleration of development over more expected timelines ,11 includi ng previous efforts to address other emerging infectious disease. T his speed have been attributed to the sheer magnitude of capital and labor resources devoted to addressing 13 COVID -19, an intensity of cooperation, encompassing the public and private sector s and occurring both within and across national borders and the use of innovative platform technologies that had already been developed. To be sure, as early as July 2020 more funding had already been poured into COVID -1912 vaccine development than into the development of any previous vaccine. There is also a long -established economic literature on drivers of therapeutic success. This work largely abstracts from emergent threats to national and international health and wealth including non-pandemic conditions. I draw on these literatures to systematically answer the questions posed in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic. To conduct this study, I conducted an in-depth review of the peer -reviewed published and gray literature, interview ed stakeholders and key opinion leaders and conducted in -depth case studies of COVID -19 vaccine candidates . I selected case s tudy candidates to profile based on the following criteria: (1) vaccines authorized or approved to date by at least one country's regulator, (2) a group of vaccine candidates that were abandoned in some phase of development or manufacturing by their sponsors to date, and (3) a group of vaccine candidates that are still in development. I took care to choose amon g candidates based on different vaccine platforms and those originating in various countries and geographical regions . The study began in May 2021, data collection concluded in Fall 2021, and the analyses and report w ere finalized on December 31, 2021. The remainder of the report proceeds as follows. Section two provides an overview of the traditional economic view of market failures in therapeutic development and general determinants of vaccine success based on previous literature. Section three provides an overview of how emergent pandemics alter the traditional ways economists may conceptualize vaccine development challenges and incentives aimed to correct these challenges. Section four provides 14 an overview of COVID -19 vaccine success drivers based on my review of the literature and case studies. I provide more detail regarding drivers of vaccine success that appear to be shared across specific vaccine case studies , which presumably can be generalized to other vaccine candidates still in development. Section five describes the case studies and how they relate to the drivers of vaccine success in detail. Finally, section six summarizes my conclusions, study limitations and discusses important directions for future work. 15 Section 2: Market failures and vaccine success This section provides a brief overview of theoretical, conceptual and empirical literature regarding determinants of vaccine success under non-emergent conditions. Vaccines are unique consumer products and market failures in their success are rife Vaccines are unique consumer products used to reduce the negative health consequences of infectious disease and viral transmission among individuals. Vaccine success can be conceptualized as a product of a series of steps along a continuum: t he application of basic scientific knowledge of the infectious agent to the identification and testing of vaccine candidates, their authorization or approval and their manufacturing, and finally their production to a sufficient scale to meet demand . According to Bown and Bollyky13, there are five main steps critical to getting a new vaccine from start to finish, including research and development; clinical trials; production of the drug substance including base ingredients and its formulation into a pr oduct; \"fill and finish,\" or the assembly-line process of putting a vaccine into millions of vials ; and then distribution. Empirical evidence from previous non- COVID -19 projects suggests vaccine development entail s a significant amount of costs, risks and uncertainty.14 It has been estimated that costs associated with vaccine development from discovery to approval fall into a wide range from millions15 to billions of dollars and take over a decade to complete, with an average chance of failure of 94 per cent .16 While initial outlays for vaccine research and development may be considered relatively small, the investment needed to conduct large- scale Phase III trials and then build the facilities to manufacture doses at mass scale ranges from $500 million to $1.5 billion.17 Phase III trials of vaccine candidates are the most costly of the clinical trial phases, in part because vaccines are typically intended for use by populations who may be otherwise healthy. 16 The earliest stages of vaccine development, such as preclinical studies and P hase I clinical trials for establishing safety, are the most risky and prone to failure. However , failures can and do occur in vaccine candidates in later stages of clinical development, including P hase III studies , which establish safety and effectiveness in eligible populations. Many vaccines are also destined for use in children, where the burden of proving that the benefits of vaccination outweigh its harms may be greater than in adult populations. Not all potential harms of vaccines can be detected in the limited context of clinical trials, where the population is selected to conform to narrow specifications that may not match the population that will use the vaccine post-approval. As a result, not only must sponsors of novel vaccines establish safety and efficacy through the completion of clinical trials , they must continue to monitor safety and effectiveness post -approval or post-authorization as a condition of country- specific regulatory approval and liability pro tections . The production of vaccines is also expensive and challenging as they are biologics for which the product is the process. There are many opportunities for manufacturing risk for which sponsors must recognize, plan for and mitigate. Vaccine supp ly entails specialized knowledge, organization and financing to manufacture at scale to meet demand. Many vaccine sponsors will contract with separate companies for the manufacturing of upstream base ingredients , including but not limited to adjuvants\u2014pro ducts that \"boost\" the bodies' own immune system and support vaccine efficacy \u2014and still other companies downstream for \"fill and finish. \" Redundancy in the sourcing of base ingredients to adequately meet demand is commonly purs ued by vaccine sponsors in Western countries . Vaccine production by sponsors must meet regulatory requirements to assure purchasers and the public that the product meets or exceeds safety and quality standards for each and every 17 dose sold before initial authorization and approval is grant ed by a regulatory body and thereafter vaccine sponsors or their licensees must continue to invest to assure regulators, purchasers and the public that the product is what it purports to contain. Moreover, sponsors of vaccines face country- specific consumer liabilit y requirements for potential clinical harms associated with vaccine use in targeted populations, including product failures in safety, strength or dose, and quality of production.18 Vaccine sponsors face other nonscientific business determ inants of investment in a given product or products to meet demand to address a pathogen, which may ultimately result in a company deciding not to invest or abandoning their existing investments in vaccine development and production. For the majority of potential vaccine s ponsors that are part of a for- profit company, any undertaking should expect to realize for the company profit , that is for expected revenue from the sale of the vaccine to meet or exceed the incremental costs of produc ing the vaccine. Revenue entails the expected price of the vaccine at launch and the expected quantity of sales. Since many purchasers of vaccines are governments, they possess significant purchasing power. Vaccine sponsors may be wary of investment, since governments ma y insist on substantial price concessions off expected prices. Expected quantities of sales may also be uncertain if the threat subsides or a competitor vaccine launches and becomes preferred over the sponsor's candidate due to safety, efficacy or other c haracteristics. Moreover, the virus may mutate and the sponsor's vaccine candidate may lose benefit in the face of such changes. In terms of costs, if the vaccine candidate entail s highly specialize d production facilities we expect the fixed and variabl e costs of production to be higher than that of small molecule- based drugs. In addition, the undertaking's profit, costs, risks and uncertainty will be weighed against other opportunities the sponsor could pursue with similar resources. The expenses 18 associated with investing in a new vaccine candidate can be funded using available resources the company has or can be borrowed from external funders. If the latter financing route is pursued, then outside funds will be borrowed typically from banks and venture capitalists , and those borrowers will expect a rate of return on their capital investments that is equal to the risks and uncertainty of the project and the outside uses of those funds. While more established pharmaceutical companies have access to rev enue and capital markets that may be willing to loan them funds to finance vaccine candidate development and manufacturing, e arly stage biopharmaceutical companies typically face more significant liquidity constraints. Earlier stage companies also need access to regulatory and manufacturing expertise. Identifying clinical trial endpoints, study inclusion criteria and study design that will be acceptable to meet regulatory requirements for authorization and approval and selecting pathways for market access entails significant expertise that is commonly provided by external parties. In contrast, more established biopharmaceutical companies have the advantage of in- house expertise in how best to overcome development challenges, reduce development risks and uncertainties in establishing product safety and efficacy for regulatory approval, and also enjoy existing resources or relationships with other partners for development activities, production and manufacturing at scale to meet demand . More established companies also face more competing demands on those resources, as the opportunity costs of investing in a vaccine must be weighed against the benefits of investing in potentially more lucrative products where demand is more predictable. 19 Given the expense, r isk and uncertainty inherent to vaccine success, vaccine development for known and established pathogens, such as HIV and malaria, is generally understood to be underinvested in by private for-profit biopharmaceutical companies. Moreover, given the costs 19 and uncertainties delaying investment in vaccine development and production until a product's prospects are more certain can be the most prudent path from the companies' perspective. For these reasons, before the COVID -19 pandemic there were less than 10 international for-profit biopharmaceutical companies making vaccines for sale in the U nited S tates of America and Western Europe, and many stakeholders worried that the existing incentives were too limited to sustain ongoing investment in novel vaccines. In contrast, it is United S tates and Western European country markets that are the most lucrative for new medicines, driving significant investment. Many established vaccine producers, such as Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi, GSK and Janssen, enjoy significant profit margins on therapeutic products that enjoy patent protection, including in oncology and other therapeutic areas, and can and do channel investment s awa y from vaccines , which tend to be viewed as \" low margin \" by established companies . The role of patents in vaccine development Due to these market failures, intellectual property found largely in the form of patents and less so in trade secrets, are critical determinants of successful biopharmaceutical product development, including vaccines . 20,21,22,23,24 Patents support innovation by allowing patent holders a limited term right to exclude others.25 This , in turn, allows innovators to charge prices that are above marginal costs of production and, indeed, when vaccines are made by the innovators mentioned above for Western country use, they tend to be higher priced and face limited to no competition, reflecting these protections. Knowledge required for vaccine development and production made freely available for use Some types of knowledge for va ccine success may also be freely available for use to all. This knowledge has various names, but here I term this \" open science. \" There are many tools and techniques to share knowledge freely relevant to vaccine success. Some tools are related to 20 public institutions and m ay even be required of scientists wishing to publish their work in peer- reviewed journals such as public registries of gene sequences. Other tools of open science include domestic and international clinical trial registries, preprint services , peer-reviewed publications that are made free for the public to access reporting endpoint validation, preliminary and final trial results among other activities, and publicly searchable patent and clinical trials databases. Access to tests and assays an d base and final product samples for interdependent innovation activities are also tools of open science. Some of these activities might be considered to be particularly important to earlier stages of vaccine identification and validation. Other aspects of open science, including access to testing assays, final product samples and sources of base ingredients may be more important to downstream production activities and manufacturing scale up and scale out. The \"web\" of knowledge facilitatin g vaccine success and licensing Stakeholders should view vaccines as being the product of a \"web\" of knowledge; much of the knowledge embodied in a vaccine is held by many actors and some is protected by patents or trade secrets that give the owner exclusi ve and temporary rights. Of particular relevance to this study is the insight from some recent work suggesting that institutional factors may help facilitate inventions that are complex and embody many different types of knowledge. One way innovation among patented technology is encouraged in political states that endorse and enforce patents is through the use of licensing between one patent holder and another patent holder. The foundational technology needed to develop a vaccine can be invented in a university lab setting or startup research firm, protected through patents, and subsequently licensed out to a for-profit company, multilateral entity or government for further development 21 and production. While the entity ultimately receiving the regulatory approval or authorization for vaccine sale may be perceived as the product \"inventor\" because they transform the foundational technology into the final market product by the public, in practice innovation is multistep, interdependent and multiparty. When patents are not enough to support vaccine success The ability to profit off new therapeutics as a monopolist producer for a limited period of time in addition to support from open science may not be enough to induce innovators to invest in the development of new therapeutics to meet demand in non- emergent threats . This may be especially true when the targeted infectious disease are viewed as concentrating among small populations and those with potentially scarce resources to pay for access to a vaccine once brought to market. In the latter circumstances, governments, philanthropis ts and multilateral organizations have supported various aspects of vaccine candidate identification, testing, manufacturing and distribution to meet demand relat ed to some prioritized threats, such as malaria and HIV . Pull incentives for vaccine success Conceptually, patents are a type of \"pull\" incentive for innovation. There are other types of \"pull\" incentives that have been used in the context of previous vaccine success.26 For example, states or other purchasers can commit in advance to buy a prespecified quantity of vaccines when they are approved or authorized by regulatory bodies at an agreed to price. The agreed price is typically set to cover at a minimum the product's development and manufacturing costs. These so -called advanced purchase agreements are the approach taken for childhood vaccines in the U nited S tates of America and a number of other countries. When this type of 22 contract is used for domestic purposes in the United S tates of America it is sometimes referred to as a \"subscription model.\"27 An alternative pull approach is an advanced market commitment (AMC), where the price, but not the quantity, of a vaccine to be purchased is agreed to in advance of approval or authorization. Under an AMC, a country or a number of countries and potentially other purchasers commit to a minimum price to be paid per person up to a certain number of individua ls immunized. There are a number of advanced market commitments entered into by selected countries and multilateral organizations for therapeutics that prevent or treat infectious disease .28 For both of these alternative pull arrangements, the price of additional purchases can stay the same or change depending on the agreement and prespecifi ed market conditions. These arrangements can and often do set safety and quality standards for a therapeutic to meet. For example, the operative regul atory body approval or authorization for the country or population intended to be served by the product is typically part of this agreement. If no suitable product meeting these prespecified standards were to be developed, no payments are made. However, if a company was successful in making the product but the immediate need for the product subsides, the agreements can still provide some payment to sponsors for their efforts to be rewarded in part. Under both arrangements, subsequent improvements in the product or additional products to aid the effectiveness of the first can also be rewarded by splitting the commitment or adding additional payments. Pull incentives resolve some of the commitment problems vaccine sponsors perceive in vaccine development. They can also smooth out liquidity constraints for vaccine sponsors and may be particularly helpful for emerging start -up companies in raising other forms of capital to support their development and production efforts. 23 Push incentives for vaccine success Push incentives include the government underwriting of research, including but not limited to government-funded research into the biological mechanism of infection and disease, and the support of the establishment of safety of novel product development. Other types of push incentives less commonly used include a government or a non- government multilateral organization underwriting clinical trials to establish vaccine safety and efficacy and the underwriting of manufacturing facili ties and base material pr oduction to help ramp up and out vaccine production. While much of the forme r clinical trials related work is typically conducted by universities or multilateral organizations, much of the latter manufacturing related work is commonly conducted by biopharmaceutical companies and other industry vendors. 24 Section 3: How emergent infectious disease with epidemic or pandemic potential create unique challenges and opportunities for vaccine success This section provides an overview of how emergent epidemics and pandemics alters the traditional ways economists conceptualize vaccine development challenges and incentives aimed to correct these challenges. The scientific challenges inherent to bringing a successful vaccine to market is expected to be g reater for a new disease, such as COVID -19, in which knowledge of the disease is rapidly evolving at the same time as the virus itself. Emerging pathogens have a way of focusing interest in novel vaccine development by the public, purchasers and governmen ts; vaccine sponsors will be naturally attracted to try to meet such interests and support disease prevention and treatment efforts . Yet , emerging pathogens also present challenges to private for -profit biopharmaceutical company investment due to the uncertainty of whether the emerging threat , and, consequently, the utility of a vaccine to prevent its spread or lessen its health impact, will wane. The risks and costs of investment for vaccine sponsors may be even greater in the midst of a pandemic as manufacturing sufficient doses to meet demand entails both scaling-up production and scaling -out distribution when typical ly supply chains and labor skilled in these and related tasks may be disrupted. As a consequence, in the midst of an emerging epidemic or pandemic, assurances may need to be made to private vaccine sponsors that they will be compensated for their investments if the threat resolves or their product is no longer needed. These assurances are usually given by a government, a coalition of governments or multilateral organizations, and private philanthropis ts and are termed \"de-risking\" investment activities . When private company 25 investments are \"de- risked ,\" some of the risks and uncertainties discussed above are in effect transferred from the innovating company to the public or other entity or entities. In the face of addressing emergent infectious disease with epidemic or pandemic potential in the past several decades , push incentives have almost always been erected alongside pull inc entives to support vaccine success .29 For example, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the US government utilized both pull and push incentives to support vaccine success ; these included the federal government contracting with vaccine manufacturers in advance for quantity to be supplied at an agreed to price as the sole domestic purchaser , the underwriting of much of the cost of development and production through grants and help with regulators for the product to meet approval standards.30 In the past two decades, t he use of both pull and push incentives for vaccine and therapeutic development were also employed to address the threat of anthrax, Ebola and Zika by governments and other funders. Pull and push incentives on their own have benefits and costs and consequently using them together in the face of emergent pathogens may resolve individual challenges while strengthening opportunities for success. Traditional pull mechanisms alone may be insufficient if they only make commitments for successfully developed and delivered products, forcing the innovative company to absorb all the risk. At the same time, some form of a guarantee of demand for a vaccine once developed has been shown to be need ed as an additional incentive and to stimulate ongoing research and development efforts by the private sector . The important role of trusted third- party institutions in supporting vaccines success in the face of emergent threats The success of vaccine development against other emergent infectious diseases also underscores the importance of preexisting institutions in building knowledge, facilitating sharing 26 and cooperation and lending the weight of credibility to such activities . Institutions can also mitigate commitment concerns on the part of multiple parties and reduce other risks and uncertainties uniquely associated with bringing vaccines to market . Institutions can support such activities by establish ing norms, supporting open communication, shar ed responsibilities and enforcement activities . Stakeholders I interviewed for this report and the case studies I detail below highlight three general types of preexisting institutions important to vaccine success in the face of emergent threats . The firs t include long-standing regulations administered by regulatory agencies that set standards for vaccine approval and ensure that pharmaceutical companies bringing vaccines to market meet minimum standards for vaccine safety and quality. If and when liability concerns arise with the use of a particular vaccine, regulatory institutions also ensure responsibility is apportioned fairly and victims are compensated. Th ese activities are critical in the face of an emergent threat when desperat ion and political expediency may lend itself to the loosening of approval and manufacturing standards and calls for broad liability exemptions. Regulatory agencies include but are not limited to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). There are also cross - national efforts to standardize regulatory requirements of novel vaccine and other therapeutics development to address emergent pathogens. They include the World Health Organization's (WHO) prequalification program that provides advice to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other United Nations agencies on the acceptability, in principle, of vaccines considered for purchases by such agencies for vaccination programs they administer. The second type of institutions are state -sponsored government a gencies and multilateral organizations that act to support vaccine development and production at risk . Perhaps the most 27 notable example of this type of institution relevant to vaccine success in the face of emergent disease is found in the United S tates of America, but other countries have agencies that serve similar functions . In 2010 the US Congress created a specialized subagency of the Department of Health and Human S ervices (HHS), the US Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), to support the advanced identification and development of medical countermeasures critical to ameliorating perceived public health and defense threats.31 BARDA identifies important areas for product development, funds research and development (R&D) efforts by pharmaceutical companies, and may design, fund or provide other technical assistance in clinical research. Since its inception, BARDA has created and maintained vaccine and other therapeutic manufacturing capacity and by directly contracting for manufacturing and therapeutic supply to be available when the need arises. Prespecified commitments to price or to price and quantity for successful vaccines and other therapeutics can be and has been pursue d by BARDA. For example, anthrax therapeutics were among the first projects pursued by BARDA , which contributed to the development and supported the path to manufacturing for three products: Anthim (obiltoxaximab), Raxibacumab and Immune Globulin (which is also being tested for use in treating COVID -19). BARDA spent approximately $200 million to ensure G SK's development, production and supply of the antitoxin Raxibacumab for the Strategic National Stockpile. C urrently , the European Union does not have an equivalent agency to BARDA, although in the face of the COVID -19 pandemic the founding of such an institution has been proposed by member countries, this will be discussed below. Similarly , multilateral organizations representing the joint interests of global actors in the face of emergent threats are instrumental in developing and delivering vaccines and other therapeutics . In terms of post-development purchasing and distribution, the paradigmatic 28 institution is UNICEF, which has led the supply of vaccines to address childhood disease through its partners for more than 20 years.32 UNICEF has also increasingly steered investment by private and public partners into the development of new vaccines and other technologies to support their vaccination programs. In terms of supporting new vaccine development to address emergent pathogen threats, the paradigmatic multilateral institution active in recent years is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI).33 CEPI was founded in 2017 to advance the development of vaccines for a select set of emerging infectious diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential and with global needs and global access front of mind , rather than representing the interests of individual nations or regions. Created as a result of lessons learned during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa where there was limited therapeutic efforts to scale up or deploy, CEPI was designed similarly to BARDA in that it can swiftly deploy both push and pull mechanism s to support the development of vaccines and therapeutics to address emergent pathogens threats . One of the ways CEPI supports global access is by requiring successful vaccines produced with its support to be accessible first and foremost to low-resource settings. In addition to these activities, CEPI provides significant technical assistance to vaccine sponsors in meeting regulatory requirements by various oversight bodies, including for WHO prequalification . 29 Section 4: Drivers of COVID-19 vaccine success In this section, I summarize the findings of my review of the literature, interviews with stakeholders and the completion of case studies to elucidate the drivers of COVID -19 vaccine success. Specifically, I define the drivers and provide additional background regarding the SARS -CoV-2 virus including some details regarding public knowledge of COVID -19 dise ase and virus characteristics and a description of various institutions that appear critical to supporting knowledge and other necessary ingredients for successful COVID -19 vaccines. Section 5 provides detailed summaries of the vaccine candidate case studies. A brief note on empirical methodology I start with a brief note on the empirical methodology I employed to conduct this study. Stakeholders to interview were drawn from experts in vaccine development and key opinion leaders in the funding and distribution of vaccines identified through my literature search, including executives at numerous pharmaceutical companies engaged in COVID -19 vaccine and therapeutic development and officials in each of the institutions detailed above and discussed below. I conducted the interviews via telephone and video conference between May and September 2021. To select case studies, I reviewed the international registry of clinical trials and clinicaltrials.gov to identify COVID -19 vaccine candidates in development since the inception of the epidemic in January 2020. Other data sources that were useful in conducting this review were COVID -19 vaccine trackers, available through various public sources and the peer- review literature, various preprint services and the shareholder reports of the vaccine developers themselves when available. I selected case study candidates to profile based on the following criteria: (1) vaccines authorized or approved to date by at least one country's regulator, (2) a group of vaccine candidates that were abandoned in some phase of development or 30 manufacturing by their sponsors to date, (3) and a group of vaccine candidates that are still in development. I took care to choose candidates from different vaccine platforms and those originatin g in various countries . Data collection began in May 2021 and analysis concluded in December 2021 . The study design builds on previous efforts seeking to answer related questions using similar methodological approaches.34 Summary of drivers of COVID -19 vaccine success Table 5 enumerates the drivers of COVID -19 vaccine success . The drivers can be divided into those that are common across vaccine candidates and ones that appear especially germane to some but not all vaccine candidates . I discuss drivers 4 to 6 as a group since they are closely related to each other. Driver 1: Open science related to national and international research and scientific collaborations The SARS -CoV-2 genome mapping by scientists appears unprecedented in its speed and international involvement by scientists working all around the world, which appears to have been supported by numerous open science related tools.35 A Chinese scientist working at the Fudan University and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Cente r was the first to successfully sequence the virus, now known as SARS -CoV -2, suspected in sickening people in the Chinese city of Wuhan.36 According to public reports, Professor Zhang Yong- Zhen received the sample on January 3 , 2020, he and his team in collaboration with a consortium of scientists working in many countries successfully identified and sequenced the virus by January 5, 2020 and uploaded the genomic sequence of SARS -CoV -2, to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Ge nBank (a comprehensive genetic sequence database administered by the NIH ) on January 5, 2020. Since public 31 posting of genomic sequences on GenBank can take time to process, Zhang's colleague, Edward C. Holmes, a scientist at the University of Sydney, expe dited the public release of the information by posting the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 to the website Virological.org on behalf of the consortium on January 11, 2020. It is this public posting that forms the basis of all other public and private efforts to characterize the initial virus and emerging variants. Following Zhang's initial genome posting, scientists mapped about 20,000 viral genomes within three months . One study37 found that more than 23,000 articles, including more than 10,000 research papers, on COVID -19 had been published in scientific journals by the end of June 2020 and that more than 31,000 documents related to COVID -19 were catalogued on PubMed Central by mid -July 2020. Technical information sharing also appears to have rapidly expanded in depth and in breadth during the pandemic.38 By early May 2020, four popular preprint servers, medRxiv, arXiv, bioRxiv and ChemRxiv, had already posted nearly 4,000 COVID -19-related studies spann ing disciplines from immunology to biophysics. Additionally, among a selection of leading peer-reviewed journals, the average time between submission and publication of COVID -19-related manuscripts has been documented to be half what was standard 39 for tho se journals prior to the pandemic. A quick s earch of PubMed Central ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) on December 31 , 2021 by myself with the keywords \" COVID -19\" returned an incredible 2 75,714 documents. These activities , in turn , appear to have been facilitated by additional tools, techniques and resources supported by numerous governments, multilateral organizations and philanthropis ts and predating COVID -19. F or example, the genetic sequence of the virus and subsequent refinements wer e publicly shared by scientists working all over the 32 world and facilitated by various platforms that allow for free posting and free access to information posted. This includes platforms maintained by the NCBI , a multidisciplinary research group composed of scientists, employed by government labs, universities and other multilateral organizations and responsible for maintaining a number of publicly available databases employed by scientists and vaccine developers in the specific case of COVID -19. This includes the GenBank genetic sequence database, which contains sequences submitted by individual laboratories and by data exchange with the international nucleotide sequence databases, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ). NCBI also developed, funds and maintains BLAST, a program for gene sequence similarity instrumental in identifying genes and genetic features relevant to COVID -19. Other preexisting international resources that appear to be important to COVID -19 vaccines include the website Virological.org and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/). The former is \"a discussion forum for analysis and interpretation of virus molecular evolution and epidemiology\" to generate real -time epidemiological information that is interpretable and actionable by public health bodies hosted online by the ARTIC Network and supported by funds from the Wellcome Trust.40 The GISAID Initiative promotes the rapid sharing of genetic sequence and related clinical, epidemiological data associated with human viruses, and geographical as well as species -specific data associated with avian and other animal viruses, to help researchers understand how viruses evolve and spread during epidemics and pandemics. The Initiative is a public-privat e partnership between the Initiative's administrative arm Freunde of GISAID e.V., a registered multilateral association, and governments of the Federal Republic of Germany , the official host of the GISAID platform, Singapore and the United S tates of Americ a with support from private and corporate philanthropis ts and received support from the 33 European Commission between 2014 and 2017. Notably, GISAID was a partner in the PREDEMICS consortium41 (Preparedness, Prediction and Prevention of Emerging Zoonotic Viruses with Pandemic Potential using Multidisciplinary Approaches) and leader in the development of databases for \"zoonotic viruses with epidemic potential in Europe\" and facilitated interdisc iplinary studies at European universities and national and international health organizations to compile data on patterns of transmission and disease emergence, and immune mechanisms of protection and novel prevention strategies. Second, the tools and techniques of gene sequencing and mapping all owe their origin to additional scientific tools, techniques, assays and other materials associated with the Human Genome Project and funded by governments, philanthropis ts and ultimately private companies, including substantial funds from the US Department of Energy, NIH and the Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom.42 GenBank itself was developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in the U nited S tates of America a nd later transferred to the National Library of Medicine. These tools include DNA clone libraries, a crucial resource in the development of genome sequencing, sequencing protocols, chemical reagents and enzymes all required to conduct this work, and publi c SNP libraries that can be accessed and searched43 and have been named in various publications related to characterizing COVID -19.44,45 Driver 2: Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology leveraged by innovators That scientists and various other stakeholders and policymakers knew enough about coronavirus pre- pandemic to characterize the no vel virus based on its taxonomic and genomic relationships to other known coronaviruses suggests the existence of other foundational knowledge. The present outbreak of the coronavirus- associated acute respiratory disease was 34 quickly identified as being caused by a coronavirus ,46 designated as SARS -CoV-2 and named coronavirus disease 19 ( COVID -19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 \"due to its taxonomic and genomic relationships with the species s evere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus.\"47 What scientists already knew at the time of the initial reporting of the outbreak was that coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses infecting vertebrates, named for the crown -like spikes on their surface.48 Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales and can widely spread in humans, other mammals and birds, and cause respiratory, intestinal, liver and nervous systems diseases , among others.49 Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in the mid-1960s. Seven common HCo Vs are coronavirus (SARS -CoV), Middle respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and current SARS- CoV-2. CoV-229E and CoV-OC43 have been acknowledged as the cause of the common cold in adults since the mid -1960s. At the time of the initial reporting of the pandemic, scientists and other stakeholders also knew that SARS-coronavirus RNA replication is unique, involving two RNA- dependent RNA polymerases.50,51 Much of this foundational knowledge was reported in peer-reviewed publications and listed in Pubmed in the early to mid-2000s. Most of the non-live or attenuated virus- based COVID -19 vaccines target SARS -CoV-2 proteins. Scientists knew at the time of the initial outbreak that coronavirus' genomes encode four structural proteins involved in various viral processes common to all coronaviruses. They include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N) structural proteins.52 It is the spike protein that allows the virus to enter into human cells, and the virus 35 that causes COVID -19 appears to have a unique spike protein sequence, the \" furin cleavage\" site, initially characterized and published in Antiviral Research in April 202053 and then confirmed subsequently. Innovators, including private companies , leveraged preexisting knowledge related to coronaviruses paired with vaccine platform technologies developed to target other infectious disease including HIV, pandemic flu and other threats to public health to support specific COVID -19 vaccine development in several ways .54 For example, Harris has reported that HIV- related vaccine and therapeutic development efforts have had an outsized impact on vaccine development in general in the intervening time periods and specifically led to COVID -19 vaccine success.55 In addition, numerous reports suggest it is notable that SARS -CoV-2 is the third novel Betacoronavirus in the past 20 years to cause substantial human disease.56 Coronaviruses have long been predicted to have a high probability of causing zoonotic disease and pandemics , and, as a consequence, US pandemic preparedness efforts at least since 2000 , including medical countermeasure investments , had funded basic scientists at the NIH and NIAID and academic researchers at various universities to study MERS-CoV as a prototype Betacoronavirus pathogen to optimize vaccine design, dissect the humoral immune response to vaccination and identify mechanisms and correlates of protection. Moreover , developing antibodies to the prefusion spike protein of coronaviruses had already been considered critical for successful vaccine development pre- COVID pandemic since natural spike proteins in isolation are inherently unstable and do not retain the prefusion shape.57 Long before the COVID -19 pandemic, NIH and NIAID scientists working with academic researchers were working on ways to build antibodies to the prefusion spike protein. 36 Other COVID -19 vaccines are based on pre-pandemic work that had establ ished coronaviruses are RNA -based . The genetic instability of RNA viruses has long been considered a challenge to develop effective vaccines to mitigate the effects of such viruses.58 Nevertheless, the NIH in collaboration with extramurally funded univers ity researchers and BARDA59 in collaboration with private companies had for decades invested in the spike protein technology and the messenger RNA (or mRNA) platform for vaccine development to address emerging infectious disease as well as other diseases o f interest including some forms of cancer. It is this technology that is used in the Pfizer/BioNtech , Moderna COVID -19 vaccines and other mRNA vaccines . 60 Some of this activity is also related to investments for combating pandemic flu and supported in part by governments including the U nited Kingdom and Germany, and some multilateral institutions and philanthropic organizations mentioned in the preceding section. Driver 3: Regulatory infrastructure and related activities As mentioned above, many individual countries have robust regulatory authorities evaluating the safety and efficacy of new vaccines and other therapeutics pre-pandemic. When the pandemic was first reported there was an increased amount of public- private collaboration to support vaccine development in meeting regulatory standards across national borders. The prominent collaboration supporting such activities is the Accelerating COVID -19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) partnership.61 ACTIV is led by the NIH and involves several US governmental agencies, including BARDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. It also involves the EMA and representatives from academia, philanthropic organizations and pharmaceutical companies. 37 The main goal of ACTIV is to develop a collaborative framework for prioritizing vaccine and drug candidates, streamlining clinical trials and coordinating regulatory processes. In particular, through ACTIV, the NIH has centrally determined the allocation of limited national biomedical resources62 such as nonhuman primates and Animal Biosafety Level 3 labs across the prioritized studies. Add itionally, ACTIV's partners agreed to contribute their respective clinical trial capacities (for example, access to clinical trial sites and volunteer networks), irrespective of the vaccine or drug candidate to be studied, to increase efficiency, prevent the wasteful duplication of trials and e nsure patients' participation in prioritized clinical trials. ACTIV has been accompanied by intensified coordination among international regulatory authorities , in particular, the FDA, the EMA and other members of the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Agencies . Increased coordination in this domain facilitates the rapid sharing of information63 on the landscape of medical products for COVID -19 and associated clinical trials. It also helped better align regulatory approaches to COVID -19 vaccines and specifically decide and communicate thresholds for vaccine approval and pre-authorization in advance of regulatory review. Th ese resources were cited repeated ly by innovators as a critical step in vaccine success, since with these standards communicated in advance and in a coordinated fashion, the individual innovators could marshal resources to help meet these standards and also make decisions about whether to continue to invest in candidates given these standards. Liability for potential harm related to the use of vaccines post-approval and distribution is also an important regulatory effort. In the United S tates of America, the enactment of the PREP Act allow ed the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue a declaration that extends liability protections to entities and individuals who manufacture, 38 distribute or administer covered medical countermeasures, including vaccines, against a public health threat or emergency. At the time of writing, n either the European Commission nor the World Trade Organization has similar authority to extend indemnity to vaccine manufacturers in the face of a public health threat or national emergenc y. As a result, vaccine sponsors must enter into individual liability agreements with non -US governments and multilateral organizations. Several people I spoke to in conducting this study suggested this inactivity is viewed as an impediment to the succes sful distribution of vaccines to all in need. Drivers 4-6: Willingness of private companies and investors to pursue vaccine development based on preexisting intellectual property and institutions facilitating cooperation Once the S ARS -CoV-2 virus was identified scientists, private corporations, governments and other institutions raced to support vaccine development efforts, which took on even more urgency as the pandemic was declared. 64 Here I describe some features of these responses that appear to b e shared across candidates . The first feature is cooperation. Much early COVID-19 vaccine development activity appears to have been facilitated by cooperation among and across institutions with preexisting knowledge of vaccine technologies, clinical development activities and capacity, vaccine production technique s and facilities. Notably, the NIH, the Jenner Institute,65 the Salk Institute,66 many university -based researchers and CEPI , among others, collaborated with pr ivate vaccine developers on early vaccine research and development activities . Some of these institutions , notably CEPI, play a more formal role in facilitating cooperation in later stages of the pandemic and vaccine production and distribution. The second feature is patents among other forms of intellectual property. Numerous stakeholders suggested that it is notable that preexisting arrangements with the US Patent and 39 Trademark Office enabled the incorporation of patented sequence data into GenBank, which facilitated the pursuit of intellectual property discussions among innovators and investors. Much evidence of the role of intellectual property in successful vaccine development comes from investigative reporting into selected vaccine candidates I describe in the case studies below. More information is currently shielded from public view. For example, the existence and precise content of patents is limited by the timing of patent filing, registration and approval by patent authorities in various countries. Some of this ambiguity may resolve itself in time, as one of the important features of patents are requirements for disclosure and there is a lag between patent filing, granting and public disclosure that is slowly coming into view . With respect to COVID -19 vaccines, p erhaps the most publicly discussed public patents are related to the spike protein technology critical for mRNA vaccine development .67 According to a recent report by KEI, the spike protein technology critical for mRNA v accine development was conceived in 2016 by scientists with the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the University of Texas.68 Specifically, NIH scientists working with academic researchers came up with a particular solu tion to address the prefusion spike protein antibody development.69 They engineered a new way of \"freezing\" coronavirus spike proteins in the prefusion shape. The prefusion spike protein for an earlier coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV), produced a stronger antibody response at lower doses than the naturally occurring protein in mice. The approach required substituting two amino acids with prolines near the central helix and heptad repeat 1; this is often referred to in the literature as the \"the 2P approach .\" The scientists filed a patent application covering this approach. W hen SARS -CoV-2 emerged, and its genomic sequence was made public and confirmed, public reports suggest the scientists realized the same approach could work for the 40 new virus. They then filed another patent application. The KEI report suggests 2P technology has been used by various mRNA vaccine candidates, including but not limited to candidates targeting COVID -19. These include Medigen Vaccine GeoVax, Inc.; ExcellGene SA; and Going beyond the 2P approach , a 2021 report published in Nature used patent network analysis techniques to detail the complex web of patents and licensing deals surrounding COVID -19 vaccine development.70 The authors identified patents that were relevant to various vaccine technology platforms and used US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings to identify pertinent licensing deals . The authors identified mRNA- based vaccine candidates for COVID -19 developed by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNtech, CureVac and Arcturus using mRNA technology. All of these technologies involve patents held by various entities including but not limited to the 2P tec hnology discussed above. They include patents related to lipid nanoparticles used to deliver the mRNA to the cells to avoid mRNA degradation. The candidates also cite patents related to delivery system technology required to achieve a desired biological response, some of which appear to have been licensed by Moderna from several other companies. Among these critical aspects of mRNA vaccine delivery know -how, ownership of the lipid nanoparticle technology appears most important. For the mRNA to be delivered into human cells and give instructions it must be wrapped in microscopic fragments of fat known as lipids.71 This delivery mechanism was not made by Moderna, Pfizer/ BioNtech or other mRNA vaccine candidates but rather originally developed by Canadian sc ientists for which a complex 41 web of patents are held by universities and private companies72 and in turn licensed out to mRNA vaccine manufacturers. From this work, we also know that the Moderna vaccine relied on some early work on lipid nanoparticles that was done jointly by the University of British Columbia and Arbutus Biopharmaceuticals in 1998.73 SEC filings show that patents relating to this early technology were solely assigned to the University of British Columbia and then licensed back to Arbutus. Further analysis reveals that in 2012 Arbutus licensed a set of patents relating to the delivery of nucleic acids to Acuitas Therapeutics. In 2016, Acuitas entered into a development and option agreement with CureVac, which included access to patents on lipid nanoparticle technology. Acuitas also granted a sublicense to Moderna; however, in 2016 Arbutus declared that Acuitas's sublicense to Moderna was improper and took to the Canadian legal system for remedy. The litigation in Canada was eventually settled, but in 2018 Moderna began filing challenges to the validity of three of Arbutus's patents, which concluded with the cancellation of claims in two of the three challenges. Moreover, Arbutus also entered into an agreement with Roivant to spin out Genev ant, which received a license for the patent portfolio on lipid nanoparticles. Like Moderna's mRNA vaccine, the Pfizer /BioNtech vaccine requires significant supplies of lipid nanoparticles to encase and deliver the mRNA into the body's cells after inoculation. BioNtech licensed technology from Acuitas but the lipids were then manufactured at scale elsewhere. Genevant also sublicensed some patents to BioNtech, who then entered into an agreement with Pfizer to develop a COVID -19 vaccine. One interesting example of licensing arrangements facilitating COVID -19 vaccine success relates to Novavax, a company making a vaccine that has only been approved for use in the E uropean Union as of this writing . The Novavax COVID -19 vaccine relies on a specialized 42 adjuvant excipient from the soap-bark tree of Chile\u2014Matrix -M\u2014which helped stimulate a strong immune responses to the antigen. This adjuvant had pre-pandemic non- COVID -19 purposes, and Novavax originally manufactured it in Sweden. In June 2020, Novavax signed agreements with two other companies to manufacture the adjuvant at the scale needed for its expected vaccine sales. AGC Biologics would produce it at facilities in Denmark and Washington State, as would PolyPeptide Group in California and Sweden. Desert King, another California company, was tasked with acquiring the critical starting material of Matrix -M. One other interesting example of licensing technology between firms is related to the BioNTech vaccine. Pfizer developed and patented the first st age of the vaccine product, DNA plasmids. P lasmids are then frozen, packed and shipped to other plants where the DNA is turned into the mRNA \u2014the active biopharmaceutical ingredient in the vaccine. The vaccine case studies also make clear that multiple companies are licensing 74 their proprietary vaccine adjuvants to other developers. Adjuvants are substances added to a vaccine to improve its immunogenicity, which can reduce the amount of vaccine required per dose, enabling more doses to be manufactured. Adjuvants can also improve vaccine effectiveness in susceptible populations, including older adults. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Seqirus and Dynavax have all committed to making adjuvants available for use in novel COVID -19 vaccines developed by other sponsors. Finally , on the licensing of intellectual property to support COVID -19 vaccine development there are only a handful of systematic sources in the public domain. The majority of these agreements are privately held trade secrets. The Global Healthcare Inn ovation Alliance Accelerator (GHIAA) is an independent and interdisciplinary think tank that provides research, education, advocacy and support to stakeholders involved with global health agreements and 43 related policies.75 GHIAA has created and curates the MAPGuide, a tool that enables practitioners and policymakers to access and explore analysis of actual and template contractual provisions from global health alliance agreements. The MAPGuide provides links, analysis and commentary on publicly available C OVID -19 vaccine agreements. On their website as of December 31 , 2021 there are links to two dozen vaccine sponsor contracts with annotations related to specific content. 76 The vaccines targeted by these contracts are diverse in their platforms and their stage of development. Contracts are also diverse in the involved parties, entailing arrangements between patent holders and between vaccine sponsors, governments and other funders. On their website currently is one contract involving a COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca) and a base ingredient supplier (Fiocruz) entailing technology transfer through a licensing agreement. 77 However, what is available currently on the website is limited and many, if not most, of the relevant contracts are still not in the public domain. Driver 7: The willingness of funders to underwrite costs and risks entailed in the development of new vaccines across platforms, companies and countries in advance of approval Innovators, nati onal governments and multilateral organizations have relied heavily on agreements to fund COVID -19 vaccine development in advance of regulatory approval. Many, but not all funders, have employed a \"portfolio\" approach to such investments pre-funding vaccine dose delivery across a variety of vaccine platforms and companies . These include the extensive use of advanced purchasing agreements. Here I first highlight several key institutions that entered into advanced purchasing agreements among other funding arrangements common across COVID -19 vaccine case study candidates. 44 Operation Warp Speed ( OWS) and other related government activities supporting vaccine development pre-approval OWS78,79 was launched on May 15, 2020 to accelerate the development, manufacture and distribution of COVID -19 vaccines to serve largely the needs of the US population. OWS is a partnership between the US Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), including activities stewarded by the subagencies BARDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Department of Defense (DOD). Funds supported significant \"push\" financing to entice major biopharmaceutical companies to prioritize the COVID -19 vaccine market and \"pull\" incentives through guaranteed purchases for the US population. Specifically, OWS partnered with several private companies to accelerate vaccine development in advance of approval . For example, OWS supported COVID -19 vaccine development by Johnson & Johnson, Oxford/Astra Zeneca, Moderna, Merck, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) vaccine platforms.80 Many details regarding OWS decision -making, investments and spending are not public. Press reporting in Fall 202081 indicated that roughly $2.5 billion had been allocated to general funding to support vaccine development efforts, with the remainder going to advance purchase agreements. It also has been reported82 that the total OWS budget in 2020 reached $18 billion.83 OWS' s spending on these activities appears to sit on top of NIH spending on basic services related to emerging infectious disease including coronaviruses and BARDA spending84 on vaccine development and production to treat emerging infectious disease mentioned above. Estimates of direct US government spending on the development, manufacture and advanced procurement of COVID -19 vaccines vary considerably based on data sources included and the timing of data collection, but extant evidence suggests they are unprecedented in their scale and 45 scope. Recent estimates from the Congressional Research Service, and the Government Accountability Office , provide government spending estimates of between $18 billion and $23 billion. Most recently the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the BARDA alone has spent $19.3 billion on COVID -19 vaccine development to date. To put this spending in perspective, Harris estimate s between 2000 and 2019, $15.3 billion was spent on HIV vaccine research. Eighty percent of this spending was paid for by the US federal governmen t. As a result of these activities, numerous sources credit the US government's investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines as accelerat ing their availability. Other countries pursued similar investment strategies to the U nited S tates of America. For example, the German government provided grant support for basic science that turned into a university spin out pre- pandemic, called BioNtech for their own mRNA vaccine pl atform.85 With the advent of the pandemic, the company raised additional financing from the private sector and the German government gave additional support to BioNtech to help with COVID -19 vaccine development. One source reports the German government gave BioNtech $445 million, enabling the firm to establish proof of principle for their COVID -19 vaccine in sufficient detail to support the partnership with Pfizer. It has also been reported86 that the United Kingd om has spent more than $4 billion, and the European Union has committed even more to support COVID -19 vaccine development. In each of these contexts, funding is divided between financing development and securing vaccine doses using advanced purchasing agr eements . Some middle -income countries, such as Brazil and Indonesia, have also made advance purchase arrangements for COVID -19 vaccines. In contrast, the European Commission87 made commitments to COVID-19 vaccines similar to the U nited S tates of America in kind and across a variety of vaccine candidates and 46 platforms but much less in magnitude compared to the commitment of the US government. In June 2020, Brussels launched a \u20ac2.7 billion vaccine Emergency Support Instrument (ESI). The ESI provided EU members and Norway the option to purchase an agreed upon amount of vaccines within a given time frame at an agreed price. In return, it supported part of the upfront costs incurred by vaccine suppliers , as a type of ' down payment' on vaccines ultimately procured by member states themselves. The size of the ESI will ultimately be surpassed by payments from national governments for the vaccines received. The Commission struck initial vaccine supply deals with several case study vaccine candidates including those pursued by AstraZeneca, Sanofi- COVID -19 emerged, CEPI quickly identified gaps and pursued a portfolio strategy to identify potential therapeutic products to invest in and pivoted to play new and leading roles in the global response. In contrast to the efforts detailed above, CEPI responded to the emergence of the COVID -19 pandemic by targeted vaccine and other therapeutic development that aimed to meet the needs of the low- and middle-income populations and transcend traditional country borders. By the end of January 2020, within three weeks of the publication of the genome sequence for COVID -19, CEPI initiated vaccine development investments with CureVac, Inovio and the University of Queensland, and Moderna, investing $44 million. Driver 8: Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of funders to support vaccine manufacturing \"at risk\" pre-product launch 47 One main challenge with advanced purchasing agreements is whether and how the vaccine sponsor and funders can provide funding to support manufacturing \" at risk \" to the vaccine spo nsor before the vaccine is approved. That the United S tates of America and other governments can and did make payments at risk to support unapproved vaccine manufacturing was cited by all stakeholders as a key to COVID -19 vaccine success . As above, the institutions supporting manufacturing efforts at risk tended to provide support across vaccine candidate sponsors and technology platforms employing a portfolio approach. For example, OWS partnered with several private companies to accelerate vaccine manufacturing at scale in advance of approval . OWS supported COVID -19 vaccine manufacturing and Other countries supported COVID -19 vaccine manufacturi ng at risk mentioned in the case studies . The European Commission made multiple advance manufacturing deals to help secure COVID -19 vaccine doses for its member nations. In one paradigmatic example, the initial call for producers resulted in a deal with AstraZeneca to provide 400 million doses and a deal with Sanofi- GSK for 300 million doses,89 although Sanofi-GSK subsequently halted its vaccine trials. Over 1.2 billion a dditional doses have been secured by contracts with Janssen/J&J , Pfizer /BioNTech, CureVac and Moderna. While the final financial terms are confidential, the initial funding is believed to represent a significant portion of the European Commission's \u20ac2.7 billion ($3.2 billion) Emergency Support Instrument, and total spending is likely to be over $10 billion. Finally, t he rapid development of several mRNA -based vaccines (including those sponsored by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNtech) with a product profile less suited to low -resourced settings, and the ability of the U nited S tates of America and other high- income countries to 48 secure priority rights to post-approval mRNA- based vaccine doses has made clear that there was no single entity charged with global leadership and a mandate to develop and deliver a diversity of innovations needed to support the global response to the pandemic across high-, middle- and low- income settings. To step into this global leadership role, in April 2020, the Access for COVID -19 Tools Accelerator (ACT -A) was launched,90 bringing together a coalition of governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, philanthropists and global health organizations (i.e., the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, Gavi, The Global Fund, Unitaid, Wellcome Trust , WHO, World Bank, UNICEF and PAHO) to expressly support both the manufacture (and equitable distribution discussed further below) of a portfolio of needed pandemic mitigation and therapeutic strategies including vaccines, tests and treatments. ACT -A activities entail threat identification, platform characteristic needs, pull and push incentives for product development, manufacture and distribution, facilitating technology transfer and licensing agreements and support for meeting regulatory standards for vaccine authorization, approval and continuous use. The vaccine portfolio of ACT- A, known as COVAX, was established to accelerate the global supply and equitable access to COVID -19 vaccines for every country in the world. In Fall 2020, COVAX announced their commitment to buying 300 million doses from AstraZeneca and the supply of an additional 200 million doses of the same vaccine from SII paid for by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In the same announcement, COVAX stated that they intended to distribute vaccines based on member -country population and need, while also maintaining a standing emergency stockpile.91 One important observation made by several stakeholders is that the key multilateral organizations supporting global access, including COVAX, cannot at the time of writing, support manufacturing efforts by willing companies at risk. 49 Driver 9: Vaccine sponsor contracts with other manufacturers to scale-up vaccine supply post- approval One main deficiency of many pre- pandemic advanced purchasing agreements is that they tend to focus heavily on the vaccine sponsor meeting the approval requirements, but less focus on vaccine sponsors or downstream ingredient suppliers meeting quantity commitments in production in specified time periods or by prioritized population. This may be in part because it is hard for to enforce advanced production commitments. COVID -19 has changed this in part because the supply chain for vaccine production is both heavily reliant on multiple parties that themselves face their own con straints related to labor and capital assets in the pandemic and in part because the nationalism exhibited by some countries , including the United S tates of America, in securing dose s in advance of others made more salient countries and funders orientation toward allocation equity. Here I discuss both these issues in more detail, again concentrating on efforts that share commonalities across vaccine candidates including those in the case studies. Also here again, many of the manufacturing support contract and production contracts are not in the public domain at this time and thus a systematic examination of public reports of manufacturing contracts that are in the public domain provides a limited picture. I expect this will resolve over time, as even in the short course of writing this report many more details and systematic collections of information have become available. Numerous vaccine sponsors have licensed their vaccines to other firms for manufacturing at scale. Perhaps the most noted arrangement is that involving the Serum Institute of India ( SII), the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume. Early on in the pandemic, SII made deals with both Oxford/AstraZeneca and Novavax to produce one billion doses of each candidate vaccine by the end of 2021.92 At the time of the announcement of this deal, several stakeholders 50 opined that is this type of collaboration is adopted more broadly, it could have important implications for future vaccine development and global access. T he case studies reveal other efforts by various stakeholders to help underwrite manufacturing for COVID -19 vaccine sponsors. ESI also provided significant early down payments on vaccine purchases to further speed development. I tried to identify a source that systematically details production arrangements for COVID -19 vaccines and located two. Both sources are nonprofit organizations making public the identification, classification and characterization of production contracts licensing arrangements for COVID -19 vaccines currently available or in the pipeline between COVID -19 vaccine innovators and manufacturers. They are the Global Health Centre (GHC) maintained by the Graduate Institute of Geneva and UNICEF (Table 3 ). Both sources lament the lack of full transparency into these arrangements currently and consequently the contracts they have identified and classified are prone to limitations related to selection bias and potentially non- random missing information. In an early summer 2021 release of their data, both efforts ma de the distinction between contracts that entail base ingredients, such as \" lipids, \" adjuvants, excipients and other materials , and ones likely to entail the licensing of intellectual property by one or more entities with others. They suggest that whereas contracts that specify contract manufacturing or so- called \"fill and finish \" arrangements likely do not entail the licensing of intellectual property from the vaccine sponsor to other manufacturers. Howeve r, for our purposes even fill and finish manufacturing arrangements likely entail the transfer of knowledge that could be considered trade secrets by the vaccine sponsor, and consequently marked in agreements as \"confidential \" or \"highly confidential.\" In the November 2021 release of the UNICEF data, these distinctions are not provided, but the number of doses contracted for in 51 agreements between funders and suppliers ( Table 4 ) are provided . The UNICEF effort also reports manufacturing arrangements between vaccine developers and manufacturers. The data reveal the breadth of contracts existing between vaccine sponsors and the very significant amount of vaccine doses secured and delivered or expected to be delivered in the next several quarters. 52 Section 5: Case studies of COVID-19 vaccine successes and failures This section provides detailed summaries of the COVID -19 vaccine case studies. Many of the primary documents used in this section are derived from the companies own public statements , including shareholder reports, and various other reports available in the gray and peer-reviewed publis hed literature. Moderna 's Spikevax Moderna's COVID -19 v accine is mRNA-based and available in the United S tates of America, European Union and many other countries under EUA as a two -dose primary series for individuals 18 years of age and older, as a third primary series dose for individuals 18 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise, and as a single booster dose for individuals 18 years of age and older at least five months after completing a primary series of the vaccine. The vaccine is also authorized for use as a heterologous (or \"mix and match\") single booster dose for individuals 18 years of age and older following completion of primary vaccination with a different available COVID -19 vaccine. Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology : Moderna is a Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - based biotech start -up. In collaboration with intramural scientists working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other extramural scientists funded by government grants and working at the University of Pennsylvania, among other academic institutions, Moderna invented an mRNA vaccine candidate before the pandemic, but had not successfully brought an mRNA vaccine through to market approval.93 NIH and Moderna entered into an agreement in 2019 to co-develop coronavirus vaccines before the identification and spread of SARS-CoV-2. Willingness of innovators to take risks, costs and uncertainty entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for COVID -19 therapeutics: after the SARS -CoV-2 virus 53 sequence was made public, t he company announced its plans to develop a COVID -19 vaccine in March 2020.94 IP, licensing and partnering arrangements: f rom the onset of their program, Moderna stated COVID -19 vaccine development would be in collaboration with the NI H and various other universities and institutions.95 Moderna started building regulatory, clinical trial and manufacturing expertise from scratch and thus relying on collaboration with others after they had developed a proof of concept for the ir COVID -19 vaccine candidate; they publicly stated this put them at a disadvantage compared to their potential competitors in the COVID -19 vaccine candidate market.96 Moderna also had to rely on upstream and downstream licensing arrangements with other companies to obtain key technology for vaccine delivery. Perhaps most notably, the mRNA nature of Moderna's vaccine required the production of large- scale volumes of lipid nanoparticles, for which Moderna collaborated with Corden Biopharmaceutical, a contract manufacturing organization. Moderna had a prior relationship with Corden Biopharmaceutical, producing at Colorado, Switzerland and France sites . Moderna stated publicly that they do not have the in-house capacity to manufacture base ingredients . 97 Public Citizen identified several patents held by Moderna relating to the appropriate vaccine technologies.98 They classified them into several groups based on their description and primary independent claim: patents directed at an mRNA vaccine, patents directed at lipids/NP + mRNA and patents directed explicitly at biopharmaceutical compositions involving lipid NP + mRNA. In their report, they provide a non- exhaustive list of patents related to these categories.99 In one recent financial statement, Moderna suggested that it relies to a certain extent on trade secrets, know-how and other technology which are not protected by patents to maintain its competitive position.100 54 To date, Moderna's COVID -19 vaccine is the only product that Moderna currently has on the market.101 However, the company has been investigating the expansion of use of this vaccine to other populations and follow-on products , including modifications to their existing vaccine to address emerging variants . In 2021, Moderna announced they had entered into vaccine candidate clinical testing for follow -on COVID -19 vaccines, including those targeted to children and boosters for adults, and for other infectious disease targets.102 As of the second quarter of 2021, Moderna's COVID -19 vaccine was also undergoing a Phase II/III trial (referred to as TeenCOVE) to determine its effectiveness in children between the ages of 12 to 17. It was determined to be 93 per cent effective in that age group.103 Moderna was in the process of enrolling participants for a Phase II/III trial of mRNA -1273 (called KidCOVE) for children between the ages of 6 months to 11 years.104 At least one of these novel candidate pursuits includes licensing arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies,105 including Merck if it meets prespecified criteria.106 Moderna has also been in the process of developing boosters for SARS-CoV-2 variants.107 The variant -specific vaccine in development is referred to as mRNA -1273.351. It is designed to fight against the Beta variant (B.1.351). mRNA-1273.351 is undergoing a Phase I clinical trial at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. mRNA-1273.211 is a multivalent booster that is currently in development. It is an amalgamation of both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. 108 All three of the vaccines that Moderna developed or is developing (mRNA-1273, mRNA- 1273.351 and mRNA-1273.211) were involved in a Phase II study that concluded that a booster dose (half of a normal dose) helped increase the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the Gamma, Beta and Delta variants. 109 Moderna also is developing mRNA-1273.617, a booster to 55 fight against the Delta v ariant, and proposes mRNA-1273.213, which combines mRNA- 1273.617 and another vaccine.110 In Summer 2021, Moderna announced it has established a Research Engine and Early Development Engine to develop boosters and vaccines to fight against any future variant s of SARS -CoV-2.111 Finally , the company announced preclinical studies to develop 24 additional vaccines , including those targeting Epstein -Barr mRNA- 1574).112 Willingness of funders to underwrite risks, costs entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for vaccine/therapeutics across platforms, companies, countries: t he partnerships Moderna entered into with governments and other stakeholders for COVID -19 are varied and appear at least in part to build on long-standing relationships related to developing vaccine candidates for Zika and HIV with the US government and other international organizations, including the Gates Foundation.113 Moderna relied on collaborations with the NIH to initiate and conduct clinical trials to meet regulatory standards for market authorization. The company was the first to sign contracts with what later became known as Operation Warp Speed (OWS)114 in February and March 2020, and many but not all of Moderna's contracts precede the founding of OWS .115 Advanced purchasing arrangements to guarantee revenue post -approval/post- authorization to manufacturers, assure supply to populations in need: Moderna received substantial US government support for vaccine testing and manufacturing.116,117 In Aug ust 2020, Moderna announced advanced market commitments with staged financing related to meeting prespecified standards in the production and delivery of vaccines for domestic118 and 56 international use.119,120 These agreements include pricing terms post -market launch.121 The European Commission122 also made advanced purchasing commitments to COVID -19 vaccines , including the \u20ac2.7 billion vaccine Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) in which EU member countries and Norway were provided the option to purchase an agreed upon amount of vaccines within a given time frame at an agreed price. In return, it supported part of the upfront costs incurred by vaccine suppliers and operated as a \"down payment\" on vaccines ultimately procured by member states themselves. The European Commission struck initial vaccine supply deals with Moderna. Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of funders to support vaccine manufacturing \" at risk \" pre -product launch: much of this effort was supported by the US government, including contracts with BARDA and OWS and international organizations, including, most notably, support from CEPI. 123 Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: Moderna stated publicly that they do not have the in-house capacity to manufacture mRNA vaccines to scale.124 The fill and finish for Moderna's vaccine were initially done by Lonza in the United S tates of America and by Rov i in Spain . Moderna relied heavily on agreements with other entities to manufacture the vaccine candidate for clinical testing and contract manufacturing organizations to scale up and scale out their production before market authorization and after approval in December 2020. Much of this effort was supported b y the US government, including contracts with BARDA and OWS, and international organizations, including most importantly support from CEPI. In August 2020, Moderna announced advanced market commitments with staged financing related to meeting prespecified benchmarks in 57 production and delivery of vaccines for domestic use and international use. These agreements include pricing terms post- market launch. In the first quarter of 2021, Moderna supplied 88 million doses to the US government, and another 14 million doses were supplied to other governments.125 During the second quarter of 2021, Moderna and its contract manufacturing partners supplied the US government with 126 million doses of the COVID -19 vaccine. Seventy -three million doses were supplied to other governments. In total, $4.2 billion of sales from the COVID -19 vaccine were made in the second quarter of 2021. 126 In the second quarter of 2021, Moderna announced that Lonza's manufacturing of their mRNA vaccine w ould double. Additionally, Rovi would be increas ing their supply to Moderna as well, along with formulation, fill and finish capabilities. Moderna also will be increas ing their own facilities manufacturing of drug substances by 50 per cent . Despite the optimistic projections as to the increasing supply for the vaccine, Moderna does note that due to the highly variable demand for COVID -19 vaccines and booster doses, there remains a r isk that supply will not be able to keep up with demand. Particularly of issue is the use of manufacturing partners, Lonza and Rovi, as Moderna will depend upon them to expand their capacity and workers. 127 Moderna has been investing in increasing their manufacturing capabilities, both in their own facilities and in partner facilities, to match demand for the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine during the second quarter of 2021. Most significantly, they announced an expansion of the Moderna Technology Center (MTC) in Nor wood, Massachusetts . The expansion doubles the available production space at the MTC. This will enable Moderna to reach a projected distribution of between 800 million and 1 billion doses in 2021, and up to 3 billion booster doses in 2022. 128 58 Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: Moderna announced that it would not enforce its patent rights against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic. This announcement first occurred before market authorization in the United S tates of America and was subsequently revised post- authorization and market launch. Regulatory approval/authorization: t he company recognized they were facing significant regulatory risks, as the criteria for authorizat ion and approvals were evolving simultaneously as vaccine candidate identification and testing.129 The company received market authorization in the United S tates of America for their COVID -19 vaccine's use in adults in December 2020, Europe, and many other countries and achieved certification by WHO.130 The initial authorization by US and EU regulators is based on final trial results suggesting the vaccine is over 90 per cent effective in preventing severe cases and death.131 Moderna filed a Biologics License Application with th e FDA on June 1, 2021 and wrote in SEC filings that it believed it would be fully approved in August 2021.132 Yet, as of December 31 , 2021, Moderna's COVID - 19 vaccine was still operating in the U nited S tates of America under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued by the FDA on December 20, 2020.133 In Spring 2021, Moderna announced they would be seeking full approval for the vaccine in late summer 2021 or early fall 2021, although as of December 31 , 2021, no permission has been granted.134 Outside of the United S tates of America , the European Union and Japan have taken the lead in approving the vaccine for children.135 As of December 31 , 2021, t he Moderna COVID -19 vaccine received Conditional Marketing Authorization in the European Union for ages 12 and up, and was approved for age 12 to 17 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. 136 59 J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen Biopharmaceuticals i s a Belgium -based division of Johnson & Johnson. The J&J/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine is available in the U nited S tates of America, European Union and many other countries under EUA as a single primary vaccination dose for individuals 18 years of age and older and as a single booster dose for individuals 18 years of age and older at least two months after completing primary vaccination with the vaccine. The Janssen COVID - 19 Vaccine is also authorized for use as a heterologous (or \"mix and match\") single booster dose for individuals 18 years of age and older following completion of pr imary vaccination with a different available COVID -19 vaccine. The J&J vaccine is built off a viral vector vaccine platform. 137 Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology: pre -pandemic Janssen had an existing partnership with the vaccine maker Crucell, a Nether lands- based company. J&J's partnership with Crucell was initiated in 2011 and their entry into the vaccine manufacturing business at the time was considered \"late\" compared to other well-diversified international vaccine manufacturers including Merck, GSK, Sanofi and Pfizer.138 Willingness of innovators to take risks, costs and uncertainty entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for COVID -19 therapeutics: J&J announced the ir COVID - 19 vaccine candidate on March 30 , 2020. IP, licensing and partnering arrangements: t he J&J /Janssen COVID -19 vaccine is a product of academic collaboration for identification and early- stage development activities .139,140,141 Janssen Biopharmaceuticals developed the vac cine in collaboration with an academic insti tution in the U nited S tates of America, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of 60 Boston. P receding and following the authorization, vaccine manufacturing was primarily the domain of external partners, including collaborations with Emergent BioSolutions to manufacture base ingredients and Catalent to fill and finish. Willingness of funders to underwrite risks, costs entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for vaccine/therapeutics across platforms, companies, countries: J&J was the secon d COVID -19 vaccine candidate (after Moderna) to receive US government support for vaccine development, including clinical trials and advanced market commitments for supply to the United S tates of America . 142 Advanced purchasing arrangements to guarantee revenue post -approval/post- authorization to manufacturers, assure supply to populations in need: J&J entered various advanced market commitments with governments and other funders before entering the market. 143 For example, in December 2020, J&J signed an agreement with Gavi to provide 500 million doses through the COVAX program through 2022. The European Commission144 also made commitments to the J&J COVID-19 vaccine. Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of funders to support vaccine manufacturing \" at risk \" pre -product launch: i nitial manufacturing of the vaccine for clinical trials took place at a J&J plant in the Netherl ands. However, preceding authorization, vaccine manufacturing was primarily the domain of external partners, including collaborations with Emergent BioSolutions to manufacture base ingredients and C atalent to fill and finish. Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: t he J&J COVID-19 vaccine is also a product of numerous internal 145 61 and external contract manufacturing agreements for the later stage production scale up, whic h appear to have been initiated early in vaccine candidates development.146,147 Following authorization, vaccine manufacturing was primarily the domain of external partners, including continuing collaborations with Emergent BioSolutions to manufacture base ingredients and Catalent to fill and finish. Emergent BioSolutions, one of the contract manufacturers making the viral vector base ingredient, was ordered shortly after authorization by US regulators to stop all production due to emergent safety concerns.148 In March 2021, J&J announced it was taking over the production of the vaccine and working with the FDA to secure authorization for their plant at about the same time. J&J also announced that they had signed an agreement with Merck \u2014first for fill and fi nish at a plant in Pennsylvania and eventually for the manufacture of the drug substance at a Merck plant in North Carolina.149 Both a rrangements were facilitated by BARDA.150 Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: J &J remains forthcoming in entering into numerous licensing arrangements to supply vaccines, including technology transfer and the sharing of trade secrets and technical assistance for production. In November 2020, South Africa's Aspen Biopharmaceuticals agreed to provide J&J with fill- and-finish services. The deal has also been criticized because Aspen had agreed to produce vaccines for Europe while at the same time vaccines were urgently needed in Africa.151 Unfortunately, in June 2021, Aspen had to destroy contaminated doses that had inadvertently been shipped from the US -based Emergent plant, waiting until late July to receive the vaccine from the European plant to bottle instead. This slowed vaccination campaigns in South Africa and elsewhere. In August 2020, J&J announced an agreement with Biological E. that would also allow 62 the Indian company to mass-produce the vaccine, entailing the entire manufacturing process . That month, Biological E. purchased a manufacturing plant in Paonta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh from Akorn India, indicating plans to expand its vaccine manufacturing capacity significantly. In February 2021, Reuters reported that Biological E.'s managing director, Mahima Datla, indicated plans to manufacture 600 million doses of J&J vaccine in 2021. Shortly after that Datla reported input shortages. By May 2021, the Times of India reported delays had forced Biological E. to change its plans once again. In August 2021, Indian regulators authori zed the J&J COVID -19 vaccine for emergency use. 152 Regulatory approval/authorization: vaccine development relied on in -house regulatory and clinical trials expertise taking advantage of their pre -pandemic experience as the sponsor of other vaccines approved for use in the United S tates of America. The U nited S tates gave J&J's vaccine market authorization in February 2021.153 However, the J&J vaccine has encountered additional regulatory challenges. J&J had to temporarily pause its clinical trials in October 2020 after one participant fell ill. In April 2021, FDA halted the use of t he J&J COVID -19 vaccine after six women who had taken it\u2014out of 6.8 million doses administered\u2014developed a blood-clotting disorder. The U nited S tates of America resumed vaccine u se on April 23, 2021, with a warning label about the risk of rare blood clots. While it had been put into use, the European Commission ultimately decided against renewing orders for more J&J COVID -19 vaccine doses beyond 2021. 63 Pfizer/BioNTech's Comirnat Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine, Comirnaty, is an mRNA -based vaccine, authorized for emergency use and available under the EUA in the United S tates of America, European Union member countries and others as a two -dose primary series for individuals 5 years of age and older, as a third primary series dose for individuals 5 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise, and as a single booster dose for individuals 12 years of age and older at least five months after completing a primary series of the vaccine. The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine is also authorized for use as a heterologous (or \"mix and match\") single booster dose for individuals 18 years of age and older following completion of primary vaccinat ion with a different available COVID -19 vaccine. Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology: much of the originating technology for the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine was developed by BioNtech, a biotech firm located in Mainz, Germany, in collaboration with German universities pre-pandemic and also previously patented like the Moderna vaccine. BioNtech and Merck had a prior commercial relationship to develop an mRNA-based vaccine; in August 2018, the companies had signed a collaborative agreement to develop mRNA- based vaccines for the prevention of influenza. Willingness of innovators to take risks, costs and uncertainty entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for COVID -19 therapeutics: at the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, BioNTech invent ed a candidate mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. On March 17, 2020, the company announced a partnership with Pfizer in which the global biopharmaceutical company would assist in clinical development and manufacturing for all markets outside of China. IP, licensing a nd partnering arrangements: t he BioNTech vaccine is reliant upon Pfizer's 64 in-house manufacturing expertise. Pfizer developed and patented the first stage of the drug product, DNA plasmids. The plasmids are frozen, packed and shipped to other plants, where the DNA is turned into mRNA\u2014the active biopharmaceutical ingredient of the vaccine. Bags of filtered mRNA are sent to two additional sites for the last formulation stage , fill and finish. Like Moderna's mRNA vaccine, the BioNTech vaccine requires vast supplies of lipid nanoparticles to encase and deliver the mRNA into the body's cells after inoculation. BioNTech/Pfizer has entered into a web of licensing arrangements with other manufacturers to secure access to thi s technology. Most notably, BioN Tech licensed technology from Acuitas, a Canadian firm. In addition, Avanti Polar Lipids of Alabama, a subsidiary of the British company Croda, produced Pfizer 's lipids under a five-year contract signed in November 2021. BioNTech subsequently contracted with firms including Evonik and Merck KGaA to manufacture lipids at facilities within the European Union. Public Citizen identified several patents claimed by BioNTech relating to the pertinent vaccine technologies.154 They placed them in three groups based on their description and primary independent claim: patents directed at RNA, patents directed at lipids/NP + mRNA and patents directed explicitly at biopharmaceutical compositions involving lipid NP + mRNA. In a recent financial statement, BioNTech suggested that its patents extend to mRNA structure, formulations and manufacture and rely on trade secrets and confidential know-how to protect several aspects of mRNA manufacturing technology.155 Willingness of funders to underwrite risks, costs entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for vaccine/therapeutics across platforms, companies, countries: t he German government provided grant support for basic science that turned into a university spin out pre- pandemic, called BioNtech , for their own mRNA vaccine platform. With the advent of 65 the pandemic, the company raised additional financing from the private sector and the German government gave additional support to BioNtech to help with COVID -19 vaccine development. One source reports the German government gave BioNtech $445 million, enabling the firm to establish proof of principle for their COVID -19 vaccine in sufficient detail to support the partnership with Pfizer. Advanced purchasing arrangements to guarantee revenue post -approval/post- authorization to manufacturers, assure supply to populations in need: Pfizer/ BioNTech entered into advanced purchasing commitments with the US government, 156 the German government157 and COVAX to deliver vaccines meeting prespecified characteristics and quan tities. The European Commission158 made advanced purchase commitments to the Pfizer/ BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine. Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of funders to support vaccine manufacturing \" at risk \" pre -product launch: Pfizer/BioNtech received help from the US government in resolving emergent manufacturing concerns. Specifically, the companies worried about running short of specific inputs for their existing production facilities. Unlike the other vaccine companies the US government contracted in 2020, Pfizer's first contract in July was not given a \"priority rating\" under the Defense Production Act (DPA). Without the priority rating, Pfizer could not jump to the head of the line on supply acquisition. Pfizer reportedly struggled and requested US government help \"to give the company better access to roughly nine specialized products it needs to make the vaccine\" including lipids. Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: BioNtech entered into a partnership with Shanghai Fosun 66 Biopharmaceutical to produce and distribute its vaccine in China in March 2020, however, it took until May 2021 to finalize the agreement where the vaccine would be produced at a manufacturing facility owned by Fosun in China. In July 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech entered into a deal with the Biovac Institute in South Africa to use its Cape Town facility to fill and finish the vaccine supplied from plants in Europe for distribution across the African Union beginning in 2022. Regulatory approval/authorization: the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first to receive authorization for emergency use by the FDA, the MHR A and the EMA. Since December 11, 2020, the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 v accine has been available under EUA in the United States of America in individuals 16 years of age and older, and the authorization was expanded to include those 12 through 15 years of age on May 10, 2021. Comirnaty was also the first COVID -19 vaccine to receive authorization in the European Union. The EMA extended vaccine approval to younger aged individuals shortly t hereafter. On August 23, 2021, the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNtech COVID -19 vaccine for the prevention of COVID -19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. AstraZeneca/Oxford University 's Vaxzevria Vaxzevria is a vaccine for preventing COVID -19 in people aged 18 years and older. Vaxzevria is made up of another virus (of the adenovirus family) that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine has an efficacy of approximately 60 per cent in preventing COVID -19. The vaccine is authorized for use in the European Union and other countries. It is not authorized for use in the U nited States of America. 67 Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology: Oxford University/Jenner Institute 's COVID -19 vaccine efforts are predicated on extensive scientific and vaccine development expertise, including previous experience with MERS.159 Willingness of innovators to take risks, costs and uncertainty entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for COVID -19 therapeutics: the Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccine was the first to be announced in development publicly. The Oxford team claimed they started working the day after Zhang's sequence was publicly released , and \"over the weekend, they had a prototype vaccine candidate160 and began manufact uring their vaccine right away \". Most of the initial vaccine identification and production was conducted by Oxford University in collaboration with scientists at the Jenner Institute. The team reported that they launched preclinical tes ting in various animal models concurrently to speed up the process, including mice, pigs and ultimately rhesus monkeys, to get a \"jump start\" on planning P hase I clinical trials in humans. The team also planned clinical trials in humans,161 including deciding not to design trials in the elderly, which ultimately entailed risks and controversies;162 the lack of data has led to many European countries advising against its use on older people. The company recently announced follow-up studies to develop a new vaccine against COVID -19 variants (AZD2816), including human testing in Phase II/III.163 The company has also been pursuing the development of COVID -19 therapeutics, however, the results to date have been disappointing.164 In June 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that AstraZeneca's coronavirus antibody treatment failed in late -stage clinical trials to achieve its primary goal of preventing symptomatic COVID -19 in people recently exposed to the virus, the latest disappointment in a broader search for reliable post -infection therapies. A single 68 dose of the AZD7442 long- acting antibody treatment was not statistically more effective than a placebo in preventing symptomatic COVID -19 in the trial of 1,121 people in the United Kingdom and the United S tates of America. Like the vaccine,165 AstraZeneca is planning two more trials , PROVENT and TACKLE , to continue testing the therapeutic with recruitment complete and ongoing, respectively. IP, licensing and partnership arrangements: Oxford announced their partnership with AstraZeneca, a British -Swedish biopharmaceutical company with global operations headquartered in Cambridge, England, to scale up and scale out production, complete clinical trials and meet regulatory requirements for vaccin e authorization and approval by regulators in Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) countries in April 2020.166 While pre- pandemic AstraZeneca had experience in producing small molecule medicines, it did not have preexisting vaccine expertise.167 After the deal was signed between Oxford University and AstraZeneca, public reports suggest AstraZeneca became active in providing contract manufacturing, regulatory expertise and communications for the co -developed COVID -19 vaccine.168 Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of funders to support vaccine manufacturing \" at risk \" pre -product launch: preparations for commercial -scale production started soon after the Oxford /AstraZeneca partnership was finalized. A UK-centric supply chain was encouraged, partially funded and facilitated by the UK government. In addition, in October 2020, AstraZeneca signed a $1.6 billion contract with the US government under OWS that supporte d manufacturing at risk as well as advanced purchasing commitments. However, manufacturing and other problems, including 69 its conduct of clinical trials , the vaccine's demonstrated efficacy in producing immunity169 and politics,170 have plagued the company's efforts to bring a COVID -19 vaccine to market.171 Advanced purchasing arrangements to guarantee revenue post -approval/post- authorization to manufacturers , assure supply to populations in need/Willingness of funders to underwrite risks, costs entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for vaccine/therapeutics across platforms, companies, countries: after the deal was signed between Oxford University and AstraZeneca, public reports suggest AstraZeneca became active in entering into advanced market commitments with various governments and other funders. The collaboration received very significant UK government, European Union, European Commission and multiparty support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and GAVI , among others, for vaccine development, including clinical trials, advanced market commitments for production and global supply. 172 The vaccine, based on a viral vector platform, has been considered an essential option for low- and middle-income countries173 with less access to cold storage and other requirements of the mRNA vaccines .174 For example, the European Commission's initial call for COVID -19 vaccine producers resulted in a deal with AstraZeneca to provide 400 million doses. In fall 2020, COVAX announced their comm itment to buying 300 million doses from AstraZeneca and the supply of an additional 200 million doses of the same vaccine from SII paid for by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. COVAX announced that they intended to distribute vaccines based on member -country population and need, while also maintaining a standing emergency stockpile. At the end of June 2021, more than 700 million doses of the vaccine had been released by the company to supply to over 170 countries. 175 AstraZeneca also entered into government -supported contracts to develop COVID -19 therapeutics. Although disappointing to date, AstraZeneca has received support from the US 70 government, potentially exceeding $700 million to develop the treatment and, if successful, to supply hundreds of thousands of doses in another advanced market commitment. Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: Cobra Biologics UK agreed to produce the drug product in England. C P Biopharmaceuticals was contracted to do fill and finish in Wales. SII, the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, made deals with Oxford /AstraZeneca to produce one billion doses of each candidate vaccine by the end of 2021.176 In addition, A straZeneca, to meet with global demand, has chosen to collaborate with \"more than 20 supply partners in more than 15 countries.\" 177 Their partners are local manufacturing companies that help with the drug substance, drug product, and finished packaging stages under the supervision of AstraZeneca.178 Much of the current controversies over the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine179 are related to later stages of development and manufacturing scale up for market authorization and delivery. Oxford University's agreement with a contract manufacturer in early stages led to dosages concerns much later on.180 In April 2021, the European Commission announced a legal suit against AstraZeneca for failure to deliver the vaccine in sufficient quantities as previously contracted for.181,182 Regulatory approval/authorization: The United Kingdom authorized the vaccine for emergency use on December 30, 2020. India approved the vaccine for emergency use on January 6, 2021, and the EMA allowed its use across the European Union on January 29, 2021. 183 AstraZeneca did not release its US Phase III trial results until March 22; when it did, it faced almost immediate rebuke; as of December 31 , 2021, the vaccine had still not received emergency use authorization in the United S tates of America .184 In the second quarter of 2021, the vaccine received special regulatory approval for emergency use in Japan. 71 CureVac 's CV2CoV CureVac's COVID -19 vaccine has not been approved for use by US, EU or other country regulators at the time of finalizing this report. The company had submitted most required preclinical data as part of the EMA's rolling review process, intended to speed up approvals in 2021. The company pulled its vaccine candidate from EMA consideration in October 2021 to focus on its next- generation COVID -19 vaccine. Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology : CureVac is a G erman biotech firm spun out of university discovery and development activities.185 Like Moderna, CureVac had no previous experience bringing a successful vaccine to market; both previo us mRNA- based vaccine candidates, one targeted at rabies, the other at prostate cancer, had both failed in development but earned them a solid reputation among funders.186 CEPI had funded the company's previous efforts .187 Willingness of innovators to take risks, costs and uncertainty entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for COVID -19 therapeutics: Curevac's vaccine technology was so promising at the outset of the pandemic that the US government promi sed the company $1 billion for exclusive rights to its vaccine in March 2020. By June 2020, regulators in Germany and Belgium authorized CureVac's candidate, CVnCoV, to begin clinical trials. IP, licensing and partnering arrangements: beginning in November 2020, Curevac announced partnerships with selected biopharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturing organizations to license required lipid technology, conduct clinical trials in humans and build out its manufacturing and distribution supply chain. 188,189 Like the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech candidates , the Curevac vaccine requires access to lipid technology for mRNA delivery into 72 human cells after inoculation and entered into various licensing deals with other companies. CureVac entered into contract s with Novartis, a Swiss -based multinational biopharmaceutical company, and Bayer to conduct base ingredient manufacturing activities. In February 2021, CureVac and GSK announced a partnership; GSK was to help CureVac manufacture the mRNA vaccine, and the two would work together to develop a vaccine to target many strains of the virus at once, projected to arrive in 2022. 190 In August 2021, the company announced promising results for their \"second generation \" COVID -19 vaccine designed to address the emergence of viral variants, including Beta, Delta and Lambda variants .191 Another company announcement in winter 2021 suggested CureVac had already started to invest in preclinical studies of this follow-on vaccine's efficacy against other COVID -19 varian ts192 and potentially other non- COVID -19 applications as well. Willingness of funders to underwrite risks, costs entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for vaccine/therapeutics across platforms, companies, countries/Advanced purchasing arrangements to guarantee revenue post-approval/post- authorization to manufacturers, assure supply to populations in need: OWS supported Curevac vaccine development. CureVac received considerable financial support from Germany to develop its COVID -19 vaccine and from CEPI to support its clinical trials, scale up manufacturin g and build its manufacturing facilities .193 In August 2020, CureVac announced they were in talks with the European Commission to guarantee supply before market authorization or approval. 194 CureVac ultimately entered into advanced purchasing commitments for its vaccine with the European Commission. Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of funders to support vaccine manufacturing \" at risk \" pre -product 73 launch: CureVac had no manufacturing or distribution expertise to scale up and scale out production for its COVID -19 vaccine clinical trials and manufacturing after authorization or approval. Funds to support these efforts came first from the German government and CEPI and then from other fund ers. CureVac also has advanced manufacturing contracts with the United States of America, CEPI and COVAX. Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: CureVac had no manufacturing or distribution exper tise to scale up production for clinical trials and manufacturing after authorization or approval. Unlike BioNTech and Oxford efforts that solely partnered directly with big international, well - diversified and experienced biopharmaceutical companies, Cure Vac constructed a network of expertise in manufacturing activities. 195,196 CureVac entered contracts with Novartis, a Swiss - based multinational biopharmaceutical co mpany, and Bayer to conduct fill- and-finish manufacturing activities for its COVID -19 vaccine. Regulatory approval/authorization: CureVac's vaccine candidate is mRNA -based but has yet to be authorized or approved for use by any regulatory agenc y worldwide .197 Novavax's Nuvaxovid Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, was authorized for use to prevent COVID-19 in individuals over the age of 18 by the EMA in December 2021. The vaccine has yet to be approved by any other regulator for use in preventing COVID-19. The vaccine uses particles studded with viral proteins, mixed with immune-boosting compounds. The vaccine is given as two shots, spaced three weeks apart. Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology: Novavax is a Maryland -based US company 74 founded in 1987 to develop experimental vaccines. Novavax had preexisting vaccine expertise in response to viral outbreaks, including other coronaviruses such as Middle East r espiratory syndrome (MERS -CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Preclinical testing of the previously developed MERS- CoV vaccine demonstrated strong immunogenicity and 100 per cent protection.198 Novavax also developed a vaccine for Ebola, which proved highly effective in primate studies. Nevertheless, Novavax was on the verge of bankruptcy before the COVID -19 pandemic and had sold its only factory in 2019. Willingness of innovators to take risks, costs and uncertainty entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for COVID -19 therapeutics: Novavax announced its COVID -19 vaccine candidate in April 2020. IP, licensing and partnering arrangements: t he Novavax COVID -19 vaccine relies on a specialized adjuvant excipient from the soap -bark tree of Chile\u2014Matrix -M\u2014that help s stimulate a strong immune response to the antigen. That adjuvant had pre- pandemic non-C OVID -19 purposes, and Novavax originally manufactured it in Sweden. In June 2020, Novavax signed agreements with two other companies to manufacture the adjuvant at the scale needed for its expected vaccine sales. AGC Biologics would produce it at Denmark- and Washington State- based facilities , as would Polypeptide Group in California and Sweden. Desert King, a California company, was tasked with acquiring the critical starting material of Matrix -M. In May 2020, Novavax announced that it was using funding from CEPI to purchase a plant in the Czech Republic (formerly Praha Vaccines, a subsidiary of the Cyrus Poonawalla Group, the parent company of SII) that would allow it to manufacture an expected one billion doses of the drug substance. 199 In the United S tates of America, a vaccine for clinical trials was initially produced by Emergent BioSolutions. F UJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies (FDB) eventually 75 agreed to handle commercial -scale manufacturing at T exas and North Carolina sites . Novavax also agreed to allow FDB to produce its vaccine at a UK plant under an agreement with the UK government.200 Willingness of funders to underwrite risks, costs entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for vaccine/therapeutics across platforms, companies, countries: based on its previous track record, the US government, CEPI and other funders felt comfortable providing Novavax considerable financial support to help it develop its COVID -19 vaccine candidate. The Novavax vaccine technology is also relatively easier to transfer than that of the mRNA-based vaccines, making it an attractive candidate for plants in developing countries to license and scale up for global manufacturing and distribution. The Novavax vaccine also benefits from not requiring the same cold- storage challenges that made others challenging to deploy in remote areas and low- and middle- income countries. 201 Advanced purchasing arrangements to guarantee revenue post -approval/post- authorization to manufacturers, assure supply to populations in need/Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of funders to support vaccine manufacturing \" at risk \" pre -product launch: Novavax's COV ID-19 vaccine clinical trials and manufacturing efforts have been supported by funding from the US government, among other funders, 202 and advance market commitments to deliver vaccines post - market approval worldwide. As early as May 2020,203 the company and CEPI had announced an agreement to support clinical trials and manufacturing efforts in addition to allowing procurement and allocation of its vaccine through worldwide efforts now under discussion as part of the Access to COVID -19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator. The company reportedly received the most significant funding commitment from OWS in the spring of 2020 to support clinical 76 trials , manufacturing efforts and procurement.204 SII, the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, made deals with Novavax to produce one billion doses of each candidate vaccine by the end of 2021.205 Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: Novavax, like other non- mRNA COVID -19 vaccines , has been very well engage d in licensing deals, including technology transfer, fill- and-finish manufacturing and full production manufacturing with global governments and other funders. Takeda signed on in August 2020 (finalized in February 2021) for Japanese production, with assi stance from the government of Japan, as did SK bioscience in South Korea, with assistance from CEPI. In September 2020, Novavax signed similar agreements with Biofabri in Spain and SII in India. In February 2021, Novavax reached an agreement with the Government of Canada to someday produce the vaccine at the National Research Council's Biologics Manufacturing Centre in Montreal. Novavax also contracted with a few other companies to fill and finish its vaccine. Par Sterile Products (Endo) signed on in September 2020 to use its Michigan plant. Later agreements were made with Jubilant HollisterStier in Washington State, Baxter in Germany, and GSK in England. Regulatory approval/authorization: in December 2020, the company announced the launch of clinical trials to establish the vaccine's safety and efficacy .206 Yet, as of December 2021, despite some publicly announced promising results from clinical trials in June 2021, the Novavax vaccine remain s unapproved by many country regulators. Some of these delays appear related to manufacturing challenges. For example, Novavax has delayed its clinical trials twice due to scale up challenges in the past year and recently said it would not meet its production targets to fulfill advanced market c ommitments with the US government and other funders until 77 the fourth quarter of 2021.207 In August 2021, the company claimed that raw material shortages for some manufacturers are exacerbating the problem even as other companies were reporting gathering saf ety stocks of these materials; they also stated the US government was putting its funding on \"pause\" as it waits for the company to resolve its manufacturing concerns.208 On December 20 , 2021, the EMA recommended granting a conditional marketing authorization for Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine Nuvaxovid to prevent COVID-19 in people from 18 years of age. Merck After initial investments, Merck abandoned its non-m RNA COVID- 19 vaccine candidates in 2021 to focus on therapeutics and supporting other vaccine development and production efforts. Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology: founded over a century ago in 1891, Merck is a Kenilworth, New Jersey, US -based multinational pharmaceutical company. Merck had developed a previously approved Ebola virus vaccine that used recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus technology. Merck's agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) supported this venture. 209 Merck also has successfully developed and marketed numerous other vaccines, including those targeted to prevent pneumonia. Prepandemic, Merck's experience in vaccine development, clinical trials and regulatory expertise was widely considered highly developed. Willingness of innovators to take risks, costs and uncertainty entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for COVID -19 therapeutics: despite its reputation as a global vaccine developer, with both experience and the finances to tackle the emerging coronavirus, Merck was notoriously late to the search for a CO VID-19 vaccine and ultimately abandoned its 78 candidates in 2021.210 In mid -February 2021, amid the spread of the virus, Merck's executives and scientists were split. Some advocated developing a vaccine, projecting that the outbreak would become a global pandemic. However, reportedly senior executives such as Chief Executive Ken Frazier and R&D chief Roger Perlmutter were hesitant to pursue risky vaccine development. They feared detracting from their core business or flourishing projects such as cancer research.211,212 Merck's ultimate pursuit of a COVID -19 vaccine candidate that employed technology that the company was already somewhat experienced with represented a larger aim to avoid the high-risk strategy of rivals, who investigated newer and less-proven technology. When the company's COVID -19 vaccine candidates failed, Merck shifted its focus to the development of COVID -19 treatments. IP, li censing and partnership arrangements: in March 2020, when the coronavirus was officially declared a pandemic, Merck engaged in the vaccine race deeper and started seeking a partner. The company reached out to the University of Oxford, which had continued utilizing cold chimpanzee vaccine technology, a project that Merck had previously dropped in the 2000s. The university's scientists ultimately turned down the proposal. They refused to hand over their intellectual property rights due to Merck's inability to guarantee an affordable supply for low-income countries, despite Professor Bell viewing their deal as the \"best on the table at the time.\" 213 As the University of Oxford then turned to AstraZeneca, Merck acquired further partnerships. In May 2020, Merck acquired Themis Bioscience, a Vienna -based privately held biotech company developing a broad pipeline of vaccine candidates using a measles backbone, for which it held exclusive licensing rights. Additionally, Merck partnered with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, Inc. (IAVI), a multilateral scientific research organization, to develop 79 the V590 vaccine candidate for COVID -19 using Merck's previously-approved Ebola vaccine's recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus technology.214 Willingness of funders to underwrite risks, costs entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for vaccine/therapeutics across platforms, companies, countries: Merck 's partnership with IAVI to develop the V590 vaccine candidate for COVID -19 was supported by grants from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).215 OWS also supported COVID -19 vaccine development by Merck . Advanced purchasing arrangements to guarantee revenue post -approval/post- authorization to manufacturers, assure supply to populations in need: N/A. Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of funders to support vaccine manufacturing \" at risk \" pre -product launch: N/A. Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: two months after abandoning its own CO VID-19 vaccine candidates, in March 2021, the company announced that it would instead help manufacture J&J COVID vaccine authorized by the FDA just a few days prior, using two facilities: one to make the drug substance and one to provide the final fill- and-finish stage. 216 Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: N/A. Regulatory approval/authorization: Merck continued to conduct human trials and test out its candidate with Themis . Yet, Phase I trial results in January 2021 indicated that the immune response in participants was not sufficient, despite the lack of significant safety issues.217 Merck 80 ultimately abandoned its COVID -19 vaccine candidates, especially in the face of Pfizer 's and Moderna's already more successful mRNA- based COVID -19 vaccines . Sanofi Sanofi's COVID -19 vaccine candidate developed in collaboration with GSK was announced in early 2020 and abandoned thereafter. In Spring 2021, Sanofi acquired rights to another COVID-19 vacc ine candidate employing mRNA technology and started P hase III clinical trials . In late 2021, Sanofi announced it was abandoning this candidate vaccine despite promising trial results . Pre-pandemic knowledge and technology: founded in 2004, Sanofi-Aventi s is a multinational pharmaceutical corporation headquarte red in Paris, France. The company is a leader in vaccine development and manufacturing. Sanofi previously engaged in the development of vaccines for infectious diseases ranging from diphtheria to yellow fever. Willingness of innovators to take risks, costs and uncertainty entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for COVID -19 therapeutics: Sanofi was hesitant to devote resources to the development of novel COVID -19 vaccines. The company initially perceived these efforts as potentially detracting from its core business. Despite this, in April 2020 announced plans to co-develop a COVID -19 vaccine in collaboration with GSK, which was later abandoned. In Spring 2021, Sanofi bought Tidal Therapeutics to get access to their mRNA technology that was used to reprogram live immune cells. On May 27, 2021, a Sanofi COVID - 19 vaccine using this acquired technology entered international clinical trial s to evaluate the efficacy of their COVID -19 vaccine with partial funding from the US government. Sanofi paid 81 $130 million for the intellectual property rights for Tidal Therapeutic's technology with an additional $310 million available if vaccine production was successful. However , in late 2021, Sanofi announced they had decided not to pursue the development of their COVID -19 mRNA candidate into a Phase III clinical study, despite positive preliminary trial results. The company cited business reasons for this product's abandonment, including that there were already on the market extremely effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19. The company announced that they would increase their support for expanding the distribution of already existing COVID-19 vaccines globally. In May 2021, Sanofi entered into an agreement with Stanford Medical School to further invest in their own mRNA vaccine technology. Stanford is expected to provide the inputs for autoimmune and inflammatory illnesses testing and vaccine developments. To further increase their investments in mRNA -based vaccines for presumably non- COVID uses , on June 29, 2021, Sanofi announced that it will invest approximately \u20ac400 million annually in a first-of- its-kind mRNA vaccines Center of Excellence. The Center will work to accelerate the d evelopment and delivery of next- generation vaccines by bringing together approximately 400 dedicated employees and integrating end- to-end mRNA vaccine capabilities with dedicated R&D, digital, and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) teams across si tes at Cambridge, Massachusetts (US) and Marcy l'Etoile, Lyon (France). IP, licensing and partnering arrangements: in April 2020, Sanofi entered a contract with GSK to co -develop a COVID -19 vaccine, with the former creating the antigen, a coronavirus protein to trigger the immune response, to GSK's adjuvant, a molecule used to boost the vaccine's level of protection. 218,219 This COVID -19 vaccine candidate was ultimately abandoned 82 by GSK. Sanofi announced in August 2021 that it was acquiring Translate Bio to develop mRNA- based vaccine candidates220,221 for new COVID -19 variants and other diseases.222 Willingness of funders to underwrite risks, costs entailed in the development of new technology to meet demand for vaccine/therapeutics across platforms, companies, countries: after fierce competition with other companies for government support, Sanofi and GSK's vaccine was one of the six chosen for funding by OWS. OWS provided $2.1 billion in exchange for a promised 100 million doses. Of this $2.1 billion, around half Sanofi allocated to clinical trials and development, while the remaining half was to help scale manufacturing and deliver the doses. 223 Advanced purchasing arrangements to guarantee revenue post -approval/post- authorization to manufacturers, assure supply to populations in need: Sanofi pledged 300 million doses for the European Union and 200 million for COVAX to deliver COVID -19 vaccines to low- and middle- income countries. 224 The European Commission made advanced purchase commitments to the Sanofi -GSK COVID -19 vaccine, including an initial deal with Sanofi- GSK for 300 million doses, although Sanofi-GSK subsequently halted its vaccine trials. Innovators pursuit of manufacturing at scale, including partnerships with other companies, and willingness of fun ders to support vaccine manufacturing \" at risk \" pre -product launch: three days after acquiring Tidal Therapeutics and their mRNA technology, Sanofi announced they were building a massive vaccine center that would be fully operational in five years to prim arily serve Asian markets. In addition, Sanofi announced in the second quarter of 2021 that they are building a new manufacturing site in Toronto , Canada, which is projected to be fully operational by 2026 to mass-produce flu vaccines. 83 Innovator contracts with other manufacturers to scale vaccine supply post- approval/authorization: San ofi has supported numerous other COVID- 19 vaccine candidate development and manufacturing efforts to support global access.225 Regulatory approval/authorization: besides utilizing traditional manufacturing techniques, which are complex and slow compared to speedier and more flexible mRNA ones, Sanofi and GSK experienced a significant setback in their efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020.226 The companies used reagents to measure the potency of the antigen from two different manufacturers, both of which were faulty and led to erroneously lower doses in clinical trials. As a result, the data showed an insufficient, weak immune response in people over 50 years old, and the company needed to reformulate its doses to restart trials six months later. The difficulty may have amplified this delay to find a representative sample of unvaccinated people from diverse geographic locations and other relevant fact ors at this time . 227 Ultimately, Sanofi and GSK pushed back their goals for regulatory authorization from the first half of 2021 to the fourth quarter, and the 200 million doses for COVAX failed to come through. 228,229 84 Section 6: Discussion , Limitations, Next steps Vaccine development is expensive, risky and highly uncertain. The degree of difficulty in successfully bringing to market a vaccine for a newly identified infectious disease is great. Vaccine production can also be expensive and technically challenging. Remarkably, there are now 33 safe and efficacious vaccines available to prevent COVID-19 and many more in development. Whereas in late 2020 there was significant doubt in the success of vaccine candidates to protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and associated morbidity and mortality, the discussion has now shifted to how best to scale up and scale out production and distribution to ensure access to the vaccines among all who ma y benefit. This study aimed to systematically assess two related questions: first, what are the d rivers of successful vaccine creation and the relationship between these d rivers , and, second, how did these d rivers combine in the specific scenarios of successful and unsuccessful vaccine candidat es to address the COVID -19 pandemic? I find in the case of COVID -19, just like previous experience with Ebola, anthrax and H1N1, there has been both private sector willingness to rise to the challenge of bringing a ne w vaccine to market to address an emergent infectious disease threat and a public sector willingness to support vaccine success. The response by private sponsors and public institutions to COVID - 19 has been unusual in the rapidity and magnitude of the funding and the cooperation between many disparate actors to support all aspects of basic science, vaccines research, development, production and manufacturing scale up and scale out to meet the needs of the global population. I find other numerous interesting and apparently unique aspects of COVID -19 vaccine success. The diversity of the vaccine candidates in their underlying technology platform is notable. Also notable is the source of these innovative vaccines from corporate collaborations 85 with university-based research teams and small emerging biotechnology companies without a significant track record in bringing other vaccines to market successfully. Interestingly, the case studies reveal that several manufacturers with highly developed and successful pre- pandemic vaccine expertise, including Merck, Sanofi and GSK, ultimately abandoned their own COVID - 19 vaccine candidates, but have supported the efforts of other sponsors in their regulatory, production and manufacturing efforts. The se companies' decisions to abandon their own vaccine candidates appear s to be largely driven by a combination of scientific and business rationales (Table 6) . The public record is also clear that all of the case study vaccines took advantage of preexisting s cientific knowledge of coronaviruses and how to develop vaccines to address them. This knowledge was largely in the public domain and accessible through numerous tools of open science. When COVID -19 was announced, scientists at universities and research institutions worldwide worked collaboratively to characterize the virus and put this information in the public domain; the public accumulation of knowledge regarding the virus, vaccine research and development efforts is very significant in scale and scope. Public efforts also supported various tools for vaccine development, many of which predated the pandemic. I find that intellectual property and in particular the licensing of patents between various corporate, university, nonprofit and other actors within the context of other economic incentives and institutions has played an important role in the successful development and production of currently available COVID -19 vaccines. Specifically, patents granted to governments, university-based researchers and private companies provide much of the knowledge of coronaviruses, the opportunities and challenges inherent in designing vaccines to address these agents and the platform technologies upon which successful COVID -19 vaccines are built. 86 Much of this knowledge, some of which was patent protected while others was in the public domain and freely available for use, predates the pandemic. Patents also have played a role in the development of specific ingredients critical for successful COVI D-19 vaccine production. Licensing arrangements between entities holding patents appear to be important drivers of vaccine success, but existing evidence suggests they are highly varied, complex and largely hidden from public scrutiny. It is important to note given the current policy debates that I have not identified any credible evidence that patents per se have forestalled innovation or COVID -19 vaccine su ccess. On the contrary, various entities appear to have enthusiastically engaged in the development of patented knowledge and the sharing of that knowledge through licensing activities. Moreover, I have found that the development of patented technology coexisted with many open science-based tools and techniques. In fact, it is possible that their coe xistence was critical to vaccine success. The extant empirical record is very clear that o pen science in the form of virus gene mapping and other base elements of vaccine candidate identification emerged coincident with SARS -CoV- 2 reports and clearly hastened COVID -19 vaccine candidate development. Opportunities for knowledge sharing was facilitated by preexisting institutions, including but not limited to registries, peer -review publications with free access and supported in various ways. Other coexisti ng pull and push incentives provided by preexisting private, government and multilateral entities contributed to vaccine development and production success. The need for additional opportunities for public sharing of intellectual property associated with vaccine development and production, facilitated by third parties, emerged as the scale of the global cris is and the tendency for the pursuit of national interests over global interests more fully emerged. Indeed, the US government's pursuit of supply agre ements that 87 prioritized Americans interests through OWS contracts, appear to have hastened other countries pursuit of their own prioritized supply. Indeed, while there is no BARDA-like agency in the European Union, a proposed agency called HERA would prioritize support for EU- based pharmaceutical companies engaged in pandemic therapeutic development efforts and supply EU member countries with resultant development products for emerging pathogen threats. In addition, several institutions appear to have played outsized roles in reducing the frictions entailed in vaccine development and production and as a consequence hastened success. Specifically, already available COVID -19 vaccines and numerous others in development or abandoned to date were supported by additional push and pull incentives provided by various governments and multi- stakeholder institutions, including the underwriting of clinical trials, advanced purchasing commitments, the de- risking of manufacturing activities and indemnifying vaccine sponsors and producers. The existence of formal contracts, and well -established scientific, regulatory, financing and governance institutions in providing assurances and building trust among highly diverse entities in this complex and rapidly evolving ecosyste m appears critical to success. Of particular note here is the importance of prespecified clinical trial endpoints, well established regulatory agencies with pre- existing expertise in assessing the safety and efficacy of novel vaccines and the existence of liability protections extended to innovators. These institutions and their ability to facilitate trust across diverse parties appear to be a less well appreciated contributor to COVID-19 vaccine success and one that builds on noted past successes in addressing Ebola, a nthrax and other infectious disease threats albeit at a much larger scale. While I do find that the case of COVID -19 pull and push incentives were used in combination and at massive scale, this leaves many unanswered questions. I t is possible certain 88 combinations of push and pull activities taken alone or together may be more impactful under specific conditions. It would be of interest to better understand the relative magnitude of contributions to successful vaccine development and production from specific determinants, although in this specific setting it is likely challenging or near impossible for analysts to isolate independent effects using standard econometric methods. It would also be of interest to better understand best practices in licensing intellectual property, in indemnification of vaccine sponsors and producers, and in advanced market commitments and other financial tools. The precondition to further empirical work on this topic is more transparency into the se and other agreements supporting successful COVID -19 vaccine development and production. Public posting and analysis of these contracts, including additional patent network analysis, is ongoing and an important direction for future work. A recent paper by Frank, Dach and Lurie argues that various institutions essentially removed the bulk of traditional industry risks related to COVID -19 vaccine development: (a) scientific failures, (b) failures to demonstrate safety and efficacy, (c) manufacturing risks; and (d) market risks related to low demand230. The se institutions did so by pursuing several related activities for which the sum is greater than its parts. These include the support of preclinical studies to understand the disease and its effects on human health, to characterize viral replication rates, transmission rates and susceptibilities, and to understand likely safety and efficacy of various approaches to preventing or mitigating transmission. It also includes these institution s absorbing the bulk of human testing costs and risk through a set of contracts that paid for the various phases of vaccine testing. Finally, they note these entities reduced manufacturing risk by underwriting capacity investments in many different ways. The US government, other countries and some multilateral organizations largely eliminated market risks for successful vaccine 89 candidates by employing advance purchase commitments that prespecified desirable vaccine characteristics, prices and quantities t o be purchased from vaccine manufacturers and distributed to meet population-specific unmet need when approved or emergency authorized. I add to this classification two additional activities played by these institutions , private innovator companies and a b roader focus on international efforts to bring successful COVID-19 vaccines to market . Specifically, these entities appeared to pursue a \"portfolio\" approach to knowledge generation and vaccine candidate platforms and approaches, choosing to invest in both complementary and competing activities that appeared promising, rather than choosing one approach among many possibilities. In addition, many of the government institutions continue to serve as trusted third parties in vetting promising platform technol ogies, facilitating knowledge transfer including the licensing of patents upstream and downstream and making matches between vaccines and other organizations and willing and trusted manufacturers. These institutions also may help enforce private firm acti vities including but not limited to licensing arrangements, technology transfer agreements and production contracts for COVID -19 vaccine success and ensure vaccine safety, quality and adequate supply. Finally, w hile Frank, Dach and Lurie's classification231 relates activities mitigating these risks to specific US government efforts, it is clear other non -US governments, multilateral organizations and philanthropis ts have played important roles in COVID -19 vaccine success. On the issue of global access, one defining feature of development and procurement efforts funded for most COVID -19 vaccine candidates studied was that they were pursued on behalf of specific populations. That is, the United S tates of America was pursuing the support of COVID -19 vaccines pr imarily for the benefit of Americans, whereas other countries' support of vaccine candidate development and production were largely focused on securing the benefits of 90 vaccine access for their populations. The actions of the United S tates of America in particular to secure vaccine supply to the exclusion or priority over others through advanced purchase agreements among other activities is readily apparent in the public record and notable in its magnitude and diversity of vaccine sponsor targets. Other high-income countries appear to have followed similar practices to secure priority access for their populations but not on the same scale. Moreover, the rapid development of several mRNA-based vaccines (perhaps most notably that sponsored by Moderna and to a lesser degree that sponsored Pfizer/BioNtech) with a product profile less suited to low -resourced settings made clear that there was no single entity charged with global leadership and mandate to develop and deliver a diversity of innovations needed to support the global response to the pandemic across high-, middle- and low- income settings. My review makes clear in a very short t ime period, CEPI, COVAX and ACT -A have stepped into this global leadership role to admirable effect. How best to support and sustain these efforts to address the current pandemic and expected future threats is a key task for future study and global engagement. Nonetheless, my review of the evidence suggests there have been some missteps in COVID -19 vaccine success . Arguably, it may be the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that has done the most to fuel the fraught battle over intellectual property and technology transfer with regard to COVID -19 vaccines in which the world is now embroiled . Manufacturing and other problems, including its conduct of clinical trials , the vaccine's demonstrated efficacy in producing immunity and politic s, have plagued the company's efforts to bring a COVID -19 vaccine to market. The company's more recent failures to deliver COVID -19 vaccines to the European Commission as promised in 2021 only added to multiple frustrations. 91 These observations raise some more fundamental concerns. First, given the magnitude and diversity of global de- risking activities, the persistent lack of access to existing COVID -19 vaccines for all those who want them is deeply unfair and unjust. Clearly, the benefits for innovation under political regimes that recognize and enforce patents or other types of protected knowledge should be weighed against their costs in excluding others from the patented invention. Economists generally understand the tradeoff as patents should be understood as aiming to balance incentives for innovation, so- called dynamic efficiency, with incentives for affordability and access related to man y manufacturers making the patented product, so- called static efficiency. It is the tension between static and dynamic efficiency that underlies some discussion of patent waivers found in the current public debate regarding expending global access to successful COVID -19 vaccines. Here my review of the extent empirical evidence suggests there may be some good news in the early months of 2022. The production contracts that are publicly accessible , my discussions with key stakeholders as well as the case studies seem to suggest that some vaccine sponsors have been much more proactively engaged in supporting global manufacturing and distribution efforts than others. Among the successful vaccine case studies, the outlier appears to be the NIH/Moderna vaccine with their lack of engagement in facilitating global manufacturing capacity and access efforts . However , this observation is limited by the opacity of the public record and may change over time. Numerous stakeholders interviewed also raised concerns of a different type of vaccine nationalism taking hold , again , largely driven by US efforts. Specifically that when NIH/Moderna have announced support for additional global supply, it has relied on domestic manufacturing to support such efforts, rather than support the scaling up of vaccine 92 manufacturing by local producers to meet local needs . This is an important area to monitor, as the US government has endorsed other manufacturing efforts that would re- shore or near shore medicine production among many other products. Second, one wonders whether the institutions supporting the pursuit of advanced purchasing and manufacturing de- risking activities could have been more explicit in their support for global access and producti on as a precondition of initial and ongoing funding. This is an important area for future work, in part because it is non-trivial to structure such future- looking agreements with adequate and enforceable penalties for failure to deliver on agreed to commi tments. There are several previously released reports that are particularly useful to this current study and important for providing the broader context to my study's results. Most notably, a recently released report by Bown and Bollyky details how complex global supply chains for COVID -19 vaccine production emerged to produce the billions of doses of currently available vaccines232. They argue the separability of vaccine development into various functions affected how the vaccine manufacturing industry was organized heading into the pandemic and conclude that splitting apart the vaccine manufacturing supply chain ultimately affects how many doses can be produced, where and how quickly. Using a case study approach of six COVID -19 vaccines to illustrate thes e steps, they identify various challenges that may plague manufacturing efforts associated with them. Notably, ensuring that upstream base ingredient manufacturers and downstream fill- and-finish manufacturers can safely and reliably produce the product ev ery single time to meet regulatory standards entails significant risks and uncertainties, especially in the context of country- specific vaccine liability concerns. This report echoes some of Bown and Bollyky concerns233. For example, one related challenge raise d by numerous stakeholders I spoke with was the availability of assays, adjuvants, 93 other base ingredients and samples of existing already approved or emergency authorized vaccines to facilitate manufacturing scale up and scale out among willing partners . Here again , it was suggested that the willingness of vaccine sponsors and their upstream partners to support such activities is critical, but that willingness to provide this information may vary substantially by sponsor. The opacity of the contracts and whether or not they have been fulfilled makes this analysis subject to many caveats. However, in theory, institutions such as BARDA, other government agencies, CEPI and COVAX may have an important role to play in facilitating such exchanges, including by planning for their eventuality in the contract terms of advanced purchasing and production support agreements. Credible enforcement mechanisms may also need more refinement to support these future efforts. It is encouraging to see announcements of additional local manufacturing capacity becoming available to support vaccine access efforts worldwide. Here , long-term credibility of funding, more advanced planning in the support of licensing activities and indemnification and other commitments to the scaling up of COVID -19 vaccine manufacture and distribution and the maintenance of these activities, assurances and facilities is important to consider and plan for by individual governments, nonprofits and multilateral stakeholder s. It is possible that some of the reluctance to support global access to some mRNA vaccines is related to the fact that these platforms likely have other uses in ameliorating the losses associated with COVID -19, other infectious disease, including influenza and HIV, and other dread diseases , such as cancer . Here, licensing between smaller start -up companies and larger biopharmaceutical companies and more formal merger and acquisition activities may have a role to play in facilitating or impeding follow- on innovation and access. Although much classic work on patents and many lay observers have viewed innovation as a one shot deal\u2014the 94 de novo product either is developed or is not. However, most scholars and practitioners in this field have recognized that in many contexts innovation is cumulative and interdependent, meaning that many innovations build on multiple past inventions and present-day inventions are inputs into future inventions. Previous empirical work has suggested patents can impede follow- on innovation. Specifically, Williams found that a private firm's (Celera's) ownership of portions of the genome (through a proprietary database, not patents) led to large declines in follow- on research 234. Mergers can also poten tial harm follow -on innovation in this market. Stopping product development may be related to scientific chal lenges or business rationales. Cunningham, Ederer and Ma discovered, using biopharmaceutical industr y data , that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer's existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer's market power is large because of weak competition or distant patent expiration235. Although the authors do not identify such activity s pecific to vaccine development, a priori the outsize market, regulatory, manufacturing and liability risks associated with vaccine development and sale, especially for infectious diseases effecting populations facing significant liquidity constraints after product development, make them a potential target of \"killer \" product development decisions. Companies can also decide to exit from existing products or platforms when demand erodes or the costs of maintaining assets in comparison to other opportunities wane. Here again, government and international institutions such as BARDA, other government agencies, CEPI and COVAX may have an important role to play in facilitating material exchanges to support follow-on innovation both in addressing emerging variants of COVID-19 and other non- COVID applications of the mRNA technology. Government anti- trust and international institutions may also need to consider playing a more 95 proactive role in supporting a vaccine manufacturing ecosystem that can weather the vicissitudes in funding and consumer de mand to best address emerging epidemic and pandemic threats over the next decade and beyond . Finally, results of this study suggest BARDA, OWS, CEPI and many other government and multilateral funding agencies proactively pursued a portfolio approach to investment across vaccines and therapeutics.236 The COVID -19 pandemic appears to have broadened potential portfolio investments to include manufacturing commitments and the potential for repurposing products to address emerging threat s. The results suggest that there may be a role for the expansion of f orgiv able loans, non-dilutive financing and other types of public finance techniques to be further developed and deployed to address emergent threats. In part, this would help ensure there are sufficient funds to commit over time and leverage the complementarities of private company investments to advance public sector goals. Moreover, collectivizing funding for new vaccine development over wider populations and using various financing mechanisms to support private sector development efforts can ensure that products with characteristics meeting the needs of specific local populations are supported at a global scale. This study has some additional limitations. Perhaps most notably, future work should examine more closely the already successfully developed COVID -19 vaccines that emerged from non-Western efforts, including that of China, Russia, India and Cuba and the drivers of their success in development, production and distribution. 96 THIS PAGE KEPT INTENTIONALLY BLANK 97 END NOTES 1 United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). \"COVID -19 Vaccine 2022. market -dashboard>. 2 World Health Organization Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard.\" Web.

Our funding collaborators may also impose restrictions on or mandate input as to our conduct of clinic al trials, manufacturing activities or distribution activities, which may cause delays in the event of disagreement. In addition, since the path to licensure of any vaccine against COVID- 19 is unclear, we may have a widely used vaccine in circulation in th e United States or another country prior to our receipt of marketing approval. Unexpected safety issues in these circumstances could lead to significant reputational damage for Moderna and our technology platform going forward and other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need for re-design of our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources.\" 96 In the company's spring 2020 SEC filings, they make this statement: \"In addition, another party may be successful in producing a more efficacious vaccine or other treatment for COVID -19 which may also lead to the diversion of governmental and quasi-governmental funding away from us and toward other companies. In particular, given the widespread media attention on the cur rent COVID -19 pandemic, there are efforts by public and private entities to develop a COVID-19 vaccine as fast as possible, including by Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Pfizer. Those other entities may develop COVID -19 vaccines that are more effective than any we may develop, may develop a COVID -19 vaccine that becomes the standard of care, may develop a COVID -19 vaccine at a lower cost or earlier than we are able to develop any COVID- 19 vaccine, or may be more successful at commercializing a COVID -19 vaccine. Many of these other organizations are much larger than we are and have access to larger pools of capital and broader manufacturing infrastructure. The success or failure of other entities, or perceived success or failure, may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding for our COVID-19 vaccine development efforts or to ultimately commercialize our vaccine, if approved.

The median duration for follow-up in this analysis was 53 days following the second dose. mRNA- 1273 was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. No serious safety concerns have been identified to date. The most common solicited local adverse event was injection site pain. The most common solicited systemic adverse events after the second dose of mRNA- 1273 were headache, fatigue, myalgia and chills. The Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) for our C OVID -19 vaccine in the European Union has been expanded to include adolescents 12 years of age and older. In addition, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare also approved our COVID- 19 vaccine for ages 12 to 17.

We expect to enroll 12,000 healthy pediatric par ticipants in the U.S. and Canada into this two- part, dose escalation study. In Part 1, each participant ages 2 years to less than 12 years may receive one of two dose levels (50 \u00b5g or 100 \u00b5g). Also in Part 1, each participant ages six months to less than 2 years may receive one of three dose levels (25 \u00b5g, 50 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g). An interim analysis will be conducted to determine which dose will be used in Part 2, the placebo-controlled expansion portion of the study...

In the case of AstraZeneca, their fears would prove to be unfounded. Oxford and the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker have since signed a licensing deal with the Serum Institute. In hindsight, the covert shipment, intended to guarantee the mass production of COVID-19 shots at low costs, was an opening salvo. \" 180 \"How AstraZeneca's Vaccine Was Hit by Flawed Trials, Defects and Politics\": \"The unorthodox data that shook some experts' confidence came after early manufacturing fumbles. Oxford was working with a contract manufacturer, which ended up making a half dose by accident. Then, when the scientists decided to test a two -dose course, they were hit by production delays, which meant a longer gap between doses as they waited for supplies. According to Oxford's Pollard, this mistake has proved to be a blessing. 'At that time, it felt like a frustration, but in retrospect it turned out to be extremely useful,' he said. Later analysis showed it was probably the longer interval that made the vaccine more effective. This finding helped assure regulators that spacing out the two doses, as the UK has, would allow more people to be vaccinated with the bonus of added efficacy.\" 116 181 Strasburg, \"AstraZeneca COVID -19 Antibody Treatment Suffers Setback.\" 182 AstraZeneca PLC, op. cit., p. 55. 183 As the vaccine began to be rolled out, a handful of Europeans experienced a rare blood- clotting condition, which led to a few deaths.

Comments on the report by Rena Conti: \"The Determinants of COVID-19 Vacci ne Success\" Hall* December 30, 2021 Introduction When the WIPO Study on the \"Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Success\" began in June, SARS-CoV-2 had taken 3.7 million lives across the world, e ffective C OVID-19 vaccines had been developed with unprecedented speed, and t hey were being rolled out. Approximately 45 per cent of Americans were fully vaccinated with a 2-dose course, 20 per cent of Europeans, and less than 1 per cent of Africans. W hile African and other low and lower-m iddle income countries were behind in receiving COVID-19 vaccines, C OVAX shared a plan for v accines to more equitably distributed by the end of 2021.1 Since then, the epidemiolocal situation has changed. By autumn, the Delta variant becam e the predominant str ain in most countries. In early Decemb er, only four weeks after being first identified, t he more contagious Omicron v ariant became the dominant strain in South Africa.2 The Omicron is projected to be the predominant strain3 in Europe, the United St ates of America and elsewhere within the coming 1 to 3 months. W hile COVID-1 9 vaccines performed well against the original strain and the Delta variant, the Omicron variant is better at ev ading vaccine- induced immunity. Da ta is mixed on the severity of disease it causes. Some findings point toward it being milder while others suggest it may lead to more hospitalization in child ren.4 As 1 \"What Does COVAX's Latest Supply Forecast Tell Us?.\" Gavi.

Israel is discu ssing the timing of a fourth dose. In terms of vaccine distribution, a lmos t 70 per cent of G7 country popul ations are fully vaccinated and more than 20 per cent also have received a booster dos e. China has fully vaccinated 85 per cent of their popul ation and 9 pe r cent have received a booster. In contrast, most African countries have vaccinated less than 3 per cent of their popul ations. Burundi has the lowest reported C OVID -19 vac cine coverag e in the world of 0.03 pe r cent. T he COVAX goal of all countries receiving vaccines for at least 20 per cent of their popul ations by the end of 2021 was missed. Poorer countries and countries without vaccine know -how still ha ve very limited access to COVID -19 vaccines . Since June, the vaccine equity gap has increase d, and an additional 1.7 million lives have been lost. T he situation furthe r increase s the urgency of everyone having access to COVID -19 vaccines \u2014the key tool for saving lives and r educing virus replication. Summary In the context of changing epidemiology and increasing vaccine inequity, th e WIPO Study of determinants of COVID- 19 vaccines success is all the more relevant . The Study provides a timely, important and new analysis on t he determinants of vaccine success. The evidence- based analysis that led to the list of determinants is compelling , including the conclusion that patents are a useful incentive but only one of multiple determinants. In my remarks I recomme nd a look at determinants of overall global vaccine success and failur e given the lack of overall va ccine success (access thus far as a future research topic . Including responsibility of patent holders toward the societal goal of saving lives and ending the pandemic; and the suitability of the current global architecture on e nabling global access. Lastly , I think the WIPO Study should be shared with countries and regions pursuing pandemic vaccine manufacturing capabilities and capacity because the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine success could be a helpful roadmap for their plans and strategies moving forward. 131 More than patents \u2014multiple determinants lead to a vaccine's success The W IPO Study describes the complexity, costs and risks tha t are inherent in vaccine development and production. Given the societal value of vaccines, special incentives and action that compensate for these costs and risks are necessary to prevent market failure and incentivize development and production. The case studies and literature review in the WIPO Study show this also to be the case with COVID -19 vaccines. Patents and intellectual property are used across COVID -19 vaccine development and manufacturing processes. But given the complexity of these processes, the case studies in the WIPO Study show that patents alone are not suffici ent. They may not even be an overriding factor. The report uncovers a mix of common factors that have resulted in COVID -19 vaccines being developed, manufactured and distributed in record time with record investment and success : open science in early research , know -how ( vaccine regulatory, R&D and technology ), collaboration and risk -sharing financial sponsors . A key conclusion of the study is that no single determinant translates to success but rather multiple determinants. Patents alone are not an enabler. Individua l COVID-19 vaccine success vs. overall vaccine success After illus trating several successful COVID -19 vaccines , the Study closes with an important note about the current lack of global access to these vaccines . As the Study notes, t he COVID -19 vaccine response has been \"exceptional in magnitude and speed.\" It also has been insufficient. Despite many individual vaccine successes, there is still 55 per cent5 of the global population without access . All low -income countries and most middle-income countries are one to two years behind the wealthier countries and/or countries with vaccine know-how.6 5 World Health Organization (WHO). \" WHO Coronavirus (COVID -19) Dashboard: Situation by Region, Country, Territory & Area .\" Web.

Apr. nition of vaccine success in the WIPO Study includes distribution of the vaccine to those who would benefit from them . An understanding of an individual vaccine' s success and failure is extremely valuable. But analysis of overall success or failure in getting COVID -19 vaccines to those who need them is also needed . The analysis of individual vaccines success does not necessarily provide that insight. Additional research on the deter minants of overall global vaccine success could be helpful. Including a critical look at whether the incentive that patents provide helps or hinders achievement of a societal g oal as large as a pandemic response. Or, whether i n a pandemic, patent grantees should have a special responsibility7 of ensuring access until the societal goal is achieved. Region al initiatives have emerged in response to a lack of overall vaccine success Trigge red by an initial delay in access to COVID -19 vaccines and growing inequity, s everal countries and regions c reated initiatives around local vaccine procurement and production. The African Union (AU) launched the Africa Vaccine Access Trust (AVAT)8 in early 2021 with the goal of procuring COVID -19 vaccines directly from the global manufacturing base. AU countries wanted more agency and took the decision to coordinate with, but bypass global mechanisms such as COVAX and UNICEF. The AU recently established an additional goal of manufacturing 60 per cent of the vaccines needed for Africa in Africa by 204 0.

The WIP O Study underscores the importance of these initiatives to strengthen or crea te regional vaccine production capabilities in areas that have been underserved by the current global architecture. The determinants of COVID -19 vaccine success outlined in the Study provide a roadmap for these initiatives to be a success: establish a base capability on regulatory, research and technology during peacetime (interpandemic), and prepare a strategy to establish a portfolio of vaccine candidates via risk - and cost-sharing agreements with public and private financing sponsors. In the c losing section, the Study points toward the need for \"further deployment of special financing\" and \"collectivizing funding for new vaccine development ... to support the needs of local populations at global scale.\" So far, it has not been seen that countries can f airly or equitably prioritize access to one of their sponsored pandemic vaccines with other countries in need . 10 Therefore, if not localized, these recommended actions may perpetuate the risk of lower income countries being subject to the epidemiological c ontext and goodwill of othe rs. As furt her action, the WIPO Study could be shared with emerging initiatives on regional and local vaccine production as helpful insight . Moreover, the suitability of the current global architecture could be considered as a part of the research on overall global vaccine success. *** 9 Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). \" PAHO Selects Centers in Argentina, Brazil to Develop COVID- 19 mRNA Vaccines .\" Sept. 21, 2021.

Even though some European countries have reached a high vaccination coverage, the infection rates are still r ising . Apparently, a global pandemic can only be controlled if vaccines are available in all affected regions of the world. Therefore, global access to vaccines is key. But the creation and production of vaccines is complicat ed and costly. The world is depending on innovators who have the necessary technological and financial resources to create vaccines and adapt them to new variants of the COVID-19 pathogen. Their innovation model is based on patents and trade secrets. The last two years have demonstrated that effective vaccines can be created much faster than in the past. However, this fast development was only possible because of unprecedented joint efforts of private companies and public institutions. Mu ch has been achieved with regard to the creation of COVID-19 vaccines whereas a sufficient production and worldwide distribution has not yet been reached. The following comments are not meant as a criticism of the WIPO Study but as suggestions for future research.1 The co mments are written from the perspective of an intellectual property lawyer. Patents and other IP are meant to su pport technological innovations. Public interest may motivate limitation s of the effects of patents or 1 Bowen, William G. \"JST OR and the Econo mics of Scholarly Communication.\" Jo urnal of Library Administration 26.1-2 (1999): pp. 27-44. Print. Future research should take into account studies in other languages as English, for example, from German literature Metzger, Axel and justify compulsory licenses. But these limitations of patent law must be complemented by other more appropriate policies and initiatives to achieve worldwide supply and equitable access to vaccines.2 Necessary limitations of the research question The focus of the WIPO Study is to determine the role of different aspects of open science, of push and pull mechanisms, of patents, of trade secrets/know-how, of licenses and of public agencies both for the creation of COVID -19 vaccines and for their production and distribution. This holistic approach is both necessary and ambitious. However, put as a general question, at least at this point in time, it seems hardly possible to produce straight- forward answers since the role of these determinants seems to be different for the various vaccine candidates examined. It is therefore for good reasons that the Study takes a more modest approach, which is to describe the determinants in the general parts of the paper and then look into case studies and explain their specific role in the different scenarios. It would require a large- scale study to confirm or reject comparative hypothetical statements such as faster/slower with/without IP, more/less public/private funding, open science, etc. Such a large- scale study would have to cope with the difficul ty that the starting points of the examined vaccine candidates were considerably different. This could be interesting for more detailed future research but would have clearly exceeded the resources available for the WIPO Study. Observed market failures in the development of vaccines The WIP O Study describes the specific market failures in the development of vaccines that have been observed in the last decades. These market failures concern in particular vaccine platforms, the basic technologies used for different kinds of vaccines and diseases that are mostly found in the Global South. It is remarkable how the joint private and public efforts have overcome these market failures in the case of COVID -19 vaccines. The WIPO Study shows the determinants of this unprecedented success of vaccine development. One can hope that some of the technological advances made regarding vaccine platforms will support a faster development from viral sequencing to clinical trials for other pathogens as well. 3 Still, it is difficult to imagine that the industrialized states of the North will engage in comparable risk -mitigation and other push and pull incentives with regard to diseases essentially found in the southern hemisphere. Therefore, the positive lessons learned from the development of COVID-19 vaccines will not be easy to transfer to other pathogens. The posit ive functions of patents in vaccine development The WIP O Study describes how patents support innovation by allowing patent holders to exclude others for a limited term. The right to exclude others in turn allows innovators to charge prices that are 2 Major initiatives are COVAX, GA VI and CEPI. 3 Lurie, Nicole, Melanie Saville, Richard Hatchett and Jane Halton . \"Developing Covid -19 Vaccines at Pandemic Speed. \" New England Journal of Medicine 382.21 (2020): pp. 1969, 1970. 137 above marginal costs of production. The hope for exclusivity can incentivize innovators to invest in research and development. Future research could explore ad ditional functions of patents for vaccine development: (1) Patents play a decisive role for all kinds of technology transfers. They serve as the basis for licenses. Much technology would not be shared if innovators could not define the terms of use and reserve their rights. As clearly defined property rights, patents help to lower transaction costs. 4 Patents may support technology transfer to the Global South. Cooperation with vaccine producers may be facilitated if the respective markets provide adeq uate patent protection. 5 (2) Patents serve as signaling tools for start-ups and SMEs seeking financial resources. Patent portfolios play an important role to convince venture capital investors or partners from major pharmaceutical industries. 6 Relation ship of patents and trade secrets A closely related issue that deserves more attention in future research is the relationship of patents and trade secrets in vaccine development. Patents allow and oblige innovators to disclose their technologies. Without legally guaranteed exclusivity, they would keep their inventions as trade secrets. Under a patent system, the innovator discloses its invention in the patent registry in return for exclusivity for a limited term. However, it has become clear during the public debate on a possible TRIPS waiver 7 that the information disclosed in the patent claims and patent descriptions as such does not enable competitors to start vaccine production. For the time being, it seems to be difficult to reproduce vaccines without the secret know-how of the inventor. This seems to be particularly the case for mRNA vaccines. The special know- how of manufacturers is partly kept secret because it does not relate to patentable information, but in some cases, it is deliberately not published as part of the patent application. 8 In contrast to other pharmaceuticals, it is not possible to successfully reverse engineer a vaccine, as an identical product is not guaranteed if an alternative production process is used.9 Therefore, access to secret manufacturing information is key for vaccine production. This overlap of patents and trade secrets distorts the \"grand bargain\" between inventor and society. The innovator can claim exclusivity but the disclosure of its technology does not enable competitors. This know-how aspect complicates any regulatory adjustments of the patent system. Compulsory licenses or statutory 4 So-called \"prospect theory, \" see Kitch, Edmund W. \"The Nature and Function of the Patent System. \" Journal of Law and Economics 20.2 (1977): pp. 265, 278. 5 Crager, Sara Eve. \"Improving Global Access to New Vaccines: Intellectual Property, Technology Transfer, and Regulatory Pathways. \" American Journal of Public Informs VC Investors - The Case Innovation and New Technology 25 (2016): pp. 197, 201, 212 f. 7 See WTO documents IP/C/W/669 and IP/C/W/669/Rev.1 on the proposal for a \"Waiver from certain provisions of the TRIPS agreement for the prevention, containment and treatmen t of COVID- 19.\" 8 Price, W.

The problem of access to know-how and manufacturing information for vaccines has long been known,10 but now receives greater public attention. The role of patent -protected basic technologies Political c laims for a statutory waiver or for voluntary patent pledges of vaccine innovators are oftentimes based on simplifications and misconceptions of the current landscape of patents related to COVID -19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines could only have been developed since early 2020 after the emergence of the pathogen. The earliest patent applicatio ns for COVID -19 vaccines are currently published after the 18-months period. These patent applications are still far off having endured the examination and possible post-grant opposition procedures. Therefore, at this point in time, the relevant patents to be taken into account are patents on basic technologies that are used for the production of or as compounds of COVID- 19 vaccines. These patents on basic technologies may trigger legal conflicts and as a consequence slow down research and development by follow-on inventors. The Moderna/Arbutus conflict illustrates the legal uncertainties arising out of conflicts over patents on basic technologies. 11 The WIPO Study addresses this conflict with regard to lipid nanoparticle technology. A second basic technology mentioned in the WIPO Study that is needed by nearly all developers of COVID -19 vaccines is a technology invented by the NIH to \" freeze \" the coronavirus spike proteins to the prefusion state. 12 One could add as a third basic technology a vaccine technology invented at the University of Pennsylvania in 2005. The invention allows mRNA to be administered to the body without eliciting an immune response. This technology is used by all mRNA vaccines.13 For the time being, notwithstanding the conflict over the validity of the Arbutus patent, it seems that vaccine innovators could get licenses for the necessary basic technologies. However, it is not unlikely that the rapid development of vaccine and more general mRNA technology may soon create patent thickets which may then call for patent pools. Also, basic technologies may develop into industry standards that may require FRAND licensing schemes. Intellect ual property resulting from public funded research The WI PO Study aims at determining the role of different determinants for the creation of COVID -19 vaccines, in particular open science, push and pull mechanisms, patents and the role of public agencies. 10 Crager, op. cit. ; Price, W.

In the United States of America, universities hold broad patent portfolios. Some of the relevant basic technologies necessary for the production of mRNA vaccines are held by universities, as mentioned before. However, in the United States of America publicly funded inventions may be covered by the Bayh-Dole Act, which allows small businesses, universities and non-profit organizations to own inventions funded by taxpayers ' money but provides march -in rights fo r the government. 14 In the context of COVID- 19 vaccines, at least several basic technologies developed by the University of Pennsylvania and covered by the Bayh- Dole Act are used for mRNA vaccines.15 As a result Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna acquired non- exclusive licenses for this technology.16 In Europe, some jurisdictions and public funding institutions allow the recipient private companies to register the resulting patents, whereas other jurisdictions and funding agencies follow different strategies.17 With regard to funding on a European level, the lack of legal requirements for a rapid and wide access to the funded innovations has been criticized. The European Union collected 9.9 billion euros during the Global Response Pledging Conference (GRPC) for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. However, there has not been a public announcement that the funded technologies have to be shared for fair prices or licensed under non-exclusive licenses. 18 Other financial projects to promote innovation in the European Union, such as HORIZON 2020 or HORIZON Europe, are even explicitly allowing participants to transfer rights under exclusive licenses. 19 Given the very relevant contribution of taxpayer's money to the creation of COVID -19 vaccines and the controversial discussion in Europe, future research should shed additional light on the role of publicly funded inventions. Ass essing the different functions of licenses Lic enses for use of IP protected technologies play an essential role for the creation and distribution of vaccines. Licenses prevent blocking effects of patents on basic technologies that are used by vaccine innovators. They provide a basis for the production and distribution of vaccines and compounds by manufacturers and distributors. Vaccine innovators do only engage in such cooperation on the basis of clear stipulations about the use of their patents and trade secrets. Otherwise, they would endanger their 14 35 U.S. Code \u00a7 203. 15 Abinadar, Luis Gil, \"Foundational mRNA Patents Are Subject to the Bayh -Dole Act Provisions. \" KEI. Nov. 30, 2020. Web.

Licenses ensure technology transfer on a national and international level. And finall y, licenses may be used as a proxy to determine the relevanc e of a technology protected by patents and trade secrets.20 However, licenses are for most part not publ icly available. Empirical studies on licenses are restricted to reviews of public statements of companies,21 a method also applied by the WIPO Study in the framework of the case studies . The specific provisions of the license contracts and the amounts of license fees remain confidentia l in most cases. This makes it impossible to come to definitive conclusions about the role of licenses for vaccine creation and production. It would be highly desirabl e for futur e research to have a broader empirical basis with regard to the relevant license agreements. Case studies from other world regions The WIPO Study examines both successful and so far unsuccessful COVID- 19 vaccin e candidates in several case studies. This provides additional insights and exemplifies how diverse the starting points and conditions of the different vaccine development projects were. The chosen candidates for case studies are all from developed industries in Nort h America and Europe. It would be of interest to learn more about the development of vaccines in other regions of the world, in particular in China and Russia. Emerging landscape of COVID-19 vaccine patents Due to the 18-month publication period, the first patent applications for COVID-19 vaccines from early 2020 are currently becoming publicly available. It is not certain when these patents will finally be granted and how the final wording of the claims will look after examination and possible oppos ition procedures. Moreover, it remains to be seen how the patents in their final wording will correlate and which of the claimed priorities will be the earliest. One can expect that the number of patents claiming or being related to COVID-19 vaccines will rise in the coming months. At this point in time, only a few patent applications of the major vaccine producers covering COVID -19 have been published,22 whereas a search on Patentscope shows many Chinese and Russian applications.23 It may well be that the discussion of the role of patents could be different once the number of published patent applications rises. 20 Gaviria and Kilic, op. cit, 546, 5 47. 21 Gaviria and Kilic (op. cit.) refer to US Securities and Exchang e Commission (SEC) filings of reported license agreements. 22 See EP 3901260 A1 (Biontech), WO 63 (Moderna). 23 A search using the terms \"SARS \" and \"Vaccine\" on the \"Front Page \" resulted in 93 patent applications for technologies related to vaccines with reference to China and 10 patent applications with reference to Rus sia. Using the terms \"COVID\" and \"Vaccine\" resulted in 60 patent applications with reference to China and seven with reference to Russia. 141 Blocking effects of COVID-19 vaccine patents The WIPO Study refers to the tradeoff of patents as aiming to balance incentives for innovation, so called dynamic efficiency, with incentives for affordability and access, so-called static efficiency. The current public debate on a possibl e waiver of patents for successful COVID-1 9 vaccines is claiming that the crisis calls for a greater emphasis of the access paradigm. Future research should further investigate whether COVID-19 patents entail blocking effects, especially with regard to ac cess to vaccines in the southern hemisphere. For the time being, there seems to be no evidence of any such blocking effects. Patent holders seem to cooperate so far, if pharmaceutical companies from the Global South are technically equipped to enter into vaccine production. Moreover, there are no reported cases or legal conflicts with regard to compulsory licenses for COVID-19 vaccine patents. This situation may chang e in the future. It may turn out that the existing legal instruments for access to technologies do no longer suffice. But in the current situation, regulators are better advised to take a cautious approach as long as the global community is in urgent need for innovative technical solutions to overcome the crisis. *** * Axel Metzger is Profess or of Civil law and Intellectua l Propert y at Humboldt- University in Berlin.
