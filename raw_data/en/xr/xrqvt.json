The most posterior zone, Zone I, is defined as a circle centered on the optic nerve with radius twice the distance from nerve to fovea, or subtending an angle of 30 degrees. Because the eye enlarges and undergoes refractive changes during the period of ROP screening, the absolute area of Zone I according to these definitions may likewise change. It is possible that these differences may confound accurate assessment of risk in patients with ROP. In this study, we estimated the area of Zone I in relation to different ocular parameters to determine how variability in the size and refractive power of the eye may affect zoning. Using Gaussian optics, a model was constructed to calculate the absolute area of Zone I as a function of corneal power, anterior chamber depth, lens power, lens thickness, and axial length (AL), with Zone I defined as a circle with radius set by a 30-degree visual angle. Our model predicted Zone I area to be most sensitive to changes in AL; for example, an increase of AL from 14.20 to 16.58mm at postmenstrual age 32weeks was calculated to expand the area of Zone I by up to 72%. These findings motivate several hypotheses which upon future testing may help optimize treatment decisions for ROP.

Cohort comprised of retinal images from 84 eyes of 42 patients who were sequentially screened for ROP over 6 consecutive weeks in a telemedicine program and then followed to vascular maturation or treatment, and then disease stabilization. De-identified retinal images across the 6 weekly exams (2520 total images) were graded by an ROP expert based on whether ROP had improved, worsened, or stayed the same compared to the prior week's images, corresponding to an overall clinical \"gestalt\" score. Subsequently, we examined which parameters might have influenced the examiner's ability to detect longitudinal change; images were graded by the same ROP expert by image view (central, inferior, nasal, superior, temporal) and by retinal components (vascular tortuosity, vascular dilation, stage, hemorrhage, vessel growth), again determining if each particular retinal component or ROP in each image view had improved, worsened, or stayed the same compared to the prior week's images. Agreement between gestalt scores and view, component, and component by view scores was assessed using percent agreement, absolute agreement, and Cohen's weighted kappa statistic to determine if any of the hypothesized image features correlated with the ability to predict ROP disease trajectory in patients. The central view showed substantial agreement with gestalt scores (kappa=0.63), with moderate agreement in the remaining views. Of retinal components, vascular tortuosity showed the most overall agreement with gestalt (kappa=0.42-0.61), with only slight to fair agreement for all other components. This is a well-defined ROP database graded by one expert in a real-world setting in a masked fashion that correlated with the actual (remote in time) exams and known outcomes. This provides a foundation for subsequent study of telemedicine's ability to longitudinally assess ROP disease trajectory, as well as for potential artificial intelligence approaches to retinal image grading, in order to expand patient access to timely, accurate ROP screening.

Remote interpretation of fundus photographs acquired in a primary care or other nonophthalmic setting in a store-and-forward manner is a predominant paradigm of teleophthalmology screening programs. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based image interpretation offers an alternative means of DR detection. IDx-DR (Digital Diagnostics Inc) is a Food and Drug Administration-authorized autonomous testing device for DR. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of IDx-DR compared with human-based teleophthalmology over 2 and a half years. Additionally, we evaluated an AI-human hybrid workflow that combines AI-system evaluation with human expert-based assessment for referable cases.Prospective cohort study and retrospective analysis.Diabetic patients 18 years old without a prior DR diagnosis or DR examination in the past year presenting for routine DR screening in a primary care clinic.Macula-centered and optic nerve-centered fundus photographs were evaluated by an AI algorithm followed by consensus-based overreading by retina specialists at the Stanford Ophthalmic Reading Center. Detection of more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy (MTMDR) was compared with in-person examination by a retina specialist.Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and gradability achieved by the AI algorithm and retina specialists.The AI 95% CI, 47.7%-72.9%) for detection of MTMDR compared remote image interpretation was lower for the AI algorithm (62.5%) compared with retina specialists (93.1%). A 2-step AI-human hybrid workflow in which the AI algorithm initially rendered an assessment followed by overread by a retina specialist of MTMDR-positive encounters resulted in a sensitivity of 95.5% (95% CI, 86.7%-100%) and a specificity of Similarly, a 2-step overread improved of encounters.Implementation of an AI-human hybrid teleophthalmology workflow may both decrease reliance on human specialist effort and improve diagnostic accuracy.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.

Given global trends of increasing myopia, we aimed to determine the absolute risk (incidence rate) of RRD in non-myopes, myopes and high myopes in the United States over ten years. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 85,476,781 commercially insured patients enrolled in the Merative Marketscan Research Database. The incidence rate of RRD in phakic patients inthe United States was 39-fold higher in high myopes than non-myopes (868.83 per 100,000 versus in non-myopes (67.51 per 100,000 person-yearsversus22.44 per 100,000 person-years). The incidence rate was significantly higher in males in each category (P<0.01). Combined, the incidence rate of RRD in phakic patients inthe United States from 2007 to 2016was 25.27 RRDs per 100,000 person-years, a rate higherthan those in prior published studies in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.The absolute risk of myopia and high myopia increased from 2007 to 2016. Therisk of RRD in phakichigh myopes rosewith increasing age. Notably, the magnitude of increased risk of RRD in myopes varied substantially according to the minimum follow-up period in our models and should be accounted for when interpreting data analyses.

Leading causes of blindness were retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in 301 (31.3%), nystagmus in 78 (8.1%), and cataract in 64 (6.7%) patients. The retina was the leading anatomic site (47.7%) followed by optic nerve (11.6%) and lens (10.0%). A total of 52.4% of patients had treatable causes of blindness.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis offers a unique cross-sectional view of childhood blindness in the US using a clinical data registry. More than one-half of blind patients had a treatable cause of blindness.

We investigated the mechanism of missingness for DR severity based on ICD coding using the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS Registry. We included all patient encounters in the registry with a DR ICD-9 or ICD-10 code between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2021. Demographic, clinical, and practice-level characteristics were compared between encounters with specified and unspecified disease severity. Practices were divided into quartiles based on the proportion of clinical encounters with unspecified DR severity. Encounters with unspecified disease severity were associated with significantly older patient age, better visual acuity, and lower utilization of ophthalmic procedures. Higher volume practices and retina specialist practices had lower proportions of clinical encounters with unspecified disease severity. Results strongly suggest that DR disease severity related to ICD coding is missing not at random.

We performed a chart review and included eyes that had high myopia and ocular biometric measurements at any time point after January 2019. We divided our cohort into 5 different groups: (1) isolated high myopia (IHM) syndrome.Main Outcome Measures: Biometric measurements.Results: A total of 246 patients (432 eyes) were included as follows: 202 patients (359 eyes) in the IHM group, 17 patients (27 eyes) in the ROP group, 7 patients (12 eyes) in the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy group, 8 patients (14 eyes) in the Marfan group, and 12 patients (20 eyes) in the Stickler group. The ROPgroup showed significantly shorter axial lengths, shallower anterior chambers, and thicker lenses compared with the IHM group. The Marfan group showed significantly flatter corneas and thicker lenses compared with the IHM group. The Stickler group showed significantly longer axial lengths compared with the IHM group.Conclusions: High myopia is associated with variable biometric measurements according to underlying ocular or genetic conditions. Retinopathy of prematurity-associated high myopia is is Marfan myopia is derived from axial and lenticular mechanisms.

While optogenetics within ophthalmology has been primarily applied towards treating inherited retinal disease, there are a myriad of other applications that hold great promise for a variety of eye diseases including cellular regeneration, modulation of mitochondria and metabolism, regulation of intraocular pressure, and pain control. Supported by primary data from the authors' work with in vitro and in vivo applications, we introduce a novel approach to metabolic regulation, Opsins to Restore Cellular ATP (ORCA). We review the fundamental constructs for ophthalmic optogenetics, present current therapeutic approaches and clinical trials, and discuss the future of subcellular and signaling pathway applications for neuroprotection and vision restoration.

We hypothesized that in many real-world scenarios the effective composite FOV is considerably less than ideal. This observational retrospective study analyzed the effective FOV of fundus photos of patients screened for ROP as part of the Stanford University Network for Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity (SUNDROP) initiative. Five fundus photos were selected from each eye per image session. Effective FOV was defined as the largest circular area centered on the optic disc that encompassed retina in each of the four cardinal views. Seventy-three subjects were analyzed, 35 without ROP and 34 with ROP. Mean effective FOV was 144.556.62 ranging from 130.00 to 153.71. Effective FOV was not correlated with the presence or absence of ROP, gestational age, birth weight, or postmenstrual age. Mean effective FOV was wider in males compared to females. Standard five-field 130 fundus photos yielded an average effective FOV of 144.54 in the SUNDROP cohort. This implies that an imaging FOV during ROP screening considerably less than the hypothetical ideal of 180 is sufficient for detecting treatment warranted ROP.

We included patients with a confirmed diagnosis of any subtype of EDS who had any form of readable retinal imaging including colour fundus photos, autofluorescence, red-free photos, red-free optical coherence tomography photos and fluorescein angiography. Patients who had no retinal imaging and those with no confirmed EDS diagnosis were excluded. Retinal images were reviewed for RAT and were graded into no, possible and definite RAT. Eyes with definite RAT were further graded into mild, moderate and severe. Eyes with definite RAT were again subclassified according to the type of involved vessels into first-order arteriolar, macular and arteriovenous.RESULTS: A total of 307 patients were identified using the STARR tool and 142 patients were included. Mean age was 40.918.1 years and 87% were female. Underlying EDS subtypes were EDS EDS (2.8%), (0.7%) and not specified (24.6%). We graded 37.3% of patients with definite RAT, 10.6% with possible RAT and 52.1% with no RAT. In patients with definite RAT, we graded 39.2% of eyes with mild RAT, 40.2% with moderate RAT and 20.6% with severe RAT. In all, 84.9% showed involvement of first-order retinal arterioles, 35.8% macular arterioles and 1.9% showed arteriovenous involvement.CONCLUSIONS: Variable degrees of RAT are associated with EDS.

Studies of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections have suggested efficacy in the treatment of ROP, but few studies have directly compared them with laser treatments.Objective: To compare intravitreal aflibercept vs laser photocoagulation in infants with ROP requiring treatment.Design, Setting, and Participants: This noninferiority, phase 3, 24-week, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 27 countries (64 hospital sites) throughout Asia, Europe, and South America. Overall, 118 infants (gestational age 32 weeks at birth or birth weight 1500 g) with ROP severity (zone I stage 1+ [stage 1 plus increased disease activity], zone I stage 2+, zone I stage 3, zone I stage 3+, zone II stage 2+, or zone II stage 3+) requiring treatment or with aggressive posterior ROP in at least 1 eye were enrolled between September 25, 2019, and August 28, 2020 (the last visit occurred on February 12, 2021).Interventions: Infants were randomized 2:1 to receive a 0.4-mg dose of intravitreal aflibercept (n=75) or laser photocoagulation (n=43) at baseline. Additional treatment was allowed as prespecified.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of infants without active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes 24 weeks after starting treatment (assessed by investigators). The requirement for rescue treatment was considered treatment failure. Intravitreal aflibercept was deemed noninferior if the lower limit of the 1-sided 95% bayesian credible interval for the treatment difference was greater than -5%.Results: Among 118 infants randomized, 113 were treated (mean gestational age, 26.3 [SD, 1.9] weeks; 53 [46.9%] were female; 16.8% had ROP, 19.5% had zone I ROP, and 63.7% had zone II ROP) and 104 completed the study. Treatment (intravitreal aflibercept: n=75; laser photocoagulation: n=38) was mostly 82.2% of eyes in the intravitreal aflibercept group received 1 injection per eye. Treatment success was 85.5% with intravitreal aflibercept 95% credible interval, -8.0% to Rescue treatment was required in 4.8% (95% CI, 1.9% to 9.6%) of eyes group vs 11.1% (95% CI, 4.9% to 20.7%) of eyes in the laser photocoagulation group. The serious adverse event rates were 13.3% (ocular) and 24.0% (systemic) in the intravitreal aflibercept group compared with 7.9% and 36.8%, respectively, in the laser photocoagulation group. Three deaths, which occurred 4 to 9 weeks after intravitreal aflibercept treatment, were considered unrelated to aflibercept by the investigators.Conclusions and Relevance: Among infants with ROP, intravitreal aflibercept compared with laser photocoagulation did not meet criteria for noninferiority with respect to the primary outcome of the proportion of infants achieving treatment success at week 24. Further data would be required for more definitive conclusions regarding the comparative effects of intravitreal aflibercept and laser photocoagulation in 35881122](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35881122) We used population-based data obtained from Optum's Clinformatics Data Mart Database to characterize recent trends in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) treatments and outcomes in the United States.

An ocular examination of a 4-month-old male infant with poor vision revealed punched-out macular and perivascular chorioretinal fibrosis and atrophy with peripheral retinal nonperfusion. Subsequently, he was hospitalized for recurrent infections and was diagnosed with CGD. Repeated examination demonstrated enlargement of the chorioretinal lesions without evidence of active inflammation or neovascularization. CGD causes recurrent, severe, life-threatening infections in children and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chorioretinal lesions with peripheral retinal nonperfusion.

Images were labeled with the clinical diagnosis of plus disease (plus, pre-plus, no plus) that was documented in the chart, and a reference standard diagnosis (RSD) determined by three image-based ROP graders and the clinical diagnosis.METHODS, INTERVENTION OR TESTING: Demographics (birthweight [BW], gestational age [GA]), and clinical diagnoses for all eye exams were recorded from each institution. Using a FL approach, a DL model for plus disease classification was trained using only the clinical labels. The three class probabilities were then converted into a vascular severity score (VSS) for each eye exam, as well as an \"institutional VSS\" in which the average of the VSS values assigned to patients' higher severity (\"worse\") eyes at each exam was calculated for each institution.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared demographics, clinical diagnosis of plus disease, and institutional VSS between institutions using the McNemar Bowker test, two-proportion Z test and one-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis by Tukey-Kramer test. Single regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between demographics and VSS.RESULTS: We found that the proportion of patients diagnosed with pre-plus disease varied significantly between institutions (p<0.00l). Using the DL-derived VSS trained on the data from all institutions using FL, we observed differences in the institutional VSS, as well as level of vascular severity diagnosed as no plus (p<0.001) across institutions. A significant, inverse relationship between the institutional VSS and the mean GA was found (p=0.049, adjusted R2=0.49).CONCLUSIONS: A DL-derived ROP VSS developed without sharing data between institutions using FL identified differences in the clinical diagnosis of plus disease, and overall levels of ROP severity between institutions. FL may represent a method to standardize clinical diagnosis and provide objective measurement of disease for image-based diseases.

All images were labeled for the presence of plus, pre-plus, or no plus disease with a clinical label, and a reference standard diagnosis (RSD) determined by three image-based ROP graders and the clinical diagnosis.METHODS, INTERVENTION OR TESTING: We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for models developed on multi-institutional data, using a central approach, then FL, and compared locally trained models to either approach. We compared model performance (kappa) with label agreement (between clinical and RSD), dataset size and number of plus disease cases in each training cohort using Spearman's correlation coefficient (CC).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Model performance Four settings of experiment: FL trained on RSD against central trained on RSD, FL trained on clinical labels against central trained on clinical labels, FL trained on RSD against central trained on clinical labels, and FL trained on clinical labels against central trained on RSD (p=0.046, p=0.126, p=0.224, p=0.0173, respectively). 4/7 (57%) of models on local institutional data performed inferiorly to the FL models. Model performance for local models was positively correlated with label agreement (between clinical and RSD labels, CC = 0.389, p=0.387), total number of (CC=0.759, p=0.047), overall training set size (CC=0.924, p=0.002).CONCLUSIONS: We show that a FL model trained performs comparably to a centralized model, confirming that FL may provide an effective, more feasible solution for inter-institutional learning. Smaller institutions benefit more from collaboration than larger institutions, showing the potential of FL for addressing disparities in resource access.

Averaging these results produced a continuous label for plus (1-9) and stage (1-3) for each image. Experts were also asked to compare each image to each other in terms of relative severity for plus disease. Each image was also labelled with a vascular severity score from the Imaging and Informatics in ROP deep learning (i-ROP DL) system, which was compared with each grader's diagnostic labels for correlation, as well as the ophthalmoscopic diagnosis of stage.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weighted kappa and Pearson correlation coefficients (CC) were calculated between each pair of grader classification labels for stage and plus disease. The Elo algorithm was also used to convert pairwise comparisons for each expert into an ordered set of images from least to most severe.RESULTS: The mean weighted kappa and CC for all inter-observer pairs for plus disease image comparison was 0.67 and 0.88 respectively. The vascular severity score was found to be highly correlated with both the average plus disease classification (CC = 0.90, p < 0.001) and the ophthalmoscopic diagnosis of stage (p < 0.001 by ANOVA) among all experts.CONCLUSIONS: The ROP vascular severity score correlates well with the ICROP committee member's labels for plus disease and stage, which had significant inter-grader variability. Generation of a consensus for a validated scoring system for ROP SaMD can facilitate global innovation and regulatory authorization of these technologies.

The key outcome was the percentage of newly diagnosed central RAO (CRAO), branch RAO (BRAO), central seen in each period.The study population included 285,759 new patients in the pre-COVID-19 period and 156,427 new patients in the COVID-19 period. The overall number of new patients dropped dramatically during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic (24%, 66%, and 51% less new patients in March, April, and May 2020 than in the same months in 2019; P < .0001 for all 3 months). However, the decrease in the number of newly diagnosed patients with CRAO, CRVO, and BRAO during these months was less dramatic. As most states reopened in June and the number of patients in retina clinics started to increase, the newly diagnosed patients with these conditions as a percentage of all new diagnoses returned to similar trends as seen in the pre-COVID-19 period.The percentage of new cases of RAO and RVO with respect to all new diagnoses in retina clinics remained stable for the majority of the COVID-19 period. There was an increase in these percentages during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for CRAO, CRVO, and BRAO, which may have led to the presumption that more patients presented with these conditions during the COVID-19 period evaluated in this study.

Meaningful deployment of smartphone apps for home vision monitoring should consider the barriers to patient uptake and engagement and address issues around digital exclusion in vulnerable patient populations.Objective: To quantify the associations between patient characteristics and clinical measures with vision monitoring app uptake and engagement.Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort and survey study, consecutive adult patients attending Moorfields Eye Hospital receiving intravitreal injections for retinal disease between May 2020 and February 2021 were included.Exposures: Patients were offered the Home Vision Monitor (HVM) smartphone app to self-test their vision. A patient survey was conducted to capture their experience. App data, demographic characteristics, survey results, and clinical data from the electronic health record were analyzed via regression and machine learning.Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations of patient uptake, compliance, and use rate measured in odds ratios (ORs).Results: Of 417 included patients, 236 (56.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 72.8 (12.8) years. A total of 258 patients (61.9%) were active users. Uptake was negatively associated with age (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.998; P=.02) and positively associated with both visual acuity in the better-seeing eye (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01; CI, 1.00-1.02; P=.02). Of 258 active patients, 166 (64.3%) fulfilled the definition of compliance. Compliance was associated with patients diagnosed with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (OR, 1.94; 0.96-3.01; P=.02), and visual acuity in at baseline (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P=.04). Use rate was higher with increasing levels of comfort with use of modern technologies (beta=0.031; 95% CI, 0.007-0.055; P=.02). A total of 119 patients (98.4%) found the app either easy or very easy to use, while 96 (82.1%) experienced increased reassurance from using the app.Conclusions and Relevance: This evaluation of home vision monitoring for patients with common vision-threatening disease within a clinical practice setting revealed demographic, clinical, and patient-related factors associated with patient uptake and engagement. These insights inform targeted interventions to address risks of digital exclusion with smartphone-based medical devices.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the ability of experts to discern synthesized retinal fundus images from real fundus images and to review the current uses and limitations of GANs in ophthalmology.Design: Development and expert evaluation of a GAN and an informal review of the literature.Participants: A total of 4282 image pairs of fundus images and retinal vessel maps acquired from a multicenter ROP screening program.Methods: Pix2Pix HD, a high-resolution GAN, was first trained and validated on fundus and vessel map image pairs and subsequently used to generate 880 images from a held-out test set. Fifty synthetic images from this test set and 50 different real images were presented to 4 expert ROP ophthalmologists using a custom online system for evaluation of whether the images were real or synthetic. Literature was reviewed on PubMed and Google Scholars using combinations of the terms ophthalmology, GANs, generative adversarial networks, ophthalmology, images, deepfakes, and synthetic. Ancestor search was performed to broaden results.Main Outcome Measures: Expert ability to discern real versus synthetic images was evaluated using percent accuracy. Statistical significance was evaluated using a Fisher exact test, with P values 0.05 thresholded for significance.Results: The expert majority correctly identified 59% of images as being real or synthetic (P= 0.1). Experts 1 to 4 correctly identified 54%, and 0.043, respectively). These results suggest that the majority of experts could not discern between real and synthetic images. Additionally, we identified 20 implementations of GANs in the ophthalmology literature, with applications in a variety of imaging modalities and ophthalmic diseases.Conclusions: Generative adversarial networks can create synthetic fundus images that are indiscernible from real fundus images by expert ROP ophthalmologists. Synthetic images may improve dataset augmentation for DL, may be used in trainee education, and may have implications for patient privacy.

Traditional neonatal and infant eye screening is administered by neonatologists and pediatricians using the red reflex test. If this test identifies an ocular abnormality, then the patient is examined by an ophthalmologist. Notably, the red reflex test may be unable to detect amblyogenic posterior segment pathology. Recent studies using fundus imaging and telemedicine show reduced cost of human resources and increased sensitivity compared with traditional approaches. In this review, the authors discuss universal newborn eye screening pilot programs with regard to disease prevalence, referral-warranted disease, and cost-effectiveness.

Information on napping was collected through face-to-face interviews. Retinal vascular calibers (RVCs), including central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE), and arterio-to-venous ratio (AVR), were obtained from fundus photography. Multivariate regression and restricted cubic spline curve were performed to determine the association between RVCs and daytime napping duration.RESULTS: 56.4% participants reported daytime napping regularly. Compared to no nap, daytime nap was related to higher CRAE, with nap duration of 0.5-1 h showing the most significant association. 0.5-1 h daytime nappers displayed an average of 4.18 m (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45-5.91, p < 0.001) wider CRAE than non-nappers after adjustment. No significant association was found between CRVE and daytime napping. Moreover, individuals with 0.5-1 h daytime napping had a lower risk for AVR reduction (odds ratio [OR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.86, p = 0.001) than non-nappers. Similar association persisted in non-hypertensive population. Restricted cubic spline indicated a J-shaped relationship between AVR reduction and nap duration.CONCLUSION: Retinal microcirculation was positively associated with self-reported 0.5-1 h daytime napping. Better indicators of retinal microcirculation were probably related to nap duration in a J-shaped manner. Also, the possibly beneficial role of 0.5-1 h daytime napping on retinal microcirculation might be independent of clinically diagnosed vascular diseases.

Here we describe the preclinical safety and toxicology of a novel biodegradable hydrogel tamponade agent (PYK-1105) with the potential to improve both patient experience and outcomes after retina surgery.We studied in vitro performance to assess hydrogel gelation time, modulus, viscosity, degradation time, refractive index, and transmittance. In addition to studying in vitro and in vivo (mice and rabbits) biocompatibility, testing was performed to assess cytotoxicity, intraocular irritation, acute systemic toxicity, genotoxicity, and pyrogenicity. Furthermore, clinical safety was assessed using in vivo (rabbits and minipigs) response to vitrectomy with PYK-1105 insertion the clinical imaging, full-field electroretinography, and histopathology.PYK-1105 met the predefined performance testing criteria for optimal tamponade and demonstrated excellent biocompatibility. Animal studies showed the PYK-1105 formulation to be well tolerated and nontoxic in mice, rabbits, and pigs.PYK-1105 holds promise as a new biodegradable tamponade agent that has the potential to improve both the patient experience and outcomes after retina surgery. Human pilot studies are warranted to further assess for safety and efficacy.

We hypothesized that pseudophakic monovision and ensuing anisometropia and aniseikonia impact elderly fall risk. This study assessed fall risk in patients with pseudophakic monovision, pseudophakic single vision distance (classic cataract surgery), and cataracts with no surgery.DESIGN: Retrospective single-institution cohort study PARTICIPANTS: Patients with bilateral cataracts diagnosed at 60 years of age or older who underwent bilateral cataract surgery (monovision or single vision distance) or did not undergo any cataract surgery (n = 13 385). Patients with unilateral surgery or a fall prior to cataract diagnosis were excluded.METHODS: Data were obtained from the Stanford Research Repository. Time-to-fall analysis was performed across all 3 groups. Primary outcome was hazard ratio (HR) for fall after second eye cataract surgery or after bilateral cataract diagnosis.RESULTS: Of 13 385 patients (241 pseudophakic monovision, 2809 pseudophakic single vision, 10 335 no surgery), 850 fell after cataract diagnosis. Pseudophakic monovision was not associated with fall risk after controlling for age, sex, and myopia. Pseudophakic single-vision patients had a decreased time to fall compared with no-surgery patients (log rank, p < 0.001). Older age at cataract diagnosis (HR =1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.06, p < 0.001) or at time of surgery (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, p < 0.001) increased fall risk, as did female sex (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.10-1.51, p = 0.002) and preexisting myopia (HR among nonsurgical patients.CONCLUSIONS: Pseudophakic monovision did not impact fall risk, but pseudophakic single vision may increase falls compared with patients without cataract surgery.

Newborns (n=380, 760 eyes) in the Maternity Ward of Irmandade Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo hospital from May to July 2014 underwent RRT by a paediatrician and WFDI performed by the authors. Wide-field digital imaging (WFDI) images were analysed by the authors. Validity of the paediatrician's RRT was assessed by unweighted kappa [kappa] statistic, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).RESULTS: While WFDI showed abnormalities in 130 eyes (17.1%), RRT was only abnormal in 13 eyes (1.7%). Wide-field digital imaging (WFDI) detected retinitis, a vitreous haemorrhage. The sensitivity of the paediatrician's RRT to detect abnormalities was poor at 0.77% (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.02%-4.21%) with a PPV of only 7.69% (95% CI, 1.08%-38.85%). Overall, there was no agreement between screening modalities (kappa=-0.02, 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.01). The number needed to screen to detect ocular abnormalities using WFDI was 5.9 newborns and to detect treatable abnormalities was 76 newborns.CONCLUSION: While RRT detects gross abnormalities that preclude visualization of the retina (i.e. media opacities and very large tumours), only WFDI consistently detects subtle treatable retina and optic nerve pathology. With a higher sensitivity than the current gold standard, universal WFDI allows for early detection and management of potentially blinding ophthalmic disease missed by RRT.

We reported 13 eyes that received several injections of anti-VEGF for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with good visual acuity despite geographic atrophy on imaging.METHODS: This is a case series study conducted at Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University. Patients of three retina specialists with wet AMD who received six or more intravitreal injection of anti-VEGFs with visual acuity of 20/60 or better and incomplete RPE and outer retina atrophy (iRORA) or complete RPE and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) were enrolled in this case series. Different imaging modalities were reviewed by three retina specialists comparing the baseline with the most recent exam.RESULTS: About 13 eyes of 10 patients met the selection criteria. Eleven eyes were classified as iRORA and 2 as cRORA. Despite the development of macular atrophy on imaging after an average of 38.1 injections, eyes maintained stable visual acuity.CONCLUSION: The discrepancy between structural and functional findings in this cohort suggests that patients treated by anti-VEGF drugs exhibit divergent clinical outcomes for currently unknown reasons. The authors propose anti-VEGF may affect melanosomes within RPE without disrupting RPE and photoreceptors function completely. This requires further investigation.

We compared the prevalence of fundus haemorrhages in two populations: term newborns screened early (less than 72 hours) and preterm newborns screened late (4-11 weeks). Additionally, we reviewed the literature on timing and prevalence of newborn haemorrhages.METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study. Infants who underwent wide-angle ophthalmic digital imaging over one overlapping year in the Newborn Eye Screen Testing (NEST) or Stanford University Network for Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity (SUNDROP) programme were included. The PubMed database was filtered to include English-language articles dating back to 1950. Nine articles were selected for review based on inclusion of the prevalence of newborn fundus haemorrhages at multiple time points.RESULTS: A total of 202 patients received early imaging in the NEST cohort and 73 patients received late imaging in the SUNDROP cohort. In the NEST cohort, 20.2% of newborns had haemorrhages. In contrast, we found haemorrhages in only one case or 1.4% of the SUNDROP cohort. Using prevalence data from nine additional studies, we developed a predicted probabilities model of newborn haemorrhages. Per this model, the probability of seeing a haemorrhage if you screen an infant at 1 hour is 18.8%, at 2 weeks is 2.9% and at 1 month is 0.28%.CONCLUSION: We found a significant difference in the prevalence of fundus haemorrhages between the early-screened NEST cohort and the late-screened, preterm SUNDROP cohort. Likely, this difference is due to the transient nature of most newborn haemorrhages.

Time-to-event analysis of the association between exposure to lipid-lowering medications and time from non-exudative AMD to exudative AMD diagnosis was conducted. Outcome measures included progression to exudative AMD, indicated by diagnosis codes for exudative AMD or procedural codes for intravitreal injections.In the year before and after first AMD diagnosis, 11,330 patients were continuously prescribed lipid-lowering medications and 31,627 patients did not take any lipid-lowering medication. Of those taking statins, 21 (1.6%) patients statins. We found no statistically significant relationship between exposure to low (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.38) or high-dose lipophilic statins (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.45) and progression to exudative AMD. No patients taking very-high-dose lipophilic statins converted from non-exudative to exudative AMD, though this difference was not statistically significant due to the subgroup size (p = .23, log-rank test).No statistically significant relationship was found between statin exposure and risk of AMD progression. Interestingly, no patients taking very-high-dose lipophilic statins progressed to exudative AMD, a finding that warrants further exploration.

Among the 418,965 patients with migraine, 1,060 (0.25%) were subsequently diagnosed with RAO, whereas only 335 (0.08%) of the patients without migraine were diagnosed with RAO. The hazard ratio (HR) for incident all RAO in patients with migraine compared with those without migraine was 3.48 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.07 - 3.94; P <0.0001]. This association was consistent across all types of RAO, including CRAO (HR = - other of RAO (HR 4.61; CI 3.94 - 5.38; P <0.001). Patients with migraine with aura had a higher risk for incident RAO compared with those with migraine without aura (HR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.40 - 1.79; P <0.001). consistent for BRAO (HR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.04 - 1.97; P <0.03) and other types of RAO (HR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.45 - 1.91; P <0.001), but was not statistically significant for CRAO (HR = 1.18; 95% CI 0.75 - 1.87; P = 0.475). Significant risk factors for this association included increased age, male sex, acute coronary syndrome, valvular disease, carotid disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, retinal vasculitis and/or inflammation, and systemic lupus erythematosus.CONCLUSIONS: Migraine is associated with increased risk of all types of RAO and migraine with aura is associated with increased risk of RAO compared with migraine without aura.

Here, we report the first published fluorescein angiography (FA) study of a morning glory optic nerve in a patient with Aicardi syndrome and contralateral persistent fetal vasculature (PFV).CASE DESCRIPTION: A 12-day old full-term baby girl with a normal neurological exam was referred for evaluation of microphthalmia. The posterior segment of the right eye demonstrated chorioretinal lacunae typical of Aicardi syndrome and microphthalmos with a stalk consistent with PFV. The right eye imaging could not be captured due to the severe microphthalmos and cataract, however, fluorescein angioscopy was performed. The left eye demonstrated a morning glory appearing optic disc with peripapillary chorioretinal lacunae. Fluorescein angiography of the eye showed staining in the areas of ellipsoid chorioretinal lacunae emanating from the optic nerve and extensive peripapillary staining and late leakage of the optic nerve.CONCLUSION: Patients with Aicardi syndrome can have morning glory optic nerve anomaly and PFV. Using FA under anesthesia to detect these abnormalities help in estimating the extend of the disease and its complications, which allows for better management of the complications.

Data analysis was performed from April to July 2018. SEER identified 4475 individuals using International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition site and morphology codes.Exposures: Race, ethnicity, and SES estimated by tertile using Yost Index composite scores.Main Outcomes and Measures: Treatment odds ratios (ORs), 1-year and 5-year survival estimates, mortality hazard ratios (HRs), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Hypothesis was formulated before data collection.Results: Multivariate analyses of who were nonwhite (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.12-1.88) and socioeconomically middle SES: OR, 1.86; CI, 1.56-2.21) were more likely to receive primary enucleation. No interactions were observed between race/ethnicity, SES, and stage at diagnosis. From 2004 to 2014, rates of primary enucleation decreased across all racial/ethnic and SES groups, but disparities persisted. Socioeconomically disadvantaged patients had lower 5-year all-cause survival rates (lower SES: upper SES: 73.8%), although disease-specific survival did not vary significantly by racial/ethnic or SES strata. Mortality risk was associated with older age at diagnosis (56-68 years: HR, 1.70; 95% CI, advanced stage of UM (stage 2: HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.19-1.65; stage 3: HR, 2.26; 95% and stage 4: HR, 10.09; 95% 7.39-13.77), and treatment with primary enucleation (HR, 95% CI, 1.88-2.44) with no racial/ethnic or SES variation.Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, SEER data from 2004 to 2014 suggest that nonwhite and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients with UM are more likely to be treated with primary enucleation, although no such variation appears to exist in disease-specific survival. These differences reveal opportunities to address issues regarding treatment choice in UM.

It is usually idiopathic and the affected eyes are otherwise healthy with near-normal overlying retinal architecture and good visual acuity.PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral conforming FCE in the setting of Stargardt disease and inactive ocular toxoplasmosis.CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old man with known history of Stargardt disease, healed toxoplasmosis, and high myopia presented to our ophthalmology department for follow-up examination and was found with bilateral FCEs not present in any of his previous examinations.CONCLUSION: FCEs have been reported in the literature in otherwise healthy eyes as well as a broad spectrum of ocular diseases. The case herein reported Stargardt disease, toxoplasmosis, and high myopia all could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of these findings. Further studies are needed to define etiologies as well as clinical significance and course of FCEs.

Near visual acuity (VA) and anterior/posterior segment photographs were taken with a smartphone-based VA app and ophthalmic camera system. The Nursing Home Vision-Targeted Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire was also administered. Risk factors for visual impairment were assessed. Institutional review board approval was obtained from Stanford University.Cataracts (51%), diabetic retinopathy (DR) common 11.7% had other referral-warranted findings. AMD and DR correlated with a higher risk of poor VA, with adjusted odds ratios of 22 (P = .01) and 43 (P = .004).This study demonstrated a high prevalence of poor VA and ophthalmic disease in the nursing home population impacting quality of life. Smartphone-based teleophthalmology platforms have the potential to increase access to eye care for nursing home patients. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2020;51:262-270.].

However, there are discrepancies between the findings of these AI programs and their referral recommendations compared with evidence-based referral patterns, such as Preferred Practice Patterns by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The overall focus of this task force report is to first describe the work in AI being completed in the management of retinal conditions. This report also discusses the guidelines of the Preferred Practice Pattern and how they can be used in the emerging field of AI.

Here, we report a case of optic disc pit-associated macular retinoschisis due to intraretinal fluid accumulation that resolved with improvement in visual acuity after treatment with topical dorzolamide.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old otherwise healthy female with no ocular history presented with 2weeks of slowly worsening blurry vision in her right eye. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye. Posterior segment examination revealed posterior vitreous detachment, an optic disc pit at 9 o'clock, macular edema and foveoschisis with fluid extending from the optic nerve, and a normal peripheral retina. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the macula showed central subfield thickness of 526m. The patient preferred no surgical intervention, so topical dorzolamide 2% three times daily was initiated. Over the next 2 years, the central subfield thickness steadily declined from 526 to 262m, and her vision improved to 20/20 with improvement in the macular retinoschisis.CONCLUSION: Our report presents a case of resolution of optic disc pit-associated macular retinoschisis due to intraretinal fluid accumulation with possible role for dorzolamide as a potential treatment option.

This of VHL may benefit from early surgical intervention.Descriptive case series of three patients in one family with VHL disease. A review of the literature regarding surgical intervention for VHL was performed.All three patients developed prominent intravitreal neovascularization with fibrovascular growth within the vitreous secondary to a retinal capillary hemangioma. Two subjects with intravitreal neovascularization were treated with laser and cryotherapy but eventually developed a TRD. The final vision in these two patients was light perception and 20/300. The eye that was preemptively treated with vitrectomy to remove the vitreous sustaining the neovascularization had visual acuity of 20/50 after surgery.Intravitreal neovascularization with fibrovascular proliferation may be an indication for vitrectomy prior to the development of retinal detachment.

The authors identified patients with primary repair with cryotherapy, laser, scleral buckle, pneumatic retinopexy, or pars plana logistic regression models were used to determine patients' likelihood of receiving each type of repair within 30 days of their diagnosis depending on whether they were diagnosed during a national ophthalmology conference. Linear regression models were used to determine the relationship between the date patients were diagnosed and how long they waited to receive a repair. Main outcome measures included days between diagnosis with RRD and RRD repair, receiving repair on the same day of diagnosis, and reoperation rate within 30 days of the primary repair.Mean time from diagnosis to repair was 1.5 days (standard deviation: 2.4 days), and 71% of patients underwent repair within a day of diagnosis. Repairs were followed by a second surgery within 30 days in 11.1% of patients. Patients diagnosed during conferences waited 0.23 days longer between diagnosis and repair compared with patients diagnosed outside of conference dates (P = .001). Patients diagnosed with RRD during conferences were less likely to receive surgical repair within a day of diagnosis compared to patients diagnosed during non-conference dates (P = .037). Patients who were diagnosed with RRD during a conference date and also received surgery during a conference date were more likely to undergo a second surgery within 30 days of the primary procedure (P = .006) CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with RRD during national ophthalmology conference dates waited slightly longer for surgery, were slightly less likely to receive surgery within a day, and were more likely to undergo a second surgery within 30 days of the primary procedure. The \"national meeting effect\" phenomenon is present in ophthalmology, albeit to a lesser degree that is likely not visually significant. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2020;51:328-337.].

FA were obtained at 40, 52, 62, and 72weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA) using wide-angle photography. FA images were analyzed and the peripheral avascular areas measured with ImageJ using a reference disc diameter (DD). Based on the extent of the avascular area and tortuosity of the retinal vessels all eyes were classified into four categories: complete vascular maturity (vascularization within 2DD of the of the ora serrata), of the ora serrata and posterior tortuosity), and reactivation (recurrence of stage disease).About 13 infants were enrolled and 24 eyes were available in this study. None of the eyes reached complete vascular maturity at an average PMA of 60weeks, 7 (29%) eyes presented with VAA, 8 (33%) with VAT, and 9 (37.5%) reactivated. The reactivated eyes presented with the largest area of peripheral ischemia, followed by the VAT and then the VAA groups (p=0.02).IVR conforms to the previously described regression patterns following intravitreal bevacizumab for ROP indicative of a class effect. Follow-up using FA might help to optimize the management of these infants after injection of the drug.

Enrolled subjects were instructed to apply the study device at least twice per day for 30 seconds bilaterally to the external nasal nerve. After the initial baseline visit, patients were followed up at days 3, 14, 30, 90, and 180. The primary efficacy endpoint was the Schirmer index (change from unstimulated to stimulated tear production as measured by the Schirmer test) at day 30. The major secondary endpoint was the change in symptoms of DED at day 30 evaluated using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI).A total of 101 subjects evaluated at day 30 had a mean Schirmer index of 9.4 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.4-11.3), and the baseline OSDI improved by an average of 14.4 (95% CI, 11.1-17.7). Both endpoints were highly statistically and clinically significant at all time points. There were two mild unanticipated adverse events definitely related to the device.The safety and efficacy of the iTEAR device observed in this study support its indication for treating DED.Neurostimulation has the potential to improve signs and symptoms of DED.

Women had 34% reduced odds of receipt of surgical repairof an RRD (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 - 0.73, p<0.001) after adjusting for confounders. This effect persisted in all sensitivity models. Among patients that received repair, women were more often delayed (0.17 days, p = 0.04). Women were more likely to undergo primary laser barricade (RRR 1.68, p < 0.001), primary SB (RRR 1.15, p < 0.001), and PR (RRR 1.07, p < 0.04) than men. The odds of reoperation were lower in women (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 - 0.96, p=0.002) after adjustment.Insured women are less likely than insured men to receive surgical intervention for an RRD. If the odds of repair were equal between women and men in the U.S. then 781 more women would receive surgery each year, or 7,029 more during the study period. Women are more likely to have the repair performed with scleral buckle and laser barricade. The reason for thesesex differences in RRD repair remains unknown and requires further investigation.

Patients with certain comorbid conditions such as anemia and cardiovascular disease may have persistent plus-like disease following successful resolution of ROP.

This study included six cases (median age 23, interquartile range 33) of sclopetaria. Additionally, literature searches were conducted in the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases to uncover risk factors associated with all published cases of sclopetaria. Main outcome measure was best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 20/20. Sixty-seven cases (71 eyes) of sclopetaria have been reported, of which 59 cases (61 eyes) met inclusion criteria in this study. Most were young (median age 19.5 years) men (51/59, 88.1%). Thirty-seven eyes were observed while 24 underwent immediate surgery including six pars plana vitrectomies and three scleral buckles. Compared to initial presentation, BCVA improved in 31/48 (64.6%) eyes, remained stable in 12/48 eyes (25.0%), and worsened in 5/48 eyes (10.4%). Ten patients (16.4%) achieved a final BCVA of 20/20 with median follow up time of seven months. In a multivariate model, location of sclopetaria in the macula, temporal retina, or immediate orbital foreign body removal predicted poor final BCVA with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.767.Conclusions and importance: Traumatic chorioretinitis sclopetaria is rare, but reports have increased dramatically over the past two decades. While pars plana vitrectomy may be required for the management of retinal detachments and non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage, close observation is appropriate in most cases. Visual prognosis is poor with most patients attaining 20/200 vision or worse.

Each POV was assessed as a standard (s-POV), physicianadjusted (a-POV), or patient-initiated visit (p-POV). Preoperative features, diagnoses, and surgical procedures were evaluated to determine protective and risk factors for AEs.RESULTS: A total of 256 patients (310 PPVs) were included in this study. The most common cumulative postoperative AEs were elevated intraocular pressure (>30 mm Hg) (12.3%), cystoid macular edema (6.1%), and retinal detachment (5.8%). Patients with the diagnosis of macular hole or epiretinal membrane had the lowest relative risk of AEs [0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.75 and 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21-0.63, respectively]. There was no difference in time to AE among different vitrectomy gauge sizes (P = 0.733). Patients in a-POV and p-POV groups had a statistically significant higher incidence of AEs in the POV day 5-10 window (P = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: The utility of standard POVs in detecting AEs is dependent on the indication for PPV. Specifically patients undergoing isolated macular surgery (epiretinal membrane peel or macular hole repair) had the lowest relative risk of postoperative AEs and may warrant a less-intensive follow-up regimen.

As a sensitivity analysis, we re-estimate all models after excluding all patients with diabetes. To assess for dose response, we calculated the total days of PPS prescriptions filled and created a categorical variable indicating total exposure.The primary outcome measure was association between binary PPS exposure and any maculopathy. Secondary outcome measures included exposure between binary and categorical, time-dependent, exposure to PPS and to drusen, nonexudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), exudative AMD, hereditary maculopathy, and toxic maculopathy.The most common diagnoses of maculopathy in patients with IC were exudative dystrophy (0.04%). In unadjusted analyses, the percentage of patients who filled a PPS prescription and were diagnosed later with a maculopathy (2.37%) was very similar to the percentage of patients who did not fill a prescription (2.77%). Survival models using a binary variable indicating PPS exposure showed no significant associations between PPS exposure and diagnosis of drusen, nonexudative AMD, exudative AMD, toxic maculopathy, hereditary dystrophy, or an aggregate variable of any maculopathy. Similarly, there was no dose-dependent relationship between PPS exposure and diagnosis of any maculopathy. These findings remained stable in sensitivity analysis models that excluded patients with diabetes mellitus.In this large, commercial claims database analysis, no association was found between PPS exposure and subsequent diagnosis of maculopathy.

Independent, masked reading centres determined the presence/absence of leakage (fluorescein angiography) and retinal fluid (optical coherence tomography) at baseline, week 24 and week 52. In this integrated, post hoc analysis of the VIEW studies, the relationship between leakage/fluid status and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed. The impact of baseline lesion type (predominantly classic (PC), minimally classic (MC), occult) was also evaluated. Data from all treatment groups were pooled.2373 eyes were included in this analysis. At baseline, 95.4% of eyes presented with both leakage and fluid. By week 52, leakage and fluid were present in 16.0% of eyes. Mean BCVA gains at week 52 were numerically greater in eyes without leakage and fluid versus eyes with both leakage and fluid (10.3 vs 9.2 letters). At week 52, 11.6%, 15.3% and 20.1% of eyes with PC, MC and occult lesions, respectively, had both leakage and fluid present.In this post hoc analysis, fixed dosing with an anti-VEGF agent over 52 weeks eliminated disease activity (absence of both leakage and fluid) in most eyes. The effect of anti-VEGF treatment on leakage/fluid status favoured PC versus occult lesions.

Approximately 6% of patients on lipid-lowering medications had a diagnosis code for NPDR, PDR, or DME, or a procedural code for intravitreal injections, PPV, or laser in their record following diagnosis with diabetes, compared to 6.5% of patients who did not take lipid-lowering medications (p<0.01). In adjusted time-to-event analyses, patients who took lipid-lowering medications prior to diagnosis with T2DM were less likely to progress to any retinopathy diagnosis (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.55-0.65) and less likely to receive any treatment for retinopathy (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.78-0.84). These findings were significant at the aggregate level, as well as at the level of individual diagnosis (NPDR HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57-0.69; 0.39, 95% CI 0.33-0.45), and at the level of each treatment category (anti-VEGF injection HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71, CI 0.59-0.85).We find consistent evidence that patients on lipid-lowering medications are less likely to develop NPDR, PDR, or DME, and modest evidence that these patients are less likely to receive intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF medication, laser treatments, or vitrectomy. Our study validates the findings of studies that have used claims databases in East Asia in relatively homogeneous populations to estimate an association between statin use and retinopathy, replicating them in a U.S. context in a large commercial claims database.

This study augments Truong et al., providing multivariate analyses combining sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with more accurate SES measures. We hypothesized children from non-white, Hispanic, and lower socioeconomic backgrounds would have increased adjusted odds of enucleation.Retrospective cohort analysis.Setting: Multicenter population-based study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 Registries.Children aged 18 and under diagnosed with retinoblastoma between 2000-2014. Subjects were identified using International Classification of Diseases Oncology (ICD-O) site and morphology codes.Enucleation Odds Ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals RESULTS: Analysis of 959 retinoblastoma patients revealed that 70.8% were enucleated. Adjusted analyses showed associations between enucleation and Asian (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.00, Confidence Interval (CI) 1.08-3.71) or Black (2.42, 1.41-4.16) race, Hispanic ethnicity (1.69, 1.16-2.46), and low SES (1.68, 1.09-2.58). Significantly increased enucleation risk was associated with older age at diagnosis (Age 1-2 years 2.55, 1.80-3.61; >2 years 4.88, 2.57-9.25), unilateral disease advanced stage (Regional 4.71, 2.51-8.84; Distant 3.15, 1.63-6.08). No interactions were observed between race, ethnicity, SES, and stage at diagnosis. Enucleation rates decreased over time across all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.Children from non-white, Hispanic, and lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to receive enucleation. These associations are independent of stage of diagnosis, suggesting larger systemic disparities in retinoblastoma care. The origin of these differences requires further study and attention by clinicians and policy-makers.

A generalised linear model was constructed using DMD, postoperative lens status, preoperative VA, patient age and surgeon as the independent variables and the final VA as the dependent variable. The main outcome measure was the final VA.RESULTS: Seventy-nine eyes met the entry criteria. Group 1 included 52 eyes with RD repaired within 3 days of DMD, and group 2 included 27 eyes repaired between 4 and 7 days of DMD. The average final VA in group 1 eyes was logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) 0.21 (Snellen 20/33) and in group 2 eyes was logMAR 0.54 (Snellen 20/69). In group 1 and group preoperative VA (p=0.017and p=0.007), DMD (p=0.004 p<0.001) predicted postoperative VA. Post-hoc analysis showed significant differences in final VA between detachments of 1day vs 3 days (p=0.0009).CONCLUSION: DMD affects the final VA even among patients whose DMD is <3 days. Based on these results, interventions that shorten DMD, including those occurring within the first 3days, may result in improved long-term VA outcomes.

Records were reviewed for surgical start time, the presence of vitreoretinal fellow, and postoperative adverse events defined as any finding deviating from the expected postoperative course requiring observation or intervention.RESULTS:: A total of 310 pars plana vitrectomies were performed. There was no statistical difference in the rate of any adverse event when comparing cases starting after 16:01 (9/13, 69.2%) and after 12:01 (42/99, 42.4%) to a morning start time (69/198, 34.9%, adjusted p=0.083). There was a statistically significant increase in the risk of postoperative vitreous hemorrhage with afternoon and evening cases as compared to morning cases (adjusted p=0.021). In addition, there was no difference in any adverse event with a fellow present (93/244, 38.1%) compared to without (27/66, 40.9%, adjusted p=0.163). There was a higher risk of postoperative hypotony when a fellow was involved (6.6% vs 0%, p=0.028), though this difference disappeared after adjusting for confounders (adjusted p=0.252). There was no difference in the length of surgery with and without a fellow (49 vs 54min, respectively; p=0.990).DISCUSSION:: Afternoon start time and the presence of a fellow were not independent risk factors for postoperative adverse events.

MethodsAll infants treated with IVB for Type 1 ROP at a single institution from June 2013 to March 2018 were retrospectively reviewed and the amount of retinal non-perfusion on fluorescein angiogram was calculated. ResultsOnly 3 eyes (3.3%) reached full vascular maturity in the 92 eyes of 46 patients analyzed. Of the 89 eyes not reaching maturity, 39 eyes (43.8%) had vascular arrest alone (VAA), 34 eyes (38.2%) had vascular arrest with persistent tortuosity (VAT), and 16 (18.0%) had ROP reactivation. Those eyes that reactivated were more likely to be initially classified as aggressive posterior ROP (p = 0.004) and of Asian ethnicity (p = 0.008). There were greater areas of ischemia in eyes with reactivation as compared to VAT (112.1 mm2 mm2 vs. 56.6 mm2, respectively, p = 0.007). Younger gestational age at birth was found to be an independent predictor of persistent tortuosity (VAT vs. VAA) in a logistic regression model. ConclusionsIncomplete vascularization following IVB is very common and is associated with a younger gestational age at birth, Asian ethnicities, and aggressive posterior ROP. The presence of tortuosity following IVB may be indicative of persistently elevated VEGF levels and an early indicator of potential reactivation.

At 9 days of age, the attending team performed wide-angle remote digital fundus imaging and the left eye was noted to have scattered multi-laminar hemorrhages. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed which revealed occipital infarct and subarachnoid hemorrhage. A diagnosis of neonatal Terson syndrome was made. The child remained asymptomatic and the fundus hemorrhages resolved without sequelae. This case represents the first documented instance of Terson syndrome following NSVD and may represent a possible etiology of the common newborn retinal hemorrhage. Alternative terminology - delivery-associated retinopathy and intracranial hemorrhages - is proposed to describe these findings. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2018;49:e154-e156.].

Patients who underwent MH repair during a 5-year period were identified. Statistical analysis was conducted to detect significant perioperative associations to ORD development.One hundred twenty-four eyes were included, and 54% developed an ORD following surgery. These defects correlated with lower preoperative stage (P = .0057), preoperative phakia (P = .036), and lack of prior macular surgery (P = .0016). Patients in the ORD group had significantly better preoperative and postoperative visual acuity (P = .031 and P = .0004, respectively), but there was no difference in change in acuity from preoperatively to 3 months postoperatively when compared with control patients (P = 42). The majority (89%) of ORDs resolved by 24 months postoperatively.The development of ORDs appears to be correlated with several factors indicative of favorable overall eye health and less advanced pathology and may represent a normal state of recovery after MH repair with internal limiting membrane peeling.

Myopic pathology can affect all regions of the retina, though there is currently no classification system to distinguish anterior (peripheral) and posterior (macular) pathology. We hypothesize that these classifications are characterized by distinct demographic and refractive features, highlighting the disparity in types of pathologic myopia.METHODS: Institutional retrospective cohort study. The Stanford University Medical Center Clinical Data Warehouse was used to identify patients with high myopia by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Predetermined ICD diagnoses were then used to classify patients with high myopia into isolated A cohort of this population was then manually reviewed to gather refractive data and confirm accuracy of ICD coding.RESULTS: Patients (3274) were identified with high myopia. Overall, individuals met criteria for APM, 17.0% for CPM, and 50.2% for IHM. We identified a significantly higher frequency of females with PPM compared to APM (62.3 vs. 48.3%; OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.25), Asian patients with PPM as compared to APM (42.9 vs. 33.3%; OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.95), and younger patients with APM compared to PPM (median 45.3 vs. 63.4years). The refractive error was significantly more myopic in the interquartile range,IQR 6.7) and PPM (median -10.5D; as compared to the APM (median -8.1D; IQR 3.5), and IHM (median - 8.2D; IQR 4.1) subgroups (p=0.003).CONCLUSIONS: High myopia may be divided into four distinct subgroups based on presence and location of pathology, which is associated with differences in age, gender, race, and refractive error.

At-risk patients for treatment could then be directed to receive either laser photocoagulation or vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor intravitreal injections followed at a later time point by examination under anesthesia, fluorescein angiography, and diode laser photocoagulation as indicated.

Currently, the emphasis is engaging the family members, the hospital staff, and clinic staff to pro-actively manage ROP patients and ensure that they are screened in a timely fashion. Coordinating care between multiple caregivers can minimize risk. Risk increases when practitioners do not stay up to date on current screening and treatment guidelines or on the most recent study recommendations. Finally, it is important to maintain a high level of suspicion when dealing with infants is known to be predisposed to poor outcomes.Premature infants with short gestation and very low birthweights need to have structured screening coordinated between the hospital, the clinic, the physicians, and the family in order to minimize medicolegal risk and maximize beneficial outcomes.

Patient characteristics, hospital course, and neurodevelopmental outcomes were compared.In all, 49 eyes from 25 patients were included; 10 infants (20 eyes) received DLP and 15 infants (29 eyes) received IVB. The IVB infants had significantly fewer diagnoses at the time of discharge and fewer readmissions after initial hospital discharge than the DLP infants (four versus six diagnoses, P = .004; zero versus one readmission, P = .038). At an average of 20 months corrected age, there was no significant difference in neurodevelopmental delay (adjusted odds ratio = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.08-9.46).Systemic morbidity may be similar among infants treated initially with bevacizumab compared to DLP.

The authors aimed to determine the validity of the pediatrician's red reflex exam using 130 wide-angle external and fundus digital imaging as a gold standard.This was a prospective cohort study of 194 healthy, term newborns enrolled in the Newborn Eye Screening Test study at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital from July 25, 2013, to July 25, 2014. Red reflex screening was performed by a pediatrician in the newborn nursery and wide-angle fundus digital imaging was performed by a neonatal intensive care unit-certified nurse. The main outcome measure was the validity of the pediatrician's red reflex exam (unweighted kappa [] statistic, sensitivity, specificity).Compared to no subjects with abnormal red reflex exams reported in the pediatrician's notes, 49 subjects demonstrated one or multiple ocular abnormalities on 130 wide-angle fundus imaging ( = 0.00). The pediatrician's red reflex exam had a sensitivity of 0.0% (95% CI, 0.0%-7.3%) and specificity of 100.0% (95% CI, 97.5%-100.0%) for the detection of ocular abnormalities.This study demonstrates the ability of wide-angle fundus imaging to detect fundus abnormalities not otherwise identified by standard newborn red reflex screening prior to hospital discharge.

A 25-gauge needle attached to a syringe is used to obtain a vitreous specimen for microbiological access and administer intravitreal injections of antibiotics and steroids. No vitreous volume is lost during these procedures because of the cannula's valve. At the completion of the tap and injections, the cannula is removed with forceps and the single wound tamponaded with a cotton-tipped applicator.With this method, a vitreous tap and injection of pharmacologic agents only requires one piercing through the sclera, instead of the usual four piercings.With this new technique, it is possible to enhance patient comfort, decreased pain, and reduce trauma to the conjunctiva.

The authors introduce a technique to improve transconjunctival wound closure in vitrectomy surgery.The authors evaluated the efficacy of porcine collagen plugs on stopping leakage from sclerotomy test sites in vitro and in vivo and assessed wound site healing with histology samples.The porcine collagen plugs successfully prevented leakage of trypan blue dye in enucleated rabbit eyes and of fluid flow in the rabbit model. Histology showed excellent wound reconstruction and healing, with essentially no inflammation for either angled or straight incisions with a 23-gauge system.The authors describe a simple and effective novel approach to wound closure in any-gauge vitrectomy surgery using porcine collagen plugs. This method can help reduce complications related to wound leakage. The authors plan to conduct human studies to demonstrate the safety of the approach in the future.

The number of cases of syphilitic uveitis was defined by (1) International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) code for syphilis and uveitis or (2) ICD-9 code for syphilitic uveitis. Annual case count, incidence rate, and trend over time were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate associated factors for a syphilitic uveitis diagnosis.The study included 455 310 286 hospitalizations during a 12-year study period with a mean of 37 942 524 patients annually. Syphilis and uveitis was recorded for 1861 patients (155 annually) and syphilitic uveitis was diagnosed in 204 subjects (average of 17 cases annually). There was no change in the incidence of syphilitic uveitis, using either definition, over the study period (Pfor trend= .46). The mean annual incidence of syphilis and uveitis was 0.0004%, or 4 per million. Syphilitic uveitis had an annual incidence of 0.000045%, or 0.45 per million. The odds of syphilitic uveitis were lower among women (odds ratio [OR] 0.40, CI 0.28-0.57) and increased with comorbid acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (OR 4.52, CI 3.01-6.79).We report the first incidence of syphilitic uveitis in the United States. Fortunately, this remains a rare condition. The results demonstrate no change in the number of inpatient admissions for syphilitic uveitis during the study period.

One of its most successful applications to date has been in pediatric retinal disease, particularly in screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Many studies have shown that using telemedicine for ROP screening allows a remote ophthalmologist to identify abnormal findings and implement early interventions. Here, we review the literature on uses of telemedicine in pediatric retinal disease and consider future applications.

Here, the authors examine the incidence of ROP in the United States and evaluate risk factors associated with ROP development.The National Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database was queried for all newborns with and without ROP. Adjusted odds ratios were constructed for predictors of ROP using multivariate logistic regression modeling.The incidence of ROP increased from 14.70% in 2000 to 19.88% in 2012. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that female gender, birth weight, and gestational age predicted ROP. The frequency of ROP was 2.40% in newborns weighing more than 2,500 grams (g) and 30.22% in newborns with a birth weight between 750 g and 999 g.The authors' report examines a nationwide cohort of ROP infants and reveals an increase in the incidence of ROP from 2000 to 2012. This trend is inversely related to a simultaneous decline in newborn mortality. [ Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina . 2017;48:553-562.].

We utilized data collected in the SUNDROP initiative to determine demographic (birth weight, sex, multiplicity), weight gain, and ocular was a retrospective nested case-control study. Cases and controls were selected from a cohort of 843 low birth weight, premature newborns who survived to an estimated gestational age of 31weeks and underwent screening through the SUNDROP initiative. Infants were screened at one of six neonatal intensive care units from December 1, 2005, to April 1, 2016. Cases (n=37) were newborns with TW-ROP who underwent retinal ablative therapy. Two controls (n=74) without TW-ROP were matched to each case by gestational age. One reviewer graded media haze, presence of peripapillary atrophy, and fundus pigmentation in images taken at the baseline exam for each newborn. The main outcome measure was association of TW-ROP with predictive factors.In the SUNDROP trial, 37 out of 843 (4.4%) newborns developed TW-ROP. In a multivariable model, birth weight (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15-0.70) was inversely associated with TW-ROP. In contrast to prior reports, we found no significant difference in sex, multiplicity, or fundus pigmentation at baseline exam in those with TW-ROP as compared to controls. High levels of media haze (>2, scale 0 to 5) were found in the majority of cases (67.6%, 25/37) and controls (65.7%, 44/67). Presence of peripapillary atrophy did not improve prediction of the development of TW-ROP compared to birth weight and weight gain rate alone.The finding of high levels of media haze at baseline ROP screening exams is novel. This study supports the current model for detection of TW-ROP using birth weight, gestational age, and weight gain rate. We found no significant difference between newborns with TW-ROP and controls in baseline presence of media haze, fundus pigmentation or peripapillary atrophy.

All studies but one evaluated chronic CSCR, and laser parameters varied greatly between studies. Mean central macular thickness decreased, on average, by 80 m by 3 months. Mean best-corrected visual acuity increased, on average, by about 9 letters by 3 months, and no study reported a decrease in acuity below presentation. No retinal complications were observed with the various forms of NRT used, but six patients in two studies with micropulse laser experienced pigmentary changes in the retinal pigment epithelium attributed to excessive laser settings.Based on the current evidence, NRT demonstrates efficacy and safety in 12-month follow-up in patients with chronic and possibly acute CSCR. The NRT would benefit from better standardization of the laser settings and understanding of mechanisms of action, as well as further prospective randomized clinical trials.

Univariate logistic regression indicated that the need for rescue treatment was associated with decreased birth weight (odds ratio [OR],-0.007; P= 0.04) and age of initial treatment (OR,-0.35; P= 0.05), but not gender, race, or gestational age. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that only decreased birth weight (OR,-0.018; P= 0.04) was associated with need for rescue treatment.Treating ROP with intravitreal bevacizumab results in a characteristic scalloped regression pattern that is highly associated with treatment using biologic anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. The presence of this pattern in conjunction with chronic vascular arrest and peripheral retinal ischemia persisting beyond standard screening timelines has significant implications for the management of ROP. Fluorescein angiography is important in assessing vascular maturation in these infants.

A paediatric vitreoretinal specialist (DMM) reviewed images sent to the Byers Eye Institute telemedicine reading centre and recorded eye colour for every infant screened. Variables were graphed to assess for normality, and frequencies per subject were reported for eye colour, sex, ethnicity and race.Among 192 subjects screened in the first year of the NEST study with external images of appropriate quality for visualization of the irides, the birth prevalence of iris colour was 63.0% brown, 20.8% blue, 5.7% green/hazel, 9.9% indeterminate and 0.5% partial heterochromia. The study population was derived from a quaternary care children's hospital. We report the birth prevalence of iris colour among full-term newborns in a diverse prospective cohort.The study demonstrates a broad range of iris colour prevalence at birth with a predominance of brown iris coloration. Future studies with the NEST cohort will assess the change in iris colour over time and whether the frequencies of eye colour change as the child ages.

Ocular examination was performed. All 6 eyes demonstrated a pigmentary maculopathy ranging from mild to pronounced. In 4 eyes, well-delineated macular chorioretinal atrophy with a hyperpigmented ring developed. Three eyes demonstrated vascular tortuosity and 2 eyes demonstrated a pronounced early termination of the retinal vasculature on photographic evaluation. Two eyes demonstrated a washed out peripheral retina with a hypolucent spot. One eye had scattered subretinal hemorrhages external to the macula. Finally, 1 eye demonstrated peripheral pigmentary changes and clustered atrophic lesions resembling grouped congenital albinotic spots (polar bear tracks).Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly in children of mothers with a viral syndrome during the first trimester of pregnancy. Ocular findings previously described a pigmentary retinopathy and atrophy that now can be expanded to include torpedo maculopathy, vascular changes, and hemorrhagic retinopathy. Ophthalmologic screening guidelines need to be defined to determine which children would benefit from newborn screening in affected regions.

The incidence of ROP is rising, placing greater demands on the healthcare providers that serve these patients and their families. Telemedicine remote digital fundus imaging (TM-RDFI) plays a pivotal role in ROP management, and has allowed for the expansion of ROP care into previously underserved areas.A broad literature review through the pubmed index was undertaken with the goal of summarizing the current state of ROP and guidelines for its screening . Furthermore, all currently used telemedicine remote digital fundus imaging devices were analyzed both via the literature and the companies' websites/brochures. Finally, the PanoCam LT and PanoCam Pro created by Visunex Medical were analyzed via the company website/brochures. Expert commentary: The PanoCam LT and PanoCam Pro have recently been approved for use within the USA and CE marked for international commercialization in European Union and other countries requiring CE mark. These wide-field imaging systems have the intended use of ophthalmic imaging of all newborn babies and meet the requirements for ROP screening, thereby serving as competition within the ROP screening market previously dominated by one camera imaging system.

DR often leads to diabetic macular edema (DME), which often goes unnoticed until a patient presents with vision loss. However, treatment options and data for DME are continually improving. We know that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in DME progression; therapies that act by inhibiting VEGF production seem to improve visual acuity in patients with DME. Of the anti-VEGF therapies available, two have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat DME: ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) and aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY). Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), which is approved for the treatment of certain types of cancer, is occasionally used off-label to treat DME. Anti-VEGF therapy can stop vision loss and even improve visual acuity. Other treatments remain effective, and these various treatment options fuel a need for new data and discussion. This roundtable discussion, which took place during the 2015 annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, outlines the current protocols used to treat DME and provides clinical opinions about selecting and treating with an appropriate anti-VEGF therapy.

We conducted the study in two phases. During phase 1 of the study, ED staff tested patient BCVA using a standard Snellen test at 20 feet. During phase 2 of the study, ED staff tested patient near BCVA using the app. During both phases, ophthalmologists measured BCVA with a Rosenbaum near chart, which was treated as the gold standard. ED BCVA measurements were benchmarked prospectively against ophthalmologists' measurements and converted to logMAR.ED logMAR BCVA was 0.21 0.35 (approximately 2 Snellen lines difference 3 Snellen lines) higher than that of ophthalmologists when ED staff used a Snellen chart (p=.0.00003). ED BCVA was 0.060.40 (less than 1 Snellen line 4 Snellen lines) higher when ED staff used the app (p=0.246). Inter-observer difference was therefore smaller by more than 1 line (0.15 logMAR) with the app (p=0.046).BCVA measured by non-ophthalmic ED staff with an app was more accurate than with a Snellen chart. Automated apps may provide a means to standardize and improve the efficiency of ED ophthalmologic care.

A key cell type involved in AMD, the retinal pigment epithelium, expresses a G protein-coupled receptor that, in response to its ligand, L-DOPA, up-regulates pigment epithelia-derived factor, while down-regulating vascular endothelial growth factor. In this study we investigated the potential relationship between L-DOPA and AMD.We used retrospective analysis to compare the incidence of AMD between patients taking vs not taking L-DOPA. We analyzed 2 separate cohorts of patients with extensive medical records from the Marshfield Clinic (approximately 17,000 and approximately 20,000) and the Truven MarketScan outpatient and databases (approximately 87 million) patients. We used International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes to identify AMD diagnoses and L-DOPA prescriptions to determine the relative risk of developing AMD and age of onset with or without an L-DOPA prescription.In the retrospective analysis of patients without an L-DOPA prescription, AMD age of onset was 71.2, 71.3, and 71.3 in 3 independent retrospective cohorts. Age-related macular degeneration occurred significantly later in patients with an L-DOPA prescription, 79.4 in all cohorts. The odds ratio of developing AMD was also significantly negatively correlated by L-DOPA (odds ratio 0.78; confidence interval, 0.76-0.80; P <.001). Similar results were observed for neovascular AMD (P <.001).Exogenous L-DOPA was protective against AMD. L-DOPA is normally produced in pigmented tissues, such as the retinal pigment epithelium, as a byproduct of melanin synthesis by tyrosinase. GPR143 is the only known L-DOPA receptor; it is therefore plausible that GPR143 may be a fruitful target to combat this devastating disease.

Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with poor follow-up.In a multivariate logistic regression model, independent factors significantly associated with poor follow-up included incorrectly answering more than 50% of questions about eye disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.24, P = 0.001), legal blindness (adjusted OR 2.64, P = 0.013), the presence of glaucomatous versus retinal disease (adjusted OR 2.06, P = 0.013), and difficulty for the study subject and/or escort taking time away from work for the appointments (adjusted OR 1.80, P = 0.049). Subjects identified the following strategies to improve follow-up: contact with others having the same eye condition (41.3%), greater education regarding eye disease (40.8%), and improved transportation services to the clinic (44.6%).Low disease knowledge scores, legal blindness, and difficulty getting time away from work for appointments adversely impacted follow-up independent of eye disease diagnosis. Improvements in patient education, transportation services, and clinic efficiency may increase adherence to recommended appointment intervals.

A total of 608 preterm infants meeting ROP examination criteria were screened with the RetCam II/III (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, Calif.). Primary outcomes were treatment-warranted ROP (TW-ROP) and adverse anatomical events.During the 6 years, 1216 total eyes were screened during 2169 examinations, generating 26 970 retinal images, an average of 3.56 examinations and 44.28 images per patient. Twenty-two (3.6%) of the infants screened met criteria for TW-ROP. Compared with bedside binocular ophthalmoscopy, remote interpretation of RetCam II/III images had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99.8%, positive predicative value of 95.5%, and negative predicative value of 100% for the detection of TW-ROP. No adverse anatomical outcomes were observed for any enrolled patient.The 6-year results for the SUNDROP telemedicine initiative were highly favourable with respect to diagnostic accuracy. Telemedicine appears to be a safe, reliable, and cost-effective complement to the efforts of ROP specialists, capable of increasing patient access to screening and focusing the resources of the current ophthalmic community on infants with potentially vision-threatening disease.

Because of recent advances and newly available treatment modalities along with the devastating consequences associated with late stages of these diseases, much attention has been paid to the importance of early detection and improving patient access to specialist care. Telemedicine or, more specifically, digital retinal imaging utilizing telemedical technology has been proposed as an important alternative screening and management strategy to help meet this demand. In this paper, we perform a literature review and analysis that evaluates the validity and feasibility of telemedicine in detecting diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Understanding both the progress and barriers to progress that have been demonstrated in these two areas is important for future telemedicine research projects and innovations in telemedicine technology.

ICD-9 codes for vitreoretinal, cataract, and glaucoma procedures were queried. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate average annual percent change (APC) in ASC utilization by these procedures over the 13-year study period and also separately for the years 2007 to 2011.From 1999 through 2011, APC in ambulatory surgery center utilization was +26.4% (P = .0039) for vitreoretinal, +21.3% (P = .012) for cataract, and +20.9% (P = .0063) for glaucoma surgery. The APC from 2007 through 2011 was -1.2% for vitreoretinal (P = .47), -9.2% for cataract (P = .0039), and -17.3% for glaucoma surgery (P = .008).A significant overall increase in ASC utilization by vitreoretinal, cataract, and glaucoma surgeons over the study period was seen; however, the most recent 5-year data show that these trends may have begun to reverse.

In a post hoc analysis, participants were grouped according to their baseline characteristics, to determine if these influenced SRT efficacy.At 52 weeks, SRT was most effective for lesions 4 mm in greatest linear dimension and with a macular volume greater than the median value of 7.4 mm. For 26% of the participants with both these characteristics, SRT resulted in 55% fewer ranibizumab injections (2.08 vs. 4.60; P = 0.0002), a mean visual acuity change that was 5.33 letters superior to sham (+2.18 vs. -3.15 letters; P = 0.0284), and a 71.1-m greater reduction in mean central subfield thickness (-122.6 vs. -51.5 m; P = 0.027). Other features associated with a positive response to SRT included pigment epithelial detachment and the absence of fibrosis.Stereotactic radiotherapy is most effective for neovascular age-related macular degeneration lesions that are actively leaking at the time of treatment, and no larger than the 4-mm treatment zone.

An independent reading center detected microvascular abnormalities in 6 control eyes and 29 SRT eyes, of which 18 were attributed to radiation; however, only 2 of these possibly affected vision. An exploratory subgroup analysis found that lesions with a greatest linear dimension 4 mm (the size of the treatment zone) and a macular volume greater than the median (7.4 mm(3)) were more responsive to SRT, with 3.9 PRN injections versus 7.1 in comparable sham-treated participants (P = 0.001) and mean BCVA 4.4 letters superior to sham (P = 0.24).A single dose of SRT significantly reduces intravitreal injections over 2 years.

Patients with records of trabeculectomy and/or tube shunt procedures were identified, and all cases of \"definite\" (ie, properly coded) and \"suspected\" (possibly miscoded) postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurring within 3 months of their glaucoma filtration procedures were captured along with the surgical interventions used for this condition. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate the 3-month incidence rates of suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and regression analysis was applied to calculate the odds ratios, confidence intervals, and P-values.There were 17,843 trabeculectomies and 9,597 tube shunt surgeries identified. Among these, there were 107 cases (247 including \"suspected\" cases) of postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage within 3 months of trabeculectomy and 113 cases (255 including \"suspected\" cases) within 3 months of tube shunt procedures. The 3-month cumulative incidence rate of postoperative suprachoroidal ranged to shunt surgery. Postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage was almost twice as likely to occur after tube shunt surgeries than after trabeculectomies for both \"definite\" and \"definite\" cases (odds ratio, 1.98; interval, odds ratio, 1.95; confidence interval, 1.63-2.32; P<0.001, respectively). Among \"suspected\" cases of postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage, 32.9% (165 cases) had a treatment record of choroidal tap and 8.8% (44 cases) had a treatment record of pars plana vitrectomy.In this sample, the 3-month cumulative suprachoroidal hemorrhage was 0.6%-1.4% after trabeculectomy and 1.2%-2.7% after tube shunt procedures, and the majority of the cases appeared to be managed without further surgery. Postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage was almost twice as likely to occur after tube shunt surgeries as after trabeculectomies.

These patients were followed until the end of 2011. During the follow-up period, all incidences of blebitis, confirmed bleb-associated endophthalmitis, and presumed bleb-associated endophthalmitis were recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was utilized to calculate 5-year cumulative incidence rates of blebitis and bleb-associated endophthalmitis following trabeculectomy procedures.Among the 1,461 trabeculectomies included in our analysis, eight cases of blebitis, five cases of confirmed bleb-associated endophthalmitis, and eight cases of presumed bleb-associated endophthalmitis were identified. We found that the 5-year cumulative incidence of blebitis was 0.55%0.19%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of bleb-associated endophthalmitis was 0.45%0.2% when only confirmed cases were included and 1.3%0.34% when presumed cases were also added to the analysis. The mean time from procedure to diagnosis was 45 months for blebitis and 33 months for bleb-associated endophthalmitis.Blebitis and bleb-related endophthalmitis are uncommon in the United States. The 5-year cumulative incidence was 0.55% for blebitis and 0.45%-1.3% for bleb-associated endophthalmitis.

Every infant received outpatient binocular indirect ophthalmoscope examinations until termination criteria were achieved or until treatment. Outcomes were treatment-warranted ROP (TW-ROP, ETROP type 1) and adverse anatomical events.Five hundred eleven infants (1,022 eyes) were screened. Fifteen infants had TW-ROP and underwent laser photocoagulation. The TW-ROP cohort had significantly lower birth weight and gestational age (both P < .001). No patient progressed to adverse anatomical outcomes and no case of TW-ROP was missed. Tele-medicine had 100% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity, 93.8% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value for detection of TW-ROP.Telemedicine demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy for detection of TW-ROP and can complement ROP screening.

Protocol mandated fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms were acquired at baseline and Year 2, from 107 sham-treated study eyes with neovascular AMD and 107 untreated fellow eyes. Images were reanalyzed by an independent reading center for the presence of RVA, defined as at least one of the following: microaneurysms, vessel staining or leakage, dilated or or narrowing, capillary nonperfusion, or capillary infarcts.The baseline prevalence of RVA in the sham-treated study eyes was 14.4% (15 of 104 gradable images) versus 8.3% (5 of 60) in the fellow eyes with dry AMD. The baseline prevalence of individual RVAs in study eyes was: microaneurysms (6.7%), vessel Results were similar at 24 months.Compared with several studies that relied solely on fundus photographs, this study included fluorescein angiography and found a higher prevalence of RVAs occurring in eyes with neovascular AMD.

A scleral buckling sleeve is used to create a guarded 26-gauge needle to avoid over-penetration of the needle beyond the suprachoroidal space. Active extrusion can be used to drain suprachoroidal blood.The authors report two cases in which active aspiration using a guarded needle was successful in draining suprachoroidal hemorrhage without complications. In both cases, the vitreous cavity could be restored, allowing for subsequent pars plana vitrectomy.The technique of active aspiration using a guarded needle optimizes surgeon control of suprachoroidal hemorrhage drainage and also has the added benefit of easy transition to secondary vitrectomy after drainage has been completed.

Hospital course, management, and outcomes were identified.Three infants were identified that developed exudative retinal detachments following laser photocoagulation for retinopathy of prematurity after 40 weeks of PMA. The average gestational age was 25 weeks with an average birth weight of 650 g. All babies were Zone II at initial examination and developed Stage 3 with pre-plus or plus disease after 40 weeks of PMA (average 42 weeks of PMA). Therapy consisted of topical cyclogyl (0.5%) and topical prednisolone acetate (1%) to the affected eyes and intravenous dexamethasone in all cases. The exudative retinal detachments resolved by 50 weeks of PMA in all infants. Hard exudates following resolution were found in all eyes. Two eyes demonstrated temporal macular dragging.Premature infants who require laser photocoagulation for retinopathy of prematurity at >40 weeks of PMA may be predisposed to develop exudative retinal detachments. In the absence of identifiable traction, systemic corticosteroid use can be considered to achieve favorable anatomic outcomes.

While the drug may circumvent the traditional risks of surgical treatment, pharmacologic vitreolysis is not devoid of risk itself. This report presents two cases, one of vitreomacular traction syndrome and the other of a full-thickness macular hole, both of which were treated with an intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin. Notably, in both cases, vitreomacular traction of the macula appears to have been alleviated; however, failure to completely relieve vitreoretinal traction from the peripheral retina generated retinal breaks with one patient eventually developing a macula-involving retinal detachment. Thus, even in instances of 'successful' pharmacologic treatment of vitreomacular traction, continued follow-up evaluation is essential.

INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized plus PRN ranibizumab, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was the mean number of ranibizumab injections at 52 weeks. Secondary end points were change in mean best-corrected visual acuity (VA), loss of fewer than 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, gain of 0 or more and 15 or more letters, and change in angiographic total lesion size and choroidal SRT arms received significantly fewer ranibizumab treatments compared with the sham arms: mean number of treatments, 2.64 (median, 2), 2.43 (median, 2), and 3.74 (median, 3.5), respectively (P = 0.013 and P = 0.004, respectively, vs. sham). Change in mean VA was -0.28, +0.40, and -1.57 letters for the 16-Gy, 24-Gy, and sham arms, respectively. The 16-Gy, 24-Gy, and sham arms lost fewer than 15 letters in 93%, 89%, and 91% of eyes, respectively, with 53%, 57%, and 56% gaining 0 or more letters, respectively, and 4% gaining 15 letters or more in all arms. Mean total angiographic lesion area and 0.10 mm(2), respectively. Optical coherence tomography central subfield thickness decreased by 85.90 m, 70.39 m, and 33.51 m, respectively. The number of adverse events (AEs) and number of serious AEs (SAEs) were similar across arms. No AEs were attributed to radiation. No SAEs occurred in the study eye. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of SRT significantly reduces ranibizumab retreatment for patients with nvAMD, with a favorable safety profile at 1 year. Whereas chronic nvAMD typically results in loss of VA over time, SRT is associated with relatively well-preserved VA over 1 year.

Patients were categorized according to ROP status and whether they completed, canceled, or failed to show up for scheduled examinations. Demographic information was collected from medical records.Of 1,823 scheduled ROP-related visits, 327 (17.9%) resulted in cancellations and 90 (4.9%) in no-shows, with 238 missed visits due to caregiver-related and 149 due to caregiver-unrelated reasons. Of 399 total patients, 142 (35.6%) canceled or failed to show up for at least one appointment because of caregiver-related reasons.More than one-third of patients with ROP canceled or missed appointments. The true risk of delay is difficult to assess because all patients requiring treatment received it prior to discharge from the hospital. To achieve maximal compliance with joint statement guidelines on ROP screening, patients should be scheduled for examination earlier than recommended.

Results: Our patient had been born at 29 weeks and 2 days gestational age with a birthweight of 940 grams, tetralogy of Fallot, DiGeorge syndrome, and major aortopulmonary collaterals. Type 1 Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity ROP (zone 2, stage 2 with plus) developed, requiring PRP. Worsening plus disease developed and mild further PRP was performed. Despite this, plus disease persisted.Conclusions: We report plus disease even after appropriate PRP therapy for ROP. In this case, it is likely the patient's cardiovascular diseases that caused the persistent plus disease. Vascular tortuosity can be due to a number of different systemic disorders, so it is important to consider an infant's systemic conditions in the evaluation of ROP.

Participants were ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, and neurologists classified as \"top earners\" (>$100,000 annually) within the University of California (UC) healthcare system in 2008. Bibliometric searches on Scopus were conducted to retrieve the total number of publications and Hirsch indices (h-index), a measure of academic productivity. The association between the number of publications and h-index on physicians' total compensation was determined with multivariate regression models after controlling for the four specialties (ophthalmology, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, and neurology), the five institutions (UC San Francisco, UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UC Davis), and academic rank (assistant professor, associate professor, and professor).The UC healthcare system departments reported 433 faculty physicians among the four specialties, with 71.6% (n = 310) earning more than $100,000 in 2008 and classifying as top earners. After controlling for the specialty, institution, and ranking, there was a significant association between the number of publications on salary (P < 0.000001). Scopus number of publications and h-index were correlated (P < 0.001). Scopus h-index was of borderline significance in predicting physician salary (P = 0.12). Physicians with higher Scopus publications had higher total salaries across all four specialties. Every 10 publications were associated with a 2.40% increase in total salary after controlling for specialty, institution, rank, and chair.Ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, and neurologists in the UC healthcare system who are more academically productive receive greater remuneration.

Younger patients (0 to 10 years) were more likely male (P < .001) while older patients were more likely female (P < .01 for 61 to 70, 81+ years). The most common diagnoses were diabetic eye disease (17.0%), retinopathy of prematurity (9.9%) and age-related macular degeneration (9.5%).Retina specialists treat patients of all ages, and the most common diagnoses vary with age and gender. Patients present to retinal clinic with a vast spectrum of disease from various ophthalmic and systemic etiologies; therefore, it is important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis.

Patients were diagnosed by various techniques, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of aqueous, vitreous, and serum, antibody determination of serum and intraocular fluids, fundoscopic exam, a therapeutic trial of antivirals active against HSV-2, or a combination thereof.Mean age of presentation was 11.7 years (range, newborn to 21.0 years) with a standard deviation of 7.0 years. Mean initial vision was 20/200 (median, 20/400; range, 20/20 to LP). Eleven patients (73.3 %) had received oral, injectable, or topical corticosteroids, and 14 (93.3 %) had received antiviral therapy. All patients were diagnosed based on evaluation of intraocular fluids and tissue by antibody determinations, culture, PCR, histopathologic examination, or a combination thereof. Mean final visual acuity was 20/400 (median, CF; range, 20/25 to LP) with worsened visual acuity in five eyes (33.3 %). Anatomically, 14 of 15 eyes had healed or improved retinal appearance.In a pediatric population with acute retinal necrosis, HSV-2 should be considered as the prime candidate virus. Diagnosis of HSV-2 acute retinal necrosis is accomplished mainly by PCR of ocular specimens. Prompt diagnosis may lead to appropriate anti-viral therapy.

A total of 410 consecutively enrolled infants meeting ROP screening criteria had nurse-obtained fundoscopic images evaluated remotely by an ROP specialist. Every infant then received at least one dilated bedside binocular indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO) examination within one week of discharge. All infants were then followed with both telemedicine images and bedside evaluation in clinic according to recommended screening timelines. Primary outcomes were treatment-warranted ROP (TW-ROP), defined as Early Treatment of ROP Type 1, and adverse anatomical outcomes.The SUNDROP telemedicine screening initiative has not missed any TW-ROP in its four-year evaluation period. A total of 410 infants (820 eyes) were imaged, resulting in 1486 examinations and 18,097 unique images. An average of 12.2 images were obtained per patient. Fourteen infants met TW-ROP criteria on telemedicine examination. After bedside evaluation, 13 infants required laser photocoagulation and one was followed until he spontaneously regressed. Infants with TW-ROP had a significantly lower gestational age (24.9 weeks), birth weight (658.7 grams), and were more likely to be male than the no TW-ROP cohort (all p values <0.00001). Telemedicine had a calculated sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99.8%, positive predicative value of 92.9% and negative predictive value of 100% for the detection of TW-ROP. No patient progressed to retinal detachment or any adverse anatomical outcome.The SUNDROP initiative demonstrated a high degree of diagnostic reliability and was able to capture all infants with TW-ROP. Telemedicine offers a cost-effective, reliable and accurate screening methodology for identifying infants with TW-ROP without sacrificing quality of care.

To determine the dose response and toxicity threshold of micro-collimated X-rays delivered to porcine maculae by a stereotactic radiosurgical system after 270 days. Methods. Twelve eyes of six Yucatan mini-swine were randomized to receive up to 90Gy to the retina, using an office-based trans-pars plana delivery system. To determine the safety profile of this radiation delivery, ophthalmic examination, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were obtained at multiple time points up to 270 days post treatment. Results. No abnormalities were noted on external examination. Cataracts were noted in 4 of 12 eyes. Dose and time-dependent changes were noted on fundus examination, FA, ICG and SD-OCT. No significant abnormalities were seen in the control, 16Gy or 24Gy groups using any modality. Histopathology revealed a dose response effect with no discernable lesions in the 16Gy group. Conclusion. The X-ray delivery system precisely targets the porcine retina in vivo with little effect on surrounding structures. No ophthalmic or intracranial adverse effects were noted at clinically relevant doses at 270 days following radiation delivery.

At day 180, patients could receive DEX implant 0.7 mg if best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was <84 letters or retinal thickness was >250 m.The primary outcome for the open-label extension was safety; BCVA was also evaluated.At day 180, 997 patients received open-label DEX implant. Except for cataract, the incidence of ocular adverse events was similar in patients who received their first or second DEX implant. Over 12 months, cataract progression occurred in 90 of 302 phakic eyes (29.8%) that received 2 DEX implant 0.7 mg injections versus 5 of 88 sham-treated phakic eyes (5.7%); cataract surgery was performed in 4 of 302 (1.3%) and 1 of 88 (1.1%) eyes, respectively. In the group receiving two 0.7-mg DEX implants (n = 341), a 10-mmHg intraocular pressure (IOP) increase from baseline was observed in (12.6% after the first treatment, and 15.4% after the second). The IOP increases were usually transient and controlled with medication or observation; an additional 10.3% of patients initiated IOP-lowering medications after the second treatment. A 15-letter improvement in BCVA from baseline was achieved by 30% and 32% of patients 60 days after the first and second DEX implant, respectively.Among patients with macular edema owing to BRVO or CRVO, single and repeated treatment with DEX implant had a favorable safety profile over 12 months. In patients who qualified for and received 2 DEX implant injections, the efficacy and safety of the 2 implants were similar with the exception of cataract progression.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.

This study seeks to evaluate the graduates of medical schools and US residency programs to determine those programs that produce a high number of graduates remaining within academic programs and the contribution of these graduates to academic neurosurgery as determined by h-index valuation.Biographical information from current faculty members of all accredited neurosurgery training programs in the US with departmental websites was obtained. Any individual who did not have an American Board of Neurological Surgery certificate (or was not board eligible) was excluded. The variables collected included medical school attended, residency program completed, and current academic rank. For each faculty member, Web of Science and Scopus h-indices were also collected.Ninety-seven academic neurosurgery departments with 986 faculty members were analyzed. All data regarding training program and medical school education were compiled and analyzed by center from which each faculty member graduated. The 20 medical schools and neurosurgical residency training programs producing the greatest number of graduates remaining in academic practice, and the respective individuals' h-indices, are reported. Medical school graduates of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons chose to enter academics the most frequently. The neurosurgery training program at the University of Pittsburgh produced the highest number of academic neurosurgeons in this sample.The use of quantitative measures to evaluate the academic productivity of medical school and residency graduates may provide objective measurements by which the subjective influence of training experiences on choice of an academic career may be inferred. The top 3 residency training programs were responsible for 10% of all academic neurosurgeons. The influence of medical school and residency experiences on choice of an academic career may be significant.

While considerable progress has been made towards combating the disease, most recently with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, visual outcomes are still limited by continued retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration and subsequent neurosensory retinal atrophy. Among the promising new treatment options being explored, radiotherapy appears apt to address the multifactorial etiology of AMD. Current investigative studies underway will hopefully yield clinical efficacy to complement this theoretical suitability for arresting visual loss.

Twelve eyes were randomized to receive 0, 16, 24, 42, 60, or 90 Gy in a single dose to the retina. Eye examinations, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were obtained at days 7, 30, 60, and 90. Indocyanine green angiography was done at day 90.Through day 90 interim analysis, no abnormalities of external structures were noted. A small cortical lens opacity was noted in the 60-Gy group. Fundus evaluation revealed no abnormalities at 16 or 24 Gy. Beginning at day 30, circular pale retinal lesions with sharp margins were noted in the maculae of the eyes that received 42, 60, and 90 Gy. Higher-dose lesions showed late indocyanine green defined and retinal thinning on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.Transscleral stereotactic radiation dosing of porcine eyes demonstrates no apparent clinical abnormalities in doses less than 24 Gy. Doses of 42 Gy or higher led to focal choroidal and retinal damage within the target area.Radiation can induce small-blood vessel closure and thereby has therapeutic potential in neovascular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration.

The resultant geometric models were voxelized and imported to the MCNPX 2.5.0 radiation transport code for Monte Carlo-based simulations of AMD treatment. Clinically, treatment is delivered noninvasively by three divergent 100-kVp photon beams entering through the sclera and overlapping on the macula cumulating in a therapeutic dose. Tissue-averaged doses, localized point doses, and color-coded dose contour maps are reported from Monte Carlo simulations of x-ray energy deposition for several tissues of interest, including the lens, optic nerve, macula, brain, and orbital bone.For all eye models in this study (n = 32), tissues at risk did not receive tissue-averaged doses over the generally accepted thresholds for serious complication, specifically the formation of cataracts or radiation-induced optic neuropathy. Dose contour maps are included for three patients, each from separate groups defined by coherence to clinically realistic treatment setups. Doses to the brain and orbital bone were found to be insignificant.The computational assessment performed indicates that a previously established therapeutic dose can be delivered effectively to the macula with the scheme described so that the potential for complications to nontargeted radiosensitive tissues might be reduced.

Low-voltage x-rays are delivered in a series of three spots to the macula in a non-invasive manner through the inferior pars plana. These beams are designed to overlap on the centre of the macula. Each beam delivers one-third of the total dose, such that the total macula dose is three times an individual beam's dose. The device is designed to run off standard domestic electrical power, and no special shielding is necessary for the room. This system has been validated in Monte Carlo simulations, human cadaver eye studies, pre-clinical animal studies and in a phase I clinical trial.

International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition, codes for endophthalmitis, sepsis, and suspected endophthalmitis risk factors in hospitalized infants and neonates were searched in the database and were tracked over time. The main outcome measure was incidence of neonatal endophthalmitis over the study period.Of 3.64 million live births in 1998, 317 newborns were identified with endophthalmitis (8.71 cases per 100 000 live births). Of 4.14 million live births in 2006, only 183 newborns were identified with endophthalmitis (4.42 cases per 100 000 live births) by comparison. The incidence of endophthalmitis decreased at a rate of 6% per year (P = .01130) between 1998 and 2006. Neonates with endophthalmitis were more likely to have systemic bacteremia (odds ratio, 21.114; P < .0001), Candidemia (odds ratio, 2.356; P < .0001), a birth weight of less than 1500 g (odds ratio, 1.215; P < .0001), and retinopathy of prematurity (odds ratio, 2.052; P < .0001).We objectively validated the commonly held belief that Candidemia, bacteremia, retinopathy of prematurity, and low birth weight are significant risk factors for endophthalmitis development in infants, which seems to have had a decreasing incidence in recent years.

Secondary end points included BCVA, central retinal thickness, and safety.After a single administration, the time to achieve a > or =15-letter improvement in BCVA was significantly less in both DEX implant groups compared with sham (P<0.001). The percentage of eyes with a > or =15-letter improvement in BCVA was significantly higher in both DEX implant groups compared with sham at days 30 to 90 (P<0.001). The percentage of eyes with a > or =15-letter loss in BCVA was significantly lower in the DEX implant 0.7-mg group compared with sham at all follow-up visits (P< or =0.036). Improvement in mean BCVA was greater in both DEX implant groups compared with sham at all follow-up visits (P< or =0.006). Improvements in BCVA with DEX implant were seen in patients with BRVO and patients with CRVO, although the patterns of response differed. The percentage of DEX implant-treated eyes with intraocular pressure (IOP) of > or =25 mmHg peaked at 16% at day 60 (both doses) and was not different from sham by day 180. There was no significant between-group difference in the occurrence of cataract or cataract surgery.Dexamethasone intravitreal implant can both reduce the risk of vision loss and improve the speed and incidence of visual improvement in eyes with ME secondary to BRVO or CRVO and may be a useful therapeutic option for eyes with these conditions.

Retrolenticular membranes precluded visualization of the fundi. Computed tomography confirmed the presence of intraocular calcifications, an interval development over 6 weeks from previously normal scans. Referral was made and diagnostic enucleation of the right eye was performed, revealing intraocular disorganization and metaplasia consistent with phthisis following intraocular inflammation. The patient's contralateral eye achieved visual acuity of light perception after lensectomy and vitrectomy. Vitreous cultures from the enucleation specimen and from the fellow eye at the time of vitrectomy were negative. Unsuspected, untreated endogenous endophthalmitis can result in dramatic and rapid metaplastic response in the developing eye and result in acute phthisis.

Using safe laser intensity, the photoacoustic system was able to visualize the blood distribution of an enucleated pig's eye and an eye of a living rabbit. Ultrasound images, which were simultaneously acquired, were overlaid on the photoacoustic images to visualize the eye's anatomy. Such a system may be used in the future for early detection and improved management of neovascular ocular diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration retinopathy.

Using gel and vacuum, an I-Guide immobilization device was coupled to the eyes and radiochromic film was affixed to the posterior aspect of the globes. Three narrow x-ray beams were delivered through the pars plana to overlap on the predicted nominal fovea. A needle was placed through the center of the film's beam spot and into the eye to register the film and the inner retina. The process was performed three times for each of the ten eyes (30 simulated treatments; 90 individual beams). The globes were dissected to assess the targeting accuracy by measuring the distances from the needles to the fovea. The dose to the fovea was calculated from the radiochromic film.X-ray targeting on the retina averaged 0.6 +/- 0.4 mm from the fovea. Repeated treatments on the same eye showed a reproducibility of 0.4 +/- 0.4 mm. The optic nerve was safely avoided, with the 90% isodose edge of the beam spot between 0.4 and 2.6 mm from the edge of the optic disk. Measured dose matched that prescribed.This study provides confidence that the IRay, with an average accuracy of 0.6 mm and a precision of 0.4 mm, can reliably treat most AMD lesions centered on the fovea. With the exception of motion, all sources of error are included.

Following the third injection, the patient developed periocular ecchymosis and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal signal characteristics at the site of injection. An orbital biopsy did not demonstrate extraocular tumor extension, but histopathologic examination revealed severe orbital fibrosis and fat necrosis. Following the biopsy, the patient developed an intraocular tumor recurrence at the same location where the carboplatin injections had been given and enucleation was performed to prevent tumor spread. In this case, a child developed orbital scarring and intraocular tumor recurrence at the site of injection following treatment with periocular carboplatin.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict risk factors for ROP.Thirty-four million live births were recorded during the study period. The total ROP incidence was 0.17% overall and 15.58% for premature infants with length of stay of more than 28 days. Our results conclusively demonstrated the importance of low birth weight as a risk for ROP development in infants with length of stay of more than 28 days, as well as association with respiratory conditions, fetal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and blood transfer. An interesting finding was the protective effect conferred by hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Infants with ROP had a higher incidence of undergoing laser photocoagulation therapy, pars plana vitrectomy, and scleral buckle surgery.The current study represents a large, retrospective analysis of newborns with ROP. The multivariate analysis emphasizes the role of birth weight in extended-stay infants, as well as respiratory conditions, fetal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and blood transfer.

The indications and therapeutic agents are reviewed in this study.A search of the English, German, and Spanish language MEDLINE database was conducted. A total of 654 references spanning the period through early 2008 were individually evaluated.The advantage of the IVI technique is the ability to maximize intraocular levels of medications and to avoid the toxicities associated with systemic treatment. Intravitreal injection has been used to deliver several types of pharmacological agents into the vitreous cavity: antiinfective and antiinflammatory medications, immunomodulators, anticancer agents, gas, antivascular endothelial growth factor, and several others. The goal of this review is to provide a detailed description of the properties of numerous therapeutic agents that can be delivered through IVI, potential complications of the technique, and recommendations to avoid side effects.The IVI technique is a valuable tool that can be tailored to the disease process of interest based on the pharmacological agent selected. This review provides the reader with a comprehensive summary of the IVI technique and its multitude of uses.

We determined the mean number of crystalline aggregates per high-power deconvolution microscopy area, triamcinolone acetonide had larger mean number of aggregates compared with TA (time 0 P = 0.002, 10 minutes P < 0.001) and TAIS (time 0 P < 0.001, 10 minutes P = 0.003). Aggregate size varied at both 0 and 10 minutes: TAIS > TA > PFTA. Spectroscopic photometric absorption decreased in direct correlation to aggregate size over time for all three preparations.In vitro, PFTA in Balanced Salt Solution Plus had more aggregates of smaller size than either TA or TAIS. By contrast, TAIS had much larger aggregate size than both PFTA and TA, and this increased over time. These findings correlate with the clinical observations that PFTA and TA tend to disperse throughout the vitreous, whereas TAIS tends to conglomerate and gravitate toward the most dependent portion of the eye in a globular fashion.

Nurses were trained to obtain five images in each eye. All patients were screened by an ophthalmologist trained in diagnosing ROP within 1 week of discharge from the hospital.Outcomes included referral-warranted disease, need for treatment, and anatomic outcomes. Referral-warranted disease was defined as any Early Treatment Retinopathy of Prematurity Disease Type 2 or greater, threshold disease, any plus disease, and any stage 4 or higher disease.In the initial 18-month period, the SUNDROP telemedicine screening initiative has not missed any referral-warranted disease for ROP. A total of 97 infants (194 eyes) were enrolled, resulting in 443 unique examinations and 4,929 unique images. The mean birth weight of the infants was 1,186.9 grams, with a mean gestational age at birth of 28.9 weeks. Seven infants were identified with referral-warranted disease; six patients underwent laser photocoagulation and completely regressed. The one remaining patient regressed spontaneously, and did not require intervention. Calculated sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 98.9% respectively. No patient progressed to retinal detachment or other adverse outcome. Inadequate exposure, artifact, poor visualization of the periphery, and lack of a complete standardized image set in some patients were identified as areas requiring further assessment.The SUNDROP telemedicine screening initiative for ROP has proven to have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for identification of referral-warranted disease. Training was easily implemented. All cases of referral-warranted disease were captured. There were no adverse outcomes.

Nurses obtained five images in each eye. All patients also received a dilated examination by the author within 1 week of discharge from the hospital. Outcomes included referral-warranted disease, need for treatment and anatomical outcomes. Referral-warranted disease was defined as any Early Treatment Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Disease Type 2 or greater, or any plus disease. A retrospective analysis of 84 eyes, 131 unique examinations and 1315 unique images from the SUNDROP archival data is reported here.In the initial 12-month period, the SUNDROP telemedicine screening initiative had not missed any referral warranted ROP. Calculated sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 95%, respectively. No patient progressed to retinal detachment or other adverse outcomes.The SUNDROP telemedicine screening initiative for ROP has proven to have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for identification of referral warranted disease. These results indicate that telemedicine may improve accessibility of ROP screening.

It may inhibit accumulation of A2E and lipofuscin, and is proposed as therapy for Stargardt disease. It is currently used for cancer therapy, and mild depression of rod function and dark adaptation is a side effect at standard dosage. We studied two youngsters (aged between 12 and 13) receiving high doses as compassionate treatment for neuroblastoma: 800 mg daily for 1 out of every 3 weeks, for roughly 2 years. Goldmann-Weekers dark adaptometry, ISCEV standard ERG and mfERG were performed, and blood was analyzed for vitamin A. Neither child complained of night blindness or showed retinal fundus abnormalities. On initial exam, dark adaptation thresholds were elevated by 3 log units, and there were no detectable rod ERG responses. However, cone responses and mfERG were normal. Retesting one subject 3 months after stopping the drug revealed normal rod thresholds (slightly delayed) and low normal rod ERG responses. Serum vitamin A levels were normal from both subjects, but there is no record of whether the samples were drawn during cycles on or off drug. Our study demonstrates that high dose Fenretinide can suppress rod function quite completely, although serum vitamin A and rod function apparently return to normal or near normal levels rapidly once the drug is stopped. It is intriguing that cone function and access to vitamin A seems largely independent of Fenretinide effects on retinol availability.

All eyes underwent fundus photography and fluorescein angiography. Four eyes received barrier photocoagulation. The outcome measures included retinal nonperfusion, proximity to retinal vessels, and progression to retinal detachment.All six posterior breaks were in areas of retinal ischemia. No eyes had neovascularization. Three breaks had a bridging vessel, and three were in a paravascular location. One untreated eye had progression to a retinal detachment.The differential diagnosis for vitreous hemorrhage in diabetic patients should include posterior retinal breaks, particularly in the absence of proliferative disease. These breaks are paravascular, are located in areas of retinal ischemia, and may involve avulsed bridging vessels. We suggest treatment with barrier rather than panretinal photocoagulation.

Bevacizumab was given for exudative and five other indications.We analyzed medical records of 186 subjects (203 eyes) who received a total of 578 injections of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab. The average follow-up was approximately 6 months. Five eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration developed retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tears, all with preexisting RPE detachments. These five eyes represented 2.9% of all age-related macular degeneration eyes treated and 7% of the age-related macular degeneration eyes with preexisting RPE detachments at initiation of treatment. Other adverse events were rare and included retinal ischemia, subretinal hemorrhage, vitreous hemorrhage, ocular irritation or pain, worsened hypertension, and headache. No death or thromboembolic events were observed.Intraocular bevacizumab appears to be well tolerated for the treatment of a variety of retinal and choroidal vascular diseases. RPE tears may occur when treating choroidal neovascularization, particularly in patients with preexisting RPE detachment.

Ocular hypertension occurred 1 month after the second ranibizumab injection in patients 1 and 3, and 1 month after the first ranibizumab in patient 2. In patient 4, it occurred several hours after the first ranibizumab injection. In all patients, the IOP increase was sustained across several visits, requiring control with topical glaucoma therapy, and in two cases the addition of a systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. None of the patients had a previous history of glaucoma, ocular hypertension or IOP asymmetry and the IOP was as high as 30, 34, 46, and 50 mmHg in the four patients.Severe and sustained ocular hypertension may occur after intravitreal ranibizumab.

A total of 104 patients participated in the study, with a total of 118 IVT injection procedures performed on 107 eyes. Standard microbiological techniques were used to culture, identify, and quantify bacterial contamination of injection needles and the bulbar conjunctiva at the injection site in patients undergoing IVT injections. The main outcomes measured were type and quantity of bacterial isolates.Two (2%) of 114 needles collected were contaminated with bacteria. The prevalence of bacterial contamination of the injection site on the bulbar conjunctiva was 43% before prophylaxis on the day of the injection with topical antibiotics and povidone-iodine, with a statistically significant reduction to 13% after prophylaxis (P < 0.0001). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, the most common bacterium isolated from the ocular surface, was isolated from both culture-positive needles.IVT injection needles became contaminated with bacteria during the injection procedure. Although the contamination rate was low, this supports a mechanism of postinjection endophthalmitis in which there is direct inoculation of ocular surface flora into the vitreous cavity by the injection needle.

Primary outcome variables included demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay (LOS), and hospital charges. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict risk factors for ROP.4.67 million live births were recorded during the study period. The total incidence of ROP was 0.12% overall and 7.35% for premature infants with LOS greater than 14 days. Newborns with ROP were more likely to be born at a teaching hospital and to have higher LOS and hospitalisation charges. The odds ratios for the development of ROP were greatest in infants weighing less than 1250 grams. The multivariate regression model revealed that only respiratory distress and intraventricular haemorrhage were predictive of the development of ROP and Hispanic infants were 33% more likely to develop ROP.This study represents the largest cohort of newborns analysed for ROP. The multivariate analysis emphasised the role of birth weight in extended-stay infants, as well as Hispanic race, respiratory distress syndrome, and intraventricular haemorrhage.

A clinical diagnosis of large choroidal malignant melanoma was made. Given the history of trauma and the possibility of enucleation, the patient wished to have histopathological confirmation. The patient underwent 25-gauge vitrectomy. However, he developed a choroidal hemorrhage during the procedure and the surgeon elected not to perform transretinal biopsy. Instead a sample of the vitreous was evaluated by ThinPrep analysis, and a diagnosis of choroidal malignant melanoma was made.Cytological evaluation of vitreous substance with ThinPrep may provide an alterative method for a diagnosis in select cases in which FNA is not possible or desirable. This technique is straightforward and minimizes the risk of retinal detachment or hemorrhage.

We describe retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tears that were noted after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab.In this multimember, retrospective case series, data on eyes that developed RPE tears after intravitreal bevacizumab injection were collected and analyzed. Previous treatments, type of lesion, time to tear, and preinjection and final visual acuities were all compared. The total numbers of bevacizumab injections were available from all four institutions and compiled to estimate the incidence rate.Four retina centers administered a total of 1,455 intravitreal 1.25-mg bevacizumab injections for neovascular AMD during the 9-month study period. Twelve patients presented with RPE tears within 4 days to 8 weeks of injection (mean +/- SD, 24.3 +/- 15.2 days from injection to tear). In each case, the RPE tear was preceded by an RPE detachment, and all had a component of serous sub-RPE fluid. On the basis of our collective data, we estimate an incidence rate of approximately 0.8%.RPE tears can occur after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. The low incidence of this adverse event should not preclude anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy counseling for patients with neovascular AMD, but eyes with serous RPE detachments appear to be most vulnerable to this adverse event.

Clinical features, disease progression, visual outcomes, and complications of these two groups were compared.Fifteen eyes demonstrated the known peripheral retinitis pattern, and 12 eyes exhibited a pattern of retinitis that affected mainly the posterior pole. Eyes with peripheral retinitis showed focal, well-demarcated areas of retinal necrosis in the periphery with rapid circumferential progression and rare involvement of the posterior pole. All eyes with posterior pole retinitis had multifocal deep lesions posterior to the vortex veins at presentation, and half of these eyes had lesions in the macula. These lesions progressed to patches of confluent retinitis in both the periphery and the posterior pole. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of anterior chamber and vitreous cells, vascular sheathing, retinal hemorrhages, or optic disk edema. Patients with posterior retinitis involvement seemed to have a worse visual outcome during the first two years after diagnosis. The Cox proportional hazards model suggested a higher incidence of retinal detachment in patients with posterior retinitis (P = .07).The authors report a pattern of herpetic retinitis that affects predominantly the posterior pole and may have a worse visual prognosis and a higher rate of retinal detachment.

Intravitreal injections have been employed to deliver antibiotics, antivirals, steroids, gas, and antivascular endothelial growth factor. The specific methods and techniques employed for intravitreal injections differ among various studies. We comment on the use of preoperative and postoperative antibiotics, type of anesthesia, gauge of the needle, and coordinates of injection. Intravitreal injections can give rise to complications, of which the most significant and devastating is endophthalmitis. We describe the factors affecting incidence of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injections, recommendations for prophylaxis, and outcomes following endophthalmitis. With increasing experience, the future will bring a reduction in the incidence of endophthalmitis, particularly as the use of intravitreal injections is increasingly supplemented by sustained release devices.

A 69-year-old woman presented with a hyperpigmented membranous retinal surface growth temporal to a stage IV macular hole in the left eye. Clinical examination and optical coherence tomography were performed prior to pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling. Histopathologic processing revealed melanosomes and retinal pigment epithelium with no evidence of neoplastic cells. Retinal pigment epithelium migration can occur through a full-thickness macular hole onto the retinal surface, simulating a retinal pigment epithelium neoplasm.

Patients were examined either in the NICU or the affiliated outpatient clinic. Clinical examination consisted of dilated fundus examination with 360 degree scleral depression. Lesions were identified if they were white, calcific, peripheral, and transient. Ancillary testing and examination of family members was performed as indicated.A total of 302 unique patients were screened for ROP. Ten lesions were identified in seven eyes. Three eyes had two lesions each. All lesions were unilateral. The size of the lesions was estimated to range between 500 and 700 microm. All lesions were located anterior to the vascularized retina, had minimal elevation on scleral depression, and demonstrated a predilection for the nasal and temporal raphe. Ultrasound findings demonstrated an elevated, hyperechoic mass with orbital shadowing. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging tests did not demonstrate the lesions. Lesions involute slowly over a period of 6 months. There were no systemic findings or familial dispositions.Immature retina in premature infants may predispose to the formation of transient reactive astrocytic hyperplasia. Development of mature retinal vascularization and spontaneous resolution of lesions should alleviate concerns regarding a more malignant diagnosis.

Ninety-two procedure- surgeon-matched subjects (2.48:1) were selected. Twenty-six cases (71%) of ASCH were related to a glaucoma operation. Risk factors for the development of ASCH included previous vitrectomy (P = .003, odds ratio of 12) and older age (P = .007, odds ratio 1.57/decade of increasing age). Hypertension was found to be protective (P = .02, odds ratio of 0.33). Factors associated with a poor visual outcome in patients with ASCH included apposition >30 days (P = .01), history of uveitis (P = .04), history of dry age-related macular degeneration (P = .05), and history of extracapsular cataract extraction (P = .05). Median pre-ASCH visual acuity was 20/100, and final median visual acuity was 20/1600.Risk factors for the development of ASCH include previous vitrectomy and older age. Patients with these risk factors should be informed of their greater chance of poor visual acuity and anatomic outcomes secondary to the development of ASCH.

We performed complete ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, linkage mapping, and mutational screening in the RDS/peripherin gene in the affected patients. Patients affected with BPD had a best-corrected vision of 20/20 to 20/25, whereas vision in the eyes of patients with AOFMD ranged from 20/20 to 20/400. In all three kindreds, sequence analysis identified an A-to-G change at nucleotide position 422 of the RDS/peripherin gene, predicting a novel Tyr-141-Cys substitution. A haplotype analysis revealed that these three kindreds shared an identical disease haplotype at the RDS/peripherin locus, indicating that the mutation reflects a founder effect. The sequence change that segregated with the disease phenotype was not observed in 200 control chromosomes. Our results identified a novel mutation in the RDS/ peripherin gene that can cause diverse macular phenotypes. Genetic and clinical investigation of pattern dystrophy may provide useful diagnostic tools and new treatment strategies for this disorder.

The secondary outcome measure was visual and anatomic outcome of treatment.Mean age was 53.5 years (range, 19-77 years), with a median of 59.5 years. There were 9 women and 13 men. Six patients were infected with HIV, and 3 patients, 1 with HIV, had bilateral disease. Mean initial vision was 20/110 (median, 20/400; range, 20/20 to no light perception [NLP]). Sixteen patients (73%) had received oral or injectable corticosteroids and 11 (50%) had received antiviral therapy before the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Diagnosis was made solely by clinical response to antitoxoplasmosis medications in 4 patients. Sixteen patients were diagnosed based on evaluation of intraocular fluids and tissue by antibody determinations, culture, PCR, histopathologic examination, or a combination thereof. Visual acuity improved after treatment in 7 of 25 eyes (28%). Mean final visual acuity was 20/156 (median, 20/2500; range, 20/30 to NLP). Anatomically, 18 of 23 eyes with follow-up had healed or improved chorioretinitis. Retinitis was progressive in 1 eye, 2 eyes were enucleated, and 2 were phthisical.Diagnosis of atypical toxoplasmic chorioretinitis that mimics viral retinitis can be accomplished by several means. Prompt diagnosis may help avoid poor visual and anatomic outcomes after prolonged initial treatment with oral prednisone or antiviral medications.

Eight eyes of eight patients with acute postoperative endophthalmitis were identified in the 6 weeks following IVTA for an incidence of 0.87% (95% confidence interval of 0.38% to 1.70%). The median time to presentation was 7.5 days (range, 1-15 days) after IVTA. The most common clinical findings were iritis (n = 8), vitritis (n = 8), hypopyon (n = 8), pain (n = 7), red eye (n = 6), and decreased vision (n = 5). The median presenting visual acuity was 20/1127 (range, 20/60 to light perception). Initial treatment consisted of vitreous tap and injection of antibiotics (n = 6) or pars plana vitrectomy and injection of intravitreal antibiotics (n = 2). Intraocular cultures yielded identification in seven patients. One demonstrated intracellular gram-positive cocci in chains with numerous polymorphonuclear cells on gram stain. The median postinfection vision was 20/400 (range, 20/40 to no light perception). Three patients ended up with no light perception visual acuity, including enucleation (n = 1) and phthisis (n = 1).Acute postoperative endophthalmitis following IVTA occurs rapidly and can result in severe loss of vision.

Computed tomography revealed a 2 x 3-cm mass in the superior left orbit that expanded orbital dimensions. Radiography showed abnormalities in the parietal and frontal bones and distal right tibia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an 8.5-cm abnormality of the marrow space of the right mid-tibia. Bone marrow biopsy was unremarkable. Orbital and tibial biopsies showed a nonspecific chronic inflammation. Idiopathic inflammation that involves the orbit (orbital pseudotumor) and that has systemic manifestations may mimic more serious conditions, such as metastases from rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma, Accurate diagnosis requires careful clinical and pathologic examinations.

The power ranged from 80 to 200 mW with 1 to 3 minutes of laser exposure for pigmented rabbits and 750 to 1800 mW with 1 minute of exposure for albino rabbits. These parameters were also evaluated after compression of the globe using the contact lens to induce blanching of the optic nerve head. After the experiment, the eyes were enucleated under deep anesthesia, and the animals were killed immediately.In pigmented rabbits, the threshold fluence with the 2-mm spot size was 229 J/cm2 without compression and 153 J/cm2 with compression. With the 3-mm spot size, the threshold decreased from 200 to 150 mW as the duration of exposure lengthened (2 or 3 minutes), increasing the fluence from 170 to 382 J/cm2. In nonpigmented rabbits, the threshold fluence with the 2-mm spot size was 2,865 J/cm2 without compression and 2,674 J/cm2 with compression. With the 3-mm spot size, the threshold fluence of 1,528 J/cm2 was not affected by compression. Histopathologic studies showed transretinal damage at the lowest levels necessary to achieve angiographic evidence of a treatment lesion or a barely visible funduscopic lesion at the time of treatment.Nonpigmented rabbits required more than a 12-fold increase in total TTT fluence compared with pigmented rabbits with the 2-mm spot size and a ninefold increase with the 3-mm spot size. Inner and outer retinal damage was seen histopathologically at these levels.

All cases had undergone ocular photodynamic therapy with verteporfin using standard protocols. Six of eight patients suffered a submacular hemorrhage after ocular photodynamic therapy, and two of eight patients refused further ocular photodynamic therapy. All patients subsequently had submacular surgery with removal of the CNV. One membrane was routinely processed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Five membranes were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopic examination. Semithin (1.0 microm) sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate-lead citrate for transmission electron microscopy.Choroidal neovascular membranes were at 3 days (presumed ocular histoplasmosis), 29 days (punctate inner choroiditis), 63 days (AMD, pathologic myopia), 66 days (AMD), 107 days (pathologic myopia), 116 days (AMD), and 152 days (idiopathic) after verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy. Histopathologic and ultrastructural examination showed areas of vascular occlusion at 3 days that were not seen at later time points. All specimens had patent CNV. There were signs of vascular damage with extravasated erythrocytes and fibrin, pigment clumping in cells, and inflammatory cells in all but the 3-day specimen.This case series presents data only from patients who refused repeat treatment with ocular photodynamic therapy or who developed submacular hemorrhage after initial photodynamic therapy. Histopathologic evaluation of CNV after verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy showed partial vascular occlusion that was not present in later specimens. These later specimens demonstrated evidence of vascular damage. Verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy does not appear to lead to permanent and complete occlusion of the CNV. Thus, treatments that lead to permanent closure of CNV without damage to the retinal pigment epithelium and sensory retina are still needed.

The study population consisted of 12 members of a Caucasian kindred. After providing informed consent, patients donated blood for genomic DNA extraction and mutational screening using standard techniques. The main outcome measure were the presence of a RDS/Peripherin gene mutation in a patient with the disease and its absence in unaffected family members and controls.Eight affected family members and no unaffected family members demonstrated a single guanine base deletion at nucleotide 112 that led to premature termination at amino acid 38 of RDS/Peripherin polypeptide. This frameshift mutation results in truncation of nearly 90% of the gene product, thus probably representing a null allele. That results in a relatively severe phenotype, with choroidal neovascularization developing in two patients and geographic atrophy involving the macula in three patients.We describe a frameshift null mutation in the RDS/Peripherin gene associated with a relatively severe manifestation of adult-onset foveomacular dystrophy in affected family members.

Neither child had physical complications as a result of the swallowing events.We report 3 instances in which a child fitted for an ocular prosthesis after enucleation swallowed his prosthesis and had no untoward effects. The failure of imaging to detect the prostheses in the second child is attributed to the radiolucent nature of materials used in the manufacture of the prosthesis.

The disease presents with a triad of photophobia, loss of color vision and reduced central vision. This phenotype is distinct from retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in which there are prominent night and peripheral vision disturbances. X-linked cone dystrophy is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, with a region that harbors the RPGR gene, mutations in which account for >70% of patients with X-linked RP. The majority of these mutations reside in one purine-rich exon, ORF15, encoding 567 amino acids with a repetitive domain rich in glutamic acid residues. We mapped two families with X-linked cone dystrophy to the COD1 locus and identified two distinct mutations in ORF15 in the RPGR gene (ORF15+1343_1344delGG and ORF15+694_708del15) leading to a frame-shift and premature termination of translation in one case and a deletion of five amino acids in another. Consistent with expression of RPGR in rods and cones, our results show that mutations in RPGR, in addition to X-linked RP, can also cause cone-specific degeneration.

Genomic DNA from serum lymphocytes was isolated and used as a template for primers specific for the cone homeobox gene (CRX), rhodopsin (RHO), and peripherin/RDS genes to conduct single stranded conformational analysis and cycle sequencing.The pedigree of four affected siblings suggested probable autosomal dominance transmission of pattern dystrophy. In the four siblings, best corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 20/80 by Snellen chart. Clinical findings included discrete, localized degenerative changes of the macular retinal pigment epithelium in all patients, with subclassification foveal. One patient exhibited pigment clumping within the atrophic areas. Another patient exhibited yellow flecks diffusely in the macula. Fluorescein angiographic findings included central hypofluorescence with a surrounding rim of hyperfluorescence that corresponded to the observed fundus lesions and window defects. There was a range of electroretinography (ERG) and electrooculography (EOG) findings. One patient demonstrated both cone and rod dysfunction on ERG testing and another demonstrated decreased rod function. EOG testing was normal in two patients and mildly diminished in one patient. DNA sequencing identified a point mutation in intron 2 of the peripherin/RDS gene, consisting of an A to T change at 1068+3, present in all four affected patients.Four siblings with pattern dystrophy of the retina presented a splice site mutation in the peripherin/RDS gene.

Supplemental therapy was withheld until disease progression was documented.Disease progression (defined as tumor growth, vitreous or subretinal seed progression, and new tumor formation), delay of external beam radiotherapy, and ocular survival.Thirty-six eyes were treated. Eighteen eyes had Reese-Ellsworth group I-III tumors, and 16 eyes had Reese-Ellsworth group IV-V tumors at diagnosis. Two patients, who had unilateral disease at diagnosis, subsequently had tumors develop in the contralateral eye. Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) completed eight cycles of chemotherapy without disease progression. Three eyes of three different patients were successfully treated with chemotherapy alone. Thirty-three of 36 eyes (92%) progressed after completion of chemotherapy: 15 of the 18 eyes (83.3%) with Reese-Ellsworth group I-III and 16 of 16 eyes (100%) with Reese-Ellsworth group IV-V tumors. Seventeen eyes (52%) had growth of a tumor, whereas 14 eyes (42%) had progressive vitreous seeding, and 2 eyes (6%) had new tumors develop. Fifteen eyes (42%) required external beam radiotherapy. Twenty-nine of 36 (80.5%) eyes were salvaged. The median follow-up after chemotherapy was 19 months (range, 3-42 months).Multiagent chemotherapy alone does not ensure a cure for multifocal intraocular retinoblastoma.

Mono-L-aspartyl chlorin e6 at a dose of 2 mg/kg was administered by intravenous infusion. Laser irradiation was applied within 5 minutes using a 664-nm diode laser at a power output of 5.9 mW (750 mW/cm2), spot size of 1,000 microm, and time of 10 seconds. This resulted in a fluence of 7.5 J/cm2. Three consecutive PDT treatments at 2-week intervals were applied over the center of the fovea and posterior fundus near the arcade vessels of each eye. The animals were killed and the eyes were enucleated for histologic study 2 weeks after the last treatment.Limited changes could be observed in the sensory retina under light microscopy. Photoreceptor cells and outer segments were not damaged, even after repeated PDT. Proliferation and duplication of the retinal pigment epithelial cells were common findings. A plaque of fibrous tissue was present, interwoven with retinal pigment epithelial cells in eyes that received repeated PDT. The retinal vessels remained patent even after three sessions of PDT. However, occlusion of the choriocapillaris and the large choroidal vessels was observed after repeated PDT treatment.Repeated PDT of healthy nonhuman primate fundi using a hydrophilic photosensitizer (NPe6) shows preservation of the neurosensory retina components and architecture with damage confined to the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris.

In both years, the most common ocular complaints were pain, blur, foreign body sensation, tearing, and photophobia. The most common slit lamp findings in 1998 were within normal limits, corneal abrasion, and conjunctival hyperemia. In 1999, the most common findings were subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal abrasion, cell and flare, and lid laceration.Projectile injuries of the eyes are common during Mardi Gras due to the nature of interaction between paradegoers and float riders. We found no identifiable trend in the number or type of injuries reported in 1986, 1987, and 1998 Mardi Gras surveys.

The threshold was determined by analyzing fluorescein angiograms for areas of nonperfusion. Retreatment: Dutch-belted rabbits underwent NPe6 PDT followed by fluorescein angiography. Rabbits were retreated one week later at the same parameters.Fluence levels and vascular damage thresholds were always higher for retinal than for choroidal vascular occlusion. Retreatment caused choroidal vessel closure at all tested fluences but retinal capillaries closed only at a fluence > 17.7 J/cm2.NPe6 PDT has a lower threshold to occlude choroidal vessels than retinal vessels. The cumulative effect of retreatment does not damage retinal vessels unless the threshold is exceeded during a single retreatment session.

Group 1 was treated at increasing power levels; fluorescein angiograms were obtained at each fluence. Group 2 animals were exposed to laser irradiation at 5 minutes, and 1 and 3 hours postinjection to determine (by fluorescein angiography 24 hours post-treatment) if increasing the interval affected outcome. Group 3 animals underwent fluorescein angiography at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 24 hours posttreatment to document the time between laser application and subsequent vessel closure.Choroidal vessel occlusion was angiographically evident in all lesions at fluences of > or = 2.65 J/cm2 in pigmented rabbits and at > or = 0.88 J/cm2 in nonpigmented rabbits. Lesion diameter decreased as the time between injection and treatment increased.

Laser light was supplied by a red diode laser coupled to a modified slit-lamp biomicroscope and delivered to the ocular fundus after passing through a standard fundus contact lens. Standard photodynamic parameters were used. The effects of fundus pigmentation, intraocular pressure, spot focus and defocus, region of fundus treated, equivalent fluence, and retreatment were observed in the different animal species.Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fluorescein angiography, light and transmission electron microscopy.Fundus pigmentation appeared to be a factor only at the lowest fluence level tested, where only 4 of 12 lesions attempted in pigmented fundi were noted on fluorescein angiography, compared with 12 of 12 lesions in albino rabbits. At normal intraocular pressures and a given fluence, 10 of 10 lesions were fully manifested on fluorescein angiography, compared with 4 of 10 at 30 mmHg and 0 of 10 at pressures sufficient to blanch the optic nerve (>60 mmHg). For laser spots either focused or defocused, there were 6 of 6 lesions that were fully manifested on fluorescein angiography for each of the parameters. Lesions treated in the fovea resulted in larger spots on fluorescein angiography. The fluence of 5 mW for 10 seconds resulted in a larger lesion on angiography than the equivalent fluence of 10 mW for 5 seconds. Areas of retreatment in rabbits demonstrated more thinning of the neurosensory retina and loss of photoreceptor outer segments and nuclei than corresponding areas receiving one treatment.Photodynamic therapy results varied, depending on intraocular pressure, region of fundus treated, ocular pigmentation, and the total time of exposure to the photosensitizer. Retreatment resulted in progressive thinning of the neurosensory retina with loss of photoreceptor outer segments and nuclei in the rabbit eye.

Recommending enucleation is one of the most difficult therapeutic decisions in ophthalmology. In some cases of malignancy, cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, diathermy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy may be viable alternatives to surgery. When surgery is chosen, evisceration or exenteration may be alternatives to enucleation. Once the decision is made to perform enucleation or evisceration, the surgeon must choose from several types of implants and wrapping materials. These devices can be synthetic, autologous, or eye-banked tissues. With certain implants, the surgeon must decide when and if to drill for subsequent peg placement. In this review, the authors discuss choices, techniques, complications, and patient consent and follow-up before, during, and after enucleation. Controversies and results of the Controlled Ocular Melanoma Study are summarized.

The animals were immediately placed in front of the scanning laser ophthalmoscope and the fundus was viewed with the helium-neon laser. The resulting fluorescence was viewed and recorded on super-VHS videotape.Fluorescence demonstrated clearly that NPe6 entered the retinal and choroidal circulation within seconds of intravenous injection. The concentration of NPe6 was diminished over a period of 1.5 hours in the monkey and 5 hours in the rat, as evidenced by considerable diminution of the intensity of fluorescence.NPe6 fluorescence allows evaluation of drug availability within the retinal and choroidal circulation and visualization of pathological lesions before commencement of photodynamic therapy.

Time from injection to irradiation varied from 5 to 15 minutes, and duration of exposure varied from 1 to 10 seconds. Power output at the corneal surface was either 3.6 or 5.9 mW. Animals were examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography at 2 hours and 7 days after treatment. After enucleation 7 days after treatment, specimens were prepared for light and electron microscopy.Angiographic evidence of occlusion and histopathologic evidence of retinal damage.Both clinical and histopathologic examination demonstrated effects on the choroidal vasculature and the retinal pigment epithelium, including necrosis of endothelial cells and occlusion in choroidal vessels, particularly within the choriocapillaris, at low levels. Overlying neurosensory retina was minimally affected. Fluorescein angiography of lesions treated with 2 mg/kg and laser fluence of 2.3 to 7.5 J/cm2 showed a normal appearance 2 hours after treatment, which changed to early hypofluorescent and later hyperfluorescent lesions 7 days after treatment. In contrast, those animals receiving the 10-mg/kg dose and laser fluence of 0.46 to 0.75 J/cm2 showed marked hypofluorescence of choroidal lesions and occlusion of retinal vessels 7 days after treatment.Effective occlusion of normal choroidal vessels was achieved at 2 mg/kg using 2.3 to 7.5 J/cm2 or at 10 mg/kg using 0.46 to 0.75 J/cm2 with minimal injury to overlying neurosensory retina.

Ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography were performed 1 day after SnET2 PDT. In separate groups of rabbits, treated areas of the fundus were imaged within 30 minutes following PDT using fluorescein vesicle and microsphere angiography with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy to document time of vascular occlusion. All animals were killed 1 day following treatment and eyes were examined by histopathology.Areas of hypofluorescence (indicating vascular occlusion) were seen when activating laser light was applied 5 to 20 minutes after SnET2 injection. Retinal vessels remained perfused in all cases. The time to vascular occlusion was 70 to 120 and 40 to 90 minutes in nonpigmented and pigmented rabbits, respectively. No safety issues were seen.PDT with SnET2 was effective in occluding the choriocapillaris.

Twenty-four hours following photocoagulation, the eyes were examined for evidence of vascular occlusive disease. Vascular occlusion was proven by fluorescent vesicle angiography with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; these results were recorded to SVHS videotape. The images were then serially analyzed frame by frame to track individual microsphere movement.The authors observed retrograde flow proximal to the point of vessel obstruction and extending backward into the arterial system.This demonstrates the existence of retrograde flow in an experimental model of BRVO and might explain vascular complications seen in this disease process.

Changes were documented on SVHS videotape for later analysis. Individual microsphere movement was tracked through the tumor vessels. Subsequently, blood velocity measurements were taken.The tumor vessels were poorly organized and inefficient. Tumor blood velocity was up to 2.5 times slower compared with normal blood velocity in the unaffected iris of the same eye of the same rabbit (P = .05). Tumor blood flow could be qualitatively visualized in real time in the liver rabbit model.The ability to visualize fluorescent microspheres within the poorly organized tumor vasculature coupled with the reduced blood velocity in the tumor helps to explain the success of hyperthermic tumoricidal therapy, and may allow for development of more efficient and selective drug delivery systems and tumoricidal agents.

Funduscopy, fluorescein angiography, and light and electron microscopy were performed at 1, 14, and 28 days after PDT.Following SnET2 and PDT, closure of the choriocapillaris was achieved with light doses as low as 5 J/cm2 (17 seconds) and a drug dose of 0.5 mg/kg of SnET2. Vascular occlusion was documented by fluorescein damage was noted in the choriocapillary endothelial cells. Retinal pigment epithelial damage and outer retinal damage were also observed. No funduscopic, angiographic, or histologic findings were present in the eyes of pigmented control rabbits.PDT with SnET2 was effective in this animal model, using low levels of activating light for the occlusion of the choriocapillaris. This has clinical implications for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization and could be a more selective therapy than thermal laser photocoagulation.

In vivo, high-quality fluorescent vesicle angiograms were obtained that demonstrated leakage of free dye from choroidal laser spots.Free dye and fluorescent vesicles can be combined to obtain an angiogram with all of the advantages of a traditional angiogram, while allowing the operator to assess the changes in retinal or choroidal circulation directly.

We studied dose and clearance of daunorubicin in various ocular tissues using fluorophotometry techniques.In vitro tests: The emission of fluorescence from the daunorubicin solution having a concentration range of 0.1 to 10 micrograms/mL in phosphate buffer was measured using an excitation wavelength range of 489 +/- 10 nm. The emission of fluorescence was measured at 514 nm; the linearity of the response was determined using linear regression analysis. There is a fluorescence peak of daunorubicin at 485 nm. The validity and reproducibility of the method were examined. In vivo tests: The rabbits were randomized into three groups and daunorubicin concentrations of 4, 6, or 8 micrograms/mL were injected into the vitreous. Fluorophotometry scanning from the retina to the anterior chamber was performed with a commercially available fluorophotometer at various times up to 48 hours after injection to quantify fluorescence emission of daunorubicin.The standard curve of fluorescence versus concentration of daunorubicin was linear in the range of 0.1 to 8 micrograms/mL. It was sensitive up to 0.1 microgram. The daunorubicin time concentration profile showed a dose response relationship over the 48-hour period studied. The half-life of daunorubicin in the vitreous was about 5 hours.We performed fluorophotometry using a fluorophotometer whose exciter emits light at 489 nm, which is very close to an absorption peak of daunorubicin. These two values are close enough to obviate the need for modifying the commercial fluorophotometer. Therefore the concentration of daunorubicin in the vitreous cavity can be measured noninvasively.

We compared the combined effects of argon laser photocoagulation and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) released from temperature-sensitive liposomes with argon laser photocoagulation alone on occlusion of retinal vessels in pigmented rats. In Group A, 8 eyes were treated with liposome-encapsulated ADP and laser photocoagulation. In Group B, 8 eyes were treated with laser photocoagulation alone. The laser parameters (power, spot size, exposure time) were maintained at the same levels for both groups. The laser was focused on the retinal vessels at the optic nerve head. The treated retinal vessels were observed at time zero, day 1, day 4, and weekly for a period of 3 months. At time zero, 6 of 8 eyes were totally occluded in Group A, with best results obtained at 80 mW. Only 1 of 8 eyes in Group B achieved total occlusion. After 3 months, 4 of 8 eyes in Group A remained totally occluded; no eyes in Group B were occluded. Complete and permanent occlusion of retinal vessels can be achieved by using ADP and laser photocoagulation of lower power density than traditional laser photocoagulation alone.

We then performed preoperative comparative simulations on the first seven patients to be treated with palladium 103 plaque therapy for choroidal melanoma. The in vitro experiment involved palladium 103 seeds placed into a Silastic seed holder, which was affixed into standard 14-mm gold eye plaques. Then the plaques were sewn onto 12 human donor eyes so as to approximate either the nasal (six eyes) or temporal (six eyes) equator. Three sets of two thermoluminescent dosimeters were used to quantify the amount of radiation delivered by the episcleral plaques. Thermoluminescent dosimeters were sewn to the sclera in three locations: on the center of the cornea, on the sclera beneath the macula, and at the equator in a position opposite the plaque. This experiment was then repeated with iodine 125 seeds and thermoluminescent dosimeters. After the plaques were adjusted to equalize their activity (plaque strength), the palladium 103 plaques were found to deliver less radiation to the three target points. Comparative clinical dosimetry also reflected this difference. Preoperative simulations comparing equal doses to the tumors' apex revealed that the palladium 103 ophthalmic plaques delivered more radiation to the tumor and less radiation to most normal ocular structures.

Microwave-induced cyclodestruction was successful in reducing intraocular pressure in all treated glaucomatous eyes for 4 weeks. Two additional glaucomatous eyes were left untreated to serve as controls, and were noted to have persistently elevated intraocular pressures. Six additional eyes were then subjected to an equivalent treatment (50 degrees C in five 1-minute applications), which resulted in approximately 180 degrees of heat treatment just posterior to the corneoscleral limbus. These specimens were evaluated with light microscopy at baseline, 24 hours, and 7 days after treatment. Our clinical and histopathologic evaluations suggested that microwave thermotherapy (delivered under thermometry control) allowed for chorioretinal/ciliary body destruction that resulted in reductions of intraocular pressure in glaucomatous eyes.
