Branham practices as the director of clinical services at Moose Pharmacy in Concord, NC, and as a clinical pharmacist at Cabarrus Family Medicine in Kannapolis, NC. \"She is an incredible source of answers to difficult clinical questions for our physicians and a tireless resource for our patients challenging psychosocial and insurance dilemmas,\" said Dr. Robert Levy, who is a family practice physician at Cabarrus Medicine. \"You just don't meet people like Dr. Branham every day, but when you are lucky enough to have her running on your team, you are deeply grateful each and every day.\" In addition to her work, Branham played an instrumental role in house bill 832 which passed through the North Carolina legislature this summer. Serving as co-chair of the immunization task force with NCAP, Branham spent four years of dedicated work to expand pharmacists' immunization authority. Starting in October, the new law will allow pharmacists to administer more vaccinations without a prescription, as long as the patient is a candidate for the immunization and age 18 and older. The expanded list of vaccines will offer prevention against hepatitis B, pneumococcal, tetanus and zoster. Pharmacists will continue to provide influenza vaccines to individuals age 14 and older. After graduating from Campbell in 2008, Branham completed a PGY1 and PGY2 residency with Moose Pharmacy and the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy. During her short career, Branham has quickly accumulated an impressive list of accomplishments. In 2010, she was a finalist in the Parata/Pharmacy Times Next Generation Pharmacist Rising Star of the Year Category. The following year Branham was recognized with the American Pharmacists Association's Immunization Champion Honorable Mention in the Individual Practice Category. In 2012, Branham was named an Outstanding Adherence Educator by the National Community Pharmacists Association.
