My goal is to help you achieve optimum health and wellness. Having evolved over thousands of years, acupuncture is one of the oldest continually practiced medical modalities in the world. Acupuncture is used to prevent and treat disease, relieve pain, balance mood, enhance athletic performance, increase fertility, and improve overall health and wellness. Acupuncture is a safe, effective, chemical-free way to promote your body's self-healing abilities. Modern research has shown that acupuncture is a safe, effective, chemical-free way to promote the body's remarkable self-healing abilities.

Sometimes there is no clear diagnosis. Many times the safe and gentle modalities of acupuncture, cupping, moxibustion, and herbal and dietary therapies are what someone needs to get them back on track, physically and emotionally. I love helping people learn to trust their bodies again. We each have an immense capacity to heal. Having seen the profound positive effects that acupuncture and Chinese medicine can have, I am honored to be able to share these benefits with my patients. Together we can work to achieve your health and wellness goals. "}
