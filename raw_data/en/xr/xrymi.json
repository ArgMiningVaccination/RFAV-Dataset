And most concerning, they found that among [babies](https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm) with [COVID-19](https://www.medicinenet.com/wuhan_coronavirus_2019-ncov_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) who were admitted to the ICU \u2014 the sickest babies \u2014 88% were born to mothers who were not vaccinated before or during [pregnancy](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm),\" Meaney-Delman said. The only baby who died in the study was born to an unvaccinated mother, she noted. Overall, the study found that \"babies less than 6 months old whose mothers were vaccinated were 61% less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19,\" Meaney-Delman said. \"As soon as a [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm) woman is willing to be vaccinated, we recommend that she go ahead and do so.\" That includes women at any stage of pregnancy \u2014 or even prior to pregnancy \u2014 since recent research has shown that contracting COVID-19 while expecting can lead to devastating consequences. \"There is a huge benefit to the pregnancy and to having a healthy mother getting vaccinated prior to pregnancy,\" Meaney-Delman said. \"I don't want us to lose sight of that piece. While we don't know there is actual immune protection conferred, we know that might protect a mom from getting COVID during pregnancy, which is associated with preterm birth, with [stillbirth](https://www.medicinenet.com/stillbirth/article.htm), with pregnancy complications.\" Still, the timing of the shots in this latest study did make a difference in how protective the [vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) was for an infant. Vaccination was 80% effective at protecting a [newborn](https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm) against severe COVID-19 if a mom got her two shots after 21 weeks of gestation, the researchers found. Any earlier in pregnancy and the vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization is only around 32%, according to the data published online Feb. 15 in the CDC's [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e3.htm?s_cid=mm7107e3_w) The findings jibe with a December [study](https://consumer.healthday.com/b-1-3-anytime-is-the-right-time-for-covid-vaccine-in-pregnancy-2656192931.html), which found that antibody levels are higher in babies' umbilical cord blood when vaccination occurs in a woman's [third trimester](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/third_trimester_32_weeks_picture/picture.htm). But that study, which appeared in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, argued that antibody levels from vaccination earlier in pregnancy were still high enough to likely prove protective. For the latest study, researchers led by CDC medical epidemiologist Dr. Manish Patel evaluated 176 infants younger than 6 months of age hospitalized for COVID-19 at 20 pediatric hospitals across 17 states between July 2021 and January 2022. Their cases were compared with 203 babies who were COVID-free but hospitalized during the same period. About 16% of babies hospitalized for COVID-19 had moms who had received two vaccine doses during pregnancy. By comparison, 32% of the control group babies had moms vaccinated while expecting. The findings are consistent with the possibility that COVID-19 antibodies can transfer across the [placenta](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/placenta/art-20044425#:~:text=The%20placenta%20is%20an%20organ,umbilical%20cord%20arises%20from%20it.) and provide protection to infants following delivery, the researchers concluded. \"With infants not currently age-eligible for vaccination and infant hospitalization rates remaining at the highest levels of the pandemic, this study suggests that maternal COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy might protect infants aged <6 months from COVID-19-related hospitalization,\" the researchers reported. They called for more study into the timing of vaccination before and during pregnancy, to suss out exactly when is the best time to get the vaccine. \"CDC recommends that women who are [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm), are [breastfeeding](https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm), are trying to get [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm) now, or might become [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) in the future get vaccinated and stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination,\" the researchers wrote. Despite the finding that getting vaccinated later in pregnancy might confer more protection to infants, other research has shown that waiting until later in pregnancy to get the vaccine can open a pregnancy up to other significant risks. For example, a [study](https://meridian.allenpress.com/aplm/article/doi/10.5858/arpa.2022-0029-SA/477699/Placental-Tissue-Destruction-and-Insufficiency) published on Feb. 10 found that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 are at increased risk for [stillbirth](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/stillbirth/facts.html#:~:text=A%20stillbirth%20is%20the%20death,to%20when%20the%20loss%20occurs.). An analysis of 64 stillbirths revealed that the COVID virus, [SARS](https://www.medicinenet.com/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_sars/article.htm)-CoV-2, wreaks havoc on the placenta, causing clotting, cell death and inflammation, according to the report in the Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine. \"We saw these abnormalities under the microscope and with the naked eye,\" said study author Dr. David Schwartz, a perinatal pathologist in Atlanta. \"The average placenta was 77.7% destroyed. A fetus can't survive with this type of damage because the placenta is its sole source of oxygen and [nutrition](https://www.medicinenet.com/nutrition/article.htm).\" More information The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about [ COVID and pregnancy](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html).
