How I made this music: Creating a Turning In album is more like editing a full length feature film than creating a three minute song - and you will feel the difference. An album for the Turning In series takes me at least around four weeks of studio work and constant testing, tweaking and mixing. In order to be able to feel and fine-tune the effects that even the smallest little detail has on the listener's state of consciousness and energy, I have to be in a meditative state myself while working in the studio. This meditative music is designed for a certain intention: To open up and change certain states of mind and expand the listener's consciousness. It is essential for me to be in an equal state of consciousness during the process of composing and designing this particular music. Why? Because once you are in a super relaxed, receptive and expanded state you will feel and hear every little detail and the slightest unevenness can ruin the whole experience. Along the way I test the latest version of the meditation tracks countless times in full length. Then I also send it to other experienced meditators to get their feedback before finally finishing the tracks. It is a very slow and time consuming but yet VERY relaxing process for me. I absolutely love this work and I am keen to know what the sounds are doing for you. Your feedback is very appreciated.
