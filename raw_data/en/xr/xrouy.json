Your body communicates through pain and discomfort. Pain is the voice of your inner-self, and that's how it communicates for help. Pain and fever are signs of an uncomfortable life; being painless and cold are signs of death or a dead end. These or any other ailments should be taken into account when holistically treating a patient. These symptoms are undeniable expressions of your body either at mental (anger, headaches), emotional (broken-hearted, fear, sadness), physical (swelling, pains, itch) and at spiritual levels (dreams, nightmares, clairvoyance). If you try to escape these symptoms, you can become trapped by disease names. Denying these symptoms can escalate any agony or anguish you currently face. "}
