Our products represent a return to nature, to the Earth, as our true source of nourishment. We are all a part of the same source. The chemical elements of man are the same chemical elements as the dust of the Earth, the ocean and the stars. Trace elements and minerals are the natural elements which sustain our electrolytic balance and magnetic energy. The complete balance of our mind and body represents health and wellness. \"Vitality and beauty are gifts of nature for those who live according to its laws. \" - Leonardo Da Vinci Source Vit\u00e1l is dedicated to holistic skin and body care. We recognize the skin as a major organ of the body, a mineral organ responsible for defending internal organs from invading microorganisms. The skin also acts as a sense organ which responds to touch, climate and environment. The messages the skin receives are a part of patterning and forming our inner thoughts and physical responses. Correct and effective skin care is a vital part of sustaining balance and well-being. The Source Vit\u00e1l philosophy is based both on European spa therapies and Chinese medicine teachings. We combine the best of East and West to achieve results-oriented products to assist in the integration of body, mind and spirit for each individual. Product Philosophy Source Vit\u00e1l believes in the wisdom of nature. We blend [seaweeds](https://www.sourcevital.com/pages/amazing-benefits-of-algae-seaweed), [essential oils](https://www.sourcevital.com/pages/the-case-for-essential-oils) and [plant extracts](https://www.sourcevital.com/blogs/insights/whats-the-difference-why-using-natural-plant-based-skin-care-is-beneficial-to-the-mind-body-spirit) to produce an effective skin, body and spa care line. We know that nature provides gifts in the form of food, air, and water. With this knowledge, Source Vit\u00e1l combines these gifts of the Earth to care for the skin and body. We feel this is accomplished by encouraging balance--internally and externally. For more than 30 years, it's been our passion to provide holistic skin and body products of integrity. We believe when the skin and body are balanced with holistic products, the mind and spirit align. Natural aromatic essential oils are consistently at work on all the body's systems and tissues. The right side of the brain\u2014the limbic system--responds favorably to aromatherapy, and the mind and spirit are empowered.

[Body Care](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/bath-body-care) Approach Cleansing, in the form of detoxification, is one of the most valuable tools for working with the body. Remineralizing is also important as it relates to bringing in the necessary nutrients needed to maintain healthy tissue and organs. Product application through massage, bathing or internal supplementation are essential when detoxifying and remineralizing. We believe you must work with the body internally to affect the external and vice versa. Seeing the entire body as a whole is the basis of our holistic philosophy. [Skin Care](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/facial-skin-care) Approach We view skin as an organ of elimination, and as the largest organ in the body, we know the skin is exposed to the environment, harsh products and toxins-- both internally and externally. Through our extensive product line, Source Vit\u00e1l's goal is to help you chose the program that is perfect for your skin and lifestyle: - Detoxify by stimulating local circulation - Eliminate toxins affecting the skin and the digestive system - Add vital nutrients to the skin topically and internally - Cleanse and stimulate the skin on a deeper level through the use of seaweed and aromatherapy.
