Maus II[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive41&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] Wow, what a horrid weekend I had. I felt the need to vent this one in the bar because I feel really bad. Basically, the wife screamed to me saying that the chickens had found a dead mouse (they often come across ones left behind by the cat and run around after each other trying to eat it) and so I went out with a bag to take it off them and throw it in the bin. As I was just approaching the chook who was currently dribbling the ball I heard a squeak (as she bashed it hard against the patio) and so I quickly took it off her only to find it was still alive. Yup, they'd cornered a little field mouse and were in the process of ripping it apart, alive. I held it for a bit, realising that just about every bone in its body was probably broken and that I really should put it out of its misery. Unfortunately by this point I had an audience, including the wife's very young niece, and was told to bring it inside. They kept it in a box for a while until it came round, and it was dragging itself around the box (obviously had a broken back, and one broken front paw, and by the feel of it, its ribs were all smashed up as well). So after the sister-in-law had left with the kids we realised we couldn't leave it and had to deal with it. I couldn't bring myself to whack it with a shovel, and so I put it in a bag, expelled the air, and filled it with the CO2 being expelled by a rather violent wine I have on the go. It stopped breathing after about 20 seconds and a few twitches, and so I think I did what I could. Unfortunately I love animals, and rescue mice from the cat all the time (unharmed, he likes to play with them when he brings them inside) and am now feeling guilty about killing one \"Nazi gas chamber style\". Help! Feed me some reassurance! [Crundy](/wiki/User:Crundy) [Talk nerdy 19:27, 8 November 2009 (UTC) - Here's some: you did everything you could to ensure that the mouse died with as little pain as possible.

Having a quick scan over, it just seems to be St Johns Wort and lysine, so not looking too good so far. They claim that it has been proven in clinical trials, but the only reference I found to this is [on their site](http://www.dynamiclear.com/herpes_clinical_trials.htm) and looks a bit simplistic, as well as not being double-blind and against \"leading brand\" and not a placebo (look under \"Study Synopsis\"). In addition, a few things catch me: 1) Googling the name shows up loads of links which use the name and either \"scam\" or \"hoax\" in the title, but then go on to give a glowing review of it. I suspect the company has deliberately flooded the interwebs with positive reviews to show up when people Google \"Dynamiclear scam\", which is a questionable tactic at best, and 2) Their entire website has a \"antiselect\" javascript code block to stop you copying and pasting data. If this was legit then they would actively encourage people to copy and paste the wonderful data from their site. What do you think?

Here's an example: She will cook a large bowl of rice in the afternoon and then leave it on the worktop until the evening (about 7 hours) before microwaving it and serving it. I have told her that cooked rice needs to go into the fridge within an hour, otherwise you are at a massive risk of contracting bactillius cereus food poisoning. I have shown her health and safety websites which list rice as the number one food for causing food poisoning. So all she has to do is put the bowl in the fridge, right? What's her response? \"Well, I've been doing it for years and I've never become ill\". I hear a lot of people use this argument, \"X is bad for you\", \"Well, it never did me any harm\".

Regarding paranoia, there was an interesting piece of research (that popped up on an older WIGO) stating that it really is the case that people on the right are paranoid. They determined that people who identified as right-wing were more jumpy than those on the left. Although which was the cause and which is the effect still isn't known.

I would suggest to avoid Perl and PHP as I feel these are not really well constructed anymore (the cruft builds up), but that's highly subjective.

Also be sure to find a generic \"computer programming\" book for undergraduates (?), that explains the basics of programming and data structures without any particular programming language in mind. Not because you'll need all this knowledge, but because it makes the experience more rewarding. - BB: What are you learning programming for? If it's for a potential career change then learn C# or Java (unless you want to work in the gaming industry, in which case learn C++), or is it just for fun? If the latter then start with something easy like PHP and make yourself a practice website. The basics you'll pick up will be transferrable, but as someone else said, try and move to something OO. - Pascal. Perfect language<not> to learn on, being - There are some fine lines between \"scripting languages\" and \"programming languages\" but they are not really that important to this discussion. tmtoulouse 02:30, 10 November 2009 (UTC) - - COBOL & FORTRAN are commercially oriented & scientifically oriented respectively -specialists only IMHO. As Pi says, without a reason to learn, you probably won't. Try - @ Pi: I see your point, but I think - Don't \"spring\" for one, use one that is open source. Basically unless you have a reason to learn a language you won't be able to. Computing languages are something you learn through necessity rather than sitting down and studying. First find a project you want to do and then work towards it. - - Learn C & work on from there. Many current languages have their roots in C so you should be able to pick & choose from there on. - I recommend either COBOL or FORTRAN. SmartBASIC for the Coleco Adam is pretty good, too. Not quite a threadjack, but kinda. I could use some programming/web development advice. I haven't touched programming since the 8-bit days. Basically I want to set up an online database, something fairly simple, for interrogating stored texts in plain text format. Any ideas on a good solution to use? It would need to be open source, and something reasonably easy to learn. Help pls! -- [TheEgyptian](/wiki/User:TheEgyptian) 10:09, 10 November 2009 (UTC) - I was being facetious when I suggested Pascal. It amounts to a toy language in my opinion. You may apply disciplined structural style just as well in C, and will still have the freedom to massage your data effectively. Forth seems like another good choice, but it takes discipline to keep from creating write-only code with it.

Contrary to the uninformed opinions of some, Pascal is also a very powerful language, and overall it's my favorite.

If you are looking to get a job based on programming, think about the kinds of settings you want to work in and the needs those employers have. For example, if I wanted to work for a bank or brokerage house then a language like C, C++ or java would be appropriate, as would scripting languages like Python or Perl. In other settings SQL and XQUERY might be more in demand, and if you're into web design then HTTP, AJAX or Flash would be good. Focus on what you want to do, and a little inquiry into the tools used there will guide you. If you're just looking to tinker, try BASIC, Visual Basic or Perl. I'd also look at sites like [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com), which offer great free online tutorials that give you a sense of various languages.

In my World History class yesterday we were discussing Europe and Christianity in the 500-1500 BCE time period, i.e. when Europeans began to study Greek philosophy again and eventually created rationalism. So we were talking about that and I found myself launching into a long and rambling rant about the rationalist viewpoint, complete with snarky attacks on dogmatism, fundamentalism, and creationism. Somehow I ended up talking about creation science, Hovind, and ID. At that point I realized that everyone was looking at me with that \"What the fuck?\" kinda look. It was pretty weird.

This fired up the crowd who felt that big government was telling this family what to do despite their beliefs, and some even saw it as an attack on faith-based healing. Doctors said that non-treatment would be a death sentence, and eventually the boy and his mom returned and agreed to conventional treatments. I'm glad to report that [he's been declared cancer-free](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,572917,00.html?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a16:g4:r3:c0.000000:b28821692:z10) following his final chemo treatment. I feel bad that he was sick in the first place, that he wound up in the media spotlight, and because chemo's certainly an ordeal in itself.

Apparently they passed up several chances over the years to opt out of that coverage, until it was pointed out to Michael Steele, who's moving quickly to make the issue go away. After making sure this coverage was pulled from the House healthcare reform bill, it would be a little awkward going through the Senate vote with that bit of hypocrisy hanging over their heads. What I'd love to know is if there's any way the GOP could be pressured into reporting on how many elective abortions were covered under their plan since 1991 - reporting the total count would not be a violation of anyone's privacy. -- [SpinyNorman](/wiki/User:SpinyNorman) 20:09, 13 November 2009 (UTC) - Such pressure would be counter-productive.

Their argument is that it is not scientific or \"evidence-based.\" I therefore took on the task of writing this 610-page book on many aspects of holistic medicine with over 800 scientific references to prove that holistic medicine is as much \"evidence-based\" and scientific as allopathic medicine - this has been two years in the making.

Be strong big man, plenty more sperm-recepticles in the world and all that. @MDB: Acid isn't as bad as people make out. Anyone who tells you an acid horror story involving demons or fruit (e.g. I thought I was a banana and tried to peel myself) has never taken acid in their lives. To get that kind of trip you'd have to take an A4 sheet. The best thing is to titrate your gear; take half of your tab, wait an hour and assess how fucked you are, and then take the other half if you are still coherent. Works for me. Mainly you'll just find yourself staring at the carpet and giggling rather than screaming about dragons and the floor eating you. - MDB, the highlight of my weekend was finding out my ex-girlfriend has found someone new, and me spending Friday and Saturday night alone getting shitfaced and smoked out of existence - I'm a STUDENT and that was my weekend! - I doubt I'd have the nerve to take acid. Though if I did, the place I saw the play (Greenbelt, MD) would be a good place to find some, I'd imagine. It, along with Takoma Park, is one of most \"hippie\" towns in Maryland. - Buy some acid off some of the kids hanging around outside. - You people make my life seem so boring, mundane and suburban.

This increases interests rates, as they have to pay the money back with interest, and devalues money - what we call inflation. He is right only in a figurative sense. I remember reading somewhere once that if everyone went to the bank and asked for their money we would only have enough legal tender to cover about 1/4 to 1/3 of it any way.

Methods for measuring water hardness almost always look at calcium, magnesium, calcium carbonate, or calcium sulfate concentrations, which seem to be more soluble in water and harder to remove. Water is a polar molecule, so magnetic fields can exert forces on it, but putting a magnet around the pipe results in a field running along the pipe that doesn't change the flow in any significant way. It isn't going to change the flow or behavior of the ions or other dissolved stuff, either.

Yes, please take notes- I wish I could go. Hopefully somebody will ask Andy if he believes that Obama is using mind control techniques to pass health care reform, seeing as how the AAPS, in their fake journal, accused Obama of doing the same to get elected [[5]](http://www.aapsonline.org/newsoftheday/0089). [Corry](/wiki/User:Corry)03:48, 18 November 2009 (UTC) - I would die to see Andy looking over his shoulders waiting for someone to \"block\" a real live person arguing with him... I so hope Rutgers posts video of this event.

He will make a complete ass off himself. - For instance, - * When Pat Sajak had a late night talk show on CBS, Limbaugh guest hosted for him for a week or so. Some people opposed to Limbaugh (gay activists from ACT-UP, I think) managed to get into the audience one night, with the express intent of disrupting things. It got so bad they cleared the entire audience. - * Limbaugh once appeared as a guest on David Letterman's show. Letterman asked him, point blank, \"does it ever occur to you that you're nothing more than a ball of hot gas?\" Limbaugh was speechless. - Just like any bully, when people like Schlafly are confronted and they can't control the situation, they lose quickly and thoroughly.

Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. |\u2014George Bernard Shaw| The first man this made me think of was Andrew Schlafly.

Although the actual efficiency of his editors? No progress obviously, they chase away the worthwhile ones. [SJ](/wiki/User:SuperJosh) [Debaser](/wiki/User_talk:SuperJosh)14:40, 18 November 2009 (UTC) - Andy isn't trying to adapt the world to himself. He's just adapted a virtual one instead.
