Here, an infectious-disease doctor answers many of the most frequently asked questions about the vaccine and children. Although children are [less likely to get ill](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352464220301772?via%3Dihub) from COVID-19 as adults or older adolescents, a small percentage of kids do get sick and even have [severe complications](https://www.vogue.com/article/covid-19-pediatric-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome). A vaccine would decrease the likelihood of this. Furthermore, children under 15 are 26% of the global population\u2014having them vaccinated will be a critical step toward achieving herd immunity. Currently, Pfizer is authorized for older adolescents\u2014age 16 and up. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are only available for those aged 18 and up. For a vaccine to be approved for children, it has to go through the same process as for adults\u2014trials must identify appropriate dosing and demonstrate safety and efficacy. Children are smaller than adults but also fundamentally have different immune systems and vary significantly across ages. Vaccines will need to be tailored and tested appropriately for each age group. Ensuring effectiveness in these trials will be tricky because children infected with this coronavirus do not get sick as frequently as adults. Since it will be difficult to detect whether the vaccine can actually reduce an uncommon event, the trial will use immunogenicity (measuring the amount of antibodies generated) as a proxy for the effective prevention of disease. All vaccine developers have delayed testing in children and adolescents to ensure several months of data showing safety in adults first. Pfizer and BioNTech have already tested their vaccines in younger adolescents aged 12 to 15 years, and those have [demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy.](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal) These results will be submitted for peer review to the FDA and European regulatory bodies for approval Pfizer/BioNTech also [began enrolling in a trial](https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine/additional-population-studies) of healthy younger children (6 months to 11 years) in March 2021. They will be doing all three phases as a single continuous trial (dosing, safety, and efficacy) and plan to enroll more than 4,600 children. Moderna and its partner the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have also been enrolling [adolescents over age 12](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728), as well as children [aged 6 months to 11 years, in](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participants-dosed-phase-23-study-0) a phase 2/3 study, aiming to test 6,700 children. In February, Johnson & Johnson announced it will begin testing its vaccine in children, starting with kids aged 12 to 18 years old first. They are following this immediately with enrolling younger children, including infants and newborns. The technology involved in these vaccines has already been around for years and demonstrated safety in kids and babies for other diseases. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford's vaccine had also announced plans in February 2021 to enroll children aged 6 to 18, but this has just recently been paused as the European regulatory agency reviews reports of rare side effects in adults. This will depend on whether the ongoing trials can show safety and efficacy of the vaccines and then receive regulatory authorization. If all goes well, the vaccines for kids over age 12 may be available as soon as late summer. Kids younger than 12 may not have a vaccine available until late fall or winter at the soonest. Babies may have to wait even longer, into 2022. The question of when and how to open schools for kids is a pressing policy question, given that being away from school harms kids' health and that they can still transmit a significant amount of infection, especially to the adults who would have to work in the schools. The [CDC has provided guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html) for school openings that take into account regional transmission rates and safety measures (e.g., ventilation, masking, and distancing). Recommendations include vaccination for adult educators and staff. But both CDC [and the American Academy of Pediatrics](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/covid-19-planning-considerations-return-to-in-person-education-in-schools/) note that vaccination of children is not necessary for school openings if other effective prevention strategies are in place. So far, the vaccines have been exceedingly safe in adults, with most side effects being mild and tolerable for the vast majority. It is not clear if the same will be true for children. There is, however, a well-established and [rigorous process](https://www.nature.com/articles/pr200452) for approving childhood vaccinations, and COVID-19 vaccine trials will follow a similar path. With these large, well-designed trials that include thousands of children with close monitoring, we will be able to identify the risks and benefits.
