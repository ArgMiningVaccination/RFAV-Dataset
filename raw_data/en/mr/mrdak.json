All organs, cells, and atoms exist as energy, and each structure has its frequency or vibrational energy. Every organ and energy center vibrates and harmonizes with the frequencies of these colors. When different parts of the body deviate from these normal vibrations, one can assume that the body is either infected or possibly not functioning as it should. The vibratory rates ingrained in the crystals are to such an extent that they balance the ailing energy pattern seen in the body. Every organ has an energy level at which it functions perfectly.
