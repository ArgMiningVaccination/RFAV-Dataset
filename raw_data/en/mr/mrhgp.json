We are not aware of any data to suggest that the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19, the disease) causes a relapse of known IBS. All drugs or chemicals cause side effects. It would be most unwise to avoid the vaccine. We know IBS may be very distressing, but it is never fatal. All our specialist clinicians advise people to get vaccinated, as the benefits, (preventing death from COVID), outweigh the risks of worsening of IBS symptoms. If you are feeling anxiety or stress leading up to the vaccination and the thought of venturing out to the vaccination centre is causing a flare-up, try to practice some mindfulness and relaxation techniques to help mitigate some of your symptoms.
