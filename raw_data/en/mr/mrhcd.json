It is frequently used in Chinese medicine. The medicinal compounds of rhodiola rosea come from the root of the plant and have been used to help treat occasional stress, anxiety, mental and physical fatigue, and depressed mood. Verywell / Jessica Olah Uses of Rhodiola Rhodiola has been used for centuries as an herbal medicine to treat a variety of ailments. Research suggests it may aid the following: Aging-related diseases (such as Alzheimer's) Anxiety disorders (such as social anxiety) Depression Fatigue Gastrointestinal distress Nervous system disorders Physical performance Sexual dysfunction Stress Health Benefits of Rhodiola Rhodiola rosea has been classified by some researchers as an adaptogen. Adaptogens are plants that help make the body less prone to physical and emotional stress. Research has shown that rhodiola may stimulate serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine activity. The proper balance of these neurotransmitters is believed to be involved in healthy emotional and neurological functioning. However, more research is needed to confirm the efficacy of rhodiola supplements. Treats Depression Symptoms Rhodiola has antidepressant properties. In a study that compared the effects of rhodiola and the effects of Zoloft (sertraline), researchers found that both medicines reduced symptoms of depression. However, rhodiola was better tolerated and produced fewer side effects. Reduces Stress and Fatigue Rhodiola is an adaptogen, which is a type of plant that helps guide the body's physiological reaction to stress. In other words, rhodiola contains properties that help the body manage stress more resourcefully. Rhodiola may help improve your body's resilience when facing life stressors, fatigue, and burnout. Boosts Physical Performance Rhodiola improves antioxidant activity in the body, and it has been used for centuries to improve physical strength, endurance, and longevity. Helps With Sexual Dysfunction Studies have found that rhodiola may help reduce signs of sexual dysfunction in men (such as erectile dysfunction) and women.

Its anti-cancer properties may even make rhodiola an effective treatment for cancers that occur most often in older people such as cancer of the bladder, breast, colon, kidney, lung, and prostate. However, more research is needed to understand its effectiveness as a treatment for these conditions.
