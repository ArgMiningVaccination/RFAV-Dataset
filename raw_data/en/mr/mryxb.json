Effective event communication is an essential component of IHR (2005) implementation and is a key function performed by National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) and the WHO IHR Contact Point . IHR event communications include public health event reporting, verification, notification, information sharing and risk assessment , which provide the foundations to determine a public health emergency of international concern (PHEI C) and the associated emergency response under the IHR (2005). Timely and transparent communications are fundament al to enabl ing effective responses to public health emergencies, particularly those with international consequences. IHR Exercise Crystal is a modified functional simulation exercise to test IHR communications and has been conducted annually in the WHO Western Pacific Region since 2008 . Simulation exercises are an effective way for Member States to practise and test their IHR capacities, facilitate learning and catalyse continuous improvement of public health emergency preparedness and response systems. In 2020, holding the exercise during an ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic provided an opportunity to test and strengthen systems that are critical to national, regional and international pandemic response. The objectives of IHR Exercise Crystal 2020 were to: 1. Validate the accessibility of IHR NFPs and the WHO IHR Contact Point using registered contact details . 2. Practi se and test the assessment by IHR NFPs of public health events using the decision instrument c ontained in Annex 2 of the IHR (2005), and its notification process , including posting to the IHR Event Information Site (EIS). 3. Facilitate cross -sectoral communication between IHR NFPs and their national counterpart departments on public health event asses sment and response . 4. Improve the understanding and familiarity of staff across Member States, areas and territories and WHO with the IHR NFP system . 5. Use a structured scenario to explore key issues, and identify strengths and areas needing improvement . 6. Test the communication capabilities of Emergency Operations Centres in the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific and IHR NFPs, including telephone, email and videoconferencing. The scenario for IHR Crystal 2020 involved potential adverse events following immunization (AEFI) associated with the use of fictitious, newly developed pandemic vaccine s. It was designed to raise issues in the special context of novel pandemic vaccines around AEFI reporting, risk communication s, vaccine hesitancy , and mai ntaining public confidence in immunization programmes. These issues were acutely relevant in December 2020, as countries around the world prepare d for mass immunization programmes with COVID -19 vaccines. 6 Twenty -seven countries, areas and territories in th e WHO Western Pacific Region participated in the exercise and demonstrated sound understanding of IHR communications and risk assessment for public health events. In 2020, all participating NFPs were able to be contacted via email during the exercise, and 20 were able to be contacted using their registered or alternative telephone number s. Twenty -five participating NFPs were able to verify and communicate the simulated public health event , with 21 continu ing to formally notify WHO of the event and develop t ext for an EIS posting. In addition, 20 NFPs demonstrated multisectoral collaboration with national counterparts during the exercise , with 14 NFPs involving either counterparts from immunization , communications , or both on their exercise team. Feedback from participants was very positive overall. NFPs found that the exercise achieved the stated objectives and the length, pace and difficulty of the exercise were suitable. Some participants commented that more guidance wou ld be appreciated on what is expected from players, and for each \"inject \". The focus of the scenario on pandemic vaccine AEFI was generally well received , although some felt that existing AEFI reporting channels are established through immunization program mes and do not involve the NFP. However , there was recognition that the IHR communication channel could play a role in rapidly sharing information about AEFI with the international community - particularly in the context of new pandemic vaccines that will be globally distributed. Many participants also commented that they found the scenario very useful in helping to explore issues and prepare for the upcoming use of COVID -19 pandemic vaccines. The following recommendations were suggested to improve future runs of IHR Exercise Crystal and IHR communications for NFPs and the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific: NFP contact details, including mobile numbers, should be updated more regularly , and NFPs should consider using generic email address es for IHR event communications rather than personal email addresses. In addition to IHR Exercise Crystal, updating contact details may also be linked to the annual submission by NFPs of the State Party self -assessment reporting tool, or WHO may consider imp lementing a regular schedule (e.g. every six months) to contact NFPs to confirm and update contact details. NFPs and Member States are encouraged to use simulation exercises as useful tools to practise, test and train IHR core capacities for public health emergency preparedness and response and to encourage multisectoral collaboration. NFPs are encouraged to provide training to new staff on Member State responsibilities under the IHR (2005) and formal IHR processes for notification, assessment and informati on sharing. The IHR communications channel may have a role to play in facilitating rapid information sharing on AEFI in the specific context of a PHEIC. WHO at regional or global level should consider developing a white paper or proposal on this issue fo r discussion with Member States ahead of COVID -19 vaccine roll -out. The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific should alert NFPs to the type of event used in the exercise scenario (e.g. disease outbreak, food safety, nuclear, chemical, vaccine safety) ahead of time, to enable NFPs to invite staff from relevant counterpart agencies to join the exercise. 7 The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific should continue to conduct IHR Exercise Crystal on an annual basis, and may consider including components to test communications between NFPs, in addition to communications between NFPs and WHO, in future exercises. 8 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 IHR event communications Timely and accurate information communication is critical to detecting and responding to public health events effectively. In the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific and South -East Asia Regions, t he Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (APSED III)1 has been developed as a common framework for action to advance implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005)2 for health security. Effective event communication is a key function performed by National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) and the WHO IHR Contact Point , and is an essential component of IHR (2005) implementation. IHR event communications include public health event reporting, verification, notification, information sharing and risk assessme nt using the decision -making instrument in Annex 2 of IHR (2005). It may also involve official communications required for the determination of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and the associated emergency response under the IHR (2005). 1.2 IHR Exercise Crystal Simulation exercises are one of the four components of the I HR (2005) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework ,3 alongside annual reporting, joint external evaluations and after -action reviews. Experience has shown that simulation exercises are an effective way for Member States to practise and test their IHR capacities , facilitate learning and catalyse continuous improvement of public health emergency preparedness and response systems. IHR Exercise Crystal is a modified functional simulation exercise to test IHR communications. In the Western Pacific Region, IHR Exercise Crystal has been conducted annually since 2008 (with the exception of 2009) to maintain and strength en the functions of NFPs in the Region and to improve communication between NFPs and the WHO IHR Contact Point . The 20 20 exercise represented the latest iteration of this process and was aimed at furthering collaboration across the Region and familiari zing participants with their responsibilities and obligations under the IHR (2005). The only year that Exercise Crystal has not been held was 2009, when the world was responding to pandemic influenza A (H1N1). In December 2020 the world was again responding to an ongoing pandemic, this time of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). The decision to hold the exercise at this time was taken because of the opportunity it presented to test and strengthen systems that are critical 1 Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies: advancing implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). Manila: World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific; 2017 (https://iris.wpro.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665.1/13654/9789290618171 -eng.pdf ). 2 International Health Regulations edition. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2016 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241580496 ). 3 International health Regulations (2005): IHR Monitoring and - framework ). 9 to national, regional and international pandemic response. Timely and transparent event communications have been repeatedly proven to be fundamental to effective responses to public health emergencies, parti cularly those with international consequences. The scenario for IHR Exercise Crystal 2020 focused on potential adverse events following immuni zation (AEFI) associated with newly developed vaccines for a ficti tious pandemic virus. Vaccination is a proven, simple and effective way to protect people against infectious diseases and will be a key public health tool to combat th e COVID -19 pandemic and others to come. Currently, over 100 COVID -19 vaccine candidates are being developed , trialled and approved at an unprecedented pace to address the global crisis. Although these vaccines are being developed according to the same safety standards as other vaccines, public perception, trust and acceptance must be carefully considered and managed. Given the potential for global consequences, pandemic vaccine safety events - whether real or coincidental - should be managed quickly and transparently , and coordinated with the global public healt h community. This will require the combined efforts of many different agencies, organizations and institutions from numerous fields. 1.3 Objectives The objectives of IHR Exercise Crystal 2020 were to: 1. Validate the accessibility of IHR NFPs and the WHO IHR Contact Point using registered contact details . 2. Practi se and test the assessment by IHR NFPs of public health events using the decision instrument contained in Annex 2 of the IHR (2005), and its notifi cation process , including posting to the IHR Event Information Site (EIS) . 3. Facilitate cross -sectoral communication between IHR NFPs and their national counterpart departments on public health event assessment and response . 4. Improve the understanding and fam iliarity of staff across Member States, areas and territories and WHO with the IHR communication system . 5. Use a structured scenario to explore key issues, and identify strengths and areas needing improvement . 6. Test the communication capabilities of Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) in the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific and IHR NFPs, including telephone, email and videoconferencing. 10 2. METHODOLOGY 2.1 Scope The scope of IHR Exercise Crystal 2020 was to test the capabilities of IHR NFPs and WHO in the Western Pacific Region to assess and communicate information on AEFI with a number of hypothetical pandemic vaccines, based on IHR (2005) principles. The exercise also tested the process of communication and coordination with relevant counterparts (immunization and risk communications) within participating countries, areas and territories, and the process of sharing information with other Member States through the WHO EIS and Disease Outbreak News (DON) platforms. 2.2 Exercise type As in previous years, IHR Exercise Crystal 20 20 was a modified functional exercise, requiring NFPs to respond to incoming simulated event information and requests in real time. Participants received \"injects \" of information via email that described the scenario of a potential public health event developing first in another country, and then in their own country, area or territory. The injects were in the format of simulated news reports and social media feeds, and emails from a local public health unit, national immunization counterparts and the WHO IHR Contact Point. During the exercise WHO IHR Duty Of ficers also contact ed NFPs with requests to receive and share information on the developing event. The exercise required NFP s to simulate the actions they would perform in a real event , given the information available . 2.3 Players All countries , areas and territories in the WHO Western Pacific Region were invited to join the 20 20 exercise. Despite the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, NFPs from 30 countries, areas and territories indicated that they would participate as players in the exercise . Given the range of time zones across the Region and the number of participants , players were divided into two groups and participated on separate days - 9 December ( Day 1 ) for Pacific island countries and areas (PICs) and Papua New Guinea ; and 10 December ( Day 2 ) for other Member States and special administrative regions. NFP players joined the exercise from an EOC or other appropriate venue in their own country. Email was t he primary means of communication , and telephone was used to check accessibility and troub leshoot. Most countries involved teams of three or more staff from relevant departments, with an average of 16 staff in their exercise teams . WHO country office staff also joined their national counterparts in some countries during the exercise to provide necessary technical support. For the purposes of exercise play, IHR Focal Points from territories, areas and special administrative regions were requested to communicate directly with the WHO IHR Contact Point instead of via their respective Member State NFP. NFPs from WHO Member States played their own role during the 11 exercise, communicating with the WHO IHR Contact Point , as they would in response to a real -life public health event. WHO IHR Duty Officers also participated in the exercise as playe rs, in order to practi se communication between NFPs and the WHO IHR Contact Point. Exercise team at the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific during exercise play. 12 13 14 IHR National Focal Point players and their colleagues discussing and responding to the exercise scenario . 15 16 2.4 Exercise Management Team The exercise was developed and conducted by a n Exercise Management Team from the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacifi c. Exercise Control managed the scenario and sequence of events by sending exercise start and stop messages, injects and scenario context (background material, media reports, articles , etc.), and also monitored the progress of the exercise. Simulators provid ed information to NFP players on the role of national counterparts in immunization and risk communications . Facilitators from WHO country offices supported communication between their counterpart NFP and W HO if needed. Evaluators observed and evaluated the process and outcomes of the exercise. Monitors performed a communications check with each participating NFP during the exercise , and monitored email communications to track progress of the exercise. Administration and IT provided logistical support for the exercise. Due to travel restrictions and social distancing requirements during the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, the Exercise Management Team was dispersed over a number of physical and virtual locations. Online messaging and meet ing applications were used by the team to keep in contact with each other throughout the exercise. 2.5 Exercise design Building on feedback from previous exercises, the 2020 exercise was presented in slightly different formats for the different participant groups. On Day 1 with PICs and Papua New Guinea participating, the exercise was presented in four phases . At the start of each phase, participants were sent a single batch of content for the phase ( scenario information and injects ) and list of tasks to complete. This format had been used in the 2019 exercise and feedback received from players included comment s on the helpfulness of the task list and the ability for participants to set the pace for exercise play. On Day 2 with other Member States and special administrative regions participating, the exercise was presented in a more traditional functional exercis e style. The pace of the exercise was set by Exercise Control , which sent individual injects and scenario content to players at pre -determined times. This format ha d been used in the majority of previous exercises and is generally found to be more challeng ing. Throughout the exercise, scenario information and injects were sent to NFP players from Exercise Control (either in phases or individually). The in jects were designed to elicit actions from NFPs , including: contacting the WHO IHR Contact Point for ev ent information; contacting national counterparts in 17 immunization and risk communication s for information on public health actions; completing a risk assessment; and sharing information with WHO via email and text for posts to the EIS and DON. Simulators p layed the role of national counterparts in immunization and risk communication s by answering requests for information from NFPs. WHO IHR Duty Officers filled the role of the WHO IHR Contact Point by providing, receiving and requesting event information from NFPs. 2.6 Scenario The fictitious scenario for IHR Crystal 2020 involved deaths potentially associated with recent vaccination with newly developed pandemic vaccine s. It was designed to raise issues in the special context of novel pandemic vaccines around reporting of AEFI, risk communications, vaccine hesitancy , and maintaining public confidence in immunization programmes. These issue s were acutely relevant in December 2020 as countries around the world prepare d for mass immunization programmes with the first available COVID -19 vaccines. The scenario was set in the year 2025 , with the world experiencing a pandemic of a \"novel respirat ory virus\". At the start of the exercise, background information on the pandemic and development of vaccines was shared. Exercise play opened with news reports of deaths potentiall y associated with pandemic vaccines in \"Country X \", an unspecified country in the WHO Western Pacific Region . This was followed by reports from the participants ' own country (or area/territory) of deaths in people recently vaccinated with a pandemic vaccine, a verification request from WHO , and increasing misi nformation and anti -vaccination sentiments circulating on social media . The scenario then followed the AEFI investigation in the participants' own country (or area/territory) by their national immunization counterparts, which finally conclude d that the dea ths were coincidental to use of pandemic vaccines. The scenario required NFPs to conduct a risk assessment and event notification, and to coordinate information with counterparts in immunization and risk communication s, and share information with WHO. AEFI reporting for non -pandemic immunizations is typically handled by national immunization programmes, which are outside of the IHR communications channel. In a pandemic , vaccination will be a high international priority with new, globally distributed vaccines that will not have fully established safety profiles . In this special context, the IHR communications channel is a useful and valid means to rapidly share information that may affect pandemic immunization programmes around the world . Importantly, it will also enable public health authorities to communicate early and transparently with the public. 2.7 Exercise conduct An email inviting NFPs to participate in IHR Exercise Crystal 2020 was sent on 7 October 2020 using contact details registered in the NFP database (as of 4 October 2020). A subsequent email to confirm participation was sent on 7 November 2020 . On 5 December , NFP participants were sent a final preparatory email which includ ed the following documents for information: 18 Briefing for National IHR Focal Points Participant s Guide Contacts List National IHR Focal Point Guide and link to access Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) . NFP participants were alerted through the pre -exercise emails that the scenario for IHR Exercise Crystal 2020 would involve a fictitious pandemic vaccine. As o ne of the objectives of the exercise wa s to facilitate cross -sectoral communication between N FPs and relevant national counterparts on public health event assessment and response , NFPs were asked to also invite relevant staff from national immunization programmes, pandemic preparedness and risk communications to participate. Briefings were also provided t o the WHO Exercise Management Team and other WHO support staff to prepare them for their exercise roles. The exercise was held over two days for two groups of participants. T he exercise ran for five hours on each day, covering four hours of exercise play and a one -hour \"hotwash \" debriefing session to discuss key issues (Table 1) . Table 1.

WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific 09:00 - 14:00 On both days, a pre -exercise message was emailed to participants 30 minutes before the start of the exercise. The pre -exercise message welcomed participants to the exercise, provided reminders of exercise rules, and included an introduction briefing, problem log and EIS posting template. During the exercise , injects were e mailed to NFP participants by Exercise Control (Day 1) and Exercise Control, the WHO IHR Contact Point and Simulators (Day 2). 19 The majority of communication between NFPs and WHO during exercise play was conducted via email. In addition to official email addresses, 16 countries and areas (53%) also requested additional emails to be used for the purposes of the exercise . WHO staff also called each NFP on their registered telephone number to check accessibility and confirm registered contact details. At the end of exercise play on both days, a one -hour hotwash debriefing session was held by videoconference to discuss key issues that were raised. This session also allowed the videoconferencing capacities of NFP offices and WHO to be tested. 20 2.8 Feedback and evaluation For the purposes of evaluation, feedback from participants about their experience with the exercise was obtained through: 1. NFP participant hotwash debrief, held immediately after each day of the exercise via videoconference (virtual polls and discussion); 2. evaluation forms submitted by NFP participants after the exercise; 3. Exercise Management Team debrief, held in the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office and via videoconference after each day of the exercise; 4. feedback forms submitted by WHO staff after the exercise; and 5. observations from the designated exercise evaluators. Screen -capture of debrief session using videoconferencing among exercise participants . 21 3. FINDINGS 3.1 Exercise participation Of the 37 countries , areas and territories in the WHO Western Pacific Region that were invited to participate in the exercise, 30 (81%) confirmed that they would participate and 2 7 (80%) actually participated in the exercise (10 on Day 1 and 15 on Day 2) . One countr y was unable to participate due to staffing shortages and two territories were unable to participate for unspecified reasons. Two other countries began the exercise, but dropped out due to competing priorities (inc luding responding to a real-life public health event). 3.2 Accessibility of registered NFP contact details One of the primary objectives of IHR Exercise Crystal is to verify the accessibility of NFPs using their registered contact details. Conducting the exercise annually provides a check of whether the NFP Contact Point database is up to date. Under IHR (2005 ), an NFP is designated by each Member State and should be accessible through registered contact details at all times. The NFP Contact Point database was used for the initial identification of email addresses and telephone numbers before the exerc ise. Of t he 30 NFPs who confirmed participation, two updated or corrected their registered contact details and 16 (53%) provided additional email addresses to be copied for the purposes of the exercise. Twenty NFPs ( 74% of participa nts) were able to be contacted by their registered telephone number o r by an alternative telephone number provided. The reasons for failed contact included telephone numbers unable to be connected, not answered, out of service , or incorrect (e.g. connected to an operator/general number). All 27 participating countries, areas and territories could be contacted by email , although for some the frequency of messages appeared to be correlated with the stability and speed of internet connections. Delays in receiving emails , or email rejection , were experienced by some countries and areas . Emails were rejected due to full mailboxes, or the sender (Exercise Control: wprocontrol@who.int ) not being on an approved sender list. The two territories that did n ot participate for unspecified reasons were also unable to be contacted by telephone or email on the day of the exercise. It therefore seems likely that technical communication issues c ontributed to their non-participation . 22 3.3 Event notification and EIS posting The second objective of the exercise was to practise and test the assessment of public health events by NFPs using the decision instrument in Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) and its notification process , including posting to the IHR EIS. During the exercise NFPs conducted this assessment by analysing simulated information from multiple sources , including: AEFI reporting and investigation data shared by the simulated national immunization programme in their country ; information shared by the WHO IHR Contact Point; news and social media reports; and simulated WHO publications. Apart from two NFPs who dropped out at the start of the exercise, the remaining 25 participating NFPs were able to verify and communicate the simulated public health event to the WHO IHR Contact Point. Twenty -one (8 4%) of these NFPs also continued to formally notify WHO of the event and develop ed text for an EIS posting. Eleven (44%) fully participating NFPs were later also able to draft text fo r a post to the DON to share information on the findings of the AEFI investigation. Five countries did not notify WHO of the event. In two cases, this was because they did not assess the event - potential deaths following vaccination with a pandemic vacci ne - as meeting at least two of the decision criteria4 for notification to WHO under the IHR. A summary of successful IHR notifications and EIS postings by participating countries , areas and territories in IHR Exercise Crystal exercises is shown in Table 2 below. Table 2. Summary of completed IHR notifications and EIS postings by participating countries , areas and territories in IHR Exercise Crystal (2008 -2020) Year Number of participating countries, areas and territories Number completed IHR notification Number submitted EIS posting 2008 23 - - 2009 Not conducted 2010 21 - - 2011 18 5 9 2012 21 15 12 2013 23 18 17 2014 11 10 10 2015 21 21 20 2016 28 22 21 2017 30 26 24 2018 29 26 24 2019 14 14 14 2020 27 21 21 4 The four decision criteria to be used by States Parties in their assessment of a public health event are: (1) the seriousness of the event's public health impact; (2) the unusual or unexpected nature of the event; (3) the risk of international disease spread; and (4) the risk that travel or trade restrictions will be imposed by other countries. 23 3.4 Cross -sectoral event communication An efficient and effective response to a public health event always requires multisectoral communication, collaboration and coordination. NFPs play a vital role in facilitat ing rapid information sharing and event communication at national level with relevant sectors of the government. In IHR Exercise Crystal 20 20, the scenario of serious AEFI (deaths) following use of a pandemic vaccine required NFPs to collaborate with national counterparts in immunization to coordinate information, and with counterparts in risk communication s to coordinate public messages and to address rumours and misinformation. Prior to the exercise , the exercise organi zers alerted NFPs that the scenario would focus on potential AEFI with a fictitious pandemic vaccine for a novel respiratory virus , and sugg ested that NFPs involve representatives from national immunization programme s, pandemic preparedness, risk communication s or national regulatory authorit ies in their exercise teams. During the exercise, NFPs were also able to coordinate with these counterp arts by contacting the Simulator. Overall, 20 out of 25 NFPs (80%) that participated fully in the exercise collaborated with these counterparts during the exercise - either through joining the exercise directly, or through contacting the Simulator. Encour agingly, 50% of respondents to post -exercise feedback reported having representatives from both immunization and risk communications on their exercise team. A further 37.5% of respondents reported having representatives from either immunization or communications. 3.5 Understanding and familiarity of staff with IHR NFP system Since 2008, IHR Exercise Crystal has contribu ted to an improved understanding and familiarity of the IHR NFP system for staff across Member States and within WHO ; the participa nts in this year's exercise demonstrated a sound understanding of the system. In 2020 the exercise was held during the COVID - 19 pandemic - an ongoing global public health event - to which NFP offices ha d been responding to most of the year. Although most staff would by now be familiar with their roles, the exercise was also a good opportunity for new staff to test their kn owledge in a safe environment, and for more experienced staff to practi se the event communications process, rapid decision -making and joint response in a new context. The scenario in 2020 was the first to involve AEFI. This caused confusion for some parti cipants, as NFPs in many Member States do not have a defined role in AEFI reporting - particularly of domestic events. However , participants were able to apply IHR communications principles to this new scenario and complete the exercise tasks. The ability to transpose IHR communication principles into new contexts may prove valuable in real life, if the IHR communication channel is utili zed for public health emergencies outside of its traditional scope. 24 3.6 Testing videoconference capability In common with previous Crystal events, the exercise concluded with a hotwash debriefing session conducted by videoconferenc e. Zoom has been used since 2017 and has proved to be an accessible and reliable platform for the Region . The platform is not subjec t to regional or locali zed filtering , which allowed all NFPs from the Region to join. Although the internet requirements were still high for some participants - particularly those from PICs - the capability of NFPs to join and maintain a connection to the one -hour hotwash continues to improve each year. In normal circumstances , IHR Exercise Crystal is r un by a large team of up to 40 WHO staff based in the EOC of the Regional Office in Manila, Philippines. This year , in order to follow social distancing protocols, and with many staff unable to be physically present in the Regional Office due to travel res trictions or quarantine requirements, a constant Zoom feed was used to connect the Exercise Management Team. Staff were connected from four separate rooms within the Regional Office, and from multiple individual locations across Manila, the Pacific and the United States. Smaller groups (e.g. Exercise Control) also held separate discussions using other platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Whats App. Remote working led to some delays in identifying and resolving problems, but the exercise was still able to be managed to a very high standard. 3.7 Feedback and evaluation NFP participants who joined the hotwash were able to provide direct verbal feedback on the exercise to the Exercise Management Team. The Mentimeter platform was also used during the hotwash to run live polls, and to capture feedback on the exercise and the status of pandemic vaccine planning in Member States. Participants were also asked to complete and submit an exercise evaluation form, and asked whether their immunization and/or communications counterparts had participated in the exercise. Overall , participants who provided feedback found that the exercise achieved the stated objectives and that the length, pace and difficulty of the exercise were suitable. Some participants commented that more guidance would be appreciated on what is expected from player s, and for each inject. Although the Participant s Guide was circulated the week prior to the exercise, sharing the guide earlier and conducting other activities such as briefings and webinars could be helpful to prepare NFPs for exercise play. The focus of the scenario on pandemic vaccine AEFI was well received by some participants, but less well by others. To some participants, AEFI is a domestic rather than international issue and t herefore does not involve the NFP. Others felt that existing AEFI reporting channels are established through immunization programmes , and that the IHR channel is not needed to communicate AEFI. However, many participants also commented that they found the scenario very useful in helping to explore issues and prepare for the upcoming use of COVID -19 pandemic vaccines. There was also recognition from some participants that the IHR communication channel could play a role in rapidly sharing information about AEFI with the international community - particularly in the cont ext of new pandemic vaccines that will be globally distributed. 25 3.8 Limitations Consistent with previous years , the exercise focused on IHR communications between NFPs and the WHO IHR Contact Point. The exercise did not allow for IHR communications between countries, which is an important part of real -life IHR communications. This issue has been noted in the past, and remains a challenge for future exercises. The ongoi ng COVID -19 pandemic was expected to result in reduced participation and/or intensity in the 2020 exercise , but this did not prove to be the case . Although not all teams were able to play to full capacity, the number of participating NFPs remained high, with 21 countries and areas participating , compared to 14 in 20 19. 26 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4.1 Conclusions The following conclusions are based on the observations, feedback and evaluation comments from exercise participants and exercise evaluators: IHR Crystal 2020 provided an opportunity for NFPs to review their internal IHR (2005) notification procedures, and review how they communicate with counterparts in immunization and risk communication s. With several successful COVID -19 vaccine candidates currently completing development and approval, this was a timely opportunity to practi se reporting and communication processes that may be tested in the near future. The exercise continues to provide an opportunity for NFPs to enhance t he understanding of their staff on the IHR (2005), event communications and collaboration among sectors. It also provides an opportunity to facilitate in -country, cross -sectoral communication with national counterparts and raise awareness of the NFP role a nd function. The different formats used to run the exercise on Day 1 (phased approach) and Day 2 (traditional injects) was not communicated to participants, but did appear to suit the majority of NFPs. In the future, th e distinction between the two days c ould be made clear and NFPs given a choice of which day/format to join. The use and accessibility of videoconferencing during and after the exercise demonstrate that the technology is now largely routine and improves the a bility of Member States and WHO t o communicate effectively. Alerting NFPs to the nature of the public health threat in the scenario ahead of time will allow them to invite appropriate representatives from other sectors to participate. Although this will diminish the \"surprise \" factor, it will much better s upport multisectoral collaboration and familiari zation with the NFP function, as well as the whole -of-government/ -society approach to public health emergency response. 4.2 Recommendations The following recommendations are suggested to improve future runs of IHR Exercise Crystal and IHR communications for NFPs and the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific: NFP contact details, including mobile numbers, should be updated more regularly and NFPs should consider using generic email address es for IHR event communications rather than personal email addresses. In addition to IHR Exercise Crystal, updating contact details may also be linked to the annual submission by NFPs of the State Party self -assessment reporting tool, or WHO may consider implementing a regular schedule (e.g. every six months) to contact NFPs to confirm and update contact details. 27 NFPs and Membe r States are encouraged to use simulation exercises as useful tools to practise, test and train IHR core capacities for public health emergency preparedness and response and to encourage multisectoral collaboration. NFPs are encouraged to provide training to new staff on Member State responsibilities under the IHR (2005) and formal IHR processes for notification, assessment and information sharing. The IHR communications channel may have a role to play in facilitating rapid information sharing on AEFI in the speci fic context of a PHEIC. WHO at regional or global level should consider developing a white paper or proposal on this issue, for discussion with Member States ahead of COVID -19 vaccine roll -out. The WHO Western Pacific Regional Office should alert NFPs to the type of event used in the exercise scenario (e.g. disease outbreak, food safety, nuclear, chemical, vaccine safety) ahead of time, to enable NFPs to invite staff from relevant counterpart agencies to join the exercise. The WHO Western Pacific Regional Office should continue to conduct IHR Exercise Crystal on an annual basis, and may consider includ ing components to test communications between NFPs, in addition to communications between NFPs and WHO , in future exercises. 28 REFERENCES 1.

Effective event communication between National IHR Focal Points (IHR NFPs) and the WHO IHR Contact Point is an essentia l component of IHR implementation and facilitates timely risk assessment, decision -making and response. IHR event communication includes public health event reporting, verification, notification, information sharing and risk assessment using the instrument in Annex 2 of the IHR (2005). It may also involve official communications required to determine if an event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and the associated emergency response under the IHR (2005). Simulation exer cises are one of the four components of the global International Health Regulations (2005) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework , alongside States Parties self -assessment annual reporting, joint external evaluations and after -action reviews. Experience has s hown that simulation exercises are an effective way for Member States to practise and test their IHR capacities, to facilitate learning and to catalyse continuous improvement of their public health emergency preparedness and response systems. To maintain and strengthen the functions of IHR NFPs, IHR Exercise Crystal has been conducted in the WHO Western Pacific Region annually since 20085 as an IHR communications and assessment exercise involving IHR NFPs and the WHO IHR Contact Point. In 2020, the exercise will be held during the ongoing coronavirus 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic - which together with other real events such as the influenza A (H1N1) pande mic of 2009, influenza A (H7N9) in 2013, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak of 2015 - continue to highlight the importance of IHR communications in contributing to risk assessment , information sharing and situation monitoring, regiona lly and globally. IHR Exercise Crystal 2020 will be conducted over two days from 9-10 December, involving Member States, areas and territories of the WHO Western Pacific Region. WHO country office staff will support participants where appropriate. Each Member State, area or territory will participate on one day . On each day the exercise will run for four hours with an additional hour for debriefing. 5 With the exception of 2009, due to the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. Why \"Crystal\"? Because crystals are valuable and transparent - just like IHR communication 33 OBJECTIVES The objectives of the IHR Exercise Crystal 2020 are to: 1. validate the acce ssibility of IHR NFPs and the WHO IHR Contact Point using registered contact details; 2. practi se and test the assessment by IHR NFPs of public health events using the decision -making instrument contained in Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) and its notification process; including posting to the IHR Event Information Site (EIS); 3. facilitate cross -sectoral communication between IHR NFPs and their national counterpart departments on public health event assessment and response; 4. improve the understanding and familiarity of staff across Member States, areas, territories and WHO with the IHR NFP system; 5. use a structured scenario to explore key issues, and identify strengths and areas needing improvement; and 6. test the communications capabilities of Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) of the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific and IHR NFPs, including telephone, email and videoconferencing. SCOPE AND TYPE OF EXERCISE IHR Exercise Crystal is a functional exercise, requiring participants to respond in real time to incoming information about a public health event and undertake simulated emergency functions that would reflect their role in an actual developing situation. The exercise is designed to test communications functions of IHR NFPs including information sharing, risk assessment, and decision -making during a simulated public health event. EXERCISE SCENARIO AND DESIGN In 2020 , Exercise Crystal is being held during an ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic. Vaccination is a proven, simple and effective way to protect people against infectious diseases and will be key public health tool to combat this p andemic and others to come. Currently, over one hundred COVID - 19 vaccine candidates are being developed at unprecedented pace to address the global crisis. Although these vaccines are being developed to the same safety standards of other vaccines, public p erception, trust and acceptance must be carefully considered and managed. Given the potential for global consequences, 34 pandemic vaccine safety events - whether real or coincidental - should be managed quickly, transparently and coordinated with the global public health community. This year, the scenario of Exercise Crystal will focus on potential adverse events following immunization (AEFI) with a fictitious pandemic vaccine for a novel respiratory virus that has caused a global pandemic. No technical knowledge of vaccines is required on the part of the IHR NFP to participate in the exercise , and we will not be dealing with issues that are not the role of the IHR NFP . However, we would suggest that you consider including r epresentatives from your national immunization programme , pandemic preparedness, risk communication or national regulatory authority in order to share their expertise of the processes in place to identify, report , communicate and investigate AEFI in your country, area or territory. Furthe r information about the development of COVID -19 vaccines (including Q&As on vaccines and vaccine safety) can be found on the WHO website at https://www.who.in t/emergencies/diseases/novel -coronavirus -2019/covid -19- vaccines . During the exercise , you will receive a number of detailed communications (injects) which will provide information on the evolving scenario , as well as tasks that you must work through withi n your own domestic context. As you receive each inject containing new information, consider what you would do if this were a real -life event and who you would contact, in line with the IHR (2005) and your own national policies and procedures. Exercise play will take four hours in real time. This will be used to simulate a period of four weeks in the scenario. Simulated times and dates will be communicated in the injects, so please read these carefully. Exercise play will be followed by a one- hour 'hotwash' debrief to discuss the exercise and share lessons for improvement. The exercise will use a simulated, artificial scenario that may not reflect a real- world situation, particularly with respect to elapsed time, and names of places or people. Participants should accept these artificialities. Please do not be overly concerned with issues associated with the scenario itself. The objective is to work with the scen ario to facilitate your actions, rather than to challenge it or seek to resolve every possible detail. Remember that this is a simulation exercise. There are no right or wrong answers and individual performance is not being tested. The aim of the exercise is to provide a safe environment for institution al learn ing by identifying strengths and areas for improvement, and thus help to prepare for a real emergency. REMEMBER the focus of the Exercise is to test IHR communication, not technical expertise on vaccines or immunology. However, it may be useful to familiarize yourself with the structures in place in your country/area/territory and key conc epts. 35 HOW THE EXERCISE WILL BE CONDUCTED Participants have been divided into two groups, with Group 1 participating on Wednesday 9 December, and Group 2 participating on Thursday 10 December. Please see Annex B for groups and the local exercise time for each country, area and territory. Participants should join the exercise at an appropriate venue in their own location, such as an Emergency Operations Centre. Email will be th e primary means of communication during the exercise, with telephone used to check communication and troubleshoot. A videoconference using Zoom will be held immediately after exercise play for a 'hotwash' debrief (see Annex E for a guide on how to connect using Zoom). During the exercise participants should act, communicate and facilitate information flow in a timely manner, as they would in a real-world setting. Participants can expect to have between 20 and 40 minutes to address each inject. Timing may vary based on the complexity of the situation or the expected response. Time for problem -solving and action will be limited to the time allotted to each inject. No extra time will be available and new injects may arrive bef ore participants have completed the previous task. Do not attempt to produce complicated reports, as these are not expected within the time frame - bullet points are sufficient for most required tasks. A one -hour 'hotwash' debrief ing will be held via Zoom videoconference immediately after exercise play. If you cannot connect via videoconference (e.g. slow internet speed), the Regional Office can bridge you to the hotwash by telephone.

Scenario caveats This exercise uses a simulated, artificial scenario that may not r eflect a real -world situation particularly with regard to elapsed time. All names of places, people and vaccine products are fictious. Summary: First reported in humans in June 2024, a novel respiratory virus - NORESPV - has spread across the world resul ting in a pandemic and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by WHO. By October 2025 several successful NORESPV pandemic vaccines have been developed. Two of these have been approved by all national regulatory author ities in the Region, including in your country, and begin to be used in your national pandemic vaccination programme. In November 2025, a number of deaths following vaccination against the NORESPV virus are reported from Country X - a country in the WHO Western Pacific Region. In December 2025, enhanced pandemic immunization safety surveillance in your country also detects nine deaths in people who were recently vaccinated against NORESPV. Growing public concerns about vaccine safety is impacting uptake o f the NORESPV vaccines and, may have an impact on other immuni zation programmes. Your Minister of Health (or equivalent) is coming under increasing pressure on social media to take action. The national pandemic vaccination programme is temporarily suspende d as an investigation is conducted. 49 Scenario outline Phase Inject Description / Expected actions From To Phase 0 - Background 45 mins Context - development of pandemic Apr 2024. NORESPV - a novel respiratory virus - is first detected in pigs on farms in Asia. Jun 2024 . The first human cases of NORESPV infection are reported in farm and abattoir workers. Jul 2024. The NORESPV virus is isolated and the data made available to scientists and vaccine manufacturers worldwide. Aug 2024 . Human cases of NORESPV have been reported from six countries, including three in the WHO Western Pacific Region. The virus is initially reported in people working w ith pigs, but soon spreads and is detected in household contacts, health care workers and community contacts. It appears to cause moderate to severe illness in the majority of infected people, with common symptoms including respiratory distress, fever and confusion. The NORESPV outbreak is declared a PHEIC by the WHO Director General at the end of August 2024. Oct 2024. NORESPV has spread globally to every continent. Higher infection rates are being reported in healthcare workers and people working in pig farming, transport and processing. The risk of serious disease appears to increase with age, and roughly 80% of deaths are recorded in people aged 65 and older. Underlying health conditions also increase the risk of serious disease, with lung disease, hea rt disease, diabetes and weakened immune systems commonly reported in hospitali zed patients. Work on vaccine development accelerates. Exercise Control All Context - vaccine development Jul 2025. Several vaccine candidates have reached phase 3 clinical t rials.

Summary of participant feedback and key statistics Participant feedback Selected g eneral comments \"This exercise is very realistic and practical. We find the tool and protocol the exercise provided are useful.\" \"Thank you very much for the excellent scenario and coordination. We gained many important ideas from the exercise.\" \"The exercise done was really helpful as it will help countries to prepare themselves ready in terms of planning, coordination towards role out of the new vaccine in the country. WHO should do more of this exercise as this type of scenario/exercise can be adapted into local country context for preparation and decision -making in terms of health of the population.\" \"Response from team members helped the exercise Identified strengths in preparation for real emergency .\" \"Appreciate thes e annual events and the learning opportunities it provides .\" Selected comments on the exercise scenario \"The scenario of possible vaccine panic is interesting. We take this chance to refresh ourselves with the local plan in managing the communication respo nse to adverse event following immunization (AEFI).\" \"In XX, NFP has a nominal role in domestic adverse event reporting as there is already a system in place for this that involves multiple parties and established SOPs.\" \"We were able to test the IHR communications but there was confusion as to the focus on AEFI reporting. This is not an area that IHR NFP works on here in XX and it is the responsibility of NIP through established mechanisms.\" Selected comments on areas of learning \"Allowed the NFP team to demonstrate how the IHR communication network functions and the relationship it has to their work.\" \"We were able to practise event -related communications through the exercise and identify and gaps that we can work to addr ess.\" \"Sharing of AEFI information between countries is important as it will help countries to understand and the situation and make decisions that will have positive impact to the people and the country as a whole.\" \"Facilitate the communication between I HR NFP and other facilities at national level.\" \"Internal mandate of the country regarding this scenario were reviewed \" \"Communication between N FPs and the immunization and risk communication team \" \"How to deal with social media and fake news.\" 72 Summary of s uggestions for future exercises More time and support to prepare NFP participants - e.g. sharing the Participants Guide earlier, conducting an exercise training/briefing before the exercise, more clarity in instructions. Define and share the exercise scope/scenario earlier to allow NFPs to engage and invite participants from relevant sectors. More interactive communication between players, and communications between NFPs. Consider including elements on interference with international travel or trade as well as public health measures at points of entry . Cross -sectoral participation As one of the objectives of the exercise was to facilitate cross -sectoral communication between NFPs and relevant national counterparts on public health event assessment and response, NFPs were asked to also invite relevant staff from national immunization programmes, pandemic preparedness and risk communication s to participate. NFP participants were asked in a follow -up email to the exercise if colleagues from immunization and communications attended. Of the sixteen responses, eight (50%) reported having both immunization and communications colleagues in attendance; four (25%) had immunization colleagues; two (12.5%) had communications colleagues; and two (12.5%) did not have colleagues from either sector in attendance. 8 422Which colleagues attended the exercise in your country/area/territory?
