In alternative medicine, Detoxification is a type of alternative-medicine treatment which aims to rid the body of unspecified \"toxins\" - substances that proponents claim have accumulated in the body and have undesirable short-term or long-term effects on individual health. As a popular buzzword, it typically implies following a specific diet or using special products that claim to rid your body of toxins, thereby improving health and promoting weight loss. [Detoxification is considered a natural process](https://anrclinic.com/blog/natural-drug-detox/) by which the body rids itself of toxins. A medical detoxification is done via medication, tapering, and other appropriate means in a designated center meant to help an individual cleanse the blood and body of legal or illegal substances. [Drug detoxification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_detoxification) is variously the intervention in a case of physical dependence to a drug; the process and experience of a withdrawal syndrome; and any of various treatments for acute drug overdose. Organs such as the liver play a major role in detoxing the body from toxins such as drugs. Ironically, prolonged drug abuse can damage organs like the liver, making it so that it must work harder in order to perform its functions successfully. The purpose of undergoing drug detoxification in a medical center is first and foremost to manage withdrawal symptoms. Many centers will utilize prescription medication therapy in order to keep an individual comfortable while the body detoxes drugs, such as opioids, from its system. Having the support of medical staff in a center specifically meant for drug detox can give you peace of mind, as detoxing from any drugs is not an easy process and can become unsafe if done without medical supervision or guidance. In a traditional medical detox program, it can take days or sometimes even months for the withdrawal symptoms of most drugs to subside. The length of withdrawal when detoxing depends on a number of factors, including: The reason there is no exact time frame for a drug detox is because certain substances may clear out from the body within hours or days, but the cravings may persist much longer. If the physical cravings are still present, some may say that the detox is not completed. Different detox centers have different timelines for depending on the actual process of their procedure as well as the unique individual factors listed above. The process of drug detoxification can be broken down into 3 major parts: Since everyone's body and history is different, any credible medical detox center will spend a significant amount of time taking a detailed health history of the patient who would like to detox from drugs. The individual will be screened for physical and mental health issues. Tests such as blood tests may be administered in order to measure the amount of drugs in the patient's system. A detailed overview of medical, psychological, and drug abuse histories is important in order to personalize and tailor the treatment plan to the individual as much as possible. Amounts of medication to administer as well as a long term treatment plan rely on accurate and comprehensive health reporting of both the past and current state of health for the individual seeking help with their drug addiction or dependence. An individual treatment plan will be created that addresses the post-detox period as well. It may contain recommendations for psychotherapy, nutritional supplementation, and any other medications or therapies that the doctor believes will help the patient's chances at a full recovery from addiction. Stabilizing the Patient: Many detox centers focus on stabilizing the patient physiologically, but psychological preparation is just as important. Medically, a patient may receive fluids, certain medications, or other physical interventions depending on what the doctor and medical staff feel will result in the best outcome, while keeping the individual who is undergoing detox as safe as possible. Preparing For Rehab After a Drug Detox: The majority of individuals will choose to enter a rehab center after undergoing a medical detox. After a drug detox, medicals staff will ensure the patient is stable and all vitals will be checked. Mentally, counseling may be offered prior to entering into a longer term rehab program which can vary from a week long up to months long. The first step, however, is ridding the body of drugs. There are many options available from at home therapy to out of state inpatient programs to address underlying mental health issues and other factors that may be contributing to a person's addiction. Will I Be Awake During a Drug Detox? Yes, patients will likely be awake during the beginning of drug detox through to the end. In fact, there may even be an experience of insomnia as a withdrawal symptom which can be a challenging side effect. Speaking with the medical professionals on staff at the center where care is being received will allow for the exploring of options to combat insomnia when detoxing from drugs as well as any other negative side effects one may experience. Rehab centers typically keep individuals completely awake during the drug detox process, although there are some centers who will partly sedate patients for at least the beginning in hopes of minimizing withdrawal symptoms. Being awake and alert for the process should not be a deterrent for seeking help. With modern medicine, it is very possible to manage withdrawal symptoms and lessen the severity in order to successfully detox from drugs. Having medical staff and medication on hand if need be is a major reason it is highly suggested that any drug detox be performed under the care of a dedicated team of medical professionals in a drug detox specific center. As with any medical procedure, there are risks to be aware of when withdrawing from drugs, even if doing so at a reputable center or clinic. Knowing what to expect as well as potential side effects can help an individual prepare mentally for a detox from drugs. Since drug use changes the chemistry of the brain, a detox will also affect its biochemistry. Physical drug dependence simply stems from the brain becoming used to a certain amount of drugs being taken to maintain its new normal. When you eliminate the drugs that the brain has gotten so used to having, it is thrown once again into a state of imbalance. Some common side effects from a drug detox include: Physical side effects as well as psychological side effects after a drug detox are common and usually not life-threatening. However, they can feel intense which is why it is so important to be in a setting around trained professionals who know how to help. On a positive note, the physical symptoms associated with detox should normally subside within days. Continuing to follow a treatment plan as written will ensure the most positive outcome for individuals in recovery and will increase the chances of staying sober while decreasing the likelihood of one or more relapses. Can I Prevent Side Effects From Drug Detox? Some ways you can prepare for drug detox and lessen side effects include: Eating foods with a variety of vitamins and minerals can help replenish the body. Detox takes a major toll on an individual physically. Drug use also inhibits the body from absorbing all of the nutrients it needs to, so beginning to incorporate healthy foods into the diet is important. Hydration can also aid in lessening effects such as pains and spasms that one may experience as they undergo medical detox. Any medications given prior to the detox should be taken as prescribed by a doctor. When undergoing a medical detox program, it is not possible to fully predict or evade side effects from the detox itself. In fact, it is both natural and expected to experience at least some negative effects when the body is detoxifying from any toxins, especially drugs that have not been taken as prescribed or those that are illicit substances. A focus on physical and mental health can assist in making the transition easier both prior to and after drug detoxification. In short, no, [at home drug detox kits](https://anrclinic.com/blog/home-remedies-for-opioid-withdrawal/) are neither safe nor always effective and [can even present new hazards](https://anrclinic.com/blog/how-improperly-detoxing-may-harm-your-body/). Detox kits are often marketed as total body cleanses or miracle detoxes that can rid the body of any toxins or drugs such as [opioids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12237786/). They are sold over the counter at local pharmacies or grocery stores and may be liquid, powder, or a pill. Unfortunately, these kits are often not regulated so there is no way of verifying what is actually in the product. It can simply be an herbal remedy that does nothing, or it can be a combination of synthetic ingredients which can react poorly with a user's body and the drugs that are already in the system. Nausea, stomach cramping, heart palpitations and other side effects are a possibility when using one of these kits. More severe side effects may include seizures, dehydration from vomiting, or even loss of consciousness. Often, individuals may be seeking a way to pass a drug test for THC in marijuana , for example, and will turn to an at home detox kit in order to do so. Not only is this an unreliable method, but different compounds in the kit may show up on a test and tip off that the person is trying to hide a drug problem. Drug detox kits are not a solution to addiction and can give an individual a false sense of sobriety. Although gaining in popularity and seemingly convenient, at home drug detox kits don't actually work to resolve the underlying causes of drug dependence and addiction; instead, they are a temporary fix when they do work. It is always encouraged to seek professional help at a drug detox center if you or someone you know would like to end a dependence on drugs. Inpatient or residential drug and alcohol treatment is often the initial step for an individual seeking help for his or her addiction. Medical detoxification happens before any other interventions as detox occurs at the beginning of [treatment](https://ncim-stage.nci.nih.gov/ncimbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20Metathesaurus&code=C0204600). Detox by itself is not considered a comprehensive treatment for addiction. However, it is important to realize that those who complete a medical detox in a well-equipped detox center, have a greater likelihood of staying in treatment longer and have longer periods of sobriety. A medical detox is a step in the right direction for anyone who wants to stop using and abusing drugs. For some, it may be enough to curb the desire to continue using their drug of choice. For most, it is not a comprehensive solution for a drug abuse problem and there is great value in following through with a treatment plan that involves regular psychosocial services. Because the brain was dependent on drugs and will no longer be receiving those same drugs, there is likely to be a period of cravings. Shortly after a medical detox is actually the time when cravings are reported to be at their strongest. The brain will begin seeking ways to replace the chemicals lost during detox, which can lead to very intense cravings. It is crucial during this period to be around licensed professionals who can help guide the individual as it begins to find a state of balance once again. Even after leaving a center based drug detox program, there will be work to be done in order to maintain sobriety. Cravings may continue to appear as well as the impulsivity to use or abuse drugs, or partake in other risky behaviors in order to recreate the \"high\" that is now missing from the individual's life that the brain has become so dependent on. Old behaviors and patterns can be managed and even changed by attending regular therapy sessions with a professional who is well-versed in addiction counseling. Is Drug Detox Worth The Cost?

It is most accurate to say trained medical professionals manage withdrawal symptoms as the liver works to detoxify the body of drugs simultaneously. Withdrawal symptoms surface when the brain is not receiving the drug it has become accustomed to any longer. known as withdrawal syndrome, it occurs simply because the brain has adapted to the presence of the addictive substance.

Undergoing drug detoxification in a center for a prescription drug abuse problem will learn the severity of withdrawal symptoms and can minimize any potential consequences. Cocaine, methamphetamines, and MDMA are popular stimulants where users may develop a dependence or addiction. While not life-threatening to stop in and of itself, individuals have reported a deep and very intense depression as being a major withdrawal symptom. This depression can lead to life-threatening secondary issues such as overdosing in order to feel \"up\" again as well as suicidal ideation.
