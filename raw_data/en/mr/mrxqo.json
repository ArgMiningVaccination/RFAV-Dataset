But in fact they describe two different sensations. It is important to know exactly what you mean when you say \"I feel weak\" or \"I am fatigued\" because it can help you and your doctor narrow down the possible causes of your symptoms. - Weakness is a lack of physical or muscle strength and the feeling that extra effort is required to move your arms, legs, or other muscles. If muscle weakness is the result of pain, the person may be able to make muscles work, but it will hurt. - Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness or exhaustion or a need to rest because of lack of energy or strength. Fatigue may result from overwork, poor sleep, worry, boredom, or lack of exercise. It is a symptom that may be caused by illness, medicine, or medical treatment such as chemotherapy. Anxiety or depression can also cause fatigue. Both weakness and fatigue are symptoms, not diseases. Because these symptoms can be caused by many other health problems, the importance of weakness and fatigue can be determined only when other symptoms are evaluated. Weakness General weakness often occurs after you have done too much activity at one time, such as by taking an extra-long hike. You may feel weak and tired, or your muscles may be sore. These sensations usually go away within a few days. In rare cases, generalized muscle weakness may be caused by another health problem, such as: - A problem with the minerals ( [electrolytes](/electrolytes-and-electrolyte-imbalances)) found naturally in the body, such as low levels of potassium or sodium. - Infections, such as a urinary tract infection or a respiratory infection. - Problems with the thyroid gland, which regulates the way the body uses energy. - A low thyroid level ( [hypothyroidism](/hypothyroidism)) can cause fatigue, weakness, lethargy, weight gain, depression, memory problems, constipation, dry skin, intolerance to cold, coarse and thinning hair, brittle nails, or a yellowish tint to the skin. - A high thyroid level ( [hyperthyroidism](/hyperthyroidism)) can cause fatigue, weight loss, increased heart rate, intolerance to heat, sweating, irritability, anxiety, muscle weakness, and thyroid enlargement. - A low thyroid level ( - [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome](/guillain-barre-syndrome), a rare nerve disorder that causes weakness in the legs, arms, and other muscles and that can progress to complete [paralysis](/paralysis). - [Myasthenia gravis](/myasthenia-gravis), a rare, chronic disorder that causes weakness and rapid muscle fatigue. Muscle weakness that is slowly getting worse requires a visit to a doctor. Sudden muscle weakness and loss of function in one area of the body can indicate a serious problem within the brain (such as a [stroke](/stroke) or [transient ischemic attack](/transient-ischemic-attack-tia-0)) or [spinal cord](/spinal-cord-anatomy) or with a specific nerve in the body. Fatigue Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness, exhaustion, or lack of energy. You may feel mildly fatigued because of overwork, poor sleep, worry, boredom, or lack of exercise. Any illness, such as a cold or influenza (flu), may cause fatigue, which usually goes away as the illness clears up. Most of the time, mild fatigue occurs with a health problem that will improve with home treatment and does not require a visit to a doctor. A stressful emotional situation may also cause fatigue. This type of fatigue usually clears up when the [stress](/stress) is relieved. Many prescription and non-prescription [medicines](/health-topics/medicines-can-cause-weakness-or-fatigue) can cause weakness or fatigue. The use of alcohol, caffeine, or illegal drugs can cause fatigue. A visit to a doctor usually is needed when fatigue occurs along with more serious symptoms, such as increased breathing problems, signs of a serious illness, abnormal bleeding, or unexplained weight loss or gain. Fatigue that lasts longer than 2 weeks usually requires a visit to a doctor. This type of fatigue may be caused by a more serious health problem, such as: - A decrease in the amount of oxygen-carrying substance (hemoglobin) found in red blood cells ( [anemia](/anemia)). - Problems with the heart, such as [coronary artery disease](/coronary-artery-disease-0)or [heart failure](/heart-failure), that limit the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle or the rest of the body. - Metabolic disorders, such as [diabetes](/diabetes), in which sugar (glucose) remains in the blood rather than entering the body's cells to be used for energy. - Problems with the thyroid gland, which regulates the way the body uses energy. - A low thyroid level (hypothyroidism) can cause fatigue, weakness, lethargy, weight gain, depression, memory problems, constipation, dry skin, intolerance to cold, coarse and thinning hair, brittle nails, or a yellowish tint to the skin. - A high thyroid level (hyperthyroidism) can cause fatigue, weight loss, increased heart rate, intolerance to heat, sweating, irritability, anxiety, muscle weakness, and thyroid enlargement. - Kidney disease and liver disease, which cause fatigue when the concentration of certain chemicals in the blood builds up to toxic levels. If fatigue occurs without an obvious cause, it is important to evaluate your mental health. Fatigue is a common symptom of mental health problems, such as [anxiety](/anxiety) or [depression](/depression). Fatigue and depression may become so severe that you may consider suicide as a way to end your pain. If you think your fatigue may be caused by a mental health problem, see your doctor. [Check your symptoms](/health-topics/back-problems-and-injuries) to decide if and when you should see a doctor. Health Tools Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Check Your Symptoms The medical assessment of symptoms is based on the body parts you have. - If you are transgender or non-binary, choose the sex that matches the body parts (such as ovaries, testes, prostate, breasts, penis, or vagina) you now have in the area where you are having symptoms. - If your symptoms aren't related to those organs, you can choose the gender you identify with. - If you have some organs of both sexes, you may need to go through this triage tool twice (once as \"male\" and once as \"female\"). This will make sure that the tool asks the right questions for you. [irregular heartbeats or changes in your heart rate](#tf7212)? [symptoms of a heart attack](#tf6936)? [areas where you may feel pain or other symptoms](tp10966). [neurological symptoms](#tf7141)? [symptoms in an adult or older child](#tf6965)are different than the [symptoms in a baby or toddler](#tf7103). [medicine](#tf7147)may be causing the weakness or fatigue? Many things can affect how your body responds to a symptom and what kind of care you may need. These include: - Your age. Babies and older adults tend to get sicker quicker. - Your overall health. If you have a condition such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease, you may need to pay closer attention to certain symptoms and seek care sooner. - Medicines you take. Certain medicines, such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), medicines that suppress the immune system like steroids or chemotherapy, or natural health products can cause symptoms or make them worse. - Recent health events, such as surgery or injury. These kinds of events can cause symptoms afterwards or make them more serious. - Your health habits and lifestyle, such as eating and exercise habits, smoking, alcohol or drug use, sexual history, and travel.

Neurological symptoms\u2014which may be signs of a problem with the nervous system\u2014can affect many body functions. Symptoms may include: - Numbness, weakness, or lack of movement in your face, arm, or leg, especially on only one side of your body. - Trouble seeing in one or both eyes. - Trouble speaking. - Confusion or trouble understanding simple statements. - Problems with balance or coordination (for example, falling down or dropping things). - Seizures.
