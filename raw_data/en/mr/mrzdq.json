In particular, women were reported to be at higher risk than men of developing symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression, and resilience was considered a key factor for positive mental health outcomes. In the present study, a sample of Italian female teachers (n = 66, age: 51.5 \u00b1 7.9 years) was assessed with self-report instruments one month before and one month after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown: mindfulness skills, empathy, personality profiles, interoceptive awareness, psychological well-being, emotional distress and burnout levels were measured. Meanwhile, they received an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) course, through two group meetings and six individual video-lessons. Based on baseline personality profiles, analyses of variance were performed in a low-resilience (LR, n = 32) and a high-resilience (HR, n = 26) group. The LR and HR groups differed at baseline in most of the self-report measures. Pre-post MOM significant improvements were found in both groups in anxiety, depression, affective empathy, emotional exhaustion, psychological well-being, interoceptive awareness, character traits and mindfulness levels. Improvements in depression and psychological well-being were higher in the LR vs. HR group. We conclude that mindfulness-based training can effectively mitigate the psychological negative consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak, helping in particular to restore well-being in the most vulnerable individuals.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-09-04", "cleaned_text": "Positive Impact of Mindfulness Meditation on Mental Health of Female Teachers during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186450](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186450) [Mental Health in the Time of COVID-19]( /journal/ijerph/special_issues/Mental_Health_COVID_Time )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-17-06450)], when Italy was the worst affected country outside China and was soon becoming the new center of the virus spread. City and regional lockdowns in Italy had already started in February, but the nationwide lockdown started on 9 March 2020, with an estimated 56 million people ordered to remain at home: bars, restaurants, schools and churches were closed and only essential services were permitted (e.g., vital health-care, food stores, electricity/gas/water/fuel suppliers, garbage collection). At the release of the toughest lockdown measures, on 4 May 2020, Italy had officially experienced 210,717 Covid-19 cases and had suffered 28,884 deaths due to this disease [ [2](#B2-ijerph-17-06450)]. [3](#B3-ijerph-17-06450)]) associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, the fear of the virus and the 2-month lockdown had a serious psychological impact on a large part of the Italian population. Early reports emerging in the literature have shown that between 40% and 50% of adults have experienced psychological distress following the Covid-19 outbreak [ [4](#B4-ijerph-17-06450), [5](#B5-ijerph-17-06450)], and that 30% of adults and children are at high risk for post-traumatic stress symptoms [ [6](#B6-ijerph-17-06450)]. These results are in line with those previously collected from Chinese samples [ [7](#B7-ijerph-17-06450), [8](#B8-ijerph-17-06450), [9](#B9-ijerph-17-06450), [10](#B10-ijerph-17-06450)], and extend our previous knowledge of the psychological burden of quarantines coming from past (shorter and smaller scale) experiences of isolation due to public health emergencies and relative confinement measures [ [11](#B11-ijerph-17-06450)]. [11](#B11-ijerph-17-06450)], as well as cash transfers and job retention acts [ [12](#B12-ijerph-17-06450)]. Moreover, other institutional and individual interventions have been proposed to protect mental heath in vulnerable groups, in particular during emergency situations such as the Covid-19 outbreak. These include stigma mitigation [ [13](#B13-ijerph-17-06450)], psychological/psychiatric assistance [ [14](#B14-ijerph-17-06450), [15](#B15-ijerph-17-06450)], [19](#B19-ijerph-17-06450)]. A recent review of the meta-analyses of self-guided interventions to alleviate anxiety, depression and stress concluded that such interventions significantly improve well-being in comparison to control groups, albeit with effect sizes smaller than those associated with traditional guided individual or group therapies [ [20](#B20-ijerph-17-06450)]. The interventions that proved to be the most effective included self-guided cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs). [21](#B21-ijerph-17-06450)]. These programs are usually delivered over 8 consecutive weeks, with eight group meetings led by a mindfulness instructor and daily individual practice at home [ [22](#B22-ijerph-17-06450)]. Several studies have highlighted the benefits of MBIs mainly in terms of self-reported reductions in anxiety, depression and stress levels [ [23](#B23-ijerph-17-06450), [24](#B24-ijerph-17-06450), [25](#B25-ijerph-17-06450)]. Other improvements due to MBIs have been reported for job burnout [ [26](#B26-ijerph-17-06450)], interoceptive awareness [ [27](#B27-ijerph-17-06450), [28](#B28-ijerph-17-06450)], empathy [ and psychological well-being [ [33](#B33-ijerph-17-06450), [34](#B34-ijerph-17-06450)]. It is important to underline that, after the completion of the program, participants can maintain and enhance the benefits gained during the training program by continuing with the meditation on their own. Two decades since the introduction of MBIs, research has showed that they could be effective in promoting well-being also when delivered through a single introductory group meeting, during which the meditation practices are taught and participants carry on the program individually [ [35](#B35-ijerph-17-06450), [36](#B36-ijerph-17-06450)], or when delivered via the internet [ [37](#B37-ijerph-17-06450), [38](#B38-ijerph-17-06450)]. MBIs are therefore tools potentially suitable for dealing with stressors arising during lockdown periods, because they can help manage psychological suffering and they can be delivered even in situations where face-to-face meetings are suspended and a large number of people need psychological support. [Figure 1](#ijerph-17-06450-f001)). Although the MOM course was not originally aimed at mitigating the psychological distress resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, as this event was unpredictable, it ended up being addressed to a class of the general population most vulnerable to the consequences of this event: many studies have indeed frequently shown that being a woman is one of the risk factors for poor mental health outcomes during the Covid-19 pandemic [ [5](#B5-ijerph-17-06450), [6](#B6-ijerph-17-06450), [39](#B39-ijerph-17-06450), [40](#B40-ijerph-17-06450), [41](#B41-ijerph-17-06450), [42](#B42-ijerph-17-06450)]. [43](#B43-ijerph-17-06450)]. Past research found that resilience is directly related, on the one hand, to secure attachment [ [44](#B44-ijerph-17-06450), [45](#B45-ijerph-17-06450)], mental health [ [46](#B46-ijerph-17-06450), [47](#B47-ijerph-17-06450)], psychological well-being empathy [ [49](#B49-ijerph-17-06450)], mindfulness [ [50](#B50-ijerph-17-06450)] and interoceptive awareness [ [51](#B51-ijerph-17-06450)], and, on the other hand, inversely related to childhood trauma [ [45](#B45-ijerph-17-06450)], anxiety, depression [ [52](#B52-ijerph-17-06450)] and burnout [ [53](#B53-ijerph-17-06450)]. Many studies have shown the link between measures of resilience and personality traits, such as harm avoidance, self-directedness, persistence and neuroticism [ [45](#B45-ijerph-17-06450), [54](#B54-ijerph-17-06450), [55](#B55-ijerph-17-06450), [56](#B56-ijerph-17-06450), [57](#B57-ijerph-17-06450)]. The sample of teachers who received the MBI were studied here in terms of their resilience profile, generated on the basis of temperamental (i.e., mainly innate) and characterological (i.e., mainly due to personal experiences and education) measures taken at baseline with the Temperament and Character Inventory low-resilience group, compared to the high-resilience group, had worse baseline levels of psychological well-being, mindfulness skills, interoceptive awareness, emotional distress, to periods free from global health emergencies like that related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we hypothesized that both groups of teachers experienced similar improvements in mindfulness skills, empathy, character traits and interoceptive awareness (H2). As the psychological impact of compulsory isolation in the context of a world-wide pandemic has not previously been examined in relation to mindfulness meditation courses, the analyses of changes in the measures of psychological well-being, burnout and emotional distress (anxiety and depression) were exploratory. [20](#B20-ijerph-17-06450)], we also hypothesized that participants could perceive mindfulness meditation as a useful practice in living through the Covid-19 lockdown period (H3b). 2. Method 2.1. Procedure [60](#B60-ijerph-17-06450)]). After participant recruitment, two parallel MOM courses were scheduled and two schools were chosen as the locations for the courses. Participants enrolled in one of the two courses based on the location of the course (the locations of the courses were about 60 km away). The MOM courses were held by two of the authors (A.M., a professional socio-health educator, and A.P., a psychologist), who have more than five years of experience in practicing and teaching mindfulness meditation. [Figure 1](#ijerph-17-06450-f001)). They could communicate with their MOM instructor through emails, telephone messages and phone calls in case they wanted to share their meditation experiences or to pose questions about the contents of the video lessons. 2.2. Participants [61](#B61-ijerph-17-06450)]. 2.3. Mindfulness Oriented Meditation (MOM) Course [31](#B31-ijerph-17-06450), [32](#B32-ijerph-17-06450), [36](#B36-ijerph-17-06450), [60](#B60-ijerph-17-06450), [62](#B62-ijerph-17-06450), [63](#B63-ijerph-17-06450), [64](#B64-ijerph-17-06450)]. In is similar to an MBSR course (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), the most common mindfulness meditation program developed by Kabat-Zinn [ [65](#B65-ijerph-17-06450)]. Each MOM meeting is divided into three parts: a 15/30 min teaching on topics related to meditative practice, a 30 min guided MOM practice and a final phase during which participants can share their experiences and ask questions to the instructor. These are the topics covered in the teachings [ [64](#B64-ijerph-17-06450)]: historical introduction to mindfulness meditation, what is mindfulness meditation and how to practice it, facing pain with a mindful attitude, attention and awareness, being in the here and now, disidentification, deautomatization, and letting go. The MOM practice, which is the same throughout the course, entails a 10 min session of paying attention to one's breathing (anapanasati meditation), 10 min dedicated to heeding one's bodily sensations (body scan meditation) and 10 min dedicated to being aware of one's emotional and mental phenomena (vipassana meditation). The main reference for these practices within the Buddhist context, from which mindfulness meditation was adapted, is the Satipatthna discourse [ [66](#B66-ijerph-17-06450)], although the instructions given to participants during the meditations do not refer to Buddhism. The same three practices are part of other contemporary, secular and psychologically-oriented mindfulness meditation courses, such as MBSR. After the first meeting, participants are provided with a 30 min audio recording containing a guided MOM practice ( [http://www.medita-mom.it/materiale](http://www.medita-mom.it/materiale)), as an aid for home meditation practice. Participants are provided with articles and book suggestions on the topics covered in the course based on personal requests. [64](#B64-ijerph-17-06450)] and the meditation\u2014guided by instructors in the first two meetings and to be performed at home by the participants throughout the course\u2014remained the same during the 8 weeks of the course. Discussions between participants and instructors, which normally take place in the final part of each MOM meeting, were replaced by personal communications via mail, phone messages or calls in the last 6 MOM weeks (see [Figure 1](#ijerph-17-06450-f001)), after the government prohibited face-to-face meetings due to the Covid-19 outbreak. 2.4. Measures [67](#B67-ijerph-17-06450), [68](#B68-ijerph-17-06450)]). This 39-item instrument measures five mindfulness scales: observing (OBS), describing (DES), acting with awareness (AWA), non-judging of inner experience (NJU), and non-reactivity to inner experience (NRE). Respondents are asked to rate each statement using a 5-level Likert scale (1 = never or very rarely true, 5 = very often or always true; item example: \"I watch my feelings without getting lost in them\"). Higher scores in each scale reflect a greater level of mindfulness. FFMQ has a high internal consistency for the total score (Cronbach's = 0.86) and acceptable values for its five scales ( 0.74) [ [68](#B68-ijerph-17-06450)] (see below the Results section for sample Cronbach's ). [69](#B69-ijerph-17-06450), [70](#B70-ijerph-17-06450)]). Using a 4-level Likert scale response format (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree), this 31-item instrument assesses the two main components of empathy, namely affective empathy (AE, a person's emotional resonance to other people's experiences; item example\u2014\"It worries me when others are worrying and panicky\") and cognitive empathy (CE, the ability to understand how other people feel; item example\u2014\"I always try to consider the other fellow's feelings before I do something\"). QCAE has acceptable internal consistency for the AE and CE components, and the total score [70](#B70-ijerph-17-06450)]. [58](#B58-ijerph-17-06450), [59](#B59-ijerph-17-06450), [71](#B71-ijerph-17-06450)]). This tool assesses the temperament and character dimensions of personality using a dichotomous true-false response format (item example: \"I'm often so determined that I continue working long after other people give up\"). Temperament scales include novelty-seeking (NS, the propensity towards impulsivity, exploratory excitability and eccentricity), harm avoidance (HA, the propensity to respond strongly to aversive stimuli), reward dependence (RD, the propensity to respond intensely to signs of social gratification) and persistence (P, the tendency to pursue goals despite fatigue and frustration). Character scales include self-directedness (SD, the ability to recognize the self as autonomous, and the feeling of self-confidence, honor and hope), cooperativeness (C, the ability to recognize the self as an organic part of society) and self-transcendence (ST, the ability to recognize the self as an organic part of nature and its source). TCI in its 125-item version has acceptable internal consistency for all scales ( 0.71) [ [71](#B71-ijerph-17-06450)]. [72](#B72-ijerph-17-06450), [73](#B73-ijerph-17-06450)]). This 32-item instrument uses a 6-level Likert scale response format (0 = never, 5 = always; item example\u2014\"I notice when I am uncomfortable in my body\"). MAIA measures interoceptive awareness through eight subscales: noticing (NOT, the awareness of neutral, comfortable and uncomfortable body sensations), not-distracting (NDI, the propensity not to distract oneself from sensations of discomfort or pain), not-worrying (NWO, the propensity not to worry when sensations of discomfort or pain are experienced), attention regulation (ARE, the ability to focus and sustain attention to body sensations), emotional awareness (EAW, the ability to connect body sensations to underlying emotional states), self-regulation (SRE, the ability to manage distress by listening to body sensations), body listening (BLI, the propensity to actively listen to the body for information) and trusting (TRU, the tendency to trust your body). The Cronbach's values for internal consistency varied between 0.53 and 0.80 in the eight MAIA scales [ [73](#B73-ijerph-17-06450)]. [74](#B74-ijerph-17-06450), [75](#B75-ijerph-17-06450)]). This tool uses a 4-level Likert scale response format (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree; item example\u2014\"I like most parts of my personality\") and the six scales included are self-acceptance (SA), autonomy (AU), environmental mastery (EM), personal growth (PG), positive relations with others (PR) and purpose in life (PL). Higher scores on any scale indicate greater indices of happiness and psychological well-being. PWB Scales showed Cronbach's values ranging from 0.60 to 0.70 [ [76](#B76-ijerph-17-06450)], which appears to be a sufficient level of internal consistency based on the fact that each subscale comprised only three items. [77](#B77-ijerph-17-06450), [78](#B78-ijerph-17-06450)]). This 14-item instrument uses a 4-level Likert scale response format, with levels that differ depending on the question. Although originally developed to measure anxiety (item example: \"Worrying thoughts go through my mind\") and depression (item example: \"I look forward with enjoyment to things\") in non-psychiatric clinical settings, the HADS has been extensively employed as an effective tool even in non-clinical populations [ [79](#B79-ijerph-17-06450)]. It provides separate scores for anxiety, depression and global emotional distress. In a review of the literature, HADS showed a high internal consistency across studies for both anxiety (mean Cronbach's = 0.83) and depression measures (mean Cronbach's [80](#B80-ijerph-17-06450)]. [81](#B81-ijerph-17-06450), [82](#B82-ijerph-17-06450)]). Using a 7-level Likert scale response format (0 = never, 6 = always; item example\u2014\"I feel frustrated by my job\"), this 22-item instrument measures three components of burnout in relation to teacher-student interaction: feelings of overwhelming emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization and detachment from the job (DP), and a lack of personal or professional accomplishment (PA). Burnout is indicated by high scores for EE and DP, and a low score for PA. MBI-ES has acceptable internal consistency for each of its components ( 0.76) [ [82](#B82-ijerph-17-06450)]. [Table 1](#ijerph-17-06450-t001)). Each question was rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (for Q1-Q8, 1 = not at all, 5 = very much; for Q9-Q10, 1 = much worse, 5 = much better). 2.5. Statistical Analyses [54](#B54-ijerph-17-06450), [55](#B55-ijerph-17-06450), [56](#B56-ijerph-17-06450)], participants were classified as having a low-resilience (LR) or high-resilience (HR) profile on the basis of their HA and SD scores obtained at baseline. Participants in the LR group therefore had higher HA and lower SD scores than participants in the HR group. The clustering procedure, which assigned each participant to one of the two groups, was performed on the participants' standardized HA and SD scores (see [Figure 2](#ijerph-17-06450-f002)) with the k-means algorithm [ [83](#B83-ijerph-17-06450)]. [31](#B31-ijerph-17-06450)], and were therefore analyzed using a single ANOVA with Time (Time T0, Time T1) and Scale (SD, C, ST) as within-subject factors and Group (LR, HR) as the between-subject factor. The same analysis was conducted for FFMQ, where the Scale levels were the five facets of mindfulness (i.e., OBS, DES, AWA, NJU and NRE), as these facets can be considered parts of the unique construct of mindfulness [ [63](#B63-ijerph-17-06450)]. 3. Results 3.1. Objective 1: Baseline Differences in Teachers with LR and HR Personality Profiles Sample Partitioning Based on Resilience Profile [Figure 2](#ijerph-17-06450-f002)). The solution found was stable (i.e., the same classification was invariably obtained by repeating the clustering procedure). When comparing the resilience profiles of the 58 teachers who completed the MOM course with those of the 8 teachers who dropped out (HA: z = 0.20 \u00b1 0.58; SD: z = 0.25 \u00b1 0.40), it was observed that the HA and SD scores of the drop-outs mainly fell in between those of the teachers in the HR group (HA: z = 0.26 \u00b1 0.82; SD: z = 0.51) and group \u00b1 0.56; SD: z = 0.77 \u00b1 0.93). The resilience profiles of the 8 teachers who dropped out of the MOM course were not included in the clustering procedure. [Table 2](#ijerph-17-06450-t002)). First of all, they were different in terms of HA and SD z-scores; this means that the clustering procedure could successfully separate the participants according to their HA and SD features. Moreover, participants in the HR had significantly higher baseline scores in the AWA, NJU and NRE facets of the FFMQ, lower AE scores in the QCAE, higher scores in the NWO and SRE scales of the MAIA, higher scores in all scales of the PWB, lower anxiety and depression scores in the HADS, and lower EE and higher DP and PA scores in the MBI (Hypothesis H1). 3.2. Objective 2: Pre-Post MOM Changes in Teachers with LR and HR Personality Profiles 3.2.1. Mindfulness Skills 3.2.2. Empathy Emotional Distress 3.2.7. Teacher Burnout 3.2.8. Adherence to Practice 3.3. Objective 3: Teachers' Satisfaction with the MOM Course (in General and in the Context of the Covid-19 Outbreak) Evaluation of the MOM Course [Table 1](#ijerph-17-06450-t001)), the participants reported that they generally enjoyed the course (average score: 4.1, SD = 0.7), that they found it rather challenging (M = 3.7, SD = 0.9) but quite useful (M = 4.0, SD = 0.7), that they considerably engaged in it (M = 3.9, SD = 0.6), that the course moderately met their professional training needs (M = 3.6, SD = 0.8) and that the instructors' competence was very good (M = 4.5, SD = 0.6). A significant between-group difference was found only in the question about the usefulness of the course (in the LR group: M = 3.81, SD = 0.69; in the HR group: M = 4.15, SD = 0.73; Fisher's exact test p = 0.046). [Table 1](#ijerph-17-06450-t001)), the participants reported that thinking about Covid-19 distracted them slightly during practice sessions (M = 2.5, SD = 0.9), that the practice of meditation helped them very much during the particular period of isolation related to the emergency (M = 3.6, SD = 0.7), that the absence of the practice would have made the period a little worse (M = 1.9, SD = 0.6) and that the distance learning methods of the last six meetings of the MOM course somewhat reduced the effectiveness of the course (M = 2.1, SD = 0.7). No significant between-group differences were found in these questions (for all, Fisher's exact test p > 0.26). 4. Discussion 4.1. Objective 1: Baseline Differences in Teachers with LR and HR Personality Profiles [50](#B50-ijerph-17-06450)], psychological well-being [ [48](#B48-ijerph-17-06450)] and interoceptive awareness [ [51](#B51-ijerph-17-06450)], and on the other hand, inversely related to burnout [ [53](#B53-ijerph-17-06450)], anxiety and depression [ [52](#B52-ijerph-17-06450)]. 4.2. Objective 2: Pre-Post MOM Changes in Teachers with LR and HR Personality Profiles [85](#B85-ijerph-17-06450), [86](#B86-ijerph-17-06450)]; various studies have indeed highlighted a direct dose-response relationship between the amount of meditation practice and the extent of the beneficial outcomes of MBIs (for a meta-analysis, see [ [87](#B87-ijerph-17-06450)]), and in the case of online MBIs as well (for a meta-analysis, see [ [37](#B37-ijerph-17-06450)]). It is indeed worth pointing out that mindfulness meditation was taught here with two face-to-face initial meeting and video lessons sent via internet for the next six weeks of the course (see [Figure 1](#ijerph-17-06450-f001)); our results therefore confirm the possibility of effectively delivering MBIs via the internet [ [37](#B37-ijerph-17-06450), [38](#B38-ijerph-17-06450)]. [15](#B15-ijerph-17-06450), [16](#B16-ijerph-17-06450), [18](#B18-ijerph-17-06450), [89](#B89-ijerph-17-06450), [90](#B90-ijerph-17-06450), [91](#B91-ijerph-17-06450)] and patients with the Covid-19 infection [ [92](#B92-ijerph-17-06450), [93](#B93-ijerph-17-06450)]. For this purpose, many scholars suggested the use of mindfulness interventions [ [94](#B94-ijerph-17-06450), [95](#B95-ijerph-17-06450), [96](#B96-ijerph-17-06450), [97](#B97-ijerph-17-06450)]. However, studies assessing the impact of interventions that supported mental health in the early stages of the Covid-19 related crisis are very limited. Although the improvements reported in the present study cannot be attributed to the MOM course given the absence of a control group, the results seem remarkable, as we are not aware of any studies reporting improved psychological well-being when comparing persons during the Covid-19 outbreak with their precedent condition. Various studies instead reported a deterioration of people's mental health [ [5](#B5-ijerph-17-06450), [6](#B6-ijerph-17-06450), [98](#B98-ijerph-17-06450), [99](#B99-ijerph-17-06450)]. At the same time, it should be recognized that our research focused on a specific population, namely state school teachers, who might have been less impacted by the emergency than other workers, as their jobs were not at risk and they were not professionally exposed to the risk of the infection (as were, for example, health care workers). Although a recent meta-analysis on the psychological impact of Covid-19 on medical staff and the general public found that the prevalence of anxiety and depression was similar in these two groups [ [100](#B100-ijerph-17-06450)], there is evidence that certain occupations, such as front-line nurses, were indeed more psychologically affected by Covid-19 than others [ [101](#B101-ijerph-17-06450), [102](#B102-ijerph-17-06450)]. [Table 3](#ijerph-17-06450-t003)). LR individuals therefore made better progresses than HR participants, although both groups reported the same amount of home meditation practice. This could be due, at least in part, to ceiling effects, because highly resilient individuals already showed healthy profiles at baseline for these measures. The findings could also be linked to different levels of motivation, across HR and LR participants, to commit themselves to the mindfulness intervention, which is usually presented as a way to alleviate one's psychological suffering [ [103](#B103-ijerph-17-06450)]; as described in our previous research [ [36](#B36-ijerph-17-06450)] and similarly to the reactive control negative feedback process proposed in many theories of self-regulation [ [104](#B104-ijerph-17-06450)], participants who are in a worse condition (i.e., the LR group in our study) could be more motivated to engage for their own recovery. [105](#B105-ijerph-17-06450)] and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been related to modifiable factors such as physical exercise and interpersonal relationships [ [106](#B106-ijerph-17-06450)]. However, as observed in other measures of the present research, at the end of the training course the two groups in our study remained significantly different in terms of the two aforementioned personality traits, and therefore in terms of resilience. 4.3. Objective 3: Teachers' Satisfaction with the MOM Course (in General and in the Context of the Covid-19 Outbreak) [30](#B30-ijerph-17-06450), [107](#B107-ijerph-17-06450), [108](#B108-ijerph-17-06450), [109](#B109-ijerph-17-06450)]. The answers to the questions about the course in the context of the Covid-19 outbreak supported H3b; participants in general reported that the practice of meditation helped them during the particular period of isolation related to the health emergency, and that the absence of the practice would have made the period a little worse. 4.4. Limitations [110](#B110-ijerph-17-06450)]. A final issue concerns individuals' spirituality. In different contexts and with different participants, past studies showed, on the one hand, that MOM practice may contribute to enhancing individuals' levels of implicit and explicit spirituality, [ [62](#B62-ijerph-17-06450)] and, on the other hand, that spirituality is an important mediator of the positive health effects of mindfulness meditation [ [111](#B111-ijerph-17-06450)]. Considering the strong connections between spirituality and healthcare (e.g., [ [112](#B112-ijerph-17-06450)]), it might have been useful to explicitly test spirituality in our study (beyond the self-transcendence scale included in the TCI measuring the predisposition of human beings toward spiritual feeling, thinking and behaviors), and it might be important that future studies investigating the psychological impact of health emergencies, and the effectiveness of related interventions, include the dimension of people's spirituality (e.g., [ [113](#B113-ijerph-17-06450)]). 5. Conclusions [114](#B114-ijerph-17-06450)] and (3) the participants actively engaged daily in the practice of meditation to protect and promote their mental health.
