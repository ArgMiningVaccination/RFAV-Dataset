Be ready to share your \"My Family Can...\" goals. Replicating last weeks recipe -any success? Did your family maintain or increase physical activity? Does anyone know how to read nutrition labels? Serving Size and Calories Serving size = the amount of food listed on a product's Nutrition Facts label A package can contain more than one serving Calories = measured by the amount of energy in food, which fuels our body Serving Size and Calories If you eat the whole package, you are eating? 2 servings 240 x 2 = 480 calories! Does anyone know how many calories people need? The amount of calories we need depends on: Age Height Weight Gender Daily activity level 600calories = 38% of Joe's daily calorie needsJoe, Age 10 Needs ~1600 633calories = 45%of Nancy's daily calorie needs % Daily Value It's the guide to the nutrients in one serving of food. EXAMPLE: 20% calcium = 20% of calcium you need each day. 5% or less = low in nutrient 20% or more = high in that nutrient Fat Content Fat provides energy that helps maintain and protect our body Each gram of fat gives more calories than either protein or carbohydrates Fat = 9 cal/gram vs. Carbohydrates and proteins = 4 cal/gram So, limit fat intake! GOOD FATS FATS TO LIMIT Polyunsaturated fats Saturated fats Mono unsaturated fats Cholesterol Sources: avocado, olive oil, fish, nutsSources: butter, red meat, high -fat dairy products Sodium Sodium is found in table salt or processed foods.

A gardening expert? -It's your time to shine! Be ready to share your \"I Spy With My Little Eyes\" Adding one organic product into your diet -success? Q: Does anyone know what a kitchen garden is? Are gardens that produce food. A kitchen garden includes fruits, veggies, and herbs -things you would use in the kitchen for cooking Kitchen gardens don't have to be large! Gardening can be in the ground or in containers The key is to find something easy for you and your family to do! The benefits of gardening are as abundant as the garden itself! Gardening burns calories You'll try new tastes Kids learn responsibility Saves money Healthy food right at your back door Choose your location Choose a location that gets full sun ( at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day) Make sure it drains well Plants tend to dry/wilt more quickly in containers than in the ground so make sure to water with good drainage ! If you're a first -time gardener, start small! Use small pots and few seedlings You can always add more, little by little Eventually your garden may be able to meet your family's produce needs! Directly in Ground or Raised Beds Remove or compost sod/grass from location Make sure you don't have grass or weeds coming up in your garden Containers Decide on your containers (repurposed items -coffee cans, buckets, kiddie pools, plastic sandboxes, storage bins, wooden crates etc.) Make sure you have good soil and ample drainage -drill or punch holes if necessary to allow drainage Over and under watering are the #1 causes of plant failure! Start small with what you like to eat (simple salad garden) If using containers, tomato, zucchini, cucumber and pepper plants do well as \"patio\" varieties. Share what you would grow in your garden and what you would make with it! 2 ways to plant -seeds or transplant seedlings Seeds: plant directly into your garden soil, like peas and beans Transplant seedlings: need to be started indoors and then transplanted outside, like tomatoes Hearty vegetables for growing = peas, beans, lettuce, melons, cucumbers, broccoli, peppers, onions, tomatoes and radishes Not sure to plant inside or outside? Check the seed packet ! Seed packets come in different shapes and sizes, but all provide same helpful information. Plant Information Where to Plant When to Plant How to Plant Water as soon as you plant your seeds Water lightly ! You do NOT want to water so much that your seeds start to show through the soil! Make sure the soil is moist every day You want moist soil until sprouts appear, then only water as needed Need extra watering during dry periods (no rain) Most vegetables will benefit from an inch or more water each week Wait for the plant to show very slight signs of wilt, then add water Feel the soil \u2014poke your finger down about an inch; if it's dry to that depth, then water Pick up the pot when it's dry and gauge its weight ; when the pot feels light, that's a clue that it's time to water Top watering : use a spouted watering can to apply water on the surface of the soil (not on the plant), until you see water pouring out the drainage hole at the bottom Bottom watering : set the container (or nursery pot) into a bucket or saucer of water, watering the root system through the drainage hole Not necessary when waiting for seeds to emerge from soil Compost and aged manure can supply nutrients to plant after they have sprouted Synthetic liquid fertilizer (Miracle Grow) can be applied after seeds have sprouted and developed 2 leaves Unlike organic matter, synthetic fertilizers don't provide benefits to soil health so LIMIT SYNTHETIC FERTILIZER USEType of fruit/vegetable will determine when you will be ready for harvest Look at days to harvest on seed packet to know when to start getting ready to harvest Enjoy your harvest! When crops are ready, plan a family dinner together . Consider sharing extra with neighbors, friends and family! Gardening can be fun and doesn't have to be a lot of hard work.

Maintaining healthy and physical activity - Success? Today's focus is making healthy choices while shopping on a budget With the right tips and a little planning, it's possible to enjoy healthy foods on a fixed or limited budget! Before heading to the grocery store or market, make a \"game plan\" Take the time to think about your budget and your shopping needs before you go This allows you to: Help get organized Save money Rethink your food choice and pick healthier options Things to think about while making your plan: What is your grocery budget? Figure out how much money you have available to spend on food Plan snacks and meals for the week according to your budget and schedule Choose meals you can prepare easily on busy days Shop according to your weekly needs Write down the meals you want to make for the week before making a list 1.Look in your freezer, cabinets and refrigerator.

Buy \"in season\" produce -usually less expensive and at their peak flavor When buying canned . Choose fruit canned in 100% fruit juice and vegetables with \"low sodium\" or \"no salt added\" on label. Canned is just as nutritious as fresh and often costs less If you have freezer space, buy frozen vegetables without added sauces or butter -they are as good for you as fresh and may cost less Canned and frozen F&V last longer than fresh Avoid pre -cut F&V because they usually cost moreMake half your grains whole grains ! Check ingredients and pick items that have whole grain listed first on the ingredients label Examples of whole grains include: whole wheat, brown rice, oatmeal Rice, pasta, hot cereals (oatmeal), and dry cereal are budget friendly whole grain options Try new whole grain snack ideas , like switching to whole -wheat crackers or popping your own popcorn Low cost choices include beans (kidney and pinto beans), peas (split peas), and lentils . Use them in main or side dishes! Buy family sized/value pack of meats and freeze what you don't use . Choose lean meats like chicken or turkey. When choosing ground beef make sure it's lean (92% lean 8% fat). Seafood doesn't have to be expensive. Try canned tuna, salmon or sardines -they store well and are low -cost options! Don't forget eggs ! They are a great low-cost option and easy to prepare. Choose low -fat or fat -free milk -it provides just as much calcium, but fewer calories than whole or 2% milk Buy the larger size of low -fat plain yogurt instead of individual flavored yogurts. You can add your own flavors by mixing fruits When buying cheese, look for \"reduced fat\" or \"low-fat\" on the label Always check the sell by dat e to make sure you are buying the freshest products Stores stock shelves back to front, placing newest items behind older ones. Reach in the back for the freshest items!Drink water instead of buying sodas or other sugary drinks Tap water is easy on your wallet and has zero calories! Infuse your water with fresh fruits -lemons, oranges or cucumbers for added flavor Use a reusable water bottle on the go! Save time, money and calories by skipping the chips and cookies aisles ! 1. Buy groceries when you are not hungry or too rushed 2. Use coupons -but only for items you know you will use 3. Look up and down for savings -stores stock the priciest items at eye level! 4. Shop the perimeter of the store first . Filling your cart with healthy whole foods [fresh produce/meat] leaves less room for \"junk food\" and saves money! 5. Stick to your grocery list! The more prepared you are, the less impulse purchases you make. Make a Plan! Every lifestyle change can be successful with a game plan to help guide you to healthy eating choices Make a list! Writing out a list before shopping and taking it with you is an anchor to help you stay focused and within budget Take Time! It takes time to make a plan -write out a list and shop without being rushed It may seem overwhelming at first, but like any lifestyle change, it takes a few weeks of trying before it becomes habit Continue to make physical activity and healthy eating plans, and try to maintain similar levels as you move on from this class!
