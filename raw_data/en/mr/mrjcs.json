Our hilltop campus is a place of beauty and friendliness. It embraces a proud heritage and a bold, ambitious future. WKU is located in Bowling Green, Kentucky, a city with a population of more than 50,000 and is located approximate 110 miles south of Louisville and 65 miles north of Nashville. Located on a hill overlooking the city of Bowling Green, the WKU campus is acclaimed as one of the most beautiful in the nation. The portion of the campus known as College Heights commands an impressive view of the Barren River Valley and is a distinctive landmark of the ci ty. Visit www.wku.edu/tour for a virtual campus tour. In addition to the main campus, WKU also has facilities south of the main campus on 31 -W that include the South Campus, the Center for Research and Development , and the University Farm. Outside of Bowling Green, WKU has regional campuses in Glasgow KY, Owensboro KY, and facilities that serve the Elizabethtown KY and Ft. Knox KY areas. History On March 21, 1906 the Kentucky General Assembly approved legislation to establish two teacher training institutions, or \"normal schools, \" in the state. A locating commission chose Bowling Green to be the site of one, and the W estern Kentucky State Normal School was created. The new state -supported school took over the buil ding and student body of the privately owned Southern Normal School. The owner of the Southern Normal School, Henry Hardin Cherry, had been actively involved in the campaign to establish teacher training schools and became the institution 's first president . Classes began on January 22, 1907. On February 4, 1911 the school moved to its present site on \"the Hill, \" approximately 125 feet above downtown Bowling Green and formerly the site of the Pleasant J. Potter College. Over the next decade, the curriculum focused on teacher training and certification. In 1922, the state renamed the institution Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College and authorized it to grant four -year degrees. The first such degrees were awarded in 1924. The campus expan ded in 1927, when it merged with Ogden College, a private young men 's school located on the east side of the Hill. The name was shortened to Western Kentucky State Teachers College in 1930, and the following year the first graduate degree was offered. In the 1950s and 1960s, both the curriculum and campus underwent major reorganization and expansion. In 1963 the institution merged with the Bowling Green College of Commerce. Along with the graduate school, the Bowling Green College of Commerce became a separ ate college within the academic structure. In 1965, the Board of Regents approved the formation of three more colleges: the Potter College of Liberal Arts, the College of Education, and the Ogden College of Science and Technology. On June 16, 1966, Western Kentucky State College became Western Kentucky University. More colleges and reorganization followed throughout the years as WKU continued to expand. The Bowling Green Community College was established in 1986. The College of Health and Human S ervices was established in 2002, and the Division of Extended Learning and Outreach launched in 2003. An administrative unit since 1994, University College was reorganized in 2009 as an academic unit; it now houses those units and programs formerly part o f the Bowling Green Community College, and serves as the administrative home of WKU 's regional campus programs (see below). In 2008, the WKU Board of Regents approved creation and development of a fully -independent Honors College at WKU. In 2011 th e first doctoral degrees were awarded through the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences. Finally, in 2011 and 2013 two new practice -oriented doctoral degrees, the Doctor of Nursing Practice and the Doctor of Physical Therapy, were established. WKU' s current six academic colleges are: College of Education and Behavioral Sciences College of Health and Human Services Gordon Ford College of Business Ogden College of Science and Engineering Potter College of Arts and Letters University College In additio n, the Honors College offers high -achieving students the environment of a small, highly selective college within the framework of the larger university. 6 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 Vision, Mission, Statement of Purpose, and Core Values Vision WKU -A leading American university with international reach.

This vision is further reflected in Dr. Cherry 's often -quoted reminder that \"It's what 's above the rim that counts \" and in the two University ideals expressed in the University seal: \"Life More Life \" and the Universi ty motto: \"The Spirit Makes the Master. \" Building upon these long lasting values, the following core values represent a reaffirmation of the shared purposes and beliefs upon which this strategic plan is built: Emphasis on cooperation, teamwork, and mutua l respect for individual differences in scholarship, diversity, and culture.

Course Load In general, the number of semester hours of credit that may be earned during a given term may not exceed the number of weeks of instruction. During a regular se mester, the course load for a full -time graduate student is 9 -15 hours with 9 being the minimum and 15 the maximum. Students are discouraged from requesting approval of a course overload. Graduate assistants may carry a course load of 9 -12 hours during ea ch semester while holding an assistantship appointment. Course Numbering 500-800 Courses numbered 500 and above are open to graduate students only, except as noted in the section \"Undergraduate Enrollment in Graduate Courses\". 400G Upper division underg raduate courses numbered at the 400 -level with a \"G\" designation (e.g., ENG 401G) may be taken for graduate credit. In these courses, graduate students are expected to complete additional course requirements as prescribed by the instructor. Additional work assigned to graduate students must bring the course to a level of rigor commensurate with a graduate level course. A student who has taken a particular 400 -level course may not repeat that same course for 400G level credit. A maximum of 12 hours of 400G c ourses may be applied to the master's degree. Neither specialist nor doctoral degree candidates may use any 400G -level courses to fulfill degree requirements. 000-400 Courses numbered at the 400 -level or below cannot be taken for graduate credit. Course s of this nature are counted in a student 's overall GPA, but will not affect the student 's degree GPA. 22 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 Grading and the Quality Point System Candidates for graduate degrees and/or certificates are required to maintain a combined average grade of B (3.0 gra de point average) in all course work. Grades lower than a C may not be used in meeting degree or non -degree requirements. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA in all courses taken as a graduate student (including all transfer courses and un dergraduate level courses). Students who fail to meet the 3.0 GPA requirements for the graduate program GPA (courses on approved Program of Study ) and overall cumulative GPA will not be awarded a degree or certificate. The letters A, B, C, D, F, FN, P and X are used by the University to indicate the student's academic proficiency. These letters have the following significance: A Excellent, four quality points per semester hour B Good, three quality points per semester hour C Average, two quality points per semester hour D Below Average, unsatisfactory, one quality point per semester hour F Failure, no semester hours earned and no quality points FN Failure due to non -attendance (no semester hours earned and no quality points) P Pass, credit is awarded t owards a degree, but no quality points are assigned. The \"P\" designation is restricted to specific courses approved for its use. X Incomplete. A grade of \"X\" (incomplete) is given only when a relatively small amount of work is not completed because of ill ness or other reason satisfactory to the instructor. A grade of \"X\" received by a graduate student, with the exception of thesis courses or similar projects, will automatically become an \"F\" unless removed within twelve (12) weeks of the next full term (su mmer term excluded). An incomplete must be removed within this twelve -week period regardless of whether the student is registered for additional work in the next term. A student should work with the instructor who assigned the incomplete on an independent basis to complete the necessary assignments. A grade of incomplete is not used under any circumstances as a substitute for \"F\" or \"W\". The designations of AU, W, NR, ER, and NG are not included in the determination of grade point average and are used in th e following cases: AU Auditor of a course (See below for additional information). W Officially withdrew. NR No report. Grades for an entire class were not received by the Office of the Registrar in time for processing. The designation \"NR\" is not to be us ed as a grade for individual students. ER Error in reporting. This designation is used by the Office of the Registrar when a grade is not reported for an individual student. NG No grade. A grade is not appropriate to the course. The \"NG\" designation is r estricted to specific courses approved for its use. IP In Progress. The IP designation is restricted to specific courses designed to span more than one term. Unless approved otherwise, an IP designation unresolved at the end of one year after its assignmen t will be converted to an F. Repeating Courses A graduate student is permitted to repeat any course in which a \"C\" or below was earned. An individual course may only be repeated one time. Courses that are repeatable for credit on different topics may be repeated one time per topic for equivalent credit. Only the second grade will be counted in computing the grade point average. The course and grade received for each attempt will continue to appear on the student's transcript. Recording and Changing Grades Grades are recorded by the faculty at the end of each term. No grade may be changed except on a written statement from the instructor certifying that an error has been made, or in the case of an incomplete, that the work was completed within the tim e limit. All conditions must be removed before the student will be recommended for any certificate or degree. Schedule Changes After classes begin, registration for a full -time course load and / or changes in schedules may be made only within the first si x class days of a semester or the first three days of a bi -term. Courses that do not meet at least twice during the 23 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 first six class days may be added through, but not past, the day of the second class meeting. During a semester, a student may withdraw from a course with a grade of \"W\" or \"F\" under the following conditions. It is recommended that faculty members inform students of this \"W\" period deadline. A student is permitted to withdraw from any course with a grade of \"W\" through the midpoint of the seme ster; After the midpoint of the semester, any student dropping a course receives an automatic \"F\". However, when there are extenuating circumstances, and at the discretion of the faculty member and the department head, the student may be permitted to withd raw with a \"W\" instead of an \"F\". During a bi -term a student may drop a course with a grade of \"W\" or \"F\" under the following conditions: A student is permitted to withdraw from any course with a grade of \"W\" through the midpoint of the bi -term; After the midpoint of the bi -term, any student dropping a course receives an automatic \"F\". However, when there are extenuating circumstances, and at the discretion of the faculty member and the department head, the student may be permitted to withdraw with a W ins tead of an F. Students should refer to the Registration Guide each term for specific dates that affect schedule changes. The institution reserves the privilege at all times of canceling any course for which the enrollment is not sufficient to justify its continuation and to make any other adjustments in the schedule that seem necessary. Auditing of Courses An auditor is a student who enrolls and participates in a course without expecting to receive academic credit. The same registration procedure is follow ed and the same fees are charged as for courses taken for credit. An audited course is not applicable to any degree or certificate program. Regular class attendance is expected of an auditor. Other course requirements, which may be obtained in writing from the instructor, will vary depending on the nature of the course. Students interested in auditing a course should secure permission from the instructor and discuss course requirements prior to enrolling. Failure to meet course requirements may result in th e auditor being withdrawn from the course at the request of the instructor. A successful audit will be recorded on the transcript with the designation of AU. Any change from audit to credit must be done by the last day to add a class. Changes from credit to audit must be done by the last day to drop a class with a grade of \"W\". Refunds for withdrawals from audited courses will be prorated on the same basis as refunds for withdrawals from courses taken for credit. Withdrawal For various reasons it is occas ionally necessary for a student to withdraw from the University. Prior to the midpoint of the semester, students may use TopNet to withdraw. After the midpoint of the semester, the student should report to the Office of the Registrar to initiate withdrawal procedures. Students leaving the institution without an official withdrawal will receive failing grades in all courses in which they are enrolled and endanger their future status in the institution. Students withdrawing after the midpoint of the semester, a bi-term or comparable period during a summer session must consult with their instructors as to the withdrawal grade. The official date of the withdrawal is the date the withdrawal is processed on TopNet or the written notice is received in the Office of the Registrar. Students wishing to return to WKU at a later date must submit an application for readmission prior to the deadline for submitting applications. In special circumstances, as described below, a complete withdrawal from the University after th e midpoint of a term will be considered. Request forms are available on the Office of the Registrar website at www.wku.edu/registrar/withdrawal.php . Administrative Withdrawal A request for an administrative withdrawal is initiated by the University because of a disciplinary situation or when, in the professional judgment of a health care provider, psychologist and/or university administrator, there is reason to believe a student is a substantia l threat to him/herself or interferes with the welfare of other members of the University, the education process, or the orderly operation of the University. The Vice President for Student Affairs or the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs, or th eir respective designees, will notify the student of the involuntary withdrawal, and the University Registrar will be directed to withdraw the student from all classes in which the student is currently enrolled and cancel registration that has occurred for any future terms. The Office of the Registrar will notify the student 's instructors of the withdrawal, and \"W\" grades will be recorded for the term in progress. A student who is administratively withdrawn will have a registration hold placed by the Vice P resident for Student Affairs or the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs to prevent the student from being readmitted or re-enrolled unless cleared by the appropriate administrator or the respective designee. A student may file a written appeal of an involuntary withdrawal through the office that administered the withdrawal. Tuition refund appeals for administrative withdrawals are handled in a separate procedure, and instructions may be obtained from the Bursar 's Office. 24 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 Medical Withdrawal A student may request and be considered for a medical withdrawal from all courses in a term when extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious physical or mental illness or injury, prevent the student from continuing his or her classes after the mid -point of a term, and incompletes or other arrangements with the instructors are not feasible or possible. A medical withdrawal must be substantiated with appropriate documentation from the attending health care provider. Once the rationale for a medical withdrawal has been validated by the Office of the Registrar, the student 's instructors will be sent notification of the withdrawal, and \"W\" grades will be recorded for each course. A student who requests a medical withdrawal, or an individual requesting a withdrawal on behalf of the student who is physically or mentally unable to request the withdrawal, should contact the Office of the Registrar to obtain medical withdrawal procedures. Tuition refund appeals for medical withdrawals are handled in a separate procedure , and instructions may be obtained from the Bursar 's Office. Military Withdrawal Students who are members of any branch of the United States Armed Services, including the National Guard, who are called to active duty while enrolled at WKU are entitled to the following options: 1. Students may work with each individual instructor to determine if an incomplete grade is appropriate, or 2. If an incomplete grade is not a viable option, the student will be permitted to withdraw either from individual courses or from the entire schedule of classes. A full refund of tuition and fees will be issued for those courses from which the student has withdrawn. Students who are called to active duty while enrolled should contact the Office of the Registrar to initiate the withdr awal process. An official copy of the military orders must be presented to invoke this special withdrawal and refund process. Retroactive Withdrawal A student who leaves the University for extenuating circumstances without an official withdrawal during th e term of departure may apply for a retroactive withdrawal. The student must present supporting documentation that demonstrates serious and compelling reasons justifying the withdrawal and extenuating circumstances justifying its retroactive nature; poor a cademic performance that is not attributed to non - academic extenuating circumstances is not a consideration for retroactive withdrawal. A student may appeal for a retroactive withdrawal within two calendar years following the end of the term for which wit hdrawal is requested. A student need not be enrolled at WKU at the time the application for retroactive withdrawal is submitted. An appellate board will review the request for a retroactive withdrawal. The board will consider the following factors, includ ing, but not limited to: 1. Documentation of extenuating circumstances. 2. Written letter of support from an academic administrator, faculty member, advisor or other university professional who is familiar with the student 's situation. If a retroactive withdrawa l is approved, the Office of the Registrar will notify the student 's instructors and department heads of the request for a retroactive withdrawal, and they will be given 14 calendar days to raise objections if the student 's classroom performance was such t hat a withdrawal (W) would not be appropriate. If objections are raised by the instructor or department head, the Office of the Registrar will be informed of the objection, and the student will not receive a \"W\" in the class. A tuition refund is not grante d for a retroactive withdrawal. Minimum Credit Requirement Master's Degree The minimum semester credit requirement for master 's degrees is thirty (30) credits. Individual programs may require more credits. Only those courses listed on a graduate Program of Study are applicable toward meeting graduate degree credit requirements. Six (6) to fifteen (15) thesis credits may be applied to meet the 30 credit minimum required for the degree. However, additional thesis hours may be taken to complete the thesis and will appear on the student's transcript. Specialist in Education Degree The minimum semester credit requirement for the Specialist in Education degree is thirty (30) credits beyond the master 's degree or sixty (60) credits for programs that do not re quire a master 's degree for admission. Individual programs may require more credits. Only those courses listed on a graduate Program of Study are applicable toward meeting the Specialist in Education degree credit requirement. Six (6) to fifteen (15) thesi s credits may be applied to meet the 30 credit minimum required for the degree. However, additional thesis hours may be taken to complete the thesis and will appear on the student's transcript. 25 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 Doctoral Degree The minimum semester credit requirement f or the doctoral degree is sixty (60) credits post -baccalaureate or thirty (30) credits post -masters in a related field. Individual programs may require more credits. Only those courses listed on a graduate Program of Study are applicable toward meeting gra duate degree credit requirements. Twelve (12) to thirty (30) dissertation credits may be applied to the 60 credit minimum required for the post -baccalaureate to doctoral degree. Six (6) to fifteen (15) dissertation credits may be applied to the 30 credit m inimum required for the post -masters to doctoral degree. Additional dissertation hours may be taken to complete the dissertation and will appear on the student's transcript. Program of Stud y All graduate degree and certificate seeking students must sub mit a planned Program of Study to the Graduate School. The Program of Study serves as a contract between the studen t and the University and defines the minimum requirements for the degree or certificate. The Program of Study is developed jointly by the gradu ate advisor and the student. Students in graduate education programs which lead to teacher certification must have their programs of study approved by the Teacher Certification Officer prior to submission to the Graduate School. Final approval rests with the Graduate School. Filing Deadlines Master's and Specialist degree students and graduate certificate seeking students must file the Program of Study within the first semester of graduate study. If a Program of Study is not on file with the Graduate Sc hool, a student will not be permitted to enroll in the following semesters. Doctoral degree students must file the Program of Study prior to Admission to Candidacy. Research Tool Requirement All graduate programs must ensure student engagement in research and/or appropriate professional practice and training experience. This requirement is defined by the individual academic programs and may include but is not limited to such experiences as completion of a research tool course, successful completion a fore ign language examination, or professional practice experience. *For the 2014 -2015 academic year and prior, students enrolled in a degree program which defines a specific course as the research tool requirement must earn a grade of \"B\" or better in that co urse. Transfer Credits The total number of credits students may apply to their degree program from credits earned prior to admission to the program (i.e. graduate courses taken as an undergraduate or non -degree seeking graduate student, transfer courses, previous master's or certificate courses , etc. ) may not exceed 12 hours. Amendments to Program of Study A Program of Study may be amended through the course of the student's graduate education program. Any change in the approved Program of Study must be specified on a \"Program of Study Change\" form, approved by the advisor, and submitted to the Graduate School for final approval. Course changes include the addition or deletion of a course, the substitution of a transfer course, or substitution of another course offered by WKU for a course on the program. The final approval should be obtained prior to enrollment in the course(s) affected by the requested Program of Study change. Doctoral Students Admission to Candidacy is required for doctoral students. Students are required to pass a qualifying exam or equivalent assessment prior to Admission to Candidacy. Once doctoral students have registered for any portion of the final 9 course credits (excluding dissertation/clinical residency credits), they shoul d apply for the qualifying examination or assessment with their dissertation chair or primary advisor. Doctoral students should submit their applications for candidacy after they complete the requirements to be admitted as a candidate for the degree. Thesis, Specialist Project, or Dissertation Students pursuing the master's degree (thesis option) or specialist degree must complete at least 6 hours of credit in 599-Thesis Research and Writing or 699 -Specialist Project. Students pursuing a doctoral degree requiring a dissertation must have at least 9 hours of credit in 799 -Dissertation Research. All thesis, specialist project, and dissertation hours will use a pass/ fail grading system. Guidelines and deadlines are online at www.wku.edu/graduate/students/thesis.php . It is the student's responsibility to obtain and comply with these guidelines. Thesis, Specialist Project and Dissertation Committees Students pursuing graduate programs requiring a thesis, specialist project or dissertation are mentored by a 26 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 committee of graduate faculty members. The student in conjunction with the committee chairperson identifies graduate faculty members to serve on the committee. Master's degree committees must include the chairperson/thesis advisor and a minimum of two additional graduate faculty members. Doctoral committees, in addition to the chairperson, must include a minimum of three additional committee members as part of the committee. In some cases, a n individual who is not a part of WKU's faculty may be asked to serve as an additional member on a thesis, specialist project, or dissertation committee. Prior to this service, such an individual must qualify and be recommended for adjunct membership on W KU's graduate faculty and be approved by the Dean of the Graduate School. Students may assist in the formation of this committee but final approval of the constituency of this committee lies with the Dean of the Graduate School. Once the committee is iden tified, then a completed Committee and Topic Selection form must be submitted for approval to the Dean of the Graduate School. Maintaining Matriculation If the thesis, specialist, or dissertation project is not completed during the initial period of regis tration for this credit, the student must maintain matriculation by enrolling in a minimum of (1) credit hour of a 600 (thesis), 700 (project), or 800 (dissertation) course until the thesis or project is submitted and approved by the Graduate School. Furth er, students must be enrolled in a minimum of one (1) credit hour of maintaining matriculation during the term in which the defense is held. Enrollment in matriculation courses does not result in a grade or credit toward any degree or non -degree program. Defense A defense covering the thesis, specialist project, or dissertation must be completed if required by the degree program. The defense usually consists of a public presentation and an oral examination of the candidate's research focus and background. The defense is arranged by the committee chair and the student, and is given before the final draft is completed. The defense is an oral examination only. Each member of the committee should be given a minimum of two (2) weeks notification before the d efense to read and review the research. Examinations in which any committee member has had insufficient time to prepare should be rescheduled. Following the approval of defense by the student's committee, t he thesis, specialist project, or dissertation is submitted to the Graduate School for final approval and publication. Submission deadlines are at www.wku.edu/graduate/students/thesis/deadlines.php . Outcome Students will pass the defense if no more than one member casts a dissenting vote. If a student does not pass this culminating assessment, the committee may grant students permission to attempt a second defense which will be administered under conditions stipulated by the committee. A student who has failed the defense may be re -examined once more by the committee. Failure to pass the second defense will result in dismissal from the program. Students who are dismissed from the program due to a failed defense are ineligible to reapply for the same graduate degree program at any time in the future. Comprehensive Examination/Capstone All graduate degree programs require that either a written or an oral examination be satisfactorily completed, or that an approved capstone course be successfully completed. The comprehensive exam and thesis or specialist project defense may be combined in those degree programs that require a defense. Examinations for professional licensure or certification may not be used for, or in place of, the comprehensive examination. Students must meet the following guidelines bef ore they are permitted to attempt the comprehensive examination: File an approved Program of Study with the Graduate School. Complete at least one half of the course work in an approved program minor (if applicable). Have no more than nine hours remaining on the approved program. Complete additional requirements as specified by faculty in the program department. The major advisor or thesis/dissertation chair, in consultation with the student, appoints the oral examination committee consisting of at least t wo graduate faculty members. If the student's program includes a minor, or a significant amount of course work in an area outside the major, one of the committee members must represent that area. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all commit tee members are available when scheduling an examination. The committee chair and department head are responsible for submitting written notice of the results of the comprehensive examination to the student and the Graduate School. The Graduate School wi ll not accept examination results from students. The comprehensive exam is graded pass/fail determined by a majority committee vote. Minimum Registration for Comprehensive Exam A student must be registered for a minimum of one (1) credit during the term i n which the comprehensive exam is 27 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 given. Outcome A student who has failed the comprehensive examination may be re -examined once more by the committee. Failure to pass the second comprehensive examination will result in dismissal from the program. Stude nts who are dismissed from the program due to a failed comprehensive examination are ineligible to reapply for the same graduate degree program at any time in the future. Graduation Checklist It is the responsibility of the student to file all forms and materials as specified in the guidelines set forth in this catalog. Failure to do so will result in delays of degree completion. The Registrar's Office will post degrees and mail diplomas to graduating students within 6 to 8 weeks after the end of the se mester. - Approved Program of Study - Transcripts for transfer credit received and approved - Approved Program of Study changes approved on Program of Study Change form (if applicable) - Approved Topic and Committee Selection form (thesis/specialist project /dissertation students ) - Succ essful completion of all course work on the Program of Study - Thesis/ specialist project/ dissertation submitted to the Graduate School (if applicable) - Successful completion of Comprehensive Exam/Capstone - Application for Graduation and fee received in the Registrar's Office - All grades pos ted on transcript 28 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 Policies and Procedures The Graduate School policies and procedures must be followed and met before a degree is granted. These requirements are described in this catalog and in p rogram documents provided by the academic departments. The University reserves the right to make changes as necessary in course offerings, curricula, academic policies, and other rules and regulations affecting students, to be effective when determined by the University. The Dean of the Graduate School is charged with the administration of policies regulating and relating to Graduate School. The Dean also certifies that candidates have fulfilled their requirements for advanced degrees. The Graduate Council is comprised of the Dean of the Graduate School, three faculty members elected from the Graduate Faculty of their college, and a graduate student from each college elected by graduate students from his or her college. The Council reviews and recommends gra duate policies including course and program proposals, degree and graduation requirements, and rules and regulations governing faculty -student relations. The Graduate Faculty consists of faculty members who upon the recommendation of department heads, coll ege deans, and Graduate Council have been approved by the Dean of the Graduate School to instruct, advise, and mentor graduate students. Privacy Policy The Graduate School will not disclose information to a third party regardless of association to the stu dent (e.g., spouse, parent, friend, or other family member) without signed, written permission from the student. This is to protect the student 's identification and ensure student information is not misused in any way. Student Responsibility The student i s responsible for becoming informed of and for fulfilling all degree and certificate related requirements. If requirements for graduation have not been met, the degree will not be granted. In no case will a regulation be waived or an exception granted beca use a student pleads ignorance of the regulation. Graduate Advising Upon admission to a graduate program, each student is assigned a major advisor from the graduate faculty in the respective department. Students pursuing a thesis, specialist project or di ssertation will select a graduate faculty member to chair his or her research project at which time the student's primary advisor will be updated to reflect the committee chair. Although student advising at Western Kentucky University is specifically desi gned to assist students as they progress through degree programs, it is the responsibility of all students to be thoroughly familiar with all rules, regulations, and requirements pertaining to graduate study. Change of Advisor Students who wish to change advisors must request an advisor change by notify ing their current advisor, the proposed advisor, and the Graduate School. Experiential Learning Credit WKU does not provide graduate credit for experiential learning, credit by exam, or professional cert ificates unless programs (degree and non -degree) specifically seek approval through the Graduate Council and have ensured that such credit is consistent with the WKU mission, that the learning outcomes are at the graduate level , and that the credit is comp arable to other WKU graduate courses . Transfer Credit A maximum of 12 transfer credits may be used in any degree program. However, some programs may have more restrictive policies regarding the number of hours that will be accepted in a particular progra m. To transfer credits, the following requirements must be met: 1. The credit(s) must have been earned at an accredited graduate institution. 2. The course work must be designated as graduate credit. 3. Courses to be transferred must be awarded a grade of \"B\" or b etter. 4. Credits must be within the six -year time limit , or ten -year time limit for doctoral degrees. The \"Transfer Credit Practices\" report published by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers is the reference used in eva luating credits. Transfer credits taken during the final semester of a program will delay program completion until official transcripts have been received in the Graduate School. In cooperative or joint programs with other universities, credits earned in the program 29 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 at these institutions are not considered transfer credits. A majority of credits applied toward certificate requirements must be earned at Western Kentucky University. Undergraduate Student Enrollment in Graduate Courses Undergraduate student s at Western Kentucky University may enroll in graduate -level courses not to exceed 12 hours . Several conditions must be met to facilitate enrollment: 1. Students obtain approvals and submit an Undergraduate Student Taking Graduate Courses form to the Graduat e School. 2. Undergraduate students must have declared a major or minor in the subject area or a closely related area for which the graduate course is offered. 3. Students must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 in the major or minor area to which the graduat e coursework is closely related. 4. Students may enroll in no more than 15 hours of coursework (graduate and undergraduate combined) in any semester in which enrollment in graduate -level courses occurs. All graduate coursework will be on the graduate transcr ipt. To move the coursework to the undergraduate transcript students should contact the Registrar's office. Joint Undergraduate -Master's Degree Programs (JUMP) Joint Undergraduate -Master's Degree Programs (JUMP) are offered in approved graduate program s including Accountancy, Applied Economics, Architectural and Manufacturing Science, Chemistry, Organizational Communication, Organizational Leadership, Psychological Science, and Religious Studies . JUMP programs provid e academically outstanding students the opportunity to complete both an undergraduate and graduate degree in approximately five years. Qualified students who have been admitted to a JUMP program may complete a maximum of 18 graduate hours as an undergraduate student and count 12 of those hou rs on both the undergraduate and graduate transcript. Students will apply to Graduate School upon or before earning more than 18 graduate hours. Time Limitation for Completion of Degrees Master 's, Certificate, and Specialist Degrees All requirements for graduate degrees must be completed within six years from the date the first course is taken. Failure to complete a degree in six years will result in the loss of all credits taken outside of the time limit. Students may request an extension to be approved by the Dean of the Graduate School. Extensions are considered on a case -by-case basis, and a student is not guaranteed approval. All records are purged after six years from the date of last enrollment at the university or degree completion. Doctoral Progr ams All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within ten years of initial enrollment in the doctoral program. Failure to complete a degree within the specified time limit will result in those courses not being counted towards the doctoral degree. Students may request a one -time, one -year extension to be considered by the Dean of the Graduate School on a case - by-case basis and a student is not guaranteed approval. Currency of Courses Master 's, Certificate, and Specialist Degrees Courses to be used as part of a Masters, Certificate, or Specialist program should be no older than six years at the time of graduation. Courses older than six years may be counted toward program requirements if approved by the program director, college Dean, and the Dean of the Graduate School. Students should check with their advisors to determine whether they are eligible to seek approval for an exception to the course currency policy. Courses to be transferred must also meet transfer credit policies. Doctoral Prog rams Courses to be used as part of a doctoral program should be no older than ten years at the time of graduation. Courses older than ten years may be counted toward program requirements if approved by the program director, college Dean, and the Dean of th e Graduate School. Students should check with their doctoral advisors to determine whether they are eligible to see approval for an exception to the course currency policy. Courses to be transferred must also meet transfer credit policie s. Academic Offens es The maintenance of academic integrity is of fundamental importance to the University. Thus, it should be clearly understood that acts of plagiarism or any other form of cheating will not be tolerated and that anyone committing such acts risks punishment of a serious nature. A student who believes a faculty member has dealt unfairly with him/her in a course involving academic offenses; such as plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty, may seek relief through the Student Complaint Procedure. Questions about 30 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 the complaint procedure should be directed to the Student Ombuds Officer at (270) 745 -6169. Academic Dishonesty - Students who commit any act of academic dishonesty may receive from the instructor a failing grade in that portion of the coursework i n which the act is detected or a failing grade in the course without possibility of withdrawal. The faculty member may also present the case to the Office of Judicial Affairs for disciplinary sanctions. Cheating - No student shall receive or give assistanc e not authorized by the instructor in taking an examination or in the preparation of an essay, laboratory report, problem assignment, or other project that is submitted for purposes of grade determination. Plagiarism - To represent written work taken from another source as one 's own is plagiarism. Plagiarism is a serious offense. The academic work of a student must be his/her own. One must give any author credit for source material borrowed from him/her. To lift content directly from a source without givin g credit is a flagrant act. To present a borrowed passage without reference to the source after having changed a few words is also plagiarism. Other Types of Academic Dishonesty - Other types of academic offenses, such as the theft or sale of tests, should be reported to the Office of Judicial Affairs at (270) 745 -5429 for judicial sanction. Academic Standing (Probation & Dismissal) Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 grade point average (GPA) for all courses taken at WKU and those graduate courses trans ferred to WKU to fulfill graduate program requirements. Students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in both the program and the cumulative (overall) GPA to earn a degree or certificate. If a student 's overall GPA falls below 3.0, the studen t will be placed on academic probation. The student will receive notification o f the probationary status. Students placed on academic probation are not eligible for graduate assistantship appointments. The student will have one additional full -time semest er or the equivalent (9 semester hours) to remove the academic probation by raising their cumulative GPA to a 3.0 or better . If the GPA remains below a 3.0 after completing the one semester of full -time course work or the equivalent (9 hours), the student may not register for any additional graduate credit at WKU and will be dismissed from the Graduate School. Individual academic programs may apply more restrictive criteria regarding probation and dismissal. Students may be dismissed from the program for h aving failed twice the final comprehensive examination for the graduate degree. Dismissal from a program will result in dismissal from the Graduate School An academically dismissed student who wishes to be readmitted to his/her program must submit an Ap peal of Graduate Policy, and, in consultation with their advisor, a written academic plan detailing how the required 3.0 GPA can be obtained. The Appeal of Graduate Policy must be submitted to the Graduate School the semester following dismissal and provid e evidence for the support of the graduate faculty in the academic program. Each case will be reviewed by the Dean of the Graduate School for consideration of readmission. An academically dismissed student who wishes to be readmitted to Graduate School as a non -degree seeking student or apply to another program must complete a new admission application. Readmitted students will remain on probation and have one full -time semester or the equivalent (9 hours) to remove the academic probation by attaining a 3 .0 cumulative GPA. Readmitted students who do not attain the requi site 3.0 GPA will be dismissed with no possibility of readmission until a period of three years has elapsed. Non -Academic Dismissal Students may also be dismissed from programs for rea sons other than failure to maintain a satisfactory grade point average. Expectations regarding student conduct are described in the Western Kentucky University Student Handbook and apply to students in all programs. Additional program -specific policies reg arding student conduct and dismissal from a program for non-academic reasons may also apply. Students should contact their advisors for more information regarding expectations for appropriate student conduct. Appeal of Graduate Regulations The Graduate Co uncil, which represents the graduate faculty, reviews and recommends policies pertinent to the graduate program. In that capacity, the Graduate Council functions as the hearing body for requests for waiver of graduate policies and regulations. Requests for waiver of Graduate School regulations such as minimum admission requirements, time limit for program completion, candidacy requirements, etc., that apply to all graduate programs are considered by the Dean of the Graduate School and the Graduate Council. The student must present the request in writing, along with supportive documentation, to the Graduate School. Requests for waiver of departmental graduate requirements such as higher grade point average, undergraduate preparation, prior certification, demo nstrated performance, etc., that are unique to the particular program are considered by the departmental graduate committee. The request must be made in writing to the graduate advisor or the department head in order for it to b e considered by the graduate committee. The graduate advisor or department head will inform the student of the outcome. In the event that the student is not satisfied with the college committee 's decision, the Graduate Council will act upon the appeal. The Graduate School informs the student of the outcome. Students failing to meet 31 Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 admission requirements should consult the catalog statement on Alternate A dmission Requirements. Student Complaint Procedure The student complaint procedure for resolving a complaint concerning a faculty m ember is outlined below in four steps: Step 1 Faculty Member. The first step is for the student to discuss the complaint with the faculty member involved. If the faculty member is no longer employed by the University, the student should go directly to the department head who will contact and represent the former faculty member. If the complaint involves a grade, the student must take the complaint to the faculty member within the first two weeks of the first regular semester (fall; spring) following the ass ignment of the grade. It is hoped that the complaint may be satisfactorily dealt with at this level. Step 2 Department Level. If the student and the faculty member are unable to resolve the complaint, the student may take the complaint to the faculty membe r's department head. Written notification of the complaint must be given to the department head within two weeks after the meeting with the faculty member. It is the responsibility of the department head to arrange for a conference where the student, facul ty member and the department head will be present for discussion. Neither the faculty member nor the student will be allowed representation at the conference. The department head shall hear both sides of the complaint and shall attempt to mediate a settlem ent. The department head shall keep a written record of the proceedings, including the recommended solution. The department head 's recommended solution is to be considered by both the faculty member and the student as a recommendation and not as a decision that is binding. Step 3 College Level. Should the student be unable to receive the satisfaction desired at the departmental level, the complaint may be taken to the college level. Written notification of the complaint must be submitted to the college dean or his designated representative within two weeks after the conference with the department head (Step 2). Upon receipt of the notification, the college dean or his representative shall provide the student a copy of the procedural guidelines to be followed by the College Complaint Committee. The procedural guidelines shall provide for a conference with both the student and the faculty member present for joint discussion of the complaint with the committee. The College Complaint Committee will be responsible for scheduling the conference within two weeks following the submission of a written complaint to the chairman of the College Complaint Committee including as much detail as the student cares to include. The written complaint should clearly state what is considered to be unreasonable and/or unfair practices or procedures. Neither the faculty member nor the student will be allowed representation at the conference. The College Complaint Committee shall hear both sides of the complaint and render a decision. The decision shall be sent in writing to the Provost and Vice -President for Academic Affairs, with a copy being sent as a matter of record to the student, faculty member, faculty member 's department head and the faculty member 's college dean. The Office of the Provost and Vice -President for Academic Affairs shall be responsible for enforcing the decision of the college committee. The Office of the Provost and Vice -President for Academic Affairs shall not enforce the decision until two weeks after the decisi on is made by the college committee. The purpose of the two week delay is to provide either the student or the faculty member an opportunity to submit a formal written notice of appeal to the University Complaint Committee. Step 4 University Level. Should the student or the faculty member desire to appeal the decision of the College Complaint Committee, a formal written notice of appeal may be submitted to the University Complaint Committee chair, with a copy to the Provost and Vice -President for Academic A ffairs, within two weeks of the decision of the College Complaint Committee. The chair of the University Complaint Committee will provide the student and the faculty member involved with a copy of the University Complaint Committee 's Procedural Guidelines. The University Com -plaint Committee will secure copies of the written proceedings from the department head and the College Complaint Committee. The University Complaint Committee will schedule a conference where the faculty member and the student jointly discuss the issue. Neither the faculty member nor the student will be allowed representation at the conference. The committee 's decision will be sent to the Provost and Vice -President for Academic Affairs, with a copy being sent as a matter of record to the student, faculty member, faculty member 's department head and the faculty member 's college dean.

Field Experience Policy WKU teacher preparation programs are designed to meet the University's standards for baccalaureate degrees, master's degrees, specialist degrees, and certification -only programs, as we ll as the Kentucky standards for the designated teaching certificate. All professional education programs require completion of a variety of diverse and focused field experiences in appropriate off -campus Primary -Grade 12 school settings as well as student teaching or equivalent experience. The number of required hours of field experiences varies by program; however, a minimum of 200 hours of approved off -campus field experience is required in professional education courses prior to the student teaching exp erience or equivalent. The candidate is responsible for documenting completed hours, date, and setting. In addition, all programs require one 16 -week or two 8 - week full -time student teaching placements, or approved equivalent. Every effort is made to prov ide teacher candidates with field experiences in diverse settings (based on socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, language, and exceptionalities of students) in order to ensure that they are prepared to help all students learn. Prior to visiting any school , a student must have on file in the Office of Teacher Services a current TB risk assessment, a current physical exam, and a current Kentucky criminal background check. Students are responsible for the expenses incurred in complying with this requirement. Recommendation for Initial Teacher Certification To be recommended for initial certification at the baccalaureate level (including post -baccalaureate certification - only programs), an applicant must document: Completion of approved program in each desired certification area(s); Passing score(s) on the PRAXIS II exam(s) or other assessments required for each desired teaching area(s) (see www.ets.org/praxis/ky for the most current list of required assessments); Achievement of at least a 2.75 GPA overall, in each certifiable major(s) and minor(s), and in professional education courses (graduate students are required to maintain a 3.0 GPA or above in all graduate coursework); Attainment of at least a \"C\" in all p rofessional education courses, including EDU 489 and student teaching. Comprehensive Examination/ Culminating Assessment/Capstone Experience All CEBS master's programs require completion of a culminating assessment, such as a thesis and thesis defense; an action research project and presentation; a Teacher Work Sample; or a comprehensive exam. General information regarding the policy for eligibility and administration of comprehensive exams may be found at www.wku.edu/cebs/programs/graduate . Eligibility requirements include successful completion of EDFN 500 or other research foundations course prior to the student 's final semester. Policy on Expiration of Graduate Courses and Programs Leading to Professional Education Certification The following policy applies only to graduate certification -only programs, endorsement programs, Planned Fifth -Year (Rank II) programs, and Planned Sixth Year (Rank I) programs: Course work for programs leading to certi fication in professional education must be aligned with current standards. Some older courses are not aligned with current standards, and thus it may not be appropriate to count them in a student 's program. Generally speaking, courses used to satisfy progr am requirements in programs leading to professional education certification should be no more than 10 years old at the time that the certification program is Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 36 written. Decisions about whether older courses may be used will be made on a case -by-case basis by the department head of the student 's major. Students may be required to demonstrate proficiency related to current course content if they wish to satisfy program requirements using courses taken more than 10 years prior to when the student 's program of st udies is written. All requirements for graduate certification -only, endorsement, Planned Fifth -Year, and Planned Sixth -Year programs must be completed within 10 years from the date when the program was written. Students may request an extension, which must be approved by the Dean of the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences on recommendation of the department head. If the Commonwealth of Kentucky makes changes in certification requirements, students seeking certification may be required to modify their programs of study to meet the new requirements. Non -Degree Programs Students who wish to pursue a Planned Fifth -Year/Rank II or Planned Sixth -Year/Rank I program must submit an application to the Graduate School. Upon completion of the non -degree program, individuals must contact the certification officer in the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences. The certification officer will then certify to Kentucky 's Education Professional Standards Board that rank requirements have been met. Enr ollment in a Planned Sixth -Year/Rank I program may not provide eligibility for a federal student loan, and completion of a Planned Fifth/Sixth -Year non -degree program may not be accepted in states other than Kentucky in determining pay status. Additional i nformation about teacher certification may be found at www.wku.edu/teacherservices/teacher_cert/index.php . Candidates for the Planned Fifth -Year/Rank II, Planned Sixth -Year/Rank I, Advanced Certification, or Endorsement should furnish the WKU Office of Teacher Certification the following documents: A completed Application for Kentucky Teacher Certification or Change in Salary Rank (TC -1), Official transcripts of all graduate and u ndergraduate course work, Verification by the superintendent or personnel director of full -time classroom teaching experience at the appropriate grade level(s), and Passing PRAXIS II Specialty Area test scores for each area of certification and the Principles of Learning and Teaching test score for appropriate grade range (if applicable). Planned Fifth -Year/Rank II Programs The School of Teacher Education provides Planned Fifth -Year/Rank II programs in Elementary Education for Teacher Leader s, Middle Grades Education for Teacher Leaders, and Secondary Education for Teacher Leaders for students who do not meet the admission requirements of a degree program or who want greater flexibility with regard to time allowed for completion, transfer lim itations, and selection of courses than is permitted in degree programs. Admission to a Planned Fifth -Year/Rank II program requires completion of a baccalaureate degree and documentation of certification or eligibility for certification consistent with the desired Planned Fifth - Year/Rank II program. According to state regulations, an applicant may be admitted to a program in a professional education specialty for which the applicant 's certification was issued, in an academic subject for which the applican t's certification was issued, or in professional education with emphasis in an academic subject for which certification was issued. Although the Planned Fifth -Year/Rank II program does not result in the master 's degree, it does result in Rank II salary cla ssification in Kentucky, renews the teaching certificate, and permits en try into some Planned Sixth -Year /Rank I programs.

Ransdell (270 ) 745 -4662 Programs Offered Educ ational Leadership (EdD) Education and Behavioral Science Studies (MAE) Doctor of Education: Educational Leadership, Ref. #0010 Educational Leadership Doctoral Program www.wku.edu/cebs/doctorate doctoral.studies@wku.edu Tony Norman, Director 1906 College Heights Blvd. #91030 Phone: (270) 745 -3061 | FAX: (270) 745 -3162 The Ed .D. in Educational Leadership provides know ledge and skills for its graduates to become effective change agents within educational and education -related environments. The program is designed to prepare scholarly practitioners whose program content and experiences emphasize application to the real w orld. The primary purpose of the program is to develop the ability of education and education -related organizational practitioners to obtain and synthesize knowledge for the solution of institutional problems and practices. The program provides value -added opportunities for candidates to develop breadth and depth in understanding leadership, policy, and applied research methodologies. In addition, program experiences contribute to the development of future leaders who will creatively generate new knowledg e, critically con - serve valuable and useful ideas, and responsibly transform those understandings through writing, teaching and application. The dissertation for all areas of emphasis is expected to contribute knowledge and under - standing of a critical i ssue drawn from the candidate's field of practice and be applicable for improving educational organizations. The Ed .D. in Educational Leadership: encourages participants to become practitioner scholars by promoting skills and knowledge in practice - based settings and to gain scholarship and experience in applied behaviors; provides opportunities to explore a range of career specialties in various settings so that participants can make sound career choices; models interdisciplinary and inter -institutional co llaboration through the program's management and accountability structures; provides participants with leadership capacity to bring about changes that enhance student learning; and provides interdisciplinary research preparation focused on contextually b ased problems central to future global competitiveness.

Alternate Route to Principal Certification Kentucky Senate Bill #77 made it possible for higher education institutions with approve d school administration certification programs to provide alternate route to certification programs upon application and approval by the Education Professional Standards Board (EPSB). Western Kentucky University (WKU) has an EPSB approved Alternate Route t o Principal Certification program. Under the provisions of Senate Bill #77 and state regulations, Western Kentucky University established procedures for the alternate route program as follows: 1. A local district superintendent must nominate a candidate for t he Alternate Route to Principal Certification program at WKU. The letter of nomination must specifically state that the superintendent is recommending the candidate to the school council and will be employed for the coming academic year if selected by the school council. 2. Once the letter of nomination and a letter of application from the candidate are received, WKU will admit the candidate to the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program providing the candidate is accepted by the Graduate School. 3. WKU will provide the candidate with a letter stating that the candidate has been admitted to the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program, thus, under the provision of Senate Bill #77 and state regulations, making the candidate eligible to intervie w and accept a principal position. It should be noted that these candidates have the same eligibility status as any other candidate who has completed a regular certification program and already has the certification endorsement. 4. WKU will also notify the Of fice of Teacher Certification/Services that the candidate has been admitted to the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program. 5. If the candidate is offered the position, the superintendent must provide verification of employment to WKU and the candi date. WKU will assign the candidate an advisor, who will prepare the student's program. The candidate will submit the verification of employment and a TC -TP to the Office of Teacher Certification/Services. That office will sign and verify the enrollment of the candidate in the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program and return the TC -TP to the candidate. The candidate will then forward the TC -TP with the verification of employment as a principal (or assistant principal) and the appropriate fee pa yment. 6. EPSB will issue the candidate a two -year, Temporary Provisional Certificate for All Grades Principal. The candidate will have two -years to complete all requirements for the principal certification, after which the candidate receives a regular Provis ional Certification. Alternate Route to Superintendent Certification Program The alternate route program enables the district to consider the best candidates for positions of superintendent or assistant superintendent, including candidates who have not pr eviously completed requirements for the superintendent's certification endorsement or are otherwise not eligible for certification under traditional program guidelines. Admission Requirements 1. A letter from the employing district signed by the superintende nt and/or board chairman must be sent to WKU indicating the desire to employ the named candidate as an assistant superintendent or superintendent and requesting the named candidate to be admitted to the Alternative Route to Superintendent Cert ification program. 2.

Degree Requirements (30-37 hours) This program is designed to develop Teacher Leaders who can positively impact student learning in their classrooms and schools. Courses and experiences include Professional Learning Communities in which students interact with other graduate students from various content areas and grade levels to discuss and work on real world challenges and promising practices they encounter in sch ools. The program is divided into two instructional components. The first component, Professional Education, provides advanced level pedagogy, leadership, and content related to Kentucky Teacher Standards and applicable to all P -12 teachers working in the wide gamut of developmental levels and content areas. The second component, Specialization, directs the candidate into an individual program in content, pedagogy, and/or areas of professional growth concurrent with the goals of each candidate. An Action Re search Project for Teacher Leaders, focusing on a classroom, school, or district issue, is the capstone for the completion of the program. During the first course in the program, TCHL 500 Foundations of Teacher Leadership, students will complete an assessm ent process that will be used in determining which TCHL core courses they must take (see Important Note below). Important Note: While enrolled in TCHL 500, students will use several documents, including their KTIP assessments or in -kind examples, disposit ions self -surveys, referrals from school personnel, and their respective School Improvement Plan, to develop with Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 84 their respective program advisors individualized programs of study of 32 hours related to Kentucky Teacher Standards and professional goals. E ach student's program of study will include some or all of the TCHL courses, plus additional education -related or content courses. Students are expected to enroll in TCHL 500 at the beginning of their program and in TCHL 560 toward the end, and in general, students should complete the professional education core (the TCHL courses except TCHL 560) as early as possible. Students sh ould consult with their advisors regarding the optimal sequence of course work to meet their professional goals. Professional Educ ation Component - 10-16 hours TCHL 500 Foundations of Teacher Leadership (3 hours) TCHL 530 Curriculum Development (3 hours) *TCHL 545 Classroom Instructional Strategies and Management (3 hours) *TCHL 555 School and Classroom Assessment (3 hours) TCHL 559 Action Research Design (1 hour) TCHL 560 Action Research Capstone for Teacher Leaders (3 hours) *All students must complete these courses or pass proficiency evaluations for these courses. Mid-Point Assessment Requirements To ensure master's candidates ar e proficient on Advanced Level Teacher Standards, it is recommended that a majority of the Critical Performances associated with the above TCHL courses be completed prior to the Specialization Component. Students must achieve an average of 3.0 on all Criti cal Performances and an average score of 3 on dispositions even though a candidate's program of studies does not include the courses. Additional course work may be required based on the assessment results. Specialization Component - 14-21 hours Advisor -approved content -specific course ( 6 hours) Electives: 8 -15 hours With advisor approval, students may select appropriate elective courses from: the discipline in which the student is certified; academic disciplines related to P -12 common core stand ards; CEBS content courses in exceptional education, interdisciplinary early childhood education, library media education, literacy, or psychology; approved endorsements (e.g., English as a Second Language, Gifted and Talented Education, Environmental Educ ation, Instructional Computer Technology); and courses identified as prerequisites for Instructional Leader programs.

Master of Arts in Teaching: Middle Grades Education (grades 5 -9) for Initial Certification, Ref. #0458 The MAT in Middle Grades Education for Initial Certification leads to i nitial certification in Middle Grades Education (grades 5 -9) for qualified individuals with bachelor's degrees and content majors (or equivalent for those who qualify for temporary provisional certification in approved areas). Course work and experiences i n the program provide students who have a deep knowledge of their respective disciplines, but no background in professional education, with the pedagogical knowledge and skills to become highly qualified educators in their fields. Upon completion of the pr ogram, graduates will be professional educators who possess the dispositions and skills to apply state -of-the-art, evidence -based, best teaching practices to increase student achievement. There are three concentrations in this program: 1. Alternate Route to C ertification Concentration for English/Language Arts, Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science (EARC) 2. Standard Concentration for English/Language Arts, Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science (ESTN) 3. Residency Concentration for Science and Mathematics (ERS M) (e.g. GSKyTeach) Note that Concentrations 1 and 2 appear identical; however, the differences between these concentrations are characterized by students with and without a temporary provisional teaching certificate and those who must meet the equivalent of the state required student teaching requirements along with the specific content area in which students are seeking certification. Students in all three concentrations are expected to become competent in theory, research, and application of best teachin g practices in their respective fields and to exhibit appropriate teacher disposition behaviors as indicated by the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences Disposition Rating Form. All professional education courses in the program require satisfactory completion of critical performance indicators (CPIs); these must be submitted as directed before the final course grade is recorded. Each course's CPIs become a part of the student's portfolio that is reviewed Western Kentucky University Graduate Catalog 2014 -2015 85 periodically throughout the program. Students who seek admission to the Alternate Route to Teacher Certification must meet additional requirements in order to qualify for temporary provisional certification, and they must complete all requirements for certification within three years of the time of e mployment by a school district. A recommendation for professional certification will be contingent upon successful completion of the Kentucky Teacher Intern - ship Program (KTIP) and submission of qualifying scores on all required examinations for the desir ed area of certification. Additional information about the Alternate Route to Teacher Certification concentrations may be found on the website for the Office of Teacher Services. Upon successful completion of the MAT in Middle Grades Education for Initial Certification and satisfaction of all other certification requirements, student who do not participate in the Alternate Route to Certification concentrations but participate in the Standard Concentration will qualify for a Statement of Eligibility for Cert ification. The Internship course for these students must be a full semester or equivalent in length.

Mission The College provides diverse educational opportunities leading to excellence in Health and Human Services for a global community. Established by the Board of Regents in August 2002, the College of Health and Human Services (CHHS) brings together th e health and human services programs under one administration unit. One of our strengths is the breadth and depth of the diverse disciplines within the College. The College consists of seven academic units that represent an array of disciplines, and offers degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree levels. Academic units include Allied Health; Communication Sciences and Disorders; Family and Consumer Sciences; Nursing; Kinesiology, Recreation, and Sport; Public Heal th; and Social Work. The College oversees the CHHS Academic Center for Excellence, the Institute for Rural Health, and the South Central Kentucky Area Health Education Center. The College is also one of the participating institutions for the doctoral pr ogram in Rehabilitation Sciences offered through the University of Kentucky. The focus of CHHS is to provide the highest possible quality of education to prepare our students to become leaders in careers related to health and human services . Faculty are highly qualified in their respective disciplines and utilize innovative teaching strategies along with state of the art instructional technology, including ITV, web -enhanced and web -based instruction. The disciplines in the college have their roots in outre ach to the community. Disciplines in CHHS prepare students for their professions by engaging them in activities within the community that apply the theories and concepts discussed in the classroom for a more comprehensive understanding of the issues, while providing a valuable service to the communities in which we reside. To fulfill degree requirements for most programs, students are required to complete clinical experiences, field work, or internships through one of the many affiliation agreements at a my riad of health and human services facilities, agencies and organizations. Two nationally recognized mobile health and wellness units provide opportunities for students to apply skills learned in the classroom in the provision of prevention services to resi dents in our region. Due to the nature of these experiences, students are required to meet various departmental academic requirements and federal and/or state mandates. Departments may require the successful completion of specific courses or maintaining a certain GPA in order to be placed in clinical or internship experiences. Some students may be required to undergo criminal background checks and drug testing and to provide proof of health insurance, liability insurance, and/or immunization records prior t o participating in any required experiences at selected on or off -campus facilities/agencies. Additionally, there may be certifications, training seminars, or other requirements specified by the facility/agency or program that a student must meet in order to be eligible for field or practical experiences at a facility. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that all institutional and/or facility requirements are met as a condition of participating in the on or off -campus experiences; students may be responsible in part or in full for any costs incurred to meet such requirements. Students are also responsible for transportation to and from off -campus experiences. In some CHHS programs, the students are responsible for rental fees for clinical instr uments and supplies, purchasing uniforms, equipment, and possible course and program fees above the regular tuition. At the completion of the program, students may also be responsible for fees related to national, regional, and/or state licensing exams. CHHS is dedicated to improving the quality of life in the community through education, service, collaboration, leadership, and scholarship. This is accomplished in the various centers and programs in the college that provide for a vibrant and relevant univer sity experience.

Determining the degree of impairment allows physical therapists to help patients return to full function by using various p hysical agents to decrease pain and by using therapeutic exercises to increase strength, endurance, and coordination. The purpose of the DPT Program is to provide students pursuing a career in physical therapy the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and s kills required for the safe practice of physical therapy. Students are prepared as generalists, but also have some opportunity to investigate specialized aspects of physical therapy through numerous clinical exposures. The program of study consists of 118 credit hours of graduate course work and consists of intense academic and clinical work spread over 3 years. These hours are divided between classroom, clinical, and research activities. The DPT Program is an entry -level professional degree program designe d to provide individuals with baccalaureate degrees and the appropriate prerequisite courses the knowledge and skills to develop clinical and research expertise in the field of physical therapy. Upon receiving the DPT degree, students will be eligible to s it for the licensure examination in physical therapy. The Mission of the WKU Doctor of Physical Therapy program is to serve the healthcare and preventative needs of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, including rural and under -served areas, by developing cultura lly competent, caring, autonomous physical therapists who will engage in evidence based practice, critical thinking, professional behavior, life-long learning, and community/professional service. In addition to formal lecture and laboratory courses, studen ts are required to successfully complete clinical experiences usually conducted at external agencies/facilities. Due to the nature of these experiences and to stipulations established by agencies/facilities, specific requirements for students may exist to be eligible to participate in the clinical experiences. These requirements may include, but are not limited to, undergoing criminal background checks, drug testing, and TB skin tests; providing proof of health insurance, professional liability insurance, a nd/or immunization records or blood titers verifying proof of immunizations. These items may need to be updated annually. Additionally, there may be certifications, training seminars, or other requirements specified by the facility/agency that a student must meet in order to be eligible for clinical experiences at a facility. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure tha t all institutional and/or facility requirements are met as a condition of participating in any on or off -campus experiences; stude nts may be responsible in part or in full for any costs incurred to meet such requirements.

Master of Arts: Crim inology, Ref. #0421 This online program exposes students to the empirical study and evaluation of crime patterns in society using a social scientific perspective. The program's primary emphasis is the development of strong methodological and quantitative skills necessary to gather and analyze criminological data. In addition to a research and analysis emphasis, course work is directed toward the investigation of the etiology of offending and victimization in violent and property crimes , using a variety of t heoretical frameworks structuring the research process. Courses examine the major correlates of crime, delinquency, and deviance, including an analysis of the effects of gender, age, race/ethnicity, and social class in explaining variation in offending and victimization rates at various levels of analysis (e.g. individuals, within neighborhoods, among counties, and across countries). Students are exposed to historical and contemporary macro and micro level theories of offending and victimization, and they a re challenged to think about how prior and current research in the field of Criminology can be used to inform social and public policies. Several courses provide students with the opportunity to examine the institutions that have evolved to respond to crim e and delinquency in our society. These courses provide insights and perspectives into punishment and correction systems, penology, criminal law, rehabilitation and recidivism. At the end of the program, students must complete a criminological research pro ject in the format of a peer -reviewed journal article and pass an oral examination.
