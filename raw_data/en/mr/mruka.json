If you have questions about getting the vaccine, it is recommended to discuss with your doctor to make an informed decision. When I get the vaccine, can I stop wearing a mask or social distancing? Fully vaccinated is considered two weeks past final dose, meaning the second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine, or, two weeks past the single dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine. To maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial of high transmission. Wearing a mask is most important if you have a weakened immune system or if, because of your age or an underlying medical condition, you are at increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in your household has a weakened immune system, is at increased risk for severe disease, or is unvaccinated. If this applies to you or your household, you might choose to wear a mask regardless of the level of transmission in your area. Fully vaccinated people who have come into close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to be tested 3-5 days after exposure, and to wear a mask in public indoor settings for 14 days or until they receive a negative test result. What do we know about the Delta variant? - The Delta variant is highly contagious, nearly twice as contagious as previous variants. - Some data suggest the Delta variant might cause more severe illness than previous strains in unvaccinated persons. - Unvaccinated people remain at the greatest risk for severe illness, hospitalization, and death. - Fully vaccinated people with Delta variant breakthrough infections can spread the virus to others. However, vaccinated people appear to be infectious for a shorter period of time. - Vaccines are highly effective, including against the Delta variant What do we know about breakthrough cases for people who are fully vaccinated? - A small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus that causes it. These are called \"vaccine breakthrough cases.\" This means that while people who have been vaccinated are much less likely to get sick, it will still happen in some cases. It's also possible that some fully vaccinated people might have infections, but not have symptoms (asymptomatic infections). Experts continue to study how common these cases are. - If you get COVID-19 after vaccination, your symptoms might be less severe. - Fully vaccinated people are much less likely to be hospitalized or die than people with similar risk factors who are not vaccinated. Is the vaccine safe? The safety of the COVID-19 vaccine is a top priority! The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) carefully reviews all safety data from clinical trials and authorizes emergency vaccine use only when the expected benefits outweigh potential risks. COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials to make sure they meet safety standards. Will there be any side effects when I get the vaccine? You may run a fever after you get the vaccine. This is normal as your body builds immunity and fights off future COVID-19 exposures. You may feel sick after getting vaccinated. You could develop a fever, headache or body aches. This is your body reacting to the vaccine, which is a normal response. It is important to know that it is impossible to get COVID-19 from the vaccine. The vaccines currently in use and others being developed do not contain a live virus. Do I have to pay for my vaccine? Or get prior authorization? No. The COVID-19 vaccine will be at no cost to you.
