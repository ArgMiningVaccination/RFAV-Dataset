In this report, the terms \"Indigenous \" and \"Aboriginal\" are used as they are in the source documentation cited. The term \"First Nations \" is used frequently within this report. This term includes individuals with and without status under the Indian Act . This report uses a range of data sources, some of which rely on self -identification of ethnicity to identify Indigenous sub -populations, and others that are based on deterministic data linkages using the First Nations Client File. Following the protocol used in Provincial Health Officer and First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) Chief Medical Office reporting, the term \"Status First Nation \" will be used in place of \"Status Indian \" in places in this report that refer to the First Nations Client File, recognizing that the legal connotation of the term \"'Indian \" originates from a colonial framework. The terms \"at-home \" and \"community -based \" are used to refer to geographically - based Fir st Nations communities, whether they qualify as \"reserves \" under the Indian Act 2 or whether the First Nation has signed a modern treaty or holds title to the land. The term \"away from home \" signifies First Nations individuals that live away from their First Nation community. The references to the Government of Canada's participation in this report is sometimes referred to as \"Health Canada\" and sometimes as \"Indigenous Services Canada. \" This reflects that the work originated while the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch was within Health Canada, and was then transferred in December 2017 to a newly created federal department called Indigenous Services Canada (ISC). 1 Government of Canada.

Cultural safety and humility represent an area of collaboration arising from the Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan (TCA: FNHP) and Tripartite First Nations Health Plan (TFNHP) and has been a key priority since 2006. Cultural safety through cultural humility is a imed at addressing stereotyping, racism and discrimination within the British Columbia health system and creating space for First Nations health and healing philosophies and practices within health care. Beginning in 2006 and gaining significant momentum in 2015, a system -wide movement in BC to enhance cultural safety and humility in health and related services persists , generated via numerous tripartite and bilateral legal and political agreements and a series of Declarations of Commitment to cultural safety and humility . The case study begins by outlining the progression of tripartite efforts to develop the Guiding Framework for Action, sign Declarations of Commitment and develop policy to embed culturally safe practices and approaches in health servi ces. Other efforts include advancing cultural safety and humility through work plans and training initiatives ; developing organizational assessment tools and indicators to track and measure cultural safety and humility ; improving complaints processes ; and developing helpful and tailored information resources for First Nations families that are grounded in culture . The case study also highlights some of the important partnerships, events and activities associated with advancing cultural safety and humility across the health system and beyond . It also highlights some of the key challenges, such as systemic racism , as the most persistent barrier to change . Although there are many activities underway, sustained commitment and simultaneous efforts at multiple levels of the system will be needed to permanently \"hardwire\" cultural safety and humility in health -related sectors in BC and beyond. 1 Background Tripart ite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance Evaluation The signing of the British Columbia Tripartite Fram ework Agreement on First Nation s Health Governance (Tripartite Framework Agreement ) on October 13, 2011, changed the course of First Nations health in BC by creating a new First Nations health governance structure to enable First Nations in BC to participate fully in the design and delivery of health services. Section 10(1) of the agreement requires that the Parties, through the Tripartite Implementation Committee, evaluate the implementation of the Tripartite Framework Agreement every five years , with the first evaluation due in 2019. As well as fulfilling the legal obligations under the Tripartite Framework Agreement, the evaluation provides information to support the continuous growth, evolution and effective functioning of the partnership and implementation of commitments. The Tripartite Implementation Commit tee established a Tripartite Evaluation Working Group composed of evaluation leads and representatives from the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) , First Nations and Inuit Health Branch and the Ministry of Health (FNHIB) . This working group engaged external consultants to conduct this cultural safety and humility case study to provide applied and contextual data and analysis illustrative of the Parties' work between 2013 and 2018. Purpose and Approach Advancing cultural safety and humility is a core goa l of the Tripartite Partners , highlighted in the Tripartite Framework Agreement itself: \"The Parties wish to work together to build ... a more integrated health system\" that improves \"cultural appropriateness of health care programs and services for First Nations\" and \"that reflects the cultures and perspectives of BC First Nations and incorporates First Nations' models of wellness.\" 3 The scope of this case study includes a thorough review of efforts and initiatives to embed cultural safety and humility t hroughout the health care system in BC and includes initiatives that support cultural safety and humility more broadly (see Appendix A) . This case study works to address the following e valuation questions : 3 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as Represented by the Minister of Health and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia as Represented by the Minister of Health and First Nations Health Society.

British Columbia Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance . 2 Has c ultural safety and h umility been improv ed? o What are some core successes and indicators of progress achieved to - date? o What are the barriers to progress and what would be required to remove or surpass them? How do programs and services integrate First Nations traditional practices, medicines and model s of health? Has the new First Nations health governance structure enabled innovation? Methodology This case study was conducted using a combination of document re view and interviews with those working in key roles within the FNHA, Ministry of Health , Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA ), BC Regional Health Authorities and other partner organizations including the BC Coroners Service ( BCCS ) and BC Patient Safety and Quality Council. Key informants - also referred to as participants or respondents in this case st udy - participated in interviews conducted between July 2018 and January 2019 to provide feedback and insights about how efforts to transform the health system and meet the commitments of the Tripartite Framework Agreement as they relate to cultural safety and h umility . Specific responses to interview questions were anonymized and synthesized in order to empower key informant s to speak freely. As part of the overall tripartite e valuation, the Tripartite Evaluation Working Group also conduc ted surveys, interviews and focus groups with other key informant s. While the findings extend beyond this case study, several respondents identified the incorporation of cultural safety and humility into the BC health care system as the greatest achievemen t of the Tripartite Framework Agreement . In addition to document research and key informant interviews, the background research conducted for this case study included an environmental scan of efforts and initiatives by the partners , which included a review of the websites and subpages, including news updates, from the FNHA, Ministry of Health , PHSA , Vanc , Island Health , Northern Health , Interior Health and Fraser Health. These initiatives and additional efforts o f the partners are reflected in Appendix A of this case study. All the materials reviewed in the scan inform ed the analysis and key initiatives have been incorporated into the body of the text below and cited throughout. The findings are presented followin g the structure established in the Guiding Framework for Action on Cultural Safety and Humility for First Nations and Aboriginal Health Services in BC 3 Cultural Safety and Humility Foundations First Nations have a rich history of wellness extending back fo r many thousands of years. The arrival of Europeans and forcible imposition of colonial practices and policies, including residential schools, the Indian Act and Indian hospitals undermined First Nations health and wellness . Today, the health and well -bein g of many First Nations peoples continues to be affected by the past and present effects of colonialism, both at the individual and system s level, and can include trauma, stigma, stereotyp ing, racism, discrimination and social inequities . \"This bias manif ests itself in multiple ways in healthcare, including that Western medicine does not reflect or incorporate Indigenous definitions of health and wellness and that health care professionals implicitly and explicitly exhibit attitudinal anti- Indigenous bias that results in Indigenous peoples not receiving equitable care to non- Indigenous peoples. As such, Indigenous peoples' prior traumatic experiences with Western institutions are continuously reinforced, contributing further to widespread mistrust of healthcare institutions and professionals by Indigenous peoples. This reluctance to interact with the healthcare system then contributes to disparities in health o utcomes for Indigenous peoples in comparison to other residents of Canada, which in turn further reinforces stereotypes about the inherent health of Indigenous peoples.\" 4 Research in this area suggests systemic racism and bias are a significant barrier that prevent First Nations and Indigenous people s from seeking and receiving equitable health care and is a direct contributor to poor outcomes: One -third of First Nations in Canada reported experiencing an in stance of racism in the last 12 months and betw een 30% to 50% of them felt it had a significa nt impact on their self-esteem ( Regional Health Survey 2008/10) ;5 Research shows that racism against Indigenous peoples in the health care system is so pervasive that people strategize around anticipated racism 4 Johnson , H.

The resulting lack of trust on the part of First Nations and Indigenous people s with the health system pla ys a major role in the reality that First Nations and Indigenous people s in Canada have the poorest health outcomes, higher rates of c hronic disease and shorter life expectancy .8 Defining Cultural Safety and Humility Figure 1: Cultural Safety, Respect and Dignity in Relationships Source: Northern Health.

Cultural sensitivity is recognition on the part of health care providers of the need to r espect that cul tural difference. Learning about that cultural difference, with the goal of enabling the health care provider to adapt their care to suit the client's cultural context, is the focus of cultural competency .9 Irihapeti Ramsden, a Mori nurse in Aotearoa (New Zealand) , was the first to introduce the concept of cultural safety in 1990 .10 Cultural safety is defined as an outcome based on respectful engagement that recognizes and strives to address power imbalances inherent in the health care system. In a culturally safe health environment, people do not need to fear that their health care providers' decisions about their c are may be influenced by racism or false assumptions stemming from ignorance or inaccurate information, or that they are powerless in the face of these issues within the health care system . A culturally safe health system is one where people feel safe and respected when receiving care because their culture, values and preferences are considered . Cultural safety requires that providers exercise cultural humility - including critical self-reflection on how their personal behaviours and biases , as well institutional biases, may have negative consequences for client experience and overall well - being. Cultural humility is the behavioural practice that contributes to a culturally safe system; it is about analyzing these power imbalances, discrimination and colonial relationships as they apply to health care. The approach seeks to address power imbalances inherent in health clien t-provider relationships to respect First Nations and Indigenous people s as the decision -makers in their own care . 11 Cultural humility is \"a process of self -reflection to understand personal and systemic conditioned biases and to develop and maintain respec tful processes and relationships based on mutual trust. Cultural humility involves humbly acknowledging oneself as a life -long learner when it comes to understanding another's experience.\"12 9 Baba , L. (2013).

After the first stage of awareness, people start believing they get it, until they learn that they don't. It's a multi -stage learning journey. Some feel acknowledging these issues means they can't be proud of who they are. But really, this process is really about learning h ow to understand one's biases and continually reflect on how they can continue to operate. - Key Informant Cultural humility involves providers engaging in a two -way conversation where both they and the client work together as partners in care. Care providers have as much to learn from their First Nations clients as vice versa . Cultural h umility requires that health care professionals increase their health literacy by listening to, understanding and appreciating health and wellness from First N ations perspectives; as well as learning the impacts of intergenerational trauma, abuse, violence, neglect and other social determinants on the health of First Nations people.13 Engaging with First Nations from a place of cultural h umility helps create a n environ ment free of racism and discrimination, where people feel respected and safe when receiving health care, leading to greater access to care and improved health outcomes. 14 Cultural safety is experienced by the client and cannot be claimed by the system or pr ovider. In other words, \"w e have achieved cultural safety whe n First Nations tell us we have.\"15 Cultural Humility has to be role -model led. There is a lot of work to be done around Cultural Humility. People don't just know how to be humble. It is a distinct way of being around people that accepts their strengths. It is rooted in empathy and self -reflection. There is not a lot of patience i n the system - the system is fast. Instead of humility, many people have been taught a certain form of natural arrogance and competitiveness. Humility is something people have to learn and it's a lifelong process.

BC First Nations have defined reciprocal accountability as a shared responsibility - amongst First Nations and between First Nations and federal and provincial government partners - to achieve common goals.

Through subsequent tripartite plans and agreements and a consensus -building process amongst First Nations, a new First Nations health governance structure in BC was created, providing unprecedented opportunity for First Nations to be involved in health system design and decision- making, including enhancing cultural safety through cultural humility . Since 2006, all health plans and agreements include a commitment to enhance cultural safety and humility and support initiatives that ensure that First Nations and 19 BC Assembly of First Nati ons, First Nations Summit, Union of BC Indian Chiefs and Province of B C.

To further consolidate the work and expedite progress in embedding cultural safety and humility into the fabric of provincial health services , in 2015 , the Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health formed an Executive Working Group on cultural safety and h umility , comprised of the FNHA, PHSA and Ministry of Health . In 2016, drawing on expertise leveraged from the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement and informed by an international literature review , the Executive Working Group developed the Guiding Frame work for Action on Cultural Safety and Humility for First Nations and Aboriginal Health Services in BC (Guiding Framework) .20 Alongside the 2015 Declaration of Commitment: Cultural Safety and Humility in Health Services Delivery for First Nations and Aboriginal People in British Columbia ,21 this reflected the commitments of the Parties and providing guidance for changes at the system, organization and provider levels. The Guiding Framework is informed by four key principles of cultural safety and humi lity that are consistently emphasized throughout the literature: Cultural humility builds mutual trust and resp ect and enables cultural safety; Cultural safety is defined by each individual client's health care experience. As such, approaches to cultural safety must be client -centred and must recognize the important roles played by cl ients' families and communities ; Cultural safety must be understood, embraced and practiced at all levels of the health system , including governance, health care organizations and within individual professional practice ; and All stakeholders, including First Nations individuals, Elders and communities, must be involved in co-developing action strategies and in the decision - making process with a commitmen t to reciprocal accounta bility . The Guiding Framework is a living document to support organizations to develop action plans to embed cultural safety and humility into the ir systems and services . The intent is to create a cohesive health system -wide approach to cultural safety a nd humility that unites fragmented initiatives, actualizes wise practices and supports 20 Leadership Council of the Tripartite Co mmittee on First Nations Health.

The Guiding Framework is intended to be an enabling menu of actions that organizations c ould use to inform their prioritization and action planning. These actions are to be reflected in provincial, regional and local health plans and decisio ns moving forward to achieve the V ision of enabling First Nations and Aboriginal people in BC to be amongst the healthiest in the world and equal partners in their health care. The Guiding Framework aligns with the structure of the Declarations of Commitment by organizing possible actions within three main categories: 22 1. Create a climate for change by opening an honest and convincing dialogue with all stakeholders to show that change is necessary; forming a coalition of influential leaders and role models who are committ ed to the urgency of embedding c ultural safety and h umility in First Nations, Ab original and BC health services; and lea ding a strategy to achieve the V ision for a culturally safe health system. 2. Engage and enable stakeholders by communicating the absolute need for commitme nt to and understanding of the V ision of a culturally safe hea lth system for First Nations and Aboriginal people in BC; leading by example and openly and honestly addressing concerns; identifying and removing barriers to progress; and tracking, evaluating and celebrating accomplishments. 3. Implement and sustain change by empowering individuals and health organiz ations to innovate and develop cultural humility and a culture of cultural s afety; enabling individuals and organizations to raise and address problems without fear of reprisal; and worki ng continuously until cultural safety and h umility are embedded within all levels of the health system .23 22 While this framework is being used to organize the evaluation findings, it should be noted that a lot of the work in cultural safety and humility pre-dates the framework. 23 Declaration of Commitment: Cultural Safety and Humility in Health Services Delivery for First Nations and Aboriginal People in BC .

These categories of the Guiding Framework for Action on Cultural Safety and Humility for First Nations and Aboriginal Health Services are therefore used as an organizing structure for describing and assessing outcomes to date in this case study. 12 1. Creating a Climate of Change The first stage of a ction i s Creating a Climate for Change . This bucket of activities focuses on creating the permissi ve environment for transformation. It includes articulating the need for cultural safety and humility and building awareness; generating t he vision and understandings of the core definitions of cultural safety and humility ; building a coalition of leadership committed to embedding cultural safety and humility in BC health services ; and engendering personal commitment in the hearts and minds of service providers. Declarations of Commitment Raising awareness can be an effective initial step to broadly signal that racism is unacceptable and that First Nations and Aboriginal people s are valued. Key informant s heralded the endorsing and signing of the Declarations of Commitment across British Columbia by leadership as a fundamental success and cornerstone to changing the system. In 2015, the FNHA, Ministry of Health and the Health Authorities signed the Declaration of Commitment to Cultur al Safety and Humility in Health Services Delivery for First Nations and Aboriginal People in BC (Declaration of Commitment ). The Declaration of Commitment signals the importance of cultural safety and humility from the leadership perspective and is intend ed to create a climate for staff to engage in open discussions on these key issues . The Declaration of Commitment recognizes that cultural safety and humility are essential dimensions of quality and safety and only a sustained and genuine commitment to a ction from senior leaders hip paired with a concrete action plan will lead to the change needed. This commitment gives a mandate to health professionals to pay attention to and advance cultural humility in their practices with First Nations and Aboriginal p eoples, which will not only benefit First Nations peoples, but also lead to more culturally safe services for all British Columbians. In March 2017 , all 23 health regulators in BC also signed a Declaration of Commitment, making BC health professionals the first in Canada to pledge their commitment to making the health system more culturally safe fo r First Nations and Aboriginal p eople. The signing of the Declaration of Commitment was witnessed b y over 230 delegates attending the 2017 Quality Forum \"Best of Both Worlds \" conference, a forum focused on improving the quality of health care for Indigenous people. 13 The signing of the declaration is another step forward, that was pretty historic from my perspective when you look at what's happening in the rest of the country. And then in March of this year, 23 regulatory bodies also signed the declaration. It was historic because those are the actual health care providers in the province on the ground, so your doctors, nurses, chiropractors, midwives, everybody. That was also an other huge step in trying to [make] cultural safety a daily practice when we're looking at meeting the needs of First Nations people in BC . - Key Informant Additional Declarations o f Commitment have been signed by Providence Health Care, Doctors of BC , the BC College of Family Physicians, the BC Patient Safety and Quality Council (BCPSQC) , the BC Coroners Service, Emergency Management BC (EMBC) and the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions (MMHA) , to name a few. Each declaration includes a commitment to strengthen and improve cultural safety and humility and is based on principles of quality, co -development and reciprocal accountability. Each signatory has committed to a public ann ual report on strategic activities to show how the commitments are being met.24 These Declarations of Commitment signal that interpersonal and systemic r acism is unacceptable and emphasize the importance of cultural safe ty fuelled by cultural humility. Signatory organizations have been collectively and respectively undertaking the development and implementation of action plans and initiatives to improve the cultural safety and humility of the health system for First Nations and Aboriginal people and ultima tely for all British Columbians, in a variety of areas . Some of the activities and actions undertaken by these organizations include establishing cultural safety and humility committees and working groups; developing training, workshops and webinars; devel oping cultural safety and humility resources , and communications and awareness campaigns; developing and reviewing policies from a cultural safety and humility lens; and developing evaluation tools and frameworks for action. 25 Common areas of focus for orga nizations are training and education, research and policy development, complaints and accountability, capital planning and s afe spaces and assessment tools. These Declarations are attributed as leading to direct on -the-ground change: 24 Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health. (2017).

There are some things that we will be able to start addressing immediately around educational opportunities, around cultural safety. We'll look at more long-term planning about what A boriginal specific programming needs to occur within Cariboo Memorial Hospital and the surrounding area, what does it mean to hire Aboriginal people within our hospitals and facilities. We know that leads to culturally competent care as well. \" 26 In this example, the Declaration has also led to First Nations and Interior Health employed nurses undertaking job exchanges to better understand barriers to health care and build better working relationships. Most recently, in April 2019, the FNHA, ISC, Health Canada and the Public Health Agen cy of Canada signed a joint Declaration of Commitment to Advance Cultural Safety and Humility in Health and Wellness Services and Organizations . As part of this initiative, the p artners have committed to developing an action plan to guide collaborative efforts. 27 This Declaration signals that the commitment to cultural safety and humility is moving to national levels and beyond health to also include other social services for First Nations. #itstartswithme Campaign In keeping with raising awareness as a way to create a climate of change, Declaration signatory organizations have promoted a cultural safety and h umility pledge campaign along with other social media efforts, embed ded cultural safety and humility into staff onboarding and encouraged staff to participate in webinar series offered by the FNHA and PHSA. In June 2016 , the FNHA launched the #itstartswithme campaign that includes both a suite of educational materials and an opportunity for health service providers to 26 Dyok , R. (2007).

The campaign and materials serve to inform those within the health care system and other stakeholders about the systemic issues contributing to the lack of trust many First Nations a nd Aboriginal people have in the health care system, leadi ng to poorer health outcomes at a population level. The \"My Commitment \" pledge cards were designed to encourage front line workers and employees to think about personal accountability , underscorin g that not only organizations, but also individuals, are responsible for change and raising awareness. The FNHA #itstartswithme campaign began with a series of webinars attende d by approximately 3,000 people , and the PHSA has held similar webinars with com parable levels of interest. Some Regional Health Authorities are spreading knowledge about the commitment to cultural safety and h umility through a poster campaign, in which ho spital staff are quoted saying , \"I promote Cultural Safety and Humility ,\" accompanied by a statement about how they are doing so within their work. 16 2. Engaging and Enabling Stakeholders The Guiding Framework outlines the second bucket of activities as Engaging and Enabling Stakeholders . This area of activities focuses on buildi ng relationships and partnerships , developing protocols and organizational policy change . Organizational Policy Development and Action Planning The FNHA , Ministry of Health , Health A uthorities and other p artners are embedding cultural safety and humility and the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness within a range of policy documents and strategies.28 FNHA Cultural Safety and Humility Policy Statement In 2016/2017 the FNHA published a Cultural Safety and Humility Policy Statement.29 The statement and accompanying booklet present a high -level, easy -to-read overview of cultural safety and humility , along with a call to action for how stakeholders can support transforming the health care system. It provides context on the long hi story of wellness bef ore coloni alism, as well as the direct and ongoing impacts of colonial institutions, policies and mindsets . The policy statement provides definitions of terms and concepts including \"cultural safety ,\" \"cultural humility ,\" \"systemic racism, \" the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness and \"relationship -based care. \" A few key statistics demonstrate the magnitude of the problem, including significantly higher rates of racism experienced by First Nations and Aboriginal peoples in Canada , dramatically higher rates of youth suicides in some First Nations communities and consistently lower life expectancy for Status First Nations people s than other BC residents. In addition to working with provinc ial and regional health system p artners to a dvance the policy, the FNHA commits to building understanding of cultural safety and humility amongst health professionals through: An awareness campaign; Developing and implementing a complaints process ; Providing compre hensive, mandatory and ongoing training for FNHA employees; 28 First Nations Health Authority.

Integration of Cultural Healing Practices The TCA: FNHP and TFNHP define health for First Nations as encompassing the \"physical, spi ritual, mental, economic, emotional, environmental, social and cultural wellness of the individual, family and community.\" Research and engagement demonstrate that traditional medicines and practices can \"improve overall health and wellness, strengthen cul ture and pride, prevent chronic conditions, support First Nation decision -making, decrease health care costs, increase access to health care and reconnect First Nation people to their territories.\"30 The 2014 FNHA Traditional Wellness Strategic Framework suggests that wholistic wellness can lead to better long -term results for First Nation s communities and people and that traditional wellness reflected in health care is a key way to achieve cultural safety since t raditional healers serve as an important en try point into the pathway to care. At the same time, as people are better able to access health care options they are comfortable with, this may increase follow through on treatment plans and decrease the need for acute care services. It is also recognize d that the integration of traditional wellness with conventional Western approaches to health can produce positive results through inter -referrals and co -management of patients.31 The Framework Agreement supports a governance structure that \"reflects the cultures and perspectives of BC First Nations and incorporates First Nations models of wellness.\" Making space for and incorporating traditional healing and wellness are key actions to transform the health system to implement cultural safety and humility in health care. A wide array of efforts is underway to int egrate cultural healing within Western health systems, such as: A number of key informant s indicated that Regional Health Authorities are working w ith local communities to include traditional foods as part of health care service to First Nations and Indigenous clients and their families; 30 First Nations Health Authority. (2014). Traditiona l Wellness Strategic Framework . 31 Ibid 18 Expressions of cultural practices are being facilitated in health care environments, such as through cultural room s and modified birthing rooms ; and, Efforts are underway to embed traditional medicine practitioners within hospitals, clinics and primary care networks . A series of regional workshops to bring hospital staff and physicians together with Elders and cultu ral leaders have been key to efforts to find pathways for incorporating the use of traditional medicines within clinical settings. The U niversity of British Columbia (UBC) Faculty of Medicine Digital Emergency Medicine, the FNHA and Island Health held one such workshop in 2018: \"A Coming Together of Health Systems: Dialogue Between Traditional Practitioners, Community Members and Health Professionals .\" The session brought participants together to discuss how to incorporate traditiona l medicine into health a uthority practice, to gather physician input into system redesign and help improve health and wellness for clients and families. Approximately 100 participants attended , including those from Kwakwaka'wakw family groups, doctors, mid wives, nurses, Health Directors, traditional medicine leads from the communities and executives from Island Health . The event was described as a big step forward in recognizing traditional practitioners as equal p artners in care and physicians have signale d an interest in learning more. Greater attention is also being paid to the positive outcomes of community -based healing programs and initiatives. One example noted was the Sts'ailes Circle of Care and Wellness Program , helping clients heal from grief, loss and trauma through cultural teachings and sacred sites. Support for clients is provided in a manner that respects Sts'ailes traditions, values and beliefs to achieve and sustain mental wellness and a healthy, balanced lifesty le. This integrated system approach meets clients and families challenged by mental health and/or addiction issues by bringing together traditional and spiritual healers with other health professionals in providing care. It also helps clients learn about m ethods of self -care, including techniques for relaxation, meditation, releasing negative energy, collecting positive energy and working toward a state of balance. All clients attending the program expressed interest in the opportunity to attend another ses sion and wanted to invite immediate and extended family members. They felt the use of traditional healing practices and programs would reduce risk to their children, youth and family systems. 19 PHSA Indigenous Cultural Safety Strategy The PHSA 2018 -2021 Dir ectional Plan on Cultural Safety received approval and support from the PHSA board. The PHSA Indigenous Cultural Safety Strategy aligns with key goals of creating a climate for change, engaging and enabling stakeholders and implementing and sustaining chan ge. It aims to create a safe and equitable organization for Indigenous clients, families and employees by addressing anti - Indigenous racism at interpersonal, organizational and systemic levels. At the direct care or interpersonal level, the strategy focuses on equipping individual service providers and teams with the knowledge and skills they need to deliver culturally safe services. At the organizational level, the strategy focuses on quality and improvement, including planning, accountability and reportin g and on strategy, leadership and policy. The strategy recognizes that Indigenous clients, families and employees must be the ones to determine when the PHSA's programs and services are culturally safe. The PHSA is currently developing organizational indicators to evaluate and measure services. These include Indigenous guidance, leadership and PHSA accountability ; experiences and incidents of anti -Indigenous racism and discrimination ; and workforce experiences and representation . Evaluatio n will be conducted across these indicators, using mechanisms such as: Organizational assessments to identify gaps, strengths and opportunities; Client surveys to collect information on client and families' experiences of racism and discrimination ; Workplace surveys to collect information on employee and service providers' experiences of racism and discrimination ; Race /ethnicity self -identification for all employees and clients ; Race/ethnicity data collection and analysis wi thin all organizational evaluative tools and processes (e.g. WorkLife Pulse survey, employee health and wellness surveys, patient satisfaction surveys) ; Culturally safe complaint and incident repo rting and resolution processes ; and, Cultural safety measur es embedded within organizational planning and reporting mechanisms (e.g. accreditation, risk management planning, internal audit , service level evaluation and metrics). To reach the goal of creating a safe and equitable organization, the strategy aims to address structural and interpersonal anti -Indigenous racism and discrimination experienced by Indigenous people at the PHSA and identify and address r acial 20 inequities throughout the organization. It aims to ensure that Indigenous peoples' perspectives gu ide and inform PHSA organizational governance and decision - making , while ensuring that services and systems are developed, assessed, adapted and improved with and for Indigenous people. To achieve this goal and these outcomes, the strategy is guided by the principles of decolonization and Indigenous -specific approaches; transformative change; critical anti-racism; equity and social justice; partnership and collaboration; and reciprocal accountability and shared ownership. Implementation coordination and evaluation of the strategy will be supported by the PHSA Indigenous Health team and involves identifying priorit ies and collaboration with key p artners across the organization. To ensure this strategy and its accomplishment of its objectives are sustainab le, the strategy will be linked to key organizational mandates, strategies and programs. Cultural Safety and Humility and BC's New Primary Care Networks In May 2018, the Government of BC launched a new provincial primary health care strategy , focused on integrated, team -based care. Strategic initiatives included establishing primary c are networks , urgent and primary care clinics and community health centres; and funding and recruiting more general practitioners, nurse practitioners and other health profes sionals. A provincial- level Primary Health Care Working Group (which includes the Ministry of Health, Gene ral Practice Service Committee, regional health a uthorities and the FNHA) supported work to define the core attributes, one of which is cultural safet y. The Primary Health Care Working Group created a sub -committee (co -chaired by the Ministry of Health and the FNHA and including other health system partners) expressly dedicated to cultural safety. A primary deliverable of this partnership was the develo pment of the Indigenous Engagement and Cultural Safety Guidebook ,32 released in October 2019. The guidebook is a resource to support those developing primary care network s to embed cultural safety in their communities, as required by the primary care strategic policy. The Ministry of Health , the FNHA and the General Practice Service Committee have also partnered to review primary care network service p lans to ensure criteria are met.33 32 Cultural Safety Attribute Working Group.

Improving Indigenous Cancer Journeys in BC: A Road Map . 37 Ibid 22 Vancouver Coastal Health Indigenous Cultural Safety Policy In 2018 , Vancouver Coastal Health updated its Indigenous Cultural Safety Policy to continue to guide creating culturally safe care practices and relationships with Indigenous people s. The policy supports Indigenous clients' requests for traditional modes of healing that can be supported or made available, whether it is time with an Elder, a ceremony, being brushed, smudging or using traditional medicines. The policy has been appended in the regional Urban Aboriginal Health St rategy to support forward planning. Vancouver Coastal Health created a cultural practices guideline - Aboriginal Cultural Practices A Guide For Physicians And Allied Health Care Professi onals38 - indexed with information on practices including use of traditiona l foods, end of life practices and birth . The guidelines are underpinned by values, practices, concepts and views of health common to Aboriginal people in the communities served by Vancouver Coastal Health . The policy also requires that any new builds must have at least one room with a ventilation system that allows indoor smudging. Vancouver Coastal Health published an Acknowledgment of Traditional Territory, the Inclusion of Indig enous Knowledge and Expertise in Health Care and the Right to Traditional Medicines .39 These cultural guidelines aim to help V ancouver Coastal Health staff within hospital settings provide culturally responsive health care services to Indigenous clients. The guidelines are supported by V ancouver Coastal Health 's Aboriginal Cultural Competency P olicy document and by Indigenous cultural safety training initiatives. The Aboriginal Cultural Competency Policy, created by Vancouver Coastal Health in 2015, provides direction to staff, facilities, departments , units and programs in its approach to cultural safety. The policy includes directives on Aboriginal leadership in health care, acknowledgement of First Nations traditional territory and the ceremonial u se of tobacco or smudging medicines. Its overall goal is to close the gap in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal populations by providing culturally safe and responsive services. The policy requires that culturally safe practices are embedded in leadership and staff members' daily work and that Aboriginal clients have the right to access traditional ceremonies and health practices as part of their patient care plan. 38 Vancouver Coastal Health. (n.d.). Aboriginal Cultural Practices: A Guide for Physicians and Allied Health Professionals working at VCH. 39 Vancouver Coastal Health. ( n.d.). Indigenous Cultural Safety Policy . 23 To supplement the Aboriginal Cultural Competency Policy, in 2017, V ancou ver Coastal Health created \" Aboriginal Cultural Practices: A Guide for Physicians and Allied Hea lth Professionals working at [Vancouver Coastal Health] \",40 a new health care resource for physicians and allied health professionals working with Indigenous patients. Key concepts include: Information/Communication - the importance of understanding different communication styles; Discharge Planning - the importance of identifying and accessing external supports ; Healing and Medicines - information about incorpor ating trad itional medicines and practices ; Dying and death - information on cultur al and spiritual considerations ; and, First Nations Communities - key contact information and a brief description of each First Nation s community in the Vancouver Coastal Health region . Awareness has been built by referencing the policy in all workshops, planning documents and communications tools related to Aboriginal health. Anecdotal reports from staff suggest that outcomes so far include increased access to culturally safe care, increased cultural safety within Vancouver Coastal Health as an organization, consistency in culturally safe services throughout the system and increased awareness of the V ancouver Coastal Health's Aboriginal Health team. The team is working on initiatives to improve the patient feedback system and increase the presence of Elders in their health care facilities. Developing Clear Working Relationships Partners Committing to and Using the Language of Cultural Safety and Humility Another success cited by key informant s is increasing awareness amongst Tripartite Partners around the language of cultural safety and humility. For example, the Ministry of Hea lth is embedding cultural safety and humility as an attribute throughout policy development work . Partner s' use of these terms and conc epts has become far more common. 40 Vancouver Coastal Health. (n.d.). Aboriginal Cultural Practices: A Guide for Physicians and Allied Health Professionals working at Vancouver Coastal Health . 24 It is a significant step forward that many partners and stakeholders are regularly talking about Cultural Safety and Humility. Ten years ago, many of these organizations would have argued that there was no problem, that their staff treated everyone the same and that there was no mistreatment of Indigenous people . - Key Informant Regional Action Planning Between December 2011 and November 2012, Partnership Accord s were finalized between each regional health authority and BC First Nations within each region, defining what their relationship processes should look like. Partnership Accords focus on improving health outcomes through better service integration by sharing decisions on planning and engagement, service delivery, accountability and evaluation of culturally appropriate, safe and effective systems and services. The guiding principle o f these Accords is reciprocal a ccountability, replacing the conventional focus of vertical accountability with a more horizontal approach that emphasizes collaboration and collective action. Key informant s identified the Regional Partnership Accords as important mechanisms for engaging and enabling stakeholders to establish a culturally safe health system. The work plans pursuant to the Accords include a focus on cultural safety and humility - such as establishing local cultural safety committees that ser ve to build regional relationships and develop specific change initiatives. Further, following the signing of the Declarations, the Ministry of Health asked each regional health authority to develop their own cultural safety and h umility action plan toward s achieving culturally safe services. Various committees, including at the local and sub -regional levels, ensure community and N ation participation. An ever - growing list of regional activities and resourc es can be found in Appendix A. By way of example, No rthern Health has: Created a Cultural Safety and Humility Plan and Framework ; Established a Cultural Competency Working Group ; Developed cultural safety training requirements ; Developed training and education materials and cultural learning sessions ; Crea ted a n Aboriginal Working Group to work together on safe space guidelines ; Held collaborative forums that bring together frontline workers and administrators together with Indigenous health representatives and 25 Indigenous community leaders to share informat ion and work in partnership on local health priorities ; Updated the Complaints process ; Developed a resource for clients to access Indigenous Patient Liaisons or Aboriginal Patient Navigators to help Indigenous clients and families navigate the system and access services like E lders and culturally safe spaces ; Published research and tools such as an inventory of F irst Nation specific cultural safety activities and ways to navigate services ; and, Developed an evaluation framework for measuring the impact of cultural safety and humility interventions . The FNHA is seen as an Important Partner and Resource Key informant s felt th at a strong sign of stakeholder engagement and commitment to establish ing a culturally safe health system is reflected in the increased n umb er of requests made of the FNHA . The FNHA is asked to participate in numerous committees to help advise health care organizations on what is required to make programs and service environments culturally safe. In addition, many organizations are requ esting the FNHA's assistance with information, review s of policies and process es and speaking e ngagements . This shows there is an increased awareness of the need to include a First Nations perspective in planning and delivery. The FNHA sub -regional Community Engagement Coordinators (CECs), for example, not only lead and coordinate sub -regional cau cus meetings with Chiefs, the First Nations Health Council and community health leads , but also connect with other partners including Divisions of Family Practice, community -based groups of family physicians funded by the General Practice Service Committee (a joint committee representing a partnership of the Ministry of Health and Doctors of BC ). One CEC described how consistent efforts to build these relationships has had significant impact in bringing family physicians into community -driven meetings where they can learn more about First Nations communities, cultures and concerns directly and with lasting impact. These doctors are in turn speaking with their colleagues, increasing awareness and interest and increasing physician participation in events and meetings as impactful learning opportunities. Health System Processes for Improvement Complaints Processes Complaints processes can be challenging to navigate and intimidating for any patient. A primary method for evaluating whether cultural safety and humility has 26 improved within the BC health system is by tracking and analyzing patient complaint data. Although there are specific examples of innovation in Indigenous self - identification practice s regionally, in general, the only way to know if a complainant is Indigenous is if they self -identify in the written part of their complaint. This means that there is no formal way of quantifying the number of complaints made by Indigenous people s relativ e to the rest of the population and whether that number is increasing or decreasing and what factors might be affecting those numbers. As such, complaints processes have been emphasized as a key focus with in the cultural safe ty and humility change movement . Much of the initial work to embed cultural safety and humility in complaints process es has been led by Regional Health Authorities , although health regulators have committed to review and consider how cultural safety and humility can be built into quality ass urance and complaints processes. Northern Health , Fraser and Vancouver Coastal have each produced a culturally relevant , user -friendly booklet aimed to support Indigenous peoples' understanding and navigation of the complaints process and to sum marize other Indigenous -specific health care resources available to them. These documents were widely promoted and disseminated, with other health authorities adapting it to their contexts. BC Emergency Health Services Patient Care Quality Office integrates First Nations perspectives on any complaint file or patient safety event to ensure information that is gathered is consistent with established standards, cultural safety is recognized and appropriately addressed, relevant First Nations agencies are included and debriefings with First Nations patients and/or families are conducted as required . 41 Those who had access to patient complaint data noted that the majority of complaints are not about medical mismanagement, but about a perceived lack of respect, racism, people acting on the basis of stereotypical assumptions and feeling like one was treated as less worth y of care. That said, given the relatively low number of complaints overall, compared to the comments and feelings within communities, a n umber of key informant s feel that the patient complaint system does not work well and that clients and families either do not know how to access the complaint process or do not feel safe doing so. A number of key informant s noted that an increase in compla ints at this stage does not necessarily mean a worsening of patient experience s, but may reflect a greater feeling of safety in making complaints about incidents that may previously have gone unreported. 41 Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health Consolidated Progress Report - October 2018 to April 2019. 27 One key informant serving in an Aboriginal health role at a regional health authority noted that the organization has tried to create a culturally safe health care environment by looking at how normalized Western processes can leave First Nations and Indigenous clients and their families feeling disempowe red. This has fed into efforts to revamp the patient complaint process in that region. While the level of Indigenous patien t complaints within the region was not statistically significant, examination indicated the existing patient complaint process was considered arduous and was not something people wanted to engage with. Within one geographical area within the health authority , a new process has emerged where practitioners within the system can bring the complaint forward on behalf of a patient or thei r family, as opposed to by someone who may not feel safe within that service environment. The process was streamlined , allowing clients to give consent for a third party to speak on their behalf. Key informant s suggested a model such as this would not have been conceivable a few years ago. The FNHA is also tracking and working with existing complaints processes and quality offices related to the complaints it receives from clients. The FNHA is further developing this complaints capacity to address complain ts about FNHA -delivered and FNHA -funded services, as well as offer a route for clients to submit complaints about the quality of care in the provincial health system . The work in educating First Nations and other Indigenous people across the province about their rights within the health care system, including their right and ability to safely make complaints, remains a critical ongoing task. Lastly, an emerging partnership, the First Nations, M\u00e9t is, and Inuit Cultural Safety and Humility in the Patient Ca re Quality Program, is currently in early development and informed by a Project Collective that includes all regional health authorities , the PHSA, BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres and M\u00e9tis Nation British Columbia. Currently, the provincial Patient Care Quality Program does not collect or analyze First Nations, M\u00e9tis or Inuit demographic data or track and monitor complaints related to cultural safety and humility. This has led to a gap in understanding of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and I nuit peoples' care quality concerns, which contributes to a health system that is not reflective of the perspectives it is aiming to serve. The vision is for a patient care quality complaints process to be culturally safe and accessible to First Nations, M \u00e9tis and Inuit peoples , contribut ing to respectful, patient- centered care improvements across the health system . 28 The Patient Voices Network In 2009 , the Ministry of Health created the Patient Voices Network , which recruits and supports patient, famil ies a nd caregivers , to work with health care partners to identify and promote local, regional and provincial opportunities for engaging the patient perspective in positive health care transformation. In December 2015 , responsibility for supporting the Patient V oices Network transferred to the BC PSQC - a provincial organization that provides system -wide leadership to efforts designed to improve the quality of health care in British Columbia - given an alignment with its mandate to \"engage and inform the public as active participants in their own care.\" The BCPSQC has indicated to help \"overcome challenges, seize upon opportunities and find solutions to problems, patients should be effectively engaged and their contributions lea ds to more informed decisions.\"42 The Patient Voices Network is working to ensure Indigenous voices are heard within patient quality and improvement processes. Before 2008, there was a rather a d-hoc system or approach and m any were not tracking whether patients making complaints identified as Indigenous. The FNHA lead for patient quality is working with all provincial and regional health authority quality care offices to understand their processes for identi fying, tracking and addressing patient perspectives and played a lead role in growing and diversifying the Patient Voices Network. According to key informant s, the FNHA has increased the diversity of the network and these patients are part of the pool of people engaged in change and informing work in the system. There are now a greater number of Indigenous Patient Partners engaged in the Patient Voices Network . 42 BC Patient Safety and Quality Council. (2017). Patient Voices Network Strategic Pl an 2017 -2020 . 29 3. Implementing and Sustaining Change The Guiding Framework outlines the third bucket of activities as Implementing and Sustaining Change . This area of activities focuses on empowering organizations and individuals to innovate and enable the systemic embedding of cultural safety and humility within all levels of the health system. Training, Education and Human Resources Many people coming into the health care system from post-secondary education have a tokenized education about Indigenous people or none at all. They are not job ready to work with Indigenous people. There is a lot of pushback from medical a nd nursing schools about adding hours to the curriculum. Institution s assert that the curriculum is fine and demand evidence of harm. There are thousands of examples of harm to Indigenous clients and their families happening regularly throughout the health system. That work the FNHA is doing around needed curriculum change s is incredibly important. And for those already working within the health care system, meaningful professional devel opment training on cultural safety and humility is critical. - Key Informant Health system leaders have emphasized the need to move \"upstream\" in the cultural safety and humility movement by embedding practices into medical and other post - secondary education. The FNHA , among other organizations, is building partnerships with professional associations, regulatory and licensing bodies , and post -secondary institutions to embed cultural safety a nd humility training into curricula for students in health fields, as well as into continuing professional education.43 PHSA - San'yas Indigenous Cultural Safety Training \"First Nations and the province wi ll develop a curriculum for cultural competency in 2007/08 and require health authorities to begin this training in 2008/09. Training will be mandatory for Ministry of Health 43 First Nations Health Authority (n.d.). FNHA 's Policy Statement on Cultural Safety and Humility . 30 and health authority staff, including executive and senior management. \"44 To fulfil the commitment in the TCA: FNHP , the PHSA created the San'yas Indigenous Cultura l Safety Training Program (ICS). Since that time, ICS has trained over 40,000 people in BC and cumulative ly 80,000 people across Canada, including health professionals in Manitoba and Ontario . The training establishes expectations around embedding cultural safety and cultural humility in clinical practice , and it encourages self-reflection when relating to and working with people from a different cultural background - spec ifically Indigenous people. San'yas ICS Training aims to increase knowledge, enhance self -awareness and strengthen the skills of health care professionals who work directly or indirectly with Indigenous peoples. The program was developed by Indigenous leaders and guided by an advisory committee of Indigenous leaders, community members, researchers and academics who have expertise in Indigenous cultural safety . The training is online, interactive and self-paced. Skilled facilitators guide and support par ticipants through learning modules including interactive activities, quizzes, videos, discussion boards and the opportunity to create individual journal entries. Rooted in the concept of cultural safety, the training focuses on identifying the social, po litical and historical factors impacting the health of Indigenous people s (e.g., re sidential schools, Indian hospitals, racism, stereotyping and discrimination, health inequities and the social determinants of health ). It supports health care professionals and others engaged in the health system to critically reflect on their personal positions and backgrounds and raise awareness about how these factors influence their working relationships with Indigenous people . San'yas Indigenous Cultural Safety Training45 also introduces tools for developing better communication and relationship -building skills. While initially developed for health staff, the t raining modules have e xpanded to include mental health , child welfare , justice and public service sectors . It has been accredited by several health profession colleges and regulatory bodies , and the training is offered throughout (and in some cases is mandatory) Regional Health Authorities , the Ministry of Health , the MMHA and the FNHA. Advanced post -training modules have been introduced in the areas of anti-racist training, mental health and 44 BC Associatio n of First Nations , First Nations Summit, Union of BC Indian Chiefs, Province of BC.

San'yas Indigenous Cultural Safety Training Program Executive Report. 32 First Nations Health Authority 57 1,028 86 1,171 92% Providence Health Care 0 80% Totals 1329 27,111 4531 32,971 87% There has been overwhelmingly positive response to th e San'yas trainin g model and while it is clear from the completion rates there have been successes ,47 there have also been challenges and limitat ions. For example, t his program does not receive core funding and, as a result, heavy demand has resulted in waiting lists. The Tripartite Evaluation Working Group survey of members of the Implementation Committee and Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health found there was concern that the online training covers only the basics and does not provide a deep understanding of the historical relationships and power dynamics that affect the contemporary healing journeys of BC First Nations and Canada. San'yas is a foundational course that addresses gaps in knowledg e about Indigenous peoples while promoting self -awareness and providing opportunities for skill development. Designed for the non -Indigenous learner, it is introductory in nature and requires organizational commitment to ongoing learning and reinforcement (the program also occasionally offers Indigenous -participant -only cohor ts, adapted for Indigenous practitioners and staff, who may bring with them lived experience and a deeper understanding of cultural safety, and is also designed to mitigate the risk of triggering trauma) . Several key informant s emphasized the need for this learning process to be ongoing and that follow up training should be integrated into training plans on a continual basis. Several key informant s indicated that while San'yas provides a good underpinning for learning , it does not necessarily change someone's behaviour. San'yas is a foundational step toward changing behaviour that requires sustained effort, accountability and commitment to structural changes within organizations. The training process is a reflective one, so it is self -driven and self -determined; thus, if people do not volunteer and create time and space to do the training , it will not get done. In addition to the S an'yas T raining provided by the PHSA, key informant s suggested that follow -up training should include specific modules for each health authority on the territories, Nations and communities where staff provide services. 47 For example, o ver 1,000 Fraser Health staff enrolled in San' yas in the 2018/ 2019 fiscal year , representing a 100% increase over the prior fiscal year . 33 A number of health authorities have complemented the impact of the San'yas training by establishing dedicated educator positions and shaping experiential learning opportunities to create positive behavioral change for health authority staff interacting with First Nations and other Indigenous patients. Fraser Health Fraser Health uses San'yas as foundational training for staff and th en works to move the conversation to the next level through debrief ing circles that create space within the organization to discuss how to address racism within the system. Experiential learning opportunities are being considered to supplement the ongoing learning required for cultural humility among staff . As of February 2019 , 1,572 F raser Health employees and volunteers had completed the Introduction to Indigenous Health eLearning module . Interior Health Aboriginal Cultural Safety Education and Employm ent Initiatives In 2016, Interior Health created a cultural safety and humility education position, leading to the creation of an education plan presented to and endorsed by the leadership and senior executive team. The position identifies and tracks the h igh, medium and low priorities for those requiring training by 2020. After the pilot year in 2016, findings were evaluated to enable revision of the program as needed. In 2018, this role grew to support two educators, to cover the entire health region . The Interior Health Abori ginal Cultural Safety Education program and associated 2017/ 2018-2019/ 2020 education plan operationalize key activities, which aim to build the cultural competence of I nterior Health staff to support the provision of culturally safe and relevant care for Aboriginal peoples in the Interior region. An Aboriginal Health Practice Lead supports three Cultural Safety Educators , a Knowledge Coordinator and an Administrative Assistant . Aborig inal Cultural Safety Education modules are now mandatory for all employees. More than 10,000 Interior Health employees have completed each of the four online modules , exceeding all expectations in the short time they have been mandatory. All existing employees are expected complete the training by March 31, 2020) .48 In 2018, Interior Health rejuvenated its Aboriginal Human Resources Plan based on four cornerstones: Employment and Retention , Workplace Readiness, Recruitm ent 48 Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health Consolidated Progress Report - October 2018 to April 2019. 34 and Leadership Competency. The plan includes tactics for recruitm ent and retention of Aboriginal employees towards the goal of 5% Aboriginal self -identified employees by March 31, 2019 , which it exceeded and expanded to 10% by 2025 .49 Vancouver Coastal Health Vancouver Coastal Health has created training to build relationships and improve knowledge of cultural safety and humility among staff . Vancouver Coastal Health uses an in -person circle method for cultural safety and humility training that includes patient navigators, 'lunch and learns ,' learning circles, newsletters and a binder of self -learning materials and videos. Seni or executives have participated in many sessions, noting how meaningful they found the training and that they would like to see uptake by as many staff as possible. As of Nov ember 2018 , more than 1,500 staff had completed the Foundationa l Indigenous Cultural Safety in- person training (first offered in October 2017 ),50 and as of April 2019, 300 acute care staff at Vancouver General Hospital received training.51 Vancouver General Hospital and Vancouver Coastal Health jointly undertook research to consider the return on investment, the cost of training mental health and cardiac teams and the change in staff knowledge to understand whether training has affected change. Island Health Cultural Safety and Employment Initiatives Island Health created a six -hour facilitated, in -person workshop to deepen health care staff's ability to foster a more culturally safe health care environment and improve health outcomes for Indigenous people. F acilitators use a circle process with group process guidelines and enco urage participants to practice self-care throughout the day. The workshop explores issues and introduc es learning to raise awareness of deeply held attitudes and preconceptions about Indigenous people and to expand participants' knowledge of the historical and social processes affecting Indigenous and non- Indigenous people. It is expected that workshop participants have already completed prior online or other learning about colonial history. By enhancing relational skills, facilitators hope to build culturally safe environments and interactions between health care providers and clients that will reduce barriers and improve cultural s afety and increase Indigenous clients' access to health care services. As of April 2019, w ork has begun with Emergency 49 Ibid 50 Vancouver Coastal Health. (2018) Connections for Leaders. 51 Information provided b y a key informant in an interview with the consultant. 35 Departments at Campbell River Hospital, West Coast General Hospital and Victoria General Hospital to s upport staff to participate in cultural s afety education.52 Island Health recognizes the n eed to create a more representative workforce to better serve Indigenous clients . With the early and ong oing support of executive leadership, Island Health has launched initiatives that include hosting workshops on the range of careers av ailable in health care, attending career fairs and offering Indigenous job applicants one -on-one employment support from an Aboriginal Career Coach. In addition, Island Health has actively recruited First Nations and other Indigenous workers who have the skillsets to fill o pen positions and its applicant tracking system includes a mandatory diversity question for internal and external applicant. Further, the health authority has improved retention rates by communicating to Indigenous staff the value they bring to their work and the organization. Through this initiative, the number of Island Health employees who self-ident ify as Indigenous has increased from 199 individuals (or 1.09% of the total workforce) in April 2012 to 613 individuals ( or 3.04% of the total workforce ) in December 2016 .53 Northern Health Indigenous Health Resources Northern Health Indigenous Health team created a series of booklets to support Indigenous people s in accessing and navigating the health care system. These outline the patient complaint proc ess, mental health and addictions programs and services , and sacred spaces and gathering places in Northern Health facilities and grounds . The booklets are designed to ensure this information is accessible to those without regular access to a computer or t he Internet. Each booklet was developed in response to needs identified by Indigenous community members, leaders and health care providers , and both i nternal and external stakeholders and partners were involved in developing and reviewing the content. The materials were visually designed to make the booklets approachable and engaging and the content is presented in plain language and laid out to maximize readability. Copies have been distributed in hard copy and electronic form to as many clients as possible - electronically via newsletters, email, social media and websites; in hard copy at meetings, events, conferences and health fairs ; and, by mail to Northern Health facilities. Northern Health is monitoring distribution and download rates of the documents and is collecting qualitative feedback on the documents at meetings and through a Northern Health- wide survey about the Indigenous Health department 52 Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health Consolidated Progress Report - October 2018 to April 2019. 53 Ibid 36 and its resources. In addition to client resources, N orthern Health funded First Nations to develop resour ces to teach health providers about the ir communities. Aboriginal Patient Navigation Aboriginal Patient Liaison/Navigation (APL/N) was introduced as a health care intervention in 1986 to reduce barriers and improve the health care experience of Indigenous patients within the hospital system and to make the system more culturally safe for Indigenous patients at the point of care . Today there are APL/N positions across all regional health a uthorities . Cultivating a relationship between Indigenous patients and their health care providers - and ensuring the cultural safety of the clinical encounter - is the main role of an APL/N . They facilitate communication between the patient/family and health care providers; provide emotional support to patients/families; advocate on behalf of patients; facilitate and/or provide practical support; facilitate spiritual care; facilitate cross -cultural competence with health care colleagues; liaise with Indigenous communities and community organizations; document the services provided; and, promote the program.54 In 2015, the Aboriginal Health (now Indigenous Health) Program at the PHSA conducted a review of the APL/N Program in British Columbia . The review found that \"while the Aboriginal Patient Liaisons /Navigator s provide a range of functions along a patient's health care journey, the greatest value of their service is in assisting patients and their families to navigate the complex, confusing, highly structured and fast paced system within a hospital.\"55 It also identified p osition, program, organizational and provincial strategies to improve the program. Engaging Outside the Health System The health system and its services are connected to and part of, a broader network of systems and services accessed by BC First N ations and Indigenous peoples . The health sector's championship of cultural safety and humility is now reaching into these related systems and services. 54 Provincial Health Services Authority. (2015). Dancing i n both worlds: a review of the A boriginal patient liaison/navigation program in British Columbia . 55 Ibid 37 BC Coroners Service (BCCS) One example of significant progress cited by key informant s is the success the BCCS has had in working with pathologists who conduct autopsies to make their practice more culturally appropriate for the families and communities of deceased First Nations infants. Previously, it had been the standard practice of pathologists to retain the brain stem of a deceased infant for a month. This was counter to the First Nations need for the body to be whol e within a few days so it could move to the The loss of a child is a devastating trauma and extremely difficult to articulate in mere words. Four years ago, my little two -month -old niece, Makara, passed away suddenly without warning. This tragedy was only the beginning of a traumatic series of events within a system that is intended to provide care. As Tla'amin people, our traditional laws direct us t o carry out our death protocols within a week's time, with our loved ones' bodies intact so they can carry out their role in the spirit world. We also appoint an advocate to speak for the family in their time of grief. For Makara, an autopsy was ordered by the coroner, as with any infant death and the report came back clear of any criminal wrongdoing. We were then informed that, without our consent, her body was being returned to us but her brain stem was to be retained for several weeks for medical investi gation despite no further legal concerns. We were told that, regardless of the will of the family or the additional trauma and grief this would cause, this was standard practice and was for the greater good of society. This conflict between cultural ways of living and systemic policies is a tragic example of culturally unsafe services that can do more harm than good. As a result of the BC First Nations Health Partnership with federal and provincial governments, work is under way to begin to address these challenges. [....] Makara's legacy is a Coroners Service that acts with cultural humility. Their willingness to consider the voices of the people they serve and review their practices has helped them establish culturally safe practices for all British Colu mbians . Joe Gallagher, First Nations Health Authority calls for cultural safety in B.C. Globe and Mail: Published Monday, Jun. 20, 2016 . 38 spirit world. Changes in practice of BCCS include developing regional death and dying protocols and ensuring that FNHA staff are included or providing training in the event of complicated deaths. The FNHA and BCCS signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2014 to address how the policy and practice of coroners and their coordination with other partners (R oyal Canadian Mounted Police , pathologists , the Ministry of Children and Family Development, Representative for Children and Youth) can improve to be more respectful and inclusive of family member decision -making and death and grieving protocols. As a result of the FNHA and BCCS collaboration, the BCCS has changed the approach to the post mortem investigation of these deaths to ensure that the least invasive means possible is used based on each individual situation and discussions with the family. This means that BCCS no longer routinely requires the retention of brain stems unless findings indicate a need for fu rther neurological examination. This is a positive policy c hange , not only for First Nation s and Indigenous people s, but also for all provincial residents who may experience a tragic death. Key informant s indicated that while the work with the BCCS was difficult at first, lasting relationships emerged from the process. Through challen ging but respectful dialogue, the FNHA encouraged the BCCS to understand First Nations' cultural practices and interests , as well as to review the evidence on the value of brain -stem retention. After this request, the BCCS reported back that in 138 infant death autopsies, further neuropathological examinations after brain stem retention added no value to the investigations and did not illuminate findings that had not already been identified through autopsy . The BCCS acknowledged these practices caused harm to families and were unnecessary. Their new practice provides all BC families with the choice to determine how their children's remains will be treated once legal requirements ar e satisfied. As of 2016, the vast majority (over 90%) of families - including both First Nations and non- First Nations families - had their children's remains returned intact and have more of a voice in determining how their children's remai ns will be treated. This is but one of the many activities that the BCCS has undertaken to enhance the cultural safety and humility of its policies, practices and practitioners. The BCCS is often cited as one of the most meaningful cultural safety and hum ility partne rs for BC First Nations. 39 Emergency Management The wildfire season of 2017 was a turning point for the BC provincial emergency management system, sparking reports such as the Chapman/Abbott \"Addressing the New Normal: 21st Century Disaster Mana gement in BC\" and \"With Us, Not f or Us, FNHA Interior Region Report on Wildfires 2017\" (and 2018 update). These reports note the need for enhanced cultural safety as well as the need for more fulsome collaboration between provincial emergency management ag encies and First Nations, based on respect for self -determination, traditional knowledge and reconciliation. At a 2018 Interior Regional Caucus Meeting, the Interior Regional Caucus passed a resolution entitled \"State of Emergency ,\" demonstrating consensus among First Nations leaders in that region that tripartite agreements on emergency management need to be entered into at the Nation level rather than, or in addition to, at the provincial level. The resolution calls upon federal and provincial government s to conduct meaningful Nation -to-Nation engagement on emergency management and that Nations need to be supported to build the necessary capacity to prepare, mitigate, respond and recover from emergencies with direct funding to develop and implement Nation -based tripartite emergency management agreements . 56 This wholistic , Nation -based approach to emergencies recognizes the importance of more effective, culturally safe, collaborative wildfire/flood emergency response s, wherein First Nations ' inherent right to participate in decision -making affecting their communities helps to addre ss trauma and support wellness. Response and recovery from natural disasters, on top of intergenerational trauma, mental healt h crises and the overdose public health emergency, must also acknowledge the cultural disruption caused by impacts on traditional medicines, food security, income security and heightened stress and anxiety. Recommended actions and lessons learned from 2017/2018 wildfires and floods have since become priori ties. In spring 2019, the FNHA Interior Region received $5.985 million from the Canadian Red Cross -BC Region provincial recovery fund for two years of mental health and wellness planning and actions to support mental health recovery in the 28 Interior com munities affected by the 2017 wildfires. These funds also support capacity within each of the seven Interior Nations to hire a Nation -based Emergency Mental Health and Wellness Manager and can be used to support 56 FNHA Interior Region. (May 2019). Bi -Annual Report. 40 traditional and cultural healing activities. In 2018, t he provincial government also provided funding to the FNHA to support Aboriginal Focused Oriented Therapy and Complex Trauma Certificate training in order to support recovery .57 Stemming from these reports and experiences, in May 2019 , EMBC and the FNHA signed a Letter of Understanding outlining \"shared priorities for service and operational improvement and an ongoing working relationship between the two signatories .\" 58 Through the Letter of Understanding , the FNHA , EMBC, Ministry of Health and Regional Health Authorities will better coordinate and integrate emergency management with and for First Nations in BC and will work to incorporate First Nation s perspectives into provincial emergency management legislation, strategies, policies and actions. The FNHA and EMBC also signed a Declaration of Commitment to Cultural Safety and Humility, committing to embed cultural safety and humility training within or ientation, learning and staff development at EMBC and other emergency management partners. EMBC has begun cultural safety t raining to support diversity and inclusion and has initiated conversations with other partners to begin significant training and educ ation with their staff, volunteers and other front line staff. Efforts to Create Culturally Safe Health Environments Recognizing that welcoming physical spaces and artwork are an important signal of organizational culture and expectations, recognition of In digenous communities and territories has been integrated in various facility planning processes, with artwork, acknowledgement of territories and sacred spaces having been established in all regional cancer centres in BC and across many health authority facilities .59 There are many efforts across the province to create culturally safe health environments where Indigenous clients receive services. More hospitals and clinics have spaces that can be used for cultural ceremonies or for extended families visiting clients . For example, seven I nterior Health hospitals have existing sacred spaces , with an additional four initiating the development (Boundary, Nicola Valley, Arrow Lakes and Vernon Jubilee). Royal Inland Hospital recently celebrated the talents of a local artist who designed a stain glass wall that has become a beautiful feature of th e hospital's Sacred Space. 60 More Regional Health Authorities are creating Elder -in-Residence 57 Emergency Management BC and FNHA .

In 2018 , PHSA Facilities Management , in partnership with Indigenous Health, began developing facility design guidelines for renovations and new builds, taking into account best practices for culturally safe spaces and engagement with local Indigenous communities .61 Lastly, i n No vember 2018, a Coast Salish totem pole celebrating crossing cultures and healing was raised at the Ministry of Health in Victoria. Over 300 Ministry of Health and MMHA staff had the opportunity to participate in t he carving process as an experiential activity of cultural humility and continuous learning. North Island Hospitals Project Two new hospitals were opened in the N orth Island in late 2017 - one in the Comox Valley and one in Campbell River - each incorpora ting culturally safe spaces by design . In 2012, as planning for these hospitals commenced, the North Island Hospitals Project created an Indigenous Working Group so the hospitals' design would reflect Vancouver Island First Nations and M\u00e9tis cultures, comm unity history and values , and local artists. Both hospitals feature a special culturally safe, spiritual and non- denominational \"Gathering Place\" room next to the main entrances. While the design of these rooms recognize the Vancouver Island Indigenous cultures, the rooms are available for people from all cultures. Indigenous Working Group members helped to ensure that the Gathering Place designs include d a larger exterior view to maximize natural lighting, as well as direct access to an outdoor garde n with traditional medicinal plants. These rooms also have flexible spaces and systems, including soundproofing and ventilation, to accommodate a wide variety of ceremonial practices, such as music, drumming and smudging. In addition, these facilities have space to securely store ceremonial items. Next steps will include developing g uidelines for how the rooms are used, so those running the facilities understand the cultural practices . Island Health Indigenous Working Group, clinicians and others will work together on these guidelines . 62 Similar r enovations are happening in other hospitals, such as Royal Jubilee in Victoria. The Saanich Peninsula Hospital has placed a totem pole to create a welcoming atmosphere as clients , families and community members enter the hospital. Many hospitals and clinics have incorporated Indigenous art, and some are introducing signage in First Nations languages. 61 Provincial Health Services Authority. (2018). Working together to advance Indigenous cultural safety in health care . 62 Island Health. (2016) . A Gathering Place for everybody . 42 Commit ment to Monitoring , Evaluation Strategies and Core Indicators Key informant feedback notes that while some organizations are putting plans in place, outcomes of those plans have yet to be tracked . Formal strategies and work plans require accountability to ensure that commitments are met . Key informant s noted that tripartite tables (e.g., the Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health (TCFNH) ) are important forum s for the partners to come together to check in on progress and change approaches as needed. 23 regulatory colleges - such as those responsible for regulating nurses, pharm acists, dentists and physicia ns - signed Declarations of Commitment and have added a cultural safety and humility question to their annual license renewal processes and are tracking responses. One concern identified in the Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health survey responses is that once short -term goals have been achieved, partners and stakeholders may feel they have done enough and discontinue learning and growing with regard to cultural safety and humility in their organizations . The work that we've been doing as an organization is trying to get the health authority and organizations to embed C ultural Safety and Humility as [a] normal piece of their work so it's not a special piece of work, it becomes just something that's part of their annual work plan, part of their day -to-day business.63 BC Patient Safety and Quality Matrix and Quality Forum Another opportunity to embed and evaluate cultural safety and humility within the BC health system is the redesign o f the BC Health Quality Matrix. This Matrix is used to guide planning, improvement and evaluation of patient safety and quality within the provincial health system. In partnership with the FNHA and stakeholders across the province, the BCPSQC is refocusing the Matrix from the predominant clinical lens towards reflecting an Indigenous perspective.64 This means moving away from an illness - and deficit -based approach towards a more wellness - and strengths -based focus in keeping with the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness. Additionally, the FNHA and the BCPSQC have partnered to ensure that Indigenous health and wellness is completely embedded in the annual provincial Quality Fo rum, with full stretches of dedicated programming. 63 Ibid 64 BC Patient Safety and Quality Council. (2020 ). BC Health Quality Matrix Handbook . 43 Organizational Cultural Competency S elf-Assessment Tools Interior Health , at the request of the I nterior Health Aboriginal Health Team, developed an evaluation framework around the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Strategy 2015 -2019, specifically regarding Advancing Cultural Competency and Safety. The PHSA , in collaboration with the I nterior Health Evaluation Department , evolved the work into an assessment tool to determine organizational Aboriginal cultural competency to measure the current state of organizational cultural competency and infor m the direction and focus of f uture planning and evaluations. The tool was developed to support Interior Health's strategy to build and enhance the cultural competence of the organization and its employees in order to provide culturally safe and relevant care for Indigenous people s. The tool outlines standards for each domain based on areas of function and structure within the organization and could be adopted by other organizations for assessment and evaluation , in order to allow for cross -system information sharing . For each of the six organizational domains and areas of function and structure within the organization, s tandards are rated through a range of qualitative indicators across columns r eflecting stages toward Indigenous cultural competency . The same six domains are the basis for the PHSA Strategy : Figure 4: Indigenous Cultural Safety Strategy Action Areas 65 65 PHSA. (2018). Indigenous Cultural Safety Strategy: Directional Plan. 44 Development of Indicators So, we knew from previous wo rk that First Nations had a higher burden of illness when they enter the system and they have a higher prevalence of ambulatory, treatable conditions when they do get into hospital. So if the vision and the outcome is actually a better health care system t hat is more culturally sensitive and appropriate for First Nations people, then we should be able to measure that in First Nations individuals' experience of the health care system in a survey and we also should see it hopefully reflected or starting to be reflected in the data, in that I would expect to see a lower burden of disease when people get into the system, but fewer illnesses in the hospital are actual ly sensitive to ambulatory care. 66 According to research performed by the PHSA, \"a few frameworks aiming to increase cultural safety and competency have been developed by health authorities in Canada, yet there is a lack of evaluative studies on their impacts or outcomes. Although these framew orks are based on research about what is needed to create safer and more equitable health care environments, structural transformation takes time and long -term health outcomes can be difficult to measure. \" 67 Work is underway to develop indicators, based o n existing foundational documents and agreements, to help measure improvements. According to a number of key informant s there is no useful baseline measurement of the state of cultural safety and humility across the health system now or prior to the start of this work in 2010. Currently t here is no system -wide Indigenous client or employee survey data, no r systemic measurement at the health authority level to assess how Indigenous clients experience health care. Key informant s note that important interventi ons have occurred, but questions remain about who gets to say what \"improved \" means and what effect interventions may have at which points in the system. The PHSA's organizational indicators of Indigenous Cultural Safety are currently in developm ent in the following areas: Indigenous Governance , Leadership and PHSA accountability ; Experiences and Incidents of Racism and Discrimination ; and Workforce Experiences and 66 Tripartite Evaluation Working Group. (2 018). Implementation Committee/ TCFNH Survey, Interview and Focus Group Findings. (Unpublished) 67 PHSA. (2016). PHSA Cultural Safety Framework: An Organizational Assessment Tool. 45 Representation .68 The TCFNH has mandated the development of a cultural safety and humility measurement framework, to be led by a standing committee that undertakes performance measurement and evaluation across the BC health system. Partnership with Health Standards Organization By supporting standards and/or participating in accreditatio n, organizations can demonstrate that they provide high -quality, effective, patient -centred and safe care. Standards help build trust and promote learning within communities while optimizing the use of resources. In December 2017, the FNHA and the Health Standards Organization signed a letter of intent to develop a cultural safety and humility standard specifically for British Columbia . This will p rovide a standard within organizations and systems to guide performance and continuous quality improvement for cultural safety and humility . A Technical Committee was struck and has commenced work to develop this standard. While the Health Standards Organization proc ess for standard development continues to guide the process, the process has been adapted to be culturally safe by: Recognizing Indigenous methodologies, such as the inclusion of an El der in the technical committee; Recognizing Ownership, Control, Access and Possession ( OCAP ) principles in the agreement with T echnical Committee members ; Increasing the number of face -to-face meetings ; and, Establishing a different consensus -building process for the T echnical Committee . Fraser Cultural Safety Review Upon signing the Declaration of Commitment in 2015, Fraser Health began working on the Fraser Salish Cultural Safety and Humility Fram ework, developing approximately 40 tangible and pragmatic strategies to meet the objectives of the commitment in harmony with their regional health and wellness plan. In 2019 , Fraser Hea lth conducted a review of cultural safety and humility across the health authority , including the efficacy of its cultural safety policies, strategies and practices by identifying gaps in culturally safe practices and articulating solutions to resolve thos e gaps, taking into account the unique organizational realities of Fraser 68 Ibid 46 Health at the regional and local leve l.69 The findings will support the renewal of the Fraser -Salish Partnership Accord . In 2019 , Fraser Health conducted an Indigenous staff experienc e survey completed by 18% of its self-identifying Indigenous staff . Results will be used to inform human resource and staff retention strategies .70 69 Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health Consolidated Progress Report - October 2018 to April 2019. 70 Ibid 47 Evaluating Improvements in Cultural Safety and Humility Without baseline data assessing how First Nation s clients experience health care , it is difficult to assess the degree to which cultural safety and humility have been improved in the health system. Further, it is difficult to measure something that is defined by each individual client. As such, partners c urrently rely on process measures , meaning that measuring improvements in cultural safety and humility at this stage is more observational and anecdotal for the purpose of this case study . Key informant s suggested that one important indicator to monitor i s level of service use. If health authorities can successfully monitor self -identification of Indigenous clients, then service utilization data can demonstrate whether health service use is increasing and whether the gap in service use between Indigenous p eople s and other residents is closing (both indicators of whether Indigenous clients feel safe in using health services). A number of key informant s drew attention to the issue of assessing whether cultural safety and humility have improved within the BC health system as a whole , suggesting that it would be most meaningful to measure these changes at a regional and sub -regional basis. This measurement would provide a better sense of where changes may be most needed and where successes should be celebrated , as well as to better report and demonstrate accountability to the communities and Nations being served. Has Cultural Safety and Humility Improved? Has cultural safety and humility been improved within the BC health system? That depends on how you define \"improve. \" It has improved in the sense that there is increased awareness and more conversations about cultural safety and humility. T here is more focus and more information on cultural safety and humility, there are more programs and initiatives that have been developed or are in development. Last week, a colleague from Manitoba commented that the work that is happening in BC is not happening in other parts of the country. But, do I think that we are providing culturally safe services throughout the health system? No. Many clinicians and providers are completely unaware of 48 the commitments to cultural safety and humility, while others are aware but have not changed their behavio ur. At the systems level, not much has changed. - Key Informant One key informant stated that cultural s afety and humility go beyond the health care system to a larger social issue, where a transformation is needed within Canadian society in terms of how it looks at people who have a different way of being. Are we at a spot where cultu ral safety and h umility are embedded and working in all cases within the system? Nowhere close. But at least there's an acknowledgement and recognition of moving towards that and that there's a gap. I think before people wouldn't even recognize there was a gap. - Key Informant Many key informant s felt that some improveme nts have been made. As examples, they noted more facilities adapting to accommodate larger First Nations and Aboriginal families and support networks , and more facilities accommodating cultu ral ceremonies relating to birth and death, including ceremonies that require ventilation systems for smudging. Many facilities have shown increased openness to listening and accommodating these cultural needs. At a higher -level yes. And the front line it is getting there. There is lots of planning and discussion at the executive level, yet we still face a number of complaint s. - Key Informant Key informant s described witnessing an expansion in frontline health care professionals working to understand and implement cultural safety and humility in their work. The movement has grown from Aboriginal Health Managers and Director s to include site managers, emergency room nurses, doctors and pharmacists, among others. While many have described progress as slow an d occurring in limited areas, key informant s also felt that some meaningful foundational progress has been made that should continue to be built upon. In response to a survey of members of the Implementation Committee and Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health , approximately half of interview participants indicated that First Nations perspectives have been increasingly 49 integrated into service planning and decision making within the provincial health system. Close to the same number stated that Fir st Nations have experienced an increase in responsiveness in their experiences within the health care system, although it was acknowledged that more access and infrastructure are still needed. I think we're seeing a real eye- opening exercise around the pr ovince in terms of FNHA having an actual role bringing something to t he table in terms of, not only the voice of our constituents, but the perspective we're bringing in terms of wellness and First Nations perspective and setting certain values and developi ng ... the discussion around Cultural Humility . 71 Regarding whether programs and services are more reflective of First Nations perspectives on health and wellness, the 19 survey participants provided an average score of 3.6 out of 5 ; 72 while they provided an a verage score of 3.5 out of 5 on the question of whether cultural s afety has improved in the BC health system. These ratings suggest that partner s have made some progress in meeting their commitment to work together to improve health and wellness services f or First Nations.73 Improving Trust in the Health System and Reducing Racism as a Barrier to Health One of the barriers to good health lies squarely in the lap of the health care system: many First Nations and Aboriginal people don't trust - and therefor e don't use - mainstream health services because they don't feel safe, due to \"being treated with contempt, judged, ignored, stereotyped, racialized and minimized \".74 Key informant s provided feedback on and assessment regarding whether trust in the health system has improved and racism has been reduced as a barrier to health. 71 Ibid 72 Note that 5 represented the highest mark a survey respondent could provide, indicating great progress, while 1 represented the lowest mark a respondent could give, indicating no progress. 73 Tripartite Evaluation Working Group. (2018). Implementation Committee/ TCFNH Survey, Interview and Focus Group Findings. (Unpublished). 74 Ibid 50 While the Implementation Committee and TCFNH survey indicated changes in approach and responsiveness of service providers, b y and large, key informant s did not feel there has been a significant reduction in racism or an increase in trust. That said, others noted that the First Nations health governance structure and discussion s of cultural s afety and h umility within leadership circles has created space within the health system to name and talk about racism toward First Nations and Indigenous people s. First Nations people have a voice in terms of racism in the health system and being able to directly name it and confront it ... This is very quickly translated int o action and understanding what's acceptable and what's not.75 The cultural safety and humility tables that operate within each region were identified as a key forum for addressing the level of racism that operates within the health care system and improving health care practice. The forums include many of the key decision -makers and stakeholders who can help create culture changes within each of the respective organiz ations and areas of practice. Prior to the introduction of 'Cultural Safety and Humility ' into the lexicon, there was a great hesitancy to talk openly about racism within the health care system itself. Now, there are more conversations where people are openly acknowledging racism and/ or that the perception of racism may be hindering access to timely and quality care. Becoming conscious of one's unconscious biases is the first step, which then enables one to admit and acknowledge the reality of racism. Shou ldn't we have done that already? It isn't necessarily obvious for some. It can be an emotionally turbulent journey to go through that awakening. That's why it's so important to guide people through that first step . - Key Informant There was both a sense of skepticism and hope amongst key informant s about whether cultural safety and humility efforts could reduce racism as a barrier to good health - whether or not the system can change . As on e key i nformant put it : 75 Ibid 51 There's so much acceptance of racis m, period. It's like there's a certain percentage that's allowable to exist, like, 'I'm going to accept a 15% surgical infection rate.' Certainly , people are trying, but there's just so much work to do in even getting people to understand the history in Canada. There are those people who have some kind of issue and seem compelled to take it out on other people, particularly vulnerable people. And let's face it, are [we] ready to talk about white supremacy or the idea of the supposedly natural ranking of rac es and peoples , with white people at the top, that so many people still believe in, whether consciously or not ? - Key Informant Some key informant s felt that strides have been made in terms of building relationships that help establish trust between their organizations and communities. Some felt hopeful that changes to social attitudes occurring in recent years will help carry the changes needed through at all levels of the health system. Key informant s noted the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's Calls to Action have raised awareness of how First Nations people experience the health care system differently and can be harmed by these experiences. While some improvements have been made, one participant in the I mplementation Committee / TCFNH survey process noted how persistent the problem of racism is at the service level within the health care system: \" There [are] still incidences of structural barriers and racism every week where we [have] to intervene to mediate a circumstance or to r eflect back to the service provider. \" 76 Some key informant s highlighted the lack of appetite to add ress racism and discrimination, suggesting the Parties need to think about how to make tackling racism and discrimination a reward -based initiative . Organizat ions need to not only recognize the health impacts racism and discrimination have on First Nation and Indigenous people s, but be able to discipline those who treat First Nation and Indigenous people s with disrespect. As one key i nformant put it, \"Lives are at stake. I don't want to be other people's learning opportunity.\" Others noted that, w ithout more extensive surveys on patient experiences, it is difficult to know whether trust is being built. Successes and Indicators of Progress It was widely agreed th at the majority of successes o bserved are at the leadership level , while little change is witnessed at the service level where First Nations and 76 Ibid 52 Indigenous clients are interacting directly with the health system .77 Key informant s all acknowledge where impor tant interventions have occurred and recognize that much progress has been made in terms of increased awareness, increased dialogue, increased partnership opportunities and increased initiatives across the health system. All key informant s stressed both th e diffic ulty and importance of the work , and recognized the significant and ongoing commitments to cultural safety and humility from both the Province and the FNHA staff and leadership . Several honoured the leadership of the FNHA 's previous Chief Executive Officer Joe Gallagher , in relentlessly driving the agenda of change forward . One key informant expressed the general sentiment : \"It is pretty amazing to think about how far we have come, though there is still a long way to go.\" I think we can see changes ... there's not that divide. Before, you'd want to get service for a First Nations person; they'd say \"Nope, that's not our responsibility, that's a federal responsibility.\"78 Key informants highlighted successes and indicators of progress to -date as: Partners committing to and using the language and conceptual framework of Cultural Safety and Humility to improve the health care experience of First Nations and Aboriginal clients ; The breadt h and uptake of the Declarations of Commitment across and outs ide of the health system; The FNHA's growing strength and importance as both a resource and a partner that is relied upon , on an ongoing basis, for information, advice and reviewing functions; The sizeable uptake and ongoing demand for San'yas ICS and other training efforts; The participation in the #itstartswith me campaign, the attendance for the action seri es webinars and the number of people that made commitments to advancing this work; and, The dev elopment of organizational and health authority action p lans and assessment tools. 77 This is in part attributed to the short time frame since the implementation of the Tripartite Framewor k Agreement, in part to deeply i ngrained racism and in part to the need for additional training and tools for front line service staff (who, in fact, are actively seeking these out). 78 Tripartite Evaluation Working Group. (2018). Implementation Comm ittee/TCFNH Survey, Interview and Focus Group Findings . (Unpublished). 53 When you know all of the directors and leaders and bring them into your world - they want nothing more than to help you. Those we work with find their work with the Aboriginal population is the most satisfying part of their w ork. They see the results and the change and we talk about it all the time. We give lots of recognition and support to those doing the work. We provide constant communication internally to ensure everyone in the HA has access to information about what we a re up to, raising the profile of Aboriginal Health . - Key Informant Many key informant s indicated there has not been enough time since the implementation of the Tripartite Framework Agreement to see changes ta ke effect at the service level. However, they noted some positive changes at the service level - including an increase in the number of sacred spaces in hospitals, APL/N and Elders on staff available for Indigenous clients in more health authorities - that help make the health care experience more cult urally safe and appropriate for Indigenous clients. While there is a long way to go, it is clear that other jurisdictions, across Canada and globally, look to BC for innovation in culturally relevant and safe care. At the twice - annual TCFNH , members report on cultural safety and humility activities. These successes are included in the annual Together in Wellness reports by the TCFNH , organizational annual reports , news sections of their websites, in their newsle tters and in their social media . Key informant s identified o ne of the most effective means of celebrating success as ceremony and public witnessing, which help build awareness and emotional memory of significant accomplishments. Ceremony and witnessing, particularly involving senior leadership , can have a much greater effect on the culture of an organization than an email blast celebrating an organizational achievement. Key Barriers Thousands of our people are being harmed every day. I see this through the data I have access to. Changes are being made at the highest levels to create a culturally safe organization. But, so far, I don't see a lessening of harm experienced by our people within the system . - Key Informant 54 Initial efforts have unearthed some key barriers in the system and, in some case s, identified the changes needed to overcome them moving forward. Many of the emerging recommendations centre on increased accountability at different levels of the health system. However, one of the largest challenges to progress identified by key informa nts is time . It will take time to grow, evolve and change the predominant health system culture; to address deeply ingrained biases; to change how system priorities are set; and , to develop innovative responses that allow cultural safety and humility to be embedded throughout the health system . Deep -Seated Racism The largest barrier to change cited by key informant s is pervasive r acism, stereotypes and substandard care experienced by First Nations and other Indigenous clients and their families. Some felt hopeful that changes to social attitudes are occurring ; however, b y and large, key informant s do not perceive a significant reduction in racism or increase in trust. Most of the complaints received continue to be about racism, stereotypes and substandard c are. In other cases, people may feel that they have been brushed aside and not acknowledged, as if they are not even there; or are treated with impatience and more roughly because they identify as First Nations. The issue of anti -Indigenous discrimination has never been dealt with in this province. People think if we provide them knowledge of our culture it will magically eliminate discrimination. That's the pedagogy around change. There is serious rigidity to change in organizations. I go to meetings wher e people have never heard about residential schools. It is shocking. They don't understand that they work in a colonized system that oppresses people. When they start to learn, they have no idea what to do. These are deep barriers that work shop s or communi qu\u00e9s won't f ix. There are individuals working inside the system that are hostile to change to address inequities experienced by Indigenous clients. Trying to get some of these individuals to change is like poking a bear. They respond with narrative like \" Why are Indigenous people so special ?\" - Key Informant In 2019 , the PHSA produced a report entitled Mapping the Harms of Indigenous Racism in the British Columbia Health Care System , which depicts eight different categories of harm within three layers of experienced racism: interpersonal, organizational and systemic. Through San'yas data and personal real -life examples, the PHSA has 55 generated data and information about common harms, stereotypes and hotspots, such as inappropriate referrals, culturally inap propriate care practices and lack of resources leading to harms such as death, medical complications and refusal to access care. Some key informant s did note that the First Nations health governance structure and cultural safety and humility leadership di scussions have created space within the health system to name and talk about racism toward First Nations and Aboriginal people s. Systemic racism is a fast -moving vehicle and the work being done to address it and increase awareness and understanding on how to provide services to our pe ople is a slow -moving vehicl e. - Key Informant Key informant s indicated a need for anti-racism tools ; however , another proposed mean s to this end is that the most senior leadership and partners include stronger language and an action plan in their mandate letters and job descriptions around how they will champion implementation and measure success . There is also a recognized need for the Declarations of Co mmitment to resonate through out entire organizations and not only vest with Aboriginal Health units or staff. M andatory deliverables were considered necessary by many key informant s. Western Biomedical Model Despite many of the positive efforts underway, the health care system remains very professional -centric, where relationship s are modelled on practitioner s as expert s directing a patient, rather than one in which the client leads and the practitioner supports . In this paradigm , the client as patient is passive and powerless, the recipient of the caregiver's generosity. The goal of client -centred or relational -based care is for clients to lead with their priorities and questions and health care practitioners to act as resources and knowledge sources to s upport clients in their health goals. Key methodologies for practitioners in this approach include motivational intervi ewing and brief action planning to achieve and co -develop a plan of action that empowers the client to feel ownership and agency . According to the FNHA Traditional Wellness Framework: 56 \"In order to build understanding, more effort needs to be placed on filling the knowledge gap between Western and traditional practices. This can be done by supporting the education of Western medical practitioners and administrators with the fundamental goal of creating an understanding and acceptance of traditional wellness and forming a collaborative approach to health care. Educational topics could focus on understanding traditional wellness practice s, how traditional wellness practices can be built into existing health systems, potential benefits from traditional wellness practices and how these practices can be accessed. Education directed toward the health care patients could focus on the value of combining both traditional and Western practices into the individual's health management. \" 79 According to key informant s, persisting siloe s in health care teams continue to act as a barrier to client -centred care. Members of different professions , all enga ging with the same client , often do not commun icate directly with each other, which does not facilitate wholistic understanding of client needs , nor does it put the client at the centre of the team as an agent. More closely integrated, interdisciplinary an d collaborative teams will better serve and centre clients. Baseline Data As noted, key informant s cite the lack of baseline data and a lack of indicators as a barrier; however , there are a number of t ripartite data and information commitments and initiatives to support First Nations health information governance around the collection, use and sharing of First Nations data. \"Due to the lack of Indigenous identity not being hardwired into other identifi ers, there is a significant reliance on self -identification processes for all data collection related to Indigenous peoples ... Self-identification is the means by which Indigenous people voluntarily identify as First Nations, Inuit and/or M\u00e9tis at the point of care and/or via various survey processes. In BC, there was been an effort to standardize the collection of self -identification information through the Government Standard for Aboriginal Administrative Data, which supports consistency 79 FNHA. (2014). Traditional Wellness Strate gic Framework. 57 in the technical aspects of the data points to be collected by the provincial government and government agencies (Province of British Columbia, 2007). This allows for comparability and quality of data across all government and other agencies in the province. While this sta ndard helps to addresses the quality of the data itself, it does not address the quality of the process to collect the data. Self - identification processes are fraught with potential cultural unsafety; due to processes of colonialism in which the state used Indigenous identity to discriminate against and control the lives of Indigenous peoples, there continues to be significant fear and mistrust on the part of Indigenous clients to be identified as Indigenous (Educational Policy Institute, 2008) .\" 80 At the r egional level, Interior Health launched an Aborigina l Self -Identification Project to support work to \"design and deliver more culturally sensitive programs and integrate traditional practices into the delivery of health care to First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people .\" 81 Patients of hospitals , health care centres and mental health sites that self-identify are asked additional questions and, if desired, receive Aboriginal Patient Navigator services. While there is no one data source or measurement framework that yet comprehensively captures a complete picture of cultural safety for First Nations in BC (although efforts on a system -wide measurement framework are underway) , it is possible to make use of various available data sources , particularly Patient Repo rted Experience Measures and Patient Re ported Outcome Measures . 82 The surveys are conducted province -wide in health care sectors deemed to be priorities by the Ministry of Health and the Health Authorities, including acute inpatient care, emergency departmen t care, outpatient cancer care, short -stay mental health and substance use care and long -term residential care .83 All Patient Repo rted Experience Measures surveys have included an Aboriginal self -identifier ethnicity variable .84 80 Johnson , H. (2018). Measurement of Cultural Safety and Humility in British Columbia (unpublished Capstone). 81 Interior Health. (2019). Aboriginal Self Identification (ASI) Project Frequently Asked Questions . 82 Each data source differs in term s of the sample population, methods for identifying First Nations respondents and subject area. 83 All provincial PREMs reports . 84 The survey question asked whether the respondents considered themselves to be First N ation, Inuit, M\u00e9tis, or Other Indigenous/Aboriginal. For the 2016/2017 Acute Inpatient provincial report, only 58 Results of the acute inpatien t and emergency d epartment sector surveys suggest that self -identified Aboriginal patients' experiences of care differ from those of other residents and vary across health sectors. Self -identified Aboriginal patients scored their overall experiences of car e lower in the emergency department than in acute inpatient settings85 and all global ratings of overall patient experience were significantly lower among self -identified Aboriginal respondents in the 2018 emergency department survey than non -Aboriginal pat ients. This finding is in line with ethnographic research that shows that the experiences of Aboriginal patients in the emergency department is different than non -Aboriginal patients and that experiences can be challenging, with interactions affected by the individual's wider social, economic and historical contexts.86 The cultural safety of patient experiences within the emergency department has been the impetus behind much of the health system's work related to cultural safety and humility. Self- identified Aboriginal patients were also less likely to report that their care providers were completely respectful of their cultures and traditions in both the 2016/ 2017 acute inpatient and 2018 emergency department surveys, as displayed in the figure below. These findings echo results from interviews from individuals who work with patient complaints data. These informants indicate that many patient complaints from Aboriginal patients relate to instances of racism, stereotypical assumptions, lack of res pect or being made to feel like one was less worthy of care. Figure 5: Providers Completely Respectful of Cultures and Traditions , Self -Identified Aboriginal Patients vs Non -Aboriginal Patients, 2016/17 Acute Inpatient Patient Repo rted Experience Measures Survey patients who self -identified as one of these four categories and not another ethnicity were included in the self -identified Aboriginal population . 85 No significance testing is available. 86 Browne, A.J., Smye, V.L., Rodney, P., Tang, S.Y., Mussell B., and O'Neil , J. (2010). Access to primary care from the perspective of Aboriginal patients at an urban emergency department. Qualitative Health Resear ch, 21(3), 333 -348. 59 As baseline data continues to emerge , it will be important to continue tracking this line of evidence. Work is also underway to determine whether there is inherent bias in self -identification (e.g. , if people tend to agree to participate when they have had a positive experience and tend not to when they feel unsafe participating) . As well as some work to develop a research project to increase the cultural safety and humility measures in the Patient Repo rted Experience Measures instrument , the TCFNH also supported the development of a measurement framework for cultural safety and humility across the health system in BC. This will leverage existing health system measurement committee processes to identify and validate ind icators for use across health authority sites and the Ministry of Health . Levers for Change What follows are areas identified by key informant s as the most significant challenges to \"hardwiring\" (or embedding) cultural safety and humility throughout the BC health care system. According to key informant s and practitioners in the area of cultural safety and humility , creating sustainable change in this area will require changes in both behaviours and attitudes in order to change habits and practices. Levers for change typically include communication, training and education, and incentives for health organizations and practitioners to foster cultural humility and offer culturally safe health care for First Nations people . Makin g Cultural Safety and Humility a System -wide R esponsibility Key informant s experienced an overreliance on Aboriginal Health units to carry cultural safety and humility responsibilities for organizations. Those working in health service enviro nments expressed that distributing accountabilities across entire organization s, as well as having others to help lighten the load , would enable them to better facilitate transformation on the front lines, at the level that clients and families experience health care. The FNHA also reports that it carries a disproportionate burden in leading transformation by supporting other partners and stakeholders without sufficient resources for the role. Resources for Mandatory Training While increasing numbers of Ministry of Health , regional health authority and health regulator personnel and those regulated by those bodies are taking the San'yas ICS training , this represents only a small proportion of all staff . In some organizations , training has been made mandat ory, yet many within those organizations have not taken it. The process to enroll and complete training is self-driven and self - 60 determined - therefore, if practitioners do not volunteer and create time and space to do the training it will not get done. Mandatory training has to happen. You can't force people to change the way they think, but if you at least expose them to the opportunity to learn and hear about different worldviews, cultures and traditions, once they understand they will be much more willi ng and able to change . - Key Informant The front lines are where most of the complaints about culturally unsafe experiences emerge. Some may feel resistant once they are told they must take the training, feeling that the training is unnecessary or not rele vant to them and may become defensive as though taking the training is a perceived judgment about them. I think that's one of the biggest barriers, there's a lot of good people in the system but the systems are not geared to think about things in terms of providing health and wellness services in an environment where the individual receiving the service has equal balance of power with those providing the service. We're really looking to embed an Indigenous worldview into health and wellness services and into our decision - making . ... When we're not in the conversation, people go back to their comfort zones and t hat doesn't include us. We're not known yet. We're still building those relationships and trying to open people's minds to how they think about health and wellness as it relates to our people. 87 The largest challenges identified in the delivery of training are resources and capacity. The Aboriginal Health department holds the responsibility for training all health authority staff (20,000 employees); whereas other departments such as Healthy Living are not responsible for training all staff. This demonstrate s that the smallest team has the biggest responsibility. There was no increase in Aboriginal Health funding, human resource capacity 87 Tripartite Evaluation Working Group. (2018). Implementation Committee/TCFNH Survey, Interview and Focus Group Findings . (Unpublished). 61 building, or training dollars identified for this purpose. Accommodating the training was difficult as it involved finding funding for overtime and/or backfilling people to keep operations running while others were taking training. Sustaining the necessary level of training currently requires paying customers . - Key Informant Ways to address these barriers included earmarked b udgets for : Training , allocated within each operational unit's professional development budget , coupled with backfill and overtime funds to enable staff to take training; Inclusion of mandatory training in employees' performan ce plans and reviews and emplo yee onboarding/orientation ; and, Required continuing education and training for all health professional s through regulatory college processes. Key informant s named the need to be able to hold people working in the health system responsible for cultural safety and humility performance, including through progressive discipline. If someone is seen to not have a certain skill needed to do their job or is not doing components of their required work , there are existing ways to implement consequences . Others em phasized the need for organizations to include it in employees' performance plans and reviews. It was suggested that cultural safety and humility be a required competency included in collective agreements and regulatory licensing requirements, so there are meaningful consequences for culturally unsafe behaviour. Recommendations also include having an Elder and/or other independent Indigenous people representative at collective bargaining negot iations to ensure that potentially adversarial employer -emplo yee bargaining dynamic s do not inadvertently leave First Nation s and Indigenous clients and families out of consideration as new agreements are made. Key informant s indicated there is still a long way to go in terms of awareness around health literacy a s a reciprocal responsibility . Indigenous Recruitment and Retention A culturally safe space within health care program and service environments entails the recruiting, hiring and retention of a First Nations and Indigenous workforce. Partner and stakeholder organizations reflect these commitments in their work plans and in the case of regional health a uthorities , results are reported at Tripartite and C hief Executive Officer /Executive tables. Many efforts are underway to recruit 62 First Nations and Indigenous hires and to encourage self -identification, although success is slow and retention remains a challenge . A cultural shift within these workplaces is required to retain these employees. Addressing \"Hot Spots\" Key informant s cited three \"hot spots\" in parti cular: discharging clients, the impacts of trauma and Emergency Departments . Discharging First Nation s and Aboriginal Clients While some education is provided around discharge processes, when discharging a First Nations or Aboriginal client , practitioners in the BC health system need to investigate and ensure the conditions are in place for the client to safely enter into the next stage of healing in their home community. Many First Nations and Aboriginal people have a nega tive experience upon discharge, where providers have not taken the time to ensure the client fully understands next steps in care, or determine what arrangements have been made in their home community , or where service provision is resourced and organized differently. One health authority key informant observed staff becoming more comfortable, asking questions and showing more of a willingness to connect with and solve problems for their clients upon discharge. Impacts of Trauma Many First Nations and Indigenous clients are also dealing wi th a legacy of trauma stemming from the direct and inte rgenerational impacts of coloni alism, and, in particular , the lasting impacts of residential schools . This presents challenges around appropriate treatment and support for these clients. Many health ca re practitioners may be unfamiliar with both the trauma First Nations and Indigenous clients may carry and with methodologies of trauma -informed care. In 2013, the BC Provincial Mental Health and Substance Use Planning Council , in consultation with resea rchers, practitioners and health system pl anners across British Columbia (including the FNHA), developed the Trauma -Informed Practice (TIP) Guide and TIP Organizational Checklist to support the translation of trauma - informed principles into practice .88 One FNHA initiative that applies TIP is the Safe Relationships, Safe Children program, which is being delivered in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the First Nations Health Directors Association .89 Trauma - 88 BC Provincial Mental Health and Substance Use Planning Council . (2013). BC Trauma Informed Practice (TIP) Guidelines . 89 FNHA. (2015). Trauma -Informed Approaches for Substance -Use Treatment . 63 informed approaches are also used and pro moted in the areas of nursing care, substance use treatment and with the BC Coroners Service. Wide development and dissemination of trauma -informed practice approach es and resources , coupled with training for community -facing staff in all health practice a reas, would serve to build trust and foster more confidence in the use of the health system. Emergency Departments One of the most dramatic health disparities shown in available data is the rate of Emergency Department use by First Nations and Indigenous p eople proportionate to the overall provincial and regional population. A higher rate of Emergency Department usage implies these clients access the health care system at later stages and as a result experience comparatively worse health outcomes, in turn i mpacting quality and length of life. This problem is especially pronounced within the Vancouver Coastal region where there are high numbers of Indigenous peoples living in urban areas struggling with the overdose public health emergency. Over - representatio n in Emergency Departments is coupled with a significant level of concern around ongoing reports of poor treatment of First Nations and other Indigenous clients in emergency room settings. There are also unique challenges for Emergency Department personnel to complete cultural safety and humility training, such as backfilling and availability. Within the regions, Fraser Health Emergency Department and Aboriginal health partners collaborate to support Fraser Health staff in improving the overall patient and family experience. Fraser Health is making recommendations to review the Provincial Emergency Department data with internal data (Patient Safety Learning System, Patient Care Quality Office, Real Time Patient Experience Survey, Aboriginal Health staff su rvey data, Fraser Health Aboriginal health cultural safety and humility review insights) to inform tangible, meaningful and appropriate improvements to service and care. 90 The FNHA and Island Health implement Elder (s)-in-Residence to support the inclusion of Indigenous perspectives, knowledge and approaches to wellness within the hospitals with the intent of improving patient experience, health outcomes and supporting hospital staff . 91 Finally, within the Interior region, I nterior Health and its Aboriginal Health division do site walkthroughs with Interior R egion Health Directors to better understand the Aboriginal patient experience in an operational context - from triage and emergency rooms to wait times. First Nations and Indigenous involvement in regional health authority planning ensures strategies to address regional issues have a strong Indigenous lens. 90 FNHA. (2015). Trauma -Informed Approaches for Substance -Use Treatment 91 Ibid 64 The UBC and the Canadian Institute of Health Research have partnered with the University of Northern British Columbia, the Minis try of Health and three emergency departments (St. Paul's, Surrey Memorial and the University Hospital of Northern BC) on Promoting Health Equity for Indigenous and non- Indigenous People in Emergency Departments in Canada . Recognizing that Emergency Departments have the potential to mitigate health inequities and facilitate appropriate care for people with complex health conditions, \"this pro ject examines the feasibility, process and impact of implementing an evidence informed framework for interventions to improve the capacity of Emergency Departments to provide high quality care to people at greatest risk of experiencing health and health ca re inequities. Through collaboration among Indigenous leaders , staff and leaders and researchers, the project aims to improve care, safety, access and decrease adverse events for patients and staff. \" The project features a Tripartite Leadership Model to en gage Emergency Department leadership and staff , with Indigenous and community leadership and researchers, to collect patient baseline data around experience, staff baseline data around Equity Promoting Care and grants to support staff -driven implementation strategies. 65 Summary What is Working Well? Cultural safety and humility work as a concept is now achieving national reach as the FNHA continues to share its knowledge with other jurisdictions across the country, maintaining political support and leveraging mandates and authorities. There has been significant regional, provincial, national and international interest in the work. Key informants emphasized that these efforts have been underway for many years, with the TCA: FNHP (2006) bringing cultural safety and humility issues to the fore and the Tripartite Framework Agreement and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission final report increasing and helping sustain tripartite attention . We need to be cognizant of the advocacy that has taken place for years and years that has brought us to where we are now. We must recognize all the work that they have put into building this possibility we are now putting into effect. The ball has started rolling. We need to keep pushing it forward and make sure it's rolling i n the right direction. With the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , the discourse has changed, within the public and many of our institutions. We are in the position to make generational change. We need more resources to really deliver on the vision th at go t us to where we are today. - Key Informant The cultural safety and humility experience in BC demonstrates the momentum that can be generated through committed and aligned leadership. It is also emblematic of the significant effort and amount of time requi red to achieve system -wide change and address matters of related to bias and racism. A range of initiatives spanning the province are addressing some of the structural, policy and systemic underpinnings of the health system , including : Revisiting the BC Health Quality Matrix to better reflect cultural safety and humility and Indigenous perspectives ; Launching an awareness -raising campaign including a pledge drive and Cultural Safety and Humility Webinar Action Series ; Initiation of a Cultural Safety and Humility Standard ; and, Development of a Cultural Safety and Humility measurement framework . 66 In addition, regional health a uthorities are implementing training and human resource initiatives , working with local communities to include traditional foods in health care service, facilitating cultural practic es in health care environments ( such as through cultural rooms and modified birthing rooms ) and advancing efforts to embed traditional medicine practitioners within hospitals, clinics and primary care netw orks. Across the health system, cultural safety and humility are a cornerstone of the work undert aken by Tripartite Partners and Parties . However, as illustrated in the case study, r acism in the system remains and needs to be addressed. Efforts to date a re particularly strong around developing senior -level commitments and training at the provincial and regional levels. At this point, there is a need to move beyond training and education into initiatives that leverage systemic change. What is Needed Moving Forward ? Embedding Cultural Safety and Humility Within All Levels of the Health System Do we have a strong culture of innovation? Not quite yet. I would like to see change happen more quickly. I don't know if that's possible, but I would like to see for i nstance skill development happen in a faster way. I would like Cultural Safety and Humility embedded in health authority services faster than it's currently happening. ... It's not a criticism, it's just personally, I wish business cultures that we're trying to affect could evolve more quickly. 92 There is c onsiderable recognition of the movement generated in BC on cultural competency, safety and humility - a movement that wa s acc elerated with the signing of various Declarations of Commitment and significant follow -up efforts by signatories. Although there are many activities underway, the p artners recognize that sustained commitment and simultaneous efforts at multiple levels of the system will be needed to permanently \"hardwire\" cultural safety and humility in health -related sectors in BC and beyond. Achieving success will require increasing understanding, ongoing leadership and vision , enhancing accountability, capacity and resou rces, as well as unflagging commitment and collaboration at all levels. 92 Tripartite Evaluation Working Group. (2018). Implementation Committee/TCFNH Survey, Interview and Focus Group Findings . (Unpublished). 67 Implementation Committee and Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health survey respon dents underscored that cultural safety and humility cannot operate on good intentions alone , but must be entrenched into the policies and regulations of health care organizations . The Tripartite Partners must examine what efforts they need to take and how they can support other partners and stakeholders to meet their cultural safety and humility commitments . Suggestions included developing measurement approaches and training standards, building capacity and long -term sustainability planning to support implementation of these commitments.93 Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health Change Leadership Strategy As cultural safety and humility efforts have unfolded, leaders have noted barriers and challenges. In the fall of 2018, the TCFNH identified and brought forward the need to outline approaches and strategies across the system, to provide enha nced support and coordination to the work underway - and to systemically consolidate and embed the gains to date . Implementing and sustaining the changes needed throughout the health system requires action and innovation by all levels of staff within tho se organization s that play a major role within the health system in BC. To this end, the TCFNH mandated the development of a Change Leadership Strategy to complement the action plans of each organization. A Change Leadership Strategy is a response to emerg ing barriers and work s to advance implementation and sustaining change. The Strategy identifies cross -system activities in five key areas: Formalizing a body (co -funded by the FNHA and Ministry of Health ) to support proactive cross -system visibility, stan dardization and knowledge exchange ; Ensuring quality through core standard ization of training and education; Advancing systemic solutions such as embedding cultural safety and humility in policy, the BC Health Quality M atrix and accreditation ; Sharing best practice in supporting people through the change and overcoming resistance ; and , Supporting system -wide measurement, reporting and accountability . 93 Ibid 68 Overall, through this strategy, the TCFNH hope s to coordinate action as one system that balances systematic efforts with local initiatives.94 These efforts have been inclusive of other Indigenous health partners, including M\u00e9tis Nation BC and the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres. 94 Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health. 2018.
