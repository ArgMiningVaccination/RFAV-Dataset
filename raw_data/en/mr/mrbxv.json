As an approach, it aims to treat the body as well as the mind, soul and spirit. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 3 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/3/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Founded by Rudolf ( with Ita Wegman ( ). It \"seeks to unite the spiritual element in the human being with the spiritual element in the universe\". Founded by Austrian scientist and philosopher Rudolf Steiner ( ) and developed in co-operation with Dutch physician Ita Wegman ( ), it \"seeks to unite the spiritual element in the human being with the spiritual element in the universe\". Anthroposophical Medicine [ 4 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/4/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine In anthroposophy, illness is not a chance occurrence of mechanical breakdown, but rather something intimately connected to the biography of the human being. Anthroposophy is a science in which both the human being and the natural world are described not only physically but also in terms of soul and spirit. It seeks to transcend the mechanistic view of man and his physiology as determined by physical and chemical processes alone. Anthroposophically extended medicine does not regard illness as a chance occurrence of mechanical breakdown, but rather as something intimately connected to the biography of the human being. Handled appropriately it presents opportunities for new balance and maturity. The patient is seen and treated holistically as a being of body, soul and spirit. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 5 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/5/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Anthroposophical medicine rests on these premises: Every human being is a unique individual and needs to be treated accordingly. Scientific, artistic and spiritual insights may need to be applied together in restoring health. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 6 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/6/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Anthroposophical medicine rests on these premises contd.. Life has meaning and purpose. The loss of this sense is often reflected in a deterioration of general health. Illness may provide opportunities for positive change and new balance in our lives. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 7 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/7/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine The Anthroposophical picture of man as a four-fold organism A basic premise is that we have a shared evolution with the three kingdoms of nature and therefore a direct relationship with them. In addition man has a fourth higher member of his being which places him in a kingdom of his own. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 8 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/8/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Man has a physical body as any other lifeless object from the mineral kingdom. This physical body would actually disintegrate if an organisation of opposing forces did not keep it together. Anthroposophy calls this organisation of formative forces the life-body, or etheric body. It cannot be perceived by the senses but only what it does. The processes of the life body appear to have the opposite aim from those of the physical body. The latter relate to gravity, which tends towards the centre of the earth. The forces of the life body tend in the opposite direction, towards the cosmic periphery. This is perfectly obvious if we look at plants. Plants root in the earth and grow towards heaven; they are enlivened beings that go against gravity in their growth process. We find the physical body and the life-body exclusively together in living nature in the plant kingdom. They sustain life in all its forms, including processes of growth, reproduction and repair.

We find the physical body and the etheric-body exclusively together in living nature in the plant kingdom. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 11 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/11/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Animals, like man, have feelings, urges, desires, experiences - all of which are lacking in plants. The organ that makes this consciousness possible is the soul or the astral body. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 12 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/12/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine The human being with his self-consciousness goes beyond the animal. He can think, he can imagine, can voluntarily remember, act freely, can be creatively active, etc. Through the little word 'I' man distinguishes himself from animals. The human being has an Ego as the fourth, supersensible member of his being. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 13 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/13/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine The super-sensible bodies intimately penetrate the processes and organs of the physical body during life. These four members of man's being are especially related to the four traditional elements, respectively to Earth, Water, Air and Fire, we can influence these bodies through the balance of the four elements interweaving in the physical body. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 14 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/14/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine [ 15 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/15/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Three-Fold Man If we look at the human body we can distinguish three functional systems, of which two can be seen as diametrically opposed, polar opposite energy centres, with a third unifying force that balances them. Each system permeates the whole body but has its main centre of activity in a particular region. Three-Fold Man Now if we look at the human body we can distinguish three functional systems, of which two can be seen as diametrically opposed, polar opposite energy centres, with a third unifying force that balances them. Each system permeates the whole body but has its main centre of activity in a particular region. Thus we have: The nerve-sense system with its main concentration at the head pole, though its functions extend right to the tips of the fingers and toes. The metabolic-limb system mainly working in the lower part of man at the abdominal pole. The rhythmic system in the middle, concentrated in the lung-heart area, but extending throughout the body via the circulation of the blood.

The metabolic-limb system mainly working in the lower part of man at the abdominal pole.

Anthroposophical Medicine [ 17 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/17/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine [ 18 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/18/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Attributes of three regions 1. The Nerve-sense system 2. The Metabolic-Limb System 3. The Rhythmic system Anthroposophical Medicine [ 19 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/19/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine 1. The Nerve-sense system The environment predominantly acts upon the nerve-sense system. Nerve tissue does not regenerate, and real growth as an expression of life hardly exists in this area; it is the most dead part of the human body. This system is the basis of conscious working life that continually erodes the life and vitality of the physical body. Should this region predominate we have hardening, sclerotic illnesses, conditions of old age. Looked at in very simple terms, the head region is cold, still, quiet and hard when compared with the rest of the body. Through this area we take in the outer world. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 20 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/20/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine 2. The Metabolic-Limb System This region exhibits warmth and movement. Movement, the action of muscles, and non-visible movement, the transformation of substances (metabolism) is a part of it. Rather than passively taking in, as with the nerves and senses, this system actively transforms and eliminates. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 21 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/21/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine 2. The Metabolic-Limb System contd.. It also acts on the environment. It is very much alive. It rebuilds and replenishes during sleep what the nerve-sense system destroys when awake. Should the metabolic-limb system predominate we have inflammatory illnesses, conditions more associated with childhood. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 22 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/22/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine 3. The Rhythmic system In the two polar opposites we see morbid tendencies, towards hardening and sclerosis on the one hand, and towards dissolution and inflammation on the other. The mediator, which brings balance and harmony to the potentially warlike situation, is the rhythmic system, the heart and the lungs. The heart links the whole through circulation and the lungs through the breathing. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 23 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/23/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Health is not an absence of inflammation or sclerosis - but a delicate balance. The 'tendency' for illness is there, but kept in balance. The treatments attempt to restore the balance. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 24 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/24/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Pathology - Two Opposite Illnesses When physical and etheric forces working in the metabolism gain the upper hand, inflammatory or feverish conditions occur. Illnesses of this kind are characteristic of childhood - for example measles and chickenpox - and are regarded as having an important influence in protecting the body from the hardening effects of the nerve-sense system, as well as strengthening the immune system. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 25 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/25/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Pathology - Two Opposite Illnesses Contd... In contrast, degenerative or sclerotic conditions are characteristic of the second part of life. These are seen to occur when the waking activity of the nerve-sense system has been the dominant one over a long period of time. These illnesses, which are often accompanied by sleeplessness, anxiety and a subnormal temperature are considered to be connected to the general intellectual culture of the present age. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 26 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/26/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine The two main kinds of illnesses Anthroposophical Medicine [ 27 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/27/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Treatment Anthroposophical medicine seeks to understand a patient's illness in terms of the interrelationships between the ego, astral body, etheric body and the physical body. The therapeutic aim is to influence the activity of one or more of these elements in order to regain a healthy balance. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 28 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/28/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Treatment Contd... The true \"measure of man\" is a universal measure belonging to the whole of creation, where \"man has the whole of the natural world in him, and nature is an infinitely differentiated human being\", as Paracelsus put it. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 29 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/29/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Therapies Medicines Artistic Therapies Anthroposophical Medicine [ 30 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/30/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Medicines are prepared from substances taken from the mineral, plant or animal kingdom in which forces that counter-balance those of the particular illness may be found. In order to strengthen these forces in the direction of one of the body's main functional systems, many anthroposophically developed pharmaceutical processes are used. Within anthroposophical medicine a number of schools of artistic therapy have developed including sculpture, painting, music and speech. In addition there is a form of movement therapy called eurythmy that Rudolf Steiner was himself instrumental in creating. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 31 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/31/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine Artistic therapies also help the patient to participate actively in the process of restoring his or her own health. These therapies emphasize the need to bring unconscious feelings to outward expression. While most forms of artistic therapies emphasize the need to bring unconscious feelings to outward expression, the anthroposophically trained artistic therapist will also guide and direct the patient into specific exercises based upon a deep understanding of the physiological effects of colour, form, sound and movement. Anthroposophical Medicine [ 32 ](//slideplayer.com/slide/6912329/23/images/32/Anthroposophical+Medicine.jpg) Anthroposophical Medicine In conclusion, one can say that anthroposophical medicine involves the collaboration of professionally trained doctors, nurses, therapists and pharmacists.
