Program Description A1. Purpose The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of Minority Health (OMH) is announcing the availability of funds under the Minority Research Grant Program to test promising solutions that achieve health equity. The goal of this NOFO is to stimulate interest in the characterization and inferential analysis of determining factors associated with health disparities and to provide funding in this area. The Grant Program supports research on the discovery and characterization of health processes, practices, behaviors, and bu rdens or issues that influence health equity and, in particular, research that address the social determinants of health. The Grant Program is an opportunity to support researchers at 1) Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), 2) Hispanic Ser ving Institutions (HSIs), 3) Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander -Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs), or 4) Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). A2. Authority This Grant Program is under the authority of Section 1110 of the Social Security Act and is consistent with four executive orders: Executive Order 13779: Whit e House Initiative to Promote Excellence and Innovation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities Executive Order 13555 : White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics Executive Order 13592: White House Initiative on Improving American Indian and Alaska Native Educational Opportunities and Strengthening Tribal C olleges and Universities Executive Order 13515: White House Initiative on Asian American and Pacific Islanders in Federal Programs More information about these Executive Orders may be found via each of the links above. A3. Background While the United States has made progress toward improving healthcare quality, well -documented inequities persist among racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, and rural populations. Evidence shows that these populations experience a higher disease burden, worse quality of care, and barriers in accessing care. For example, chronic disease morbidity and mortality pose increasingly high costs for the U.S. healthcare system underscoring the need for concerted efforts to improve chronic disease prevention, early detection, and management among priority populations. CMS seeks to achieve health equity by improving quality and making care more person -centered, affordable, and acc essible. Through the Minority Research Grant Program, CMS will support research aimed at achieving health equity and improving healthcare quality leading to more fair and just practices. Key CMS programs include Medicare Part A (hospital coverage), Part B (medical services), Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (prescription drug coverage), Medicaid and CHIP , private health insurance offered through federal and state Marketplaces , and innovative models and 6 demonstrations that test payment and delivery reforms . Within each of these programs, there are opportunities to exp lore issues related to health equity including through CMS Quality Improvement Programs, the Quality Payment Program, Conditions of Participation, formulary and benefit design, reimbursement, risk adjustment, network adequacy, demonstrations and models related to bundled payment, risk -sharing, and value -based payment, instrument design, and cognitive testing of questions in standardized patient assessments. Specific examples of CMS programs and policies addressing health equity include: - Hospice Outcomes & Patient Evaluation (HOPE) instrument: -Instruments/Hospice- Quality-Reporting/HOPE - Accountable Health Communities Model: https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/ahcm/ - Medicaid Innovation Accelerator Program areas related to coordinating care for individuals with complex health needs, community linkages for long- term services and supports, and integration of care across settings: https://www. medicaid.gov/state -resource -center/innovation- accelerator -program/program-areas/index.html - Recent changes Medicare Advantage coverage of telehealth and supplemental benefits: https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-finalizes-policies-bring-innovative - telehealth-benefit- medicare-advantage The MRGP grant shall foster the capacity of principal investigators to advance the understanding of health equity in CMS programs, which enhances the capacity of CMS and other stakeholders to develop solutions and embed health equity across programs and policies . Researchers are expected to collaborate with local minority com munities, rural populations, and/or health systems (e.g. hospitals, health plans, community centers, etc.) in the design, implementation, and evaluation of research projects on issues related to health equity, including social determinants of health in particular. CMS is committed to developing partnerships with minority -serving institution researchers to achieve the goals of the listed Executive Orders described above. A4. Program Requirements The CMS Office of Minority Health administers the Minority Res earch Grant Program (MRGP). The purpose of the grant program is to support researchers at minority serving institutions that are exploring how CMS can better meet the health care needs of racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, sexual and g ender minorities, and rural populations. The three goals of MRGP are to: 1. Develop capacity at minority serving institutions to research health disparities and social determinants of health; 2. Understand the root cause of issues - processes, practices, behaviors, and burdens - that lead to health disparities and identify replicable interventions; and 3. Strengthen CMS programs by disseminating best practices uncovered through funded research. 7 A5. Technical Assistance and Information for Prospective Applicants This NOFO encourages research projects that will develop and test new methodologies and new research technologie s focused on specific topics addressing social determinants of health . The availability of beneficiary data through the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) Public Use Files as well as M apping Medicare Disparities ( MDD) Tool , make it feasible to study factors that contribute to disparities in health outcomes among different racial/ethnic populations. Research projects using CMS beneficiary data by racial/ethnic populations (e.g. American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, African American, Caucasians, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/Latino populations) are encouraged, but not mandated . Projects that are strictly h ypothesis -generating, exploratory and correlative studies are discouraged. As this NOFO is focused upon research, immediate systemically translational potential of the proposed project is NOT a requirement for the proposed projects. Research topics of interest include but are not limited to: o Causal drivers of early onset ESRD in specific populations (e.g. chronic kidney disease in Native American populations) o Inferen tial analysis and modeling for predicting aggressive prostate cancer in African American men o Patterns, behavior, and trends of community network utilization and care coordination among sexual and gender minorities (e.g. medication adherence among transgender and gender non -binary individuals dealing with insecure housing) o Public health interventions designed to meet the needs of people with disabilities (e.g. exercise, life coaches, etc.) o Effect of obesity or obesity -associated health outcomes on populations in rural communities o Role of decision making in medically scarce situations for vulnerable patients o Drivers of behavioral, social, environmental, or community/population -based studies that create health instability among racial/ethnic populations Research topics that are not appropriate for this NOFO: o Genome -Wide Association Studies (GWAS); o Studies investigating biological mechanisms such as metabolic changes/chronic metabolic diseases on the microenvironment (including immune cells, surrounding blood vessels, soluble factors) in racial/ethnic minorities ; and o Studies that do not propose health d isparity research. 8 B.

E2. Review and Selection Process (select one) Anticipated Federal Review Anticipated Mix of Federal and Non-Federal Review E3. Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) i. CMS, prior to making a Federal award with a total amount of Federal share greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS) (see 41 U.S.C. 2313); ii. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through SAM and comment on any information about itself that the HHS awarding agency previously entered and is currently in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM. CMS will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the other information in the designated integrity and performance system, in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing t he review of risk posed by Applicant as described in \u00a775.205. F. Federal Award Administration Information F1. Federal Award Notices If successful, Applicant will receive a Notice of Award (NoA) signed and dated by the HHS Grants Management Officer. The NoA is the document authorizing the grant award and will be issued to the applicant as listed on the SF -424 and available to the Applicant organization through the online grants management system used by CMS and awardee organizations. Any communication between HHS and Applicant prior to issuance of the NoA is not an authorization to begin performance of a project. If unsuccessful, Applicant will be notified electronically within 30 days of the award date. F2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements A. National/Public Policy Requirements By signing the application, the authorized organizational official certifies that the organization will comply with applicable public policies. Once a grant is awarded, the Recipient is responsible for 22 establishing and maintaining the necessary processes to monitor its compliance and that of its employees and, as appropriate, subrecipients and contractors under the grant with these requirements. Recipient should consult the applicable Appropriations Law, Exhibit 3 of the HHS Grants Policy Statement, titled Public Policy Requirements, located in Section II, pages 3 -6, as well as the terms and conditions of award for information on potentially applicable public policy requirements. Non-Discrimination All awardees receiving awards under this grant project must comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination, including, but not limited to: a. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, b. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, c. The Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and d.

Accessibility Provisions Award recipients, as recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from Health and Human Services (HHS), must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws . This means that award recipients must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. It is HHS' duty to ensure access to quality, culturally c ompetent care, including long-term services and supports, for vulnerable populations. HHS provides guidance to award recipients on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. In addition, award recipients will have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities by providing information in alternate formats. Several sources of guidance are provided below: https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disabili ty/index.ht ml Award recipients will be required to review and comply with the Accessibility Requirements outlined in Appendix F to this FOA. Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federa l civil rights laws at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about -us/index.html or call 23 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1- 800-537-7697.

This award is subject to 45 CFR Part 75, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for HHS awards [available at https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi - bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=df3c54728d090168d3b2e780a6f6ca7c&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=tr ue&n=pt45.1.75&r=PART ], which implements 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (\"Uniform Guidance\") effective December 26, 2014. See below for more information. Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements Appl icant and recipients should take particular note of the following information found in 45 CFR Part 75. Uniform Administrative Requirements In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.112, all award recipients receiving federal funding from CMS must establish and comply with the conflict of interest policy requirements outlined by CMS (available for Applicant upon request). In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.113, Mandatory Disclosures, the non-Federal entity or applicant for a Federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in writing to the HHS awarding agency or pass - through entity all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award. Non-Federal entities that have received a Federal award including the term and condition outlined in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 are required to report certain civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings to SAM. Failure to make the required disclosures can result in the imposition of any of the remedies described in \u00a775.371, including suspension or debarment (see also 2 CFR Parts 180 and 376, and 31 U.S.C. 3321). For specific information on reporting such disclosures to CMS and HHS please see Section F3. Terms and Conditions of this FOA. Cost Principles CMS grant awards provide for reimbursement of actual, allowable costs incurred and are subject to the Federal cost principles. The cost principles establish standards for the allowability of costs, provide detailed guidance on the cost accounting treatment of costs as direct or indirect, and set forth allowability and allocability principles for selected items of cost. Applicability of a particular set of cost principles depends on the type of organization. Award recipients must comply with the cost princip les set forth in HHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, Subpart E with the following exceptions: (1) hospitals must follow Appendix IX to part 75 and commercial (for -profit) organizations are subject to the cost principles located at 48 CFR subpart 31.2. As provided in the cost principles in 48 CFR subpart 31.2, allowable travel costs may not exceed those established by the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR). 24 There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect (a lso known as Facilities & Administration (F&A) costs) under every accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, it is esse ntial that each item of cost incurred for the same purpose is treated consistently in like circumstances either as a direct or F&A cost in order to avoid double-charging of Federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and F&A costs charged to Federal awards are provided in 45 CFR \u00a7\u00a775.412 to 75.419. Requirements for development and submission of indirect (F&A) cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in Appendices III-VII, and Appendix IX to Part 75. Indirect Costs HHS will reimburse indirect costs to recipients under an award if (1) allowable under the governing statute, regulations, or HHS grants policy; (2) the recipient requests indirect costs. Indirect costs on training grants are limited to a fixed rate of 8 percent of modified total direct cost (MTDC) exclusive of tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and subawards and contracts under the grant in excess of $25,000. Cost Allocation In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.416 and Appendix V to Part 75 - State/Local G overnment-wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans, each state/local government will submit a plan to the HHS Cost Allocation Services for each year in which it claims central service costs under Federal awards. Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation plans are provided in a brochure published by the HHS entitled \"A Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with th e Federal Government.\" A copy of this brochure may be obtained from the HHS Cost Allocation Services at https://rates.psc.gov. A current, approved cost allocation plan must be provided to CMS if central service costs are claimed. Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans Appendix VI to Part 75 - Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans, provides that state public assistance agencies will develop, document and implement, and the Federal Government will review, negotiate, and approve, public assistance cost allo cation plans in accordance with Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. The plan will include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency. Where a letter of approval or disapproval is transmitted to a state public assistance agency in accordance w ith Subpart E, the letter will apply to all Federal agencies and programs. This Appendix (except for the requirement for certification) summarizes the provisions of Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. Audit Requirements The audit requirements in 45 CFR Part 75, Subpart F apply to each award recipient fiscal year that begins on or after December 26, 2014. A non -Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non - Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of Subpart F, Audit Requirements. Commercial Organizations (including for -profit hospitals) have two options regarding audits, as outlined in 45 CFR \u00a775.501 (see also 45 CFR \u00a775.216). 25 F3. Terms and Co nditions This announcement is subject to the Department of Health and Human Services Grants Policy Statement (HHS GPS) at http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies- regulations/hhsgps107.pdf.
