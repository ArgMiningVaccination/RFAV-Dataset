Dry matter digestion was greatest for the pellets (64.3%) followed by the pellet-aspen mix (58.9%) and the mixed browse (31.1%). Time of first appearance (15.8 h),rumen turnover time (31.2h), and total mean retention time (53.6 h) of the fluid phase of digesta were longest for the mixed browse diet. In an earlier work (Schwartz et al. 1988) we estimated the digestibility of birch, willow, and aspen mixtures in moose. Concurrent to those studies, we measured the rate of move\u00ad ment of the liquid phase of material in the digestive tract and attempted to measure the same rate for solids. That work is reported here. METHODS Rates of passage were measured using adult (2-3 years of age) moose during three winter trials. Moose were fed ad libitum amounts of (1) pelleted diet (Schwartz et al. 1985), (2) a 60:40 mixture of the pelleted diet and current annual growth of aspen clipped in winter, and (3) a browse diet containing winter clipped current annual growth of paper birch, aspen, and willow mixed in equal parts on a wet weight basis. Moose used in all trials were hand-reared (Regelin et al. 1979) and main\u00ad tained on the pelleted diet. Rumen turnover times were measured us\u00ad ing a liquid phase marker-chromium (51Cr\u00ad EDT A), and a particle marker-ruthenium (103RuCl). The radiolabeled markers were given as a single dose by mixing the marker with a small portion of food at a dose rate of 100 J.LCi and 30 J.LCi per lOOkgbodyweight for 97 ALCES VOL. 24 (1988) pp.97-101 51Cr-EDTA and 103RuC1, respectively. The marker was applied by pipetting an acid solu\u00ad tion containing the isotope onto the test diet. Animals were given the food for a 30 min period, after which the uneaten portion was removed. Fecal samples were collected after every defecation for the first 24 hand at approxi\u00ad mately 6 h intervals for the next three days. Subsamples for radioassay were placed in pre-weighed counting vials, freeze-dried to constant weight and assayed with a dual chan\u00ad nel gamma spectrometer (Searle Analytical Modelll95). Nonnal gamma-ray spectrum stripping methods were used to calculate the marker concentrations which were expressed as cpm/g water (51Cr-EDT A) and cpm/g dry matter (1\u00b03RuC1). Time of first appearance (transit time, TT), rumen turnover time {RTT), and total mean retention time in the alimentary tract (TMRn were calculated according to Grovum and Phillips (1973) and assuming that turnover time of rumen-reticu\u00ad lum contents exceeded that of the large intes\u00ad tine (Faichney and Boston 1983). Difference in the slope of regression lines was deter\u00ad mined according to Neter and W assennan 1974:160). The reliability of 103RuCl as a particle marker was tested by taking a 10 gram sample 98 SCHWAR'IZ EI AL.-FOOD PASSAGE RATE IN MOOSE ALCES VOL. 24 (1988) Table 1.

Tubes were incubated at 37\"C while being continuously shaken. Samples were removed at various times, centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 30 minutes, and 5ml of the supernatant removed and assayed (P1). The supernatant remaining was filtered and assayed (P1F). The % dose recovered from the supernatant was calculated as: Recovered= (p1 or P1F) * (35/5)*100 D Foods and orts were analyzed for crude protein (micro-Kjeldahl nitrogen X 6.25), gross energy, ash, and minerals (A.O.A.C. 1965), cell-wall constituents (CWC), acid\u00ad detergent Soest Van Soest and Wine 1967, Goering and Van Soest 1970). Esti\u00ad mates of in vitro dry matter digestion were made using the techniques ofTilley and Terry (1963) and Pearson (1970). Rumen liquor for our studies was collected from a wild moose on winter range.

There was a range of 26.2-65.1% of the activity associ\u00ad ated with the liquid phase or small particles . (Table 1). Time of incubation seemed to have little effect on the amount of binding taking place so that correction for nonbinding was not possible. These results confirm findings of Faichney ( 1980) for sheep fed concentrate diets and they verify that there would be masking of particulate flow rate and digesta particles would be retained longer than deter\u00ad mined in this study (Hubbert 1985). Because the solid marker did not perform adequately, we will only present results for liquid mark\u00ad ers. Composition of the pelleted diet and indi\u00ad vidual components of the mixed diets (Table 2) varied chemically. The fiber component as indicated by CWC and ADF estimates, varied markedly between the pellets and mixed browse diets. The aspen-pellet diet was simi\u00ad larto the pelleted ration. Voluntary intake and digestion of dry matter were higher for the pelleted diet and the aspen-pellet diet than for the mixed browse diet (Table 3). Estimates of in vitro dry matter digestion (Table 2) were very similar to those obtained with conven\u00ad tional digestion trials (Table 3). Time of first appearance of the markers (TT) was similar L ALCES VOL. 24 (1988) SCHARTZ Ef AL. -FOOD PASSAGE RATE IN MOOSE 99 Table 2.

RTf of the liquid phase of the mixed browse diet (31.2 h, Table 3) was within the range presented by Hjeljord et al. (1982) for a variety of browse species (21.3-33.9 h range). RTf of the liquid phase of the mixed diet (aspen-pellets) and the pelleted diet was faster than both the hay and browse diets fed by Hjeljord et al. (1982). Studies of food passage rates in domestic sheep (Uden et al. 1982) and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) (Holleman et al. 1984) consistently demonstrated faster movement of the liquid phase marker as compared to the particulate matter marker, suggesting a faster movement of the liquid phase of digesta.

Our results clearly demonstrate that the 103RuCl was not an adequate solid marker. Additional studies with an adequate solid particle marker are required to determine if solids and liquids flow at different rates through the digestive tract of moose.
