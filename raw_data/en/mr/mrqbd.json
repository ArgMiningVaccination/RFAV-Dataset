CHAPTER 12 India has all the ingredients needed to become a global driver of inno- vation: It has a strong market potential, an excellent talent pool, and an underlying culture of frugal innovation. Innovative countries have demonstrated the leverage of their cultural advantage to capture markets. Japan leveraged its cul- tural emphasis on 'efficiency and team work',/one.superior to revolutionize the manufacturing and engineering industries. The Republic of Korea (Korea) utilized its cultural emphasis on 'speed',/two.superior and it built world-class companies such as Samsung and LG. China has sustained a GDP growth in excess of 10% for more than two decades by virtue of its 'ability to scale.'/three.superior The United States of America (USA) and Israel have leveraged the diversity of their populations to lead innovation globally. Similarly, India can build on its cultural bias of frugality and sus- tainability to capture markets not only within its shores but globally. For this to happen, however, India's industries need to have the hunger to be at the top of the value chain, its customers have to be more demand- ing, its policies have to be more transparent, and its talent pool has to get more hands-on experience while simultaneously growing to leverage the global talent pool. Leveraging global talent An often-cited example of a US company leveraging global talent is that of General Electric (GE). GE has been an early pioneer of globalizing research with its centres in India, China, Germany, and Brazil, in addi- tion to the parent research centre in the USA. The centre in Bangalore, the John F. Welch Technology Center (JFWTC), was set up in September 2000 at its present 50 acre campus. Today the JFWTC is home to over 4,000 researchers and engineers con- tributing to product development and intellectual property filed and owned by the parent GE. Close to 2,000 of the 30,000 patents awarded between 2011 and 2016 to GE have Indian inventors from the JFWTC and Indian talent in other global centres. Contributions from the JFWTC include low wind regime wind turbines, locomotive designs for emerging markets including India, low-cost ultrasound and ECG machines, and aircraft engine com- ponent designs. Going by awarded patents, other global companies with strong contributions from Indian inventors include IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, and Google (see Table 1). An interesting aspect of these data is that US companies, especially GE and IBM, have leveraged Indian inventors more than non-US com- panies have. This could point to the fact that the Asian companies have only recently started leveraging tal- ent outside their own geographies. Similarly, Indian corporations show an increasing trend in patent filing and a healthy leverage of global tal- ent, as shown in Table 2. Innovating for the immediate needs of the Indian market As India embarks on its innovation journey, Indian corporations and the government should first focus on the significant internal market needs in the energy, water, trans- port, healthcare, food security, and digital products and services sectors to deliver tangible human and envi- ronmental benefits. India should build out its own capabilities while simultaneously leveraging global talent to speed up delivery in these critical sectors. Identified below are the opportunities and challenges in the six sectors: Energy. India would need to generate 0.5 kW of electric- ity per person to provide a rea- sonable level of opportunity to its population. Based on cur- rent population projections for 2025, India needs to increase its generation capacity by 2.5, from roughly 280 GW to 710 GW. The energy requirement of 0.5 kW per person is roughly half of the European average and a quarter of the US aver- age. Transmission and distribu- tion capacity should be upgraded accordingly.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2016 12: Leveraging Talent Globally to Scale Indian Innovati on 150 taken to achieve those goals by 2022./one.superior/one.superior Food Security.

Building innovation competence: Indian IT and automotive industries The Indian information technol- ogy (IT) industry is discussed in the following paragraphs to outline the historical context of global leverage of Indian talent and the subsequent leverage of global talent by Indian industry. The chapter then focuses on the automotive industry as an example of a sector where global tal- ent has played a role in the maturing of the Indian industry. The Indian IT industry: Moving up the value chain During the era of protected markets, companies in emerging markets predominantly focused on prod- ucts based on dated technology and adapted them to local needs with local manpower. However, with emerging markets opening up to global players, traditional companies Table 1: Contributions of Indian inventors to patents granted to multinational corporations Company Patents granted (total, 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2016) Patents with at least one Indian inventor (total) Patents with at least one Indian inventor (%) GE 29,001 1,966 6.8 IBM 45,527 1,894 4.1 Intel 16,542 284 1.7 Amazon 3,631 62 1.7 Google 12,116 192 1.5 Microsoft 24,696 365 1.4 Qualcomm 32,218 421 1.3 Samsung 95,298 0.22 LG 71,443 47 0.06 Sony 47,336 9 0.01 Toshiba 51,703 8 0.01 Toyota 53,122 6 0.01 Canon KK 56,987 3 0.005 BMW 75 0 0 Data source: Patent Inspiration, http://www.patentinspi ration.com/. Water. India needs to double its available usable water from 1,000 to 2,000 cubic metres per person per year; less than 1,700 cubic metres of water per person per year is considered by the United Nations to be water-stressed. To put this into perspective, cur- rently the USA provides 8,000 cubic meters of water per person per year to its citizens. Further- more, India needs to double the sewage treatment facilities in its urban areas to even meet its cur- rent needs. Transportation. It is estimated that India will add 1,000 passen- ger and freight locomotives over the next 10 years, and the pas- senger and freight aircraft market will grow to US$100 billion or more by 2025. A detailed analy- sis of India's transportation sec- tor is available in the report sub- mitted to the Prime Minister of India by the National Trans- port Development Policy Com- mittee in 2013-14 entitled India Transport Report: Moving India to 2030. In regard to road trans- portation, the Government of India aims to make automobile manufacturing the main driver of its Make in India initiative, as it expects the passenger vehicles market to triple, reaching 9.4 million units by 2026, as high- lighted in the Auto Mission Plan (AMP) 2016-26./one.superior Efficiency, emission control, and light weighting will continue to drive the next generation of transpor- tation in India. Healthcare. In order to provide sufficient healthcare for its citi- zens, India will need to boost its healthcare spend from its current 4% of GDP to 5.5% of GDP, as noted by the McKinsey report prepared for the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) India Healthcare: Inspiring Possibilities, Challenging Journey. The report presents a vision for India's healthcare with clear goals and the steps that will need to be 151 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2016 12: Leveraging Talent Globally to Scale Indian Innovati on have focused on processes to improve product quality and operational efficiencies to remain competitive. Simultaneously, several start-ups seized this opportunity in sunrise sectors, specifically in the Indian IT sector, to leverage the low-cost talent available in India to initially execute manpower intensive proj- ects for mature markets. Companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, and Tech Mahindra have progressively expanded their scale and scope to move up the value chain with a global centre and workforce and have transformed themselves into major international players. Tata Consultancy Services: An example of leveraging talent globally TCS established its first research cen- tre, the Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC), in Pune, India, in 1981. The TRDDC undertakes research in software engineering, process engineering, and systems research. It is also the largest research and development (R&D) facility among the network of innovation labs at TCS. In the USA, TCS opened cen- tres in Cincinnati and Santa Clara with the goal of fostering research by leveraging specific talent and ecosystems available in these cities. TCS Innovation Labs in Cincinnati, established in 2008, employs more than 900 workers. This centre was created to nurture research in the areas of supply chain management and manufacturing technologies. The empowered team of research- ers, located in both Cincinnati and Bangalore, is extensively engaged in co-innovation partnerships with their global partners includ- ing Purdue University, the Indian Institute of Science, and Oklahoma University. This team is pilot- ing innovative platforms such as the supplier social network and is excited about shaping the TCS research agenda in the emerging area of cybersecurity across applications in the automotive, supply chain, and Internet of Things sectors. The TCS Silicon Valley Customer Collaboration Center in Santa Clara, California, which was officially opened on 31 January 2012, is designed to provide an open, innovative, and collaborative work- space that adopts the entrepreneurial spirit and best practices employed by the world's leading start-up compa- nies in Silicon Valley. With a state-of the-art Usability Test Lab, the centre serves as the worldwide headquar- ters of TCS's Mobility Solutions platform, incorporating the benefits of emerging technologies such as big data, analytics, and mobility into TCS's technology palette. Furthermore, as one of the early adopters of collaborative innova- tion, TCS has actively pursued the development of new models for research and innovation. TCS's Co-Innovation Network (COIN) includes companies with thriving, customized innovation ecosystems that enable the development of break- through solutions. The COIN network comprises leading uni- versity and research communities, tech start-ups, venture capital firms, industry analysts, and senior indus- try executives. Anchored at the TCS Innovation Labs across multiple cit- ies, COIN provides an environ- ment for sophisticated IT research in leading-edge technologies across various domains with the aim of delivering innovative solutions that can be globally sourced and custom- ized to requirements. The strategic approach of TCS in building a strong Indian research base and combining it with talent at its global centres is reflected in the steady accumulation of intellectual property, as shown in Figure 1. Some of the granted patents are also well cited, indicating the relevance of the patents in the industry. The evolution of the Indian automotive industry The Indian automotive industry is another good case study that illus- trates a transition for both Indian and global players over the past two decades. During its initial phase, the market needs drove the formation of several joint ventures between major international original equip- ment manufacturers (OEMs) and big Indian conglomerates. Examples include TVS Suzuki, Mahindra Ford, Table 2: Indian companies filing globally and leveraging global talent, 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2016 Company Patents granted (total, five years) USA China Australia European Patent Office Canada Patents with one or more non-Indian inventors (total) Infosys 281 275 2 1 0 0 81 TCS 244 170 22 25 4 2 21 Ranbaxy 196 58 10 23 26 8 35 Wockhardt 160 54 9 13 16 19 45 Sun Pharma 84 21 8 6 10 2 24 Source: Patent Inspiration, http://www.patentinspirati on.com/. THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2016 12: Leveraging Talent Globally to Scale Indian Innovati on 152 Daewoo Shriram, and Hero Honda. The major objective was to launch global products and technology in India with a focus on localization for Indian conditions and consumer requirements. Although many of these partnerships were short lived, they created a strong pool of local engineering talent with exposure to global manufacturing systems, pro- cesses, and quality standards. During this period, the quality of products manufactured in India improved considerably. Subsequently, when statutory regulations synchronized with global standards were ushered in by the government, updated tech- nology features needed to be intro- duced at a cost affordable to Indian customers. Given the advantage of local market knowledge, Indian compa- nies such as Tata Motors, Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, and TVS shifted their focus to product development. Although these companies signifi- cantly increased their investment in their own product development cen- tres in India, they also collaborated extensively with global consultants and suppliers to accelerate their learning process. These companies reached out to mature automotive markets such as the one in the USA to recruit talented and experienced professionals to lead their product development initiatives. One out- come of this incorporation of global talent was that several products were successfully designed, developed, and launched in India for India, with a frugal engineering approach. One such success story is that of the Scorpio vehicle, launched by Mahindra in 2002 and devel- oped under the leadership of Pawan Goenka, who joined the company after spending more than two decades at the GM Research Labs in Detroit. Indian customers quickly embraced the Mahindra Scorpio 020 40 60 80 100120 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011Figure 2: Mahindra patents: Published patents including granted patents Data source: Patent Inspiration, augmented with data from InPAAS for India patents.

This vehicle has maintained its place in the Indian market for more than a decade with a strong brand loyalty. This loyalty is mainly the result of periodic upgrades and quality improvement, which bridge the gap with global products, and yet it continues to provide an affordable price that meets customer expectations. During the same period, some of the global automotive players, such as Hyundai and Ford, continued investing in manufacturing and sales operations in India. This strategy enabled them to access the local sup- plier ecosystem, leading to product cost reduction through increased local content in their products. In addition, their direct presence in the Indian market accelerated their understanding of emerging market customer expectations. The result was several product designs that cater to India and similar markets globally. Late entrants such as Renault Nissan formed several joint ventures with Indian companies to access the local ecosystem and talent pool. Although most of these partnerships did not last long, their continued focus in India has helped them establish a strong presence in the Indian market within a very short time. The large-scale manufactur- ing operations set up by the global OEMs have been transformed into major export hubs for vehicles man- ufactured in India to global markets. The two major ports in the southern city of Chennai\u2014the manufactur- ing base of major global OEMs such as Hyundai, Ford, and Nissan Renault\u2014handle about 400,000 vehicles per annum. Last year, Hyundai alone accounted for more than 100,000 vehicles exported from the Chennai Port. Sustained investment by Indian companies for more than a decade with the goal of establishing indig- enous product development capa- bilities has created an ecosystem of skilled professionals across the country. While public investment by the government over the last two decades led to the creation of state-of-the-art infrastructure for vehicle testing and homologation, several technical centres that match global standards have been created by Indian companies to ensure that they are able to sustain competitive- ness in the market with a slew of new product launches. A good example of such a product development centre is the Mahindra Research Valley (MRV), which was established in the out- skirts of Chennai with an invest- ment of more than 700 crores Indian rupees ( ). Infrastructure at MRV rivals that of most global automo- tive R&D centres. The uniqueness of this campus, which has more than 2,500 engineers, is that it is arguably the only integrated R&D centre in the world that is involved in product development activities for both automobiles and tractors. This unique synergy has enabled the company to successfully launch several new products on the market, such as the XUV5OO, TUV3OO, and KUV1OO sport utility vehicles and the Nuovosport by leveraging the shared talented workforce for both sectors. Similar to the products of multinational operations in India, these products not only cater to the Indian market but are also exported globally. Vehicle exports from both local and international OEMs have registered an impressive growth during the last decade, as illustrated in Table 3. The XUV5OO vehicle, which was the first product developed at MRV, is a classic example of frugal engineering that incorporates state- of-the-art technology without the frills to make a product accessible to cost-conscious customers in emerg- ing markets. Such product develop- ment initiatives have been made possible by engineers at MRV, both local workers and expatriates, col- laborating extensively with global consultants and international sup- pliers to bring sophisticated features to the vehicle in a simplified form. Since its launch, this product has outsold all global and local com- petitors in the Indian market by offering a very attractive customer value proposition. It is a testament to the collaborative efforts of engi- neers working across the world with a focus on developing a prod- uct to meet the unique customer requirements in emerging markets. Moreover, focus on new product development has created substantial intellectual property for Mahindra, as depicted in Figure 2. Table 3: Automobile export trends, aggregated for local and international OEMs Indian Automobile Manufacturers. THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2016 12: Leveraging Talent Globally to Scale Indian Innovati on 154 Global automotive players such as Bosch, Cummins, Fiat Chrysler, GM, and Renault Nissan also tapped into the availability of qualified engi- neering professionals by establishing their captive development centres in India. Most of the engineers at these centres worked closely with experi- enced professionals across the globe, thus reducing product development costs for global companies while at the same time accelerating the trans- fer of skills across borders within a short time. With increasing software and electronic content in the vehicles, such collaborations extended beyond Indian development centres. Several partnerships were established outside the traditional automotive domain, specifically with the already-mature Indian IT industry. Several other models of collaboration are also being attempted to leverage the highly skilled software professionals available in India, although these are finding limited success. One such unconventional part- nership was the joint venture between an Indian OEM (Ashok Leyland) and a global Tier 1 supplier (Continental AG, then Siemens VDO) called Automotive Infotronics. Its main objective was to leverage the mar- ket knowledge of the Indian player and the knowledge repository of the global partner to design and develop technology products that would meet local customer requirements at a new price performance point. Through this partnership, quite a few products were created for the commercial vehicle market segment that challenged the conventional wisdom on product cost and perfor- mance. In addition, the cross-polli- nation of ideas between German and Indian engineers also accelerated the development of solutions for cus- tomers in other markets. Although Automotive Infotronics did not survive because of an expectations mismatch between the Indian and German partners, the products they developed are still manufactured by Continental in India. Automotive Infotronics remains a good example of building talent in emerging mar- kets using global partnerships. Through its journey over the past two decades, the Indian auto- motive industry has fully integrated itself into the global market while maintaining its uniqueness, both in terms of market potential and in terms of the availability of skilled talent. Over the past few years the difference between the strategies of the local and global players has been significantly reduced since both have gone through the learning curve, albeit for different competen- cies, and are now competing in the market place as equals. Both the multinational corpora- tions and the Indian conglomerates have benefitted from the partnering of engineering talent across bor- ders. Some multinationals, such as Suzuki, acquired Maruti operations in India to leverage the talent avail- able in their Indian R&D centre to develop global products. The Indian conglomerates, on the other hand, have successfully taken over ailing operations of global companies to gain access to their global techni- cal resources. Examples include the successful turnaround of Jaguar Land Rover after it was acquired by Tata Motors and Ssangyong after it was acquired by Mahindra. This inorganic growth has also enabled Indian companies to tap into global product development talent. Global players such as Renault Nissan and Hyundai now have India-specific product strategies and leverage these strategies for other emerging markets. Similarly, Indian companies have established technical centres in Europe and the USA not only to develop products for emerging markets but also to enable their entry into mature mar- kets. Examples include Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, which estab- lished R&D centres in the United Kingdom (UK). Tata Motors, in addition to their R&D centre in India, has design and R&D presence in the UK, Italy, and Korea. The centre of excellence in the West Midlands, UK, Tata Motors European Technical Center (TMETC)\u2014a wholly owned sub- sidiary of Tata Motors\u2014was estab- lished in 2005. One of the main reasons for having an R&D centre based in the UK was to provide a gateway to European technology, processes, personnel, and R&D. In addition to the core team of 250 members at TMETC today, a design studio in Coventry and a prototype workshop located in Gaydon have also been set up. One area that grew out of the advanced engineering at TMETC was a focus on electric and hybrid vehicles. TMETC has played a major role in helping the parent company augment capabilities in aspects such as craftsmanship, elec- trical system design, and platform strategy. TMETC has also provided a strong and active link to collabora- tion with UK and European research programmes and funding. Recently, Mahindra has been aggressively adopting this same approach by establishing the Mahindra North American Technical Center (MNATC) in Detroit in the USA, taking con- trolling stakes in PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn's motorcycles unit and also acquiring Pininfarina, the legend- ary Italian car designer responsible for the design of the iconic cars of Ferrari, Maserati, Rolls-Royce, and Cadillac. MNATC is currently bidding on the US Postal Service's next-generation delivery trucks. 155 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2016 12: Leveraging Talent Globally to Scale Indian Innovati on This centre, which was formed just two years ago, has grown signifi- cantly and employs more than 100 engineers with decades of product development experience. Such ini- tiatives by Indian and multinational OEMs result in the creation of a global network of product develop- ment engineers and transnational companies. Through this network they can maximize the talent avail- able in each region to develop prod- ucts to not only cater to emerging market requirements but also for the global markets. Opportunities for leadership: Innovation in emerging sciences and materials The previous section describes an India market-pull approach to inno- vation. In order to play a leadership role in innovation, India should also develop a technology-push strategy. Indian start-ups should accelerate innovating for the digital economy and large corporations, and universi- ties should develop new opportuni- ties at the confluence of emerging scientific knowledge and materials. One such opportunity is the inter- section of biology, computing, and materials. New developments in areas such as genomics, connec- tomics, deep learning, graphene, and metal organic frameworks pro- vide the palette to create global first products and services. Applications include developing sustainable fuels for transportation, predicting and preventing disease, determin- ing ways to improve wellness, and delivering better nutrition. This section explores some spe- cific areas of opportunity presented by these emerging scientific knowl- edge and materials (see Figure 3). The human genome project, which was officially declared com- plete in 2003, was a major milestone in human technological history. In 2009, the human connectome proj- ect was launched and is providing further fuel to modify the techno- logical landscape. The connectome will provide a map of the human nervous system, just as the genome provided the map of the human DNA. A further development is the human microbiome, which is the genetic understanding of the tril- lions of microbes that are symbioti- cally part of the human system. The microbes in the gut, as examples, are now considered an important aspect of human health and the immune system. In addition, with a better understanding of our genes,/one.superior RNA,/one.superior and the proteins associated with health and disease, RNA-based therapeutics is now viable. Precision genetic engineering using CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has been heralded by MIT Technology Figure 3: Examples of opportunities at the intersection of biology, computing, and materials Note: MOF = Metal organic framework.

CRISPR, interestingly, is a snipped copy of a virus DNA extracted from previous attacks on the microbe. CRISPR is used by the microbe's immune system to identify and disable new virus attacks. Recent understanding of CRISPR has led to CRISPR-based technology that allows scientists to snip any target DNA at precise location(s) and poten- tially replace the segments with repair strands. This technology hence has the ability, as already demonstrated in mice, to cure genetic disorders. Moreover, the technology has a range of possible applications, from produc- ing pest-resistant crop to increasing the energy yield of biomass. These advances clearly herald the overdue age of biology and the consequent 'biofication' of other technologies. Over the past two years, deep learning algorithms that attempt to mimic the human brain have demon- strated the power of computational biofication, particularly in voice and image recognition. In March 2016, Lee Sedol\u2014one of the world's best players of the game of Go\u2014lost 5 to 1 to AlphaGo, a deep learning soft- ware. Go is considered to be far more difficult for a computer algorithm to master than games such as Chess. The recent advances in deep learn- ing are attributable to new training algorithms and increased compu- tational power. The new training algorithms incorporate different levels of abstractions in multiple layers of learning networks, thereby enabling better utilization of layered networks. Improved hardware and the ability to handle large volumes of data now enable combining super- vised and unsupervised networks to solve complex cognition problems. While deep learning is an example of leveraging biology into computation, personal genom- ics is an example of the leverage of computation into biology. Personal genomics is now a reality, with an individual genome being sequenced in 2016 for US$1,000\u2014down from US$10,000 in 2011. This accomplish- ment is a combination of biological, computational, and optical sensing innovations. Personal genomics will eventually enable the evolution of healthcare from a diagnose-and-cure model to a predict-and-prevent one. Biomimetic structures ranging from roofs to hydrophobic surfaces have successfully incorporated evo- lutionary biological advantages into human creations. Simultaneously, advances in material sciences have offered progress in biological fields such as medicine. Recent material advances include metal organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are metallic ions joined together by organic ligands into structures that have a high porosity and active area. MOFs have demonstrated substan- tial potential for applications such as gas storage and separation. In medi- cal applications, MOFs have shown promise in the delivery of drugs, imaging agents, and nitrogen oxide. Graphene has been described as a 'wonder material' because of its high strength, high electric conductivity, high thermal conductivity, high flexibility, and high transparency. In medicine, the applications of graphene derive from its biocompat- ibility and high strength as leveraged in implants. Graphene oxide is also used for detecting specific toxins and in the targeted delivery of drugs and imaging agents. It is interesting to note that the hotbed of innovation as measured by patent activity continues to be the USA, as shown in Table 4. Other regions, such as China and Korea, emerge as innovation hubs based solely on patent numbers. However, based on the citations of the pat- ents, US universities and companies continue to lead in these emerg- ing R&D areas. Furthermore, the importance of university research in creating a national innovation advantage is emphasized by the fact that many of the highly cited patents Table 4: Patents published in the last 20 years, based on inventor country Inventor location Patent topic USA China Israel UK India Others Deep learning 328 135 4 15 3 Canada: 24 Japan: 18 CRISPR 893 255 15 42 2 France: 126 Germany: 48 Japan: 38 MOFs 912 381 75 repeats; MOFs = metal organic frameworks. 157 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2016 12: Leveraging Talent Globally to Scale Indian Innovati on in the areas shown in Table 4 belong to universities. Conclusions India has the ability to create a unique spot in innovation history to meet its own market requirements by using its cultural advantages of frugality and sustainability. India's first priority for innovation should be its immediate internal needs in the areas of energy, water, transport, healthcare, food security, and digital consumption. In these market-pull areas, India should strengthen its own talent pool while also leverag- ing global talent. The examples from the IT and automotive sectors pre- sented in this chapter demonstrate the role of global talent in meeting both local and export needs. In emerging research areas\u2014such as at the intersection of biology, comput- ing, and materials\u2014industry R&D should double its investment and the government should provide direct R&D grants to industry. Industry and government should team up with universities to create meaning- ful graduate research programmes utilizing global collaboration mod- els where appropriate. The govern- ment should adequately resource its intellectual property offices to grant intellectual property rights in a timely manner and to ensure proper enforcement of the law. With its positive demographic, political, and market outlook today, India has its best opportunity in many decades to position itself for a century of innovation.
