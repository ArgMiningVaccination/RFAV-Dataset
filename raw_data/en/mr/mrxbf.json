We just sprung forward as we set our clocks ahead one hour so we can look forward to warmer days and more sunlight. In Chinese medicine Spring is considered a period of yang within yin, when energetically we start to awaken and move outward after a period of dormancy in Winter. This is a great time to see your acupuncturist for a seasonal tune up to keep your body in balance! According to the 5-phase theory of Chinese medicine Spring is associated with the wood element which corresponds to the liver meridian and the color green. The liver is responsible for moving qi through the body, but it often gets stuck when we are inactive or when we experience emotions in excess. This is why it is important to spend more time outdoors experiencing nature and gradually increasing our activity level with gentle exercise. When out of balance the yang qi of the liver rises, and it can create agitation causing red eyes, headaches, and acid reflux. To keep the liver meridian running smoothly it is good to consume more greens and cooler, lighter foods. Some foods to increase are spinach, artichokes, asparagus, bokchoy, kale, sprouts, celery, and lean protein. Foods to avoid or decrease include rich greasy foods, nuts, spicy and hot foods. This is also a great time to start a cleanse. Dr. Jackie is here to keep you in balance as we transition through the seasons. To schedule your appointment call 858-285-5602 or book "}
