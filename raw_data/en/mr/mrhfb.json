A large and growing percentage of Americans use complementary, alternative or unconventional healing therapies, often in addition to seeking advice from physicians and other care providers . Increasingly, research is showing efficacy for many of these therapies , and conventional care providers are beginning to take notice, in some instances incorporating selected CAM therapies into care plans. Ability to understand and communicate effectively w ith patients and other care providers about these therapies , and recommend evidence -based CAM therapies and practitioners when appropriate, should enhance patients' health and safety and optimize health care. Course Objectives: As a result of the cour se, learners should be able to: Describe the use of CAM therapies in the United States; Describe healing paradigms and rationales for patients' use of these therapies; Describe the philosophies, theoretical basis and techniques of various CAM therapies; Discuss the training and certification of practitioners of these therapies; Discuss uses of each therapy and evidence of efficacy; and Describe the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to communicate effectively with practitioners and users of CAM and conventional therapies. Format: The course provides an introduction to the field of CAM and integrative health -care, including a wide range of alternative modalities, in lecture -and-discussion format, presented by an active practitioner of the therap y and/or a person knowledgeable in the field, with patient presentations, demonstrations and audience participation where applicable. Presentations cover diagnosti c methods, treatment, evidence of efficacy and safety for various conditions, training of pr actitioners, the practitioner -patient relationship, patient satisfaction, role of prevention, and potential for interactions with conventional healthcare. Topical readings supplement l ectures and demonstrations.
