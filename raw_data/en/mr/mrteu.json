How Does the Immune System Work? Your [immune system](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/immune.html#:~:text=How%20Does%20the%20Immune%20System,proteins%20lock%20onto%20specific%20antigens.) is made up of a complex network of different layers of protection against outside invaders, ranging from your skin barrier, to specific cells, fluids, and organs that help keep you healthy. The immune system is able to identify invading substances called antigens that can make us sick and fight them off. Antibodies can sometimes recognize invaders that they've encountered in the past and effectively fight them off again in the future, hence why vaccines are key to preventing serious health scares. However, there are times when our bodies cannot effectively fight off these antigens and we end up getting sick. Not all sickness symptoms mean you're actually sick, like having a fever means that your body is actually doing its job to fight off the invaders and that you're on your way to recovery. That being said, no one actually wants to get sick, so it's always best to ensure that your immune system is in tip top shape so that you can avoid feeling ill and can conquer those germs the first time around! Using products to boost immunity during cold and changing seasons can help protect you from getting sick too. How Can Essential Oils Benefit Your Immune System?
