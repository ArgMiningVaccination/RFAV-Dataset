Hospital staff may refer by telephone. Once the referral is made, the SCP follows up directly with the Patient/client for her or his spiritual needs. Hospital Interfaith Spiritual Care Practitioners, Residents and interns are on-site at VGH 7 days per week and are available by on-call 24 hours. Direct bedside care and counselling Our practitioners assist with coping and containing emotional crisis through spiritual support to lessen suffering. For some patients it may mean exploration of spiritual concerns at deep emotional and cognitive levels using spiritually-focussed dialogue and counselling that addresses such matters as the meaning or purpose of life, feelings of connection or disconnection with a higher power, coping with loss, addressing despair and finding hope. Practitioners are highly trained in self-awareness, so as to be able to be fully present with patients/clients in their deepest suffering. Provision of rituals by our denominational and multi-faith service providers is also facilitated. Spiritual assessment Our Spiritual Care Practitioners assess the spiritual need of each client according to department standards and professional guidelines. Consultations Consults may be requested for assistance with patients, families or teams from a spiritual perspective on such matters as advance health care planning, the provision or removal of life supports, medical assistance in dying, conflict resolution and other matters that may benefit from application of a spiritual lens.
