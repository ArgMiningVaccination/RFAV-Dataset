Immunizations Overview Immunizations are one of the greatest public health achievements, preventing tens of thousands of deaths, millions of cases of disease, and saving billions of dollars per decade. Immunizations are a safe, effective way to protect children from disease, including some cancers, as well as hospitalization, disability, and death. It is especially important to maintain routine immunizations to prevent a disease outbreak, public health emergency or future pandemic. Pediatricians play a crucial role in immunizing children and are a trusted source for vaccine information. Vaccine conversations with parents should begin as early as possible \u2014 ideally at the prenatal visit. AAP Recommendations Learn more about policy recommendations and the regulations and laws that the AAP supports surrounding vaccination. Interactive Vaccination Map This interactive map allows immunizers and families to see immunization rates and exemptions by state, and to compare these rates to national rates, goals, and immunity thresholds needed to keep communities safe from vaccine-preventable diseases. This map also presents immunization rates broken down by demographics, such as insurance coverage, race, urbanicity and poverty level. Data come from the CDC National Immunization Survey and are updated annually. More About the Science Vaccines are both safe and effective. Learn more about how they work and how we know they're safe.
