Dr. Ankur Prakash developed his love for chiropractic while in college at the University of Maryland... She enjoys patient care immensely and looks forward to establishing long relationships with her patients... Josh combines years of experience in emergency medicine and orthopedic surgery in the treatment of patients... Hey there! I'm Meghan. I was born on Long Island and moved to North Carolina when I was young... Helping others, being a part of something bigger than myself, and fighting against pain... My end goal is to emphasize \"heal\", as it appears in the word \"healthy\"... As a trainer I believe that proper movement should compromise of the bones and muscles functioning together... It's my aim to give people their lives back as a Fitness Professional through fitness and wellness... I strongly believe in the medicinal power of eating purposefully... I am ecstatic to be a part of the Living Well Balanced team because it gives me an opportunity... Before coming to Living Well Balanced, I was a medic and radiology tech in the US Army.... I am very excited to be a part of the Living Well Balanced team to continue the amazing work of caring for others! My goal as a trainer is to show that wellness starts within and that the unrealistic ideas put on us about being \"healthy\" is the ego struggling to accept who we are in the present moment. I decided to take my health into my own hands and advocate for my own well-being! We will provide the most up-to-date, cutting edge care to get you well and keep you well. We will provide a fun and positive environment every time you walk in the office. Our care is top shelf and our programs are all-inclusive. We are highly intuitive and believe that people can and should live longer, happier livesthrough natural healthcare. We look to build unshakeable trust in our practice members and our communityand we strive to be transparent with everyone we meet. If you take care of your body, only then will your body take care of you. If joint pain or injury are keeping you from living the life you want, consider our Regenerative Medicine treatments. These therapies are designed to activate your body's natural repair mechanisms and kickstart it on a journey of recovery. This is an integrative and holistic approach to pain management with treatments that produce measurable results. We use top-of-the-line amniotic tissue products that support healing, restore function, and return your body to a more youthful state. Our doctors are committed to your well-being and quality of life. Regenerative medicine treatments are an opportunity to regain lost function and live an active life, free of pain, without medications or joint replacement surgery. Our chiropractors are quite literally the spine of our wellness center, focusing on a natural way to healing and maintaining physical and emotional health. By receiving chiropractic adjustments on a regular basis, your spine and nervous system clear the path for vital information to flow freely from your brain to your body, enhancing your ability to think, move, and reduce stress. Not only does chiropractic care help reduce symptoms of pain, it helps you get to the root cause of your discomfort and prevents the overuse of medication and sometimes even surgery. Our gentle, family approach, including the various techniques we offer, will decrease your level of stress and optimize the function of your entire body, thus contributing to your overall vitality and well-being. Eating is about so much more than just food \u2014 it's infused into our culture, our relationships, and our sense of self. We address the behavioral, dietary and lifestyle aspects of your relationship with food creating a realistic plan to guide you to your goals. Whether it's improving overall health, losing weight, or solving more specific issues \u2014 we can help. Do you listen to your body? Our skin is an amazing communicator that tells us so much. From breakouts and wrinkles, to eczema and dark circles, our skin is a great indicator for what's going on internally. It's time you start to pay attention. If your body is fighting disease in the form of stress, obesity, lack of sleep, dehydration, poor digestion, poor nutrition, free radicals, or overload of toxins and chemicals, it is likely to present itself in the form of problem and aging skin. Don't wake up one day and think, \"My gosh, how I've aged,\" and then start planning for surgery to pump your body with toxins like botox and fillers. Instead, start taking steps now to naturally relax, rejuvenate, and restore your skin and overall wellness. We do skin care differently \u2014 with a 360 degree holistic approach to health and wellness! Embrace a healthy skin lifestyle today! Let us breathe life back into your muscles and lift the burden of stress with one of our massage techniques. We offer a variety of massages, including Swedish, Deep Tissue, Medical, Prenatal, Cupping, and more. This traditional form of therapy, performed by our expert therapists, will invoke a positive change throughout your nervous, circulatory, and muscular systems. We look at each body as a unique case so that we can create a treatment plan that is right for you. Cryotherapy is the practice of using cold temperatures to support healing and wellness and dates back to ancient civilizations. Whole body cryotherapy is the modern application and stimulates the same rejuvenating and recovery benefits at a whole new level of cold in just three minutes. People use whole body cryotherapy for sports and fitness, muscle pain and inflammation, for healthier skin and weight loss. With our personal training programs, individuality is key. Not everyone achieves the same results with the same plan, so we're here to show you how to live rather than tell you how to live. Drawing from a foundation in functional movement training, we work in tandem with the office to meet your goals, and create a fitness plan that caters to your body's needs. Whatever your health goals might be, our trainers are equipped to maximize your sessions and be your motivational partner along the way. Your body might not move like it once used to. You're stiff where you used to be more limber and you don't want to be limited by it anymore. With assisted stretching, we can give you that extra expert help to push you beyond the mobility you can achieve on your own. This targeted work on specific muscles and joints increases your overall muscle control, motion, and flexibility, plus we give you the tools to continue working on your own and beyond. It's time to regain your youthful self. We use doTERRA essential oils for a wide range of emotional and physical wellness applications. Essential oils are both exciting and promising when it comes to taking care of your own and your family's health. Whether we're applying essential oils topically during your massage sessions, enjoying the aromatic benefits through diffusing it in the air, or taking essential oils internally, the positive effects of essential oils are boundless. Because of their guarantee on potency and purity, the essential oils we use are capable of delivering on their promise. I absolutely love Dr. Ankur and the staff at Living Well Balanced!! Dr. Ankur took the time to do an in-depth evaluation of not just my body alone, but also my lifestyle and health as a whole. I've seen a chiropractor for years and always found great relief from it, but Dr. Ankur was able to get rid of my low back pain that had been irritating me for ever! My adjustments have easily become the highlight of my week. I know that when I walk in to Living Well Balanced, I'll feel better, I'll be loved on, and I'll relax while I'm there. The amazing view and atmosphere at the office are just a huge plus! I HIGHLY recommend the chiropractic, massage & stretching at Living Well Balanced to friends, family & anyone looking for quality holistic health care. Dr. Ankur is the best of the best!! I have really enjoyed going here... all the staff is really nice and knowledgeable. I wouldn't say that I thought I had issues to make me go see a chiro but I wanted to do it for my health. I been going for a month and they are great with working around my crazy schedule. They do have a great holistic approach which is great to see. I would highly recommend going here and giving it a try. I have been running for over 25 years and have suffered hamstring pain for the last 10 years. The pain had become something I just lived with. In the past, I had gone to physical and massage therapist without much success. It wasn't until I came into Living Well Balanced that I got the proper sports stretching I needed. It took about 30 minutes and I was feeling better than I had in a long time. It was the answer to my pain! If you are looking for stretching and muscle therapy from someone that understands how to diagnose your needs and apply the right therapy this is the place! Everyone here is great, always smiling, and just a relaxing and no-judgment environment to be in. They play music anywhere from country to reggae and shoes are optional. Only halfway through my treatment course, I can already see a vast improvement in my day to day activities and feel. Looking forward to the second half of my treatments and the continued improvements. Unlike other places I have gone, I like the results from the combined holistic approach, all of which are in house services. I would recommend stopping by for an assessment and seeing their approach for yourself. "}
