Each chakra has its own vibrational frequency, that is depicted through a specific chakra colour, and governs specific functions of the body, mind and spirit. Chakras are believed to be situated in certain places in the body and are connected by meridians through which vital energy 'chi' flows. Blockages in these areas can lead to poor physical and mental health. To unblock chakras and restore balance, there are a number of chakra healing or chakra cleansing techniques from a broad range of fields from energy healing and holistic medicine, to fitness and psychology. Using essential oils is one of these practices as specific essential oils are associated with different chakras. The profiles and properties of specific essential oils - for example woody essential oils used or grounding - can help bring healing and balance to specific chakras. 1.Muladhara (Root chakra) At the base of the spine, the Root chakra is essential to help us feel grounded. The root chakra provides a base or foundation for life and helps us withstand challenges. It is linked to our sense of security and stability. Grounding woody oils and resins are particularly apt, including: cedarwood, myrrh, patchouli, benzoin, carrot and vetiver. 2.Svadhisthana (Sacral chakra) Located in the lower abdomen, the sacral chakra is associated with the reproductive system. This chakra is linked to our sexual and creative energy as well as our emotions. Those with a blocked sacral chakra could feel a lack of control in their lives. Uplifting and lightly stimulating floral oils are particularly effective, including jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, geranium, sandalwood and orange. 3.Manipura (Solar plexus chakra) Located in the organic in the upper abdomen, the solar plexus chakra is connected to self-esteem, confidence and feeling in control in our live. If the solar plexus chakra is blocked, we might feel overwhelming amounts of shame and self-doubt. Those with open sacral chakras are free to express their true selves. Stimulating essential oils are particularly effective, including ginger, coriander, majoram, manuka and orange. 4.Anahata (Heart Chakra) Located around the heart and upper body, this chakra is associated with love, acceptance, compassion and kindness. As the name suggests, this chakra can influence our ability to give and receive love\u2014from others and ourselves. Someone with a blocked heart chakra will have difficulty fully opening up to the people in their life. If someone's heart is open, they can experience deep compassion and empathy. Essential oils are particularly effective for stimulating this chakra include rose, bergamot, lemon balm, neroli, sandalwood and palmarosa. 5.Visshudha (Throat chakra) The throat chakra covers the area of the throat and the thyroid gland and relates to communication, honesty and expression. When it's functioning at full capacity, it allows us to express ourselves truly and clearly. Someone with a blocked throat chakra will feel like they have trouble finding the words to say how they truly feel. Herbaceous essential oils particularly effective for stimulating this chakra are peppermint, clary sage, eucalyptus, chamomile, rosemary and cajuput. 6.Ajna (Third eye chakra) Located just above and between the eyes, Ajna is connected to the pituitary gland and rules the memory and imagination. It controls our ability to see the big picture and the third eye is strongly connected to our intuition. Essential oils that are used to treat blockages in this chakra are rosemary, myrrh, sandalwood, jasmine and neroli. 7.Sahasrara (Crown chakra) Located at the top of the head, the Crown chakra governs knowledge, fulfilment and spirituality. The Sahasrara represents the spiritual connection to oneself, others, and the universe. It also plays a role in your life's purpose. Essential oils that are used to treat blockages in this chakra are frankincense, lavender, elemi, rose and juniper berry.
