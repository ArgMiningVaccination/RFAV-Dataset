Dementias is an introductory curriculum from the Alzheimer's Association that is intended to increase awareness of the impact of Alzheimer's and other dementias as well as the role of public health. D evelop ed as part of a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Program, and in partnership with Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, this curriculum addresses cognitive health, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and is for use by undergraduate faculty in schools and programs of public health. It can also be adapted for other purposes. This work supports The Healthy Brain Initiative: The Public Health Road Map for State and National Partnerships (Road Map) goal of developing a competent workforce. The curriculum has four modules that are designed to be used individually or as a whole. T he following materials are provided for each module: Faculty Guide , including: oLearning objectives oCompetencies test questions oCase studies oVideo resources oReferences PowerPoint slides Novel Approaches for Implementing the Curriculum ABOUT EACH MODULE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE - A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS (MODULE 1) Module 1: Alzheimer's Disease - A Public Health Crisis frames Alzheimer's disease and dementia as a public health epidemic with a large and rapidly growing burden that has a significant impact on the nation. Alzheimer's disease is felt at a national , state , and local level through financial burdens , resource needs , and professional requirements . Module 1 focuses primarily on the U.S. as it explores the current and projected scope of the epidemic, the financial burden on federal and state governments as well as individuals, and the care burden on caregivers and the health care system. Health dispar ities are highlighted, as rates of Alzheimer's disease are substantially higher for African -Americans and Hispanics. 5 Learning Objectives: At the end of Module 1: Alzheimer's and Dementia - A Public Health Crisis , students will be able to: Provide a gene ral description of dementia and Alzheimer's disease Explain the current and projected scope of the Alzheimer's disease epidemic Discuss the cost burden of Alzheimer's disease for federal/state governments and individuals/caregivers Describe the care burden of Alzheimer's disease, including caregivers and the health care system Identify health disparities related to Alzheimer's and dementia Explain why public health must play a role in addressing the Alzheimer's disease epidemic ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHE R DEMEN TIAS - THE BASICS (MODULE 2 ) Module 2: Alzheimer's and Other Dementias - The Basics provides background information on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. It lays a foundation for what cognitive health is and how changes within the brain may lead to c ognitive aging, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. The module then shifts to focus more specifically on Alzheimer's disease. Learners gain a general understanding about the stages of Alzheimer's disease, risk factors, and how the disease is diagnosed and treated. The module also addresses unique aspects of Alzheimer's disease (including financial hardship, stigma, and vulnerability to abuse) and the role of caregivers and caregiving impacts. Learning Objectives: At the end of Module 2: Alzheimer's and Other Dementias - The Basics, students will be able to: Define cognitive health Define and differentiate between dementia and Alzheimer's List at least five early signs of Alzheimer's Describe the changes that occur during the course of Alzheimer's disease Describe the role of caregivers in the care of someone with Alzheimer's 6 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH? (MODU LE 3) Module 3: What is the Role of Public Health? briefly describes the Alzheimer's disease epidemic in the U.S., followed by a discussion of four tools of public health that may play significant roles in mitigating the Alzheimer's disease crisis. The four public health intervention tools discussed are: 1. Surveillance/monitoring 2. Primary prevention 3. Early detection and diagnosis 4. Ensuring safety and quality of care Each tool is described and applied to the context of a public health response to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Progress to date and challenge s associated with each tool are addressed. Learning Objectives: At the end of Module 3: What is the Role of Public Health? students will be able to: List four key tools public health can apply to the Alzheimer's epidemic Describe surveillance/monitoring an d how public health practitioners can apply it in response to Alzheimer's disease Name the two Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) modules that pertain to cognitive decline and caregiving Describe primary prevention and how public health pra ctitioners may apply it in response to Alzheimer's disease Explain why it is important to promote early detection of Alzheimer's disease Summarize one workforce challenge that affects the safety and quality of care for people living with dementia DEMENTIA CAPABLE SYSTEMS AND DEMENTIA FRIENDLY CO MMUNITIES (MODULE 4) Module 4: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities addresses the public health response to the Alzheimer's disease epidemic at the state and community levels. The module descri bes the concepts of \"dementia capable\" systems and dementia friendly communities, both of which involve accommodating the needs of a population with memory loss, and a variety of related physical , cognitive , and behavior symptoms, as well as other co - morbi dities . Module 4 explores how public health may support the development of such systems at the state and local levels through support services and programs, workforce training, and the creation of dementia friendly communities. 7 Learning Objectives: At the end of Module 4: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities , students will be able to: Define dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities Explain how public health can contribute to the development of dementia capable systems by analyzing community -support needs, developing support services and programs, and establishing workforce training, and also to the creation of dementia friendly communities List at least two support services that may benefit a caregiver of someo ne with Alzheimer's or dementia Identify at least three professions that would benefit from workforce training related to Alzheimer's and dementia Describe at least two components of a dementia friendly community HOW TO USE THE MATERIALS The four modules w ere designed for use either as a set or as stand -alone modules. Users are free to make changes to the materials to fit their needs, including: adding, modifying or removing content, graphics, talking points, discussion questions, or learning activities. The Faculty Guide for each module includes a slide guide that contains the information as presented in the slide, talking points, space for presenter notes, and references. The talking points included in the Faculty Guide should not be read word for word; each presenter should review the materials before delivering the material to ensure familiarity and deliver the information in his/her own style. Delivery time will generally be 60 -90 minutes per module, depending on class engagement, presenter style, and the addition or elimination of any content, discussion questions, or learning activities. Discussion questions are included in the slide deck of each module. These may be modified or removed at the discretion of the presenter. Questions may also be used fo r other activities such as small group discussion or individual writing assignments. Video resources, a list of articles, and case studies are also included to help in learning more about the topics presented in each module.

The right margin has been widened to allow the presenter to write notes. SLIDE 1: Module 1: Alzheimer's Disease - A Public Health Crisis TALKING POINTS: This presentation entitled Alzheimer's Disease - A Public Health Crisis, is part of a curriculum for public health students entitled, A Public Health Approach to Alzheimer's and Other Dementias . It was developed by the Emory Centers for Training and Technical Assistance for the Alzheimer's Association with funding from the Cen ters for Disease Control and Prevention. During this module , we will discuss the epidemic of Alzheimer's and other dementias , and why it is an important issue for public health to under stand and act on. FACULTY GUIDE 18 SLIDE 2: Learning Objectives Provide a general description of dementia and Alzheimer's disease Explain the current and projected scope of the epidemic Discuss the cost burden of Alzheimer's for federal/state governments and individuals/ caregivers Describe the care burden of Alzhe imer's, including caregivers and the health care system Identify health disparities related to Alzheimer's and other dementias Explain why public health must play a role in addressing the Alzheimer's epidemic TALKING POINTS: By the end of the presen tation, you will be able to: Provide a general description of dementia and Alzheimer's disease Explain the current and projected scope of the epidemic Discuss the cost burden of Alzheimer's for federal/state governments and individuals/caregivers Describe the ca re burden of Alzheimer's , including caregivers and the health care system Identify health disparities related to Alzheimer's and other dementia s Explain why public health must play a role in addressing the Alzheimer's epidemic FACULTY GUIDE 19 SLIDE 3: Alzheimer's - Public Health Crisis1 Historically viewed as aging or medical issue Impact at national, state, and local levels Multi -faceted approach needed TALKING POINTS: For many years after its discovery in 1906, Alzheimer's disease was primarily viewed through the lenses of medical care and aging. There are valid reasons for this. Medical care is an essential component of identifying and treating individuals with Alzheim er's disease, which primarily affects older populations . Aging services , such as nursing homes and programs aimed at assisting seniors , are often a vital source of support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Yet Alzheimer's disease affects more than just the individual and his or her medical and support team. The impact of Alzheimer's is felt at national , state , and local levels, as well as on a family and personal level, through financial burdens , resource needs , and professional requirements . It is a growing epidemic that has profound social and economic implications, especially given the current trends of an aging population. As more is learned about Alzheimer's disease and its impact, it becomes clear that a multi- faceted response by the health care sector, government, public health and within communities is vitally important to address the growing crisis within the U.S. and throughout the world. 1 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dementia is a general term for a decline in cognitive functioning -that is, thinking, remembering, and reasoning severe enough to interfere with daily life. Deme ntia is not a specific disease. It is an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills. Dementia is characterized by damage to the brain cells due to age, brain injury, other conditions or diseases, heredity, or a combination of factors. Many dementias are progressive, meaning that symptoms start out s lowly and gradually get worse. In the most severe stages of dementia, a person must depend on others for basic activities of daily life. The causes of dementia can vary, depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dem entia in older adults. Other dementias include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia. It is common for people to have mixed dementia \u2014a combination of two or more types of dementia. 2 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) What is D ementia?

Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills , and eventually the ability to carry out the simplest tasks . The brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease occur on a continuum and can begin up to 20 years before a person has any noticeable symptoms or impairment. Alzheimer's progressively damages and eventually destroys brain cells over the course of many years, ev en decades. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. It accounts for an estimated 60 % to 80% of cases. The term Alzheimer's dementia is used to describe the stage of Alzheimer's disease when an individual has observable symptoms such as memory loss, mood/behavior changes, and difficulty with activities of daily living. *Note: The image on the slide shows a healthy brain (left side) as compared to a severe Alzheimer's brain (right 4Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 24 SLIDE 7: Scope of the Epidemic (U.S.) 6 Over 5.8 million adults 1 in 10 adults age 65 1 in 3 adults age 85 2/3 are women TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease must be considered a public health crisis . There are many reasons for this. First, the burden is large and it is growing. Today, over 5.8 million adults in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer's disease, including an estimated 200,000 under the age of 65. One in ten adults age 65 and older (1 0%) currently ha s Alzheimer's dementia meaning they are in the stage of Alzheimer's disease whe n their symptoms are noticeable and impacting daily living. Approximately one in three (32% ) people age 85 and older has the disease. Women make up almost 2/3 of seniors living with Alzheimer's dementia in the U.S . According to the Framingham Heart Study data, the estimated lifetime risk for Alzheimer's dementia at age 45 was approximately one in five (20 %) for women and one in ten (10%) for men. 6 Alzheimer's Association.

Although whites make up the majority of people with Alzheimer's i n the U.S., African -Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of Alzheimer's and other dementias than peop le of other races and ethnicities. In the United States, older African -Americans are about two times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's and other dementias. It is estimated that the prevalence is 64% higher in African -Americans. Yet, African -Americans are less likely to receive a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or other dementias than whites . Older Hispanics are about one and one -half times more likely than older whites to have these conditions. When African -Americans and Hispanics are diagnosed, it is often in the later stages of the disease when cognitive and physical imp airment are more severe and require more medical care. Thus, they incur much higher costs for care such as hospitals, doctors, home health or nursing home services. 7 Matthews, K.A. et al.

Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association FACULTY GUIDE 26 Genetic factors do not appear to impact risk or prevalence. The greater prevalence in these groups may be caused by the increased incidence of other chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes \u2014both suspected risk factors for Alzheimer's an d other dementias. Socioeconomic factors may also play a role in risk, diagnosis , and care. Large proportional increases are also expected in both African -American and Hispanic populations in the U.S., which will contribute significantly to the growth of the epidemic in these groups and overall. Information is emerging about the prevalence of Alzheimer's in other racial and ethnic groups, including Asian Americans and American Indians /Alaska Natives . It appears that the prevalence is lower in these group s. FACULTY GUIDE 27 SLIDE 9: Alzheimer's Death s9 6th leading cause of death 5th leading cause among adults age 65 Deaths increased 1 45% from 2000 -2017 TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and the 5th leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. Deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 145% from 2000 to 2017 , while deaths from other m ajor diseases (including stroke, prostate cancer, and HIV/AIDS) decreased. The science related to Alzheimer's and other dementias is rapidly evolving. Current evidence indicates that opportunities may exist to lessen the burden of the disease while the search for a cure continues. 9 Alzheimer's Association.

The cause of the increase can be attributed to people living longer , the large increase in the number of people over age 65 (baby boomers) , and the increasing population of racial and ethnic groups with higher prevalence of Alzheimer's and other dementias . By 20 50, the U.S. population aged 65 and over is expect ed to be 88 million . By 2050, the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease is expected to total 13.8 million . Today, someone in the U.S. develops Alzheimer's every 65 seconds . By 2050, that rate is expected to increase to one person every 33 seconds . 11 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 32 SLIDE 14: Financial Burden : U.S. & Worldwide14,15 Alzheimer's is most expensive disease in U.S. Annual costs of direct care over $290 billion Worldwide annual costs exceed $818 billion (2015 ) TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease is the most expensive disease to treat and provide care for in the U.S., costing more than heart disease and cancer. In the U.S., the annual costs of direct care for people with Alzheimer's disease exceed $290 billion . \"Direct care\" includes both paid health care , long -term care, and out of pocket costs. It does not include costs of caregiving provided by family members , which will be discussed late r in the module. Worldwide, the annual costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias are estimated to be over $ 818 billion . 14 Alzheimer's Association.

First, we'll start by looking at the Alzheimer's disease burden on two federally -funded health care programs. What are Medicare and Medicaid? Open responses. FACULTY GUIDE 34 SLIDE 1 6: Medicare & Medicaid16 Medicare: federally -funded health insurance o U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident age 65 o People under age 65 with certain disabilities or End -Stage Renal Disease Medicaid: funded by federal and state governments o Helps with medical costs and nursing home expenses for low -income individuals TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease imposes a significant cost on federal and state budgets through Medicare and Medicaid . Medicare is federally funded health insurance for people age 65 and older who are U.S. citizen s or legal permanent resident s, or people under 65 with certain disabilities or with End- Stage Renal Dis ease (kidney failure that requires dialysis or a kidney transplant). Medicaid is a program funded by both federal and state governments to help with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicare does not cover the cost of long -term care for assisted living, nursing homes, or in -home care such as sitters or certified nursing assistants. Medicaid will cover the cost of nursing home care for low -income individuals or once an individual has limited personal assets and/or may require that the majority of the individual's monthly income be spent on nursing home care expenses. 16 Department of Health and Human Services.

About 67% of the health and long -term care costs of caring for those with Alzheimer's disease are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid. In 201 9, the Medicare and Me dicaid government programs will spend an estimated $195 billion caring for those with Alzheimer's and oth er dementias \u201467% of total annual costs of these conditions . Nearly one in every five Medicare dollars is spent on people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Average per- person Medicare spending for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias is three ti mes higher than average per- person spending across all other seniors. Medicaid payments are 23 times higher . People with Alzheimer's and other dementias also have high out- of- pocket costs. These costs are for Medicare and other health insurance premiums and for deductibles, copayments and services not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or additional sources of support. 17 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 36 SLIDE 1 8: Alzheimer's : Projected Costs (2050)19,20 Total annual costs over $1.1 trillion Annual costs to Medicare: $5 59 billion 300% increase) billion TALKING POINTS: Just as the number of people with Alzheimer's disease is projected to dramatically increase, so will the costs associated with their care. Currently, 1 in every 5 dollars spent by Medicare is spent on someone with Alzheimer's. By 2050, it will be 1 in every 3 dollars. If current conditions go unchanged, in 2050 the annual costs of treating Alzheimer's disease in the US will be over $1.1 trillion. Annual c osts to Medicare will increase over 3 00% to $559 billion . It is estimated that Medicaid spending on people with Alzheimer's will reach $191 billion in 2050. Combined costs for Medicare and Medicaid expenses will be $750 billion (in today's dollars). Out-of-pocket costs for individuals and families affected by Alzheimer's and other dementias will similarly see increase s from $ 63 billion in today's dollars to $198 billion in 2050. 19 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 38 SLIDE 20: Care Workforce Caregivers (family or friends) Health care providers Paid care providers TALKING POINTS: People with Alzheimer's and other dementia s are generally cared for by a network of family or friend caregivers , health care providers , and paid care providers (such as those who help with daily tasks and self- care). Most individuals with Alzheimer's dis ease have a primary caregiver , often a family member, who is crucial to ensuring appropriate care. The type and scope of the care needed by people with Alzheimer's disease changes throughout the course of the illness.

About 70% of people with Alzheimer's disease live in the community in home settings where the vast majority of their care is provided by family and friends . Currently in the U.S., it is estimated that over 1 6 million family and friends provide nearly 18.5 billion hours of unpaid care annually. In 201 8, this care was valued at $23 3.9 billion. This is approximately 46% of the net value of Walmart annual sales which was $ 500.3 billion in 2018 and nearly 10 times the total annual revenue of McDonald's which was $ 22.8 billion in 2017 . 21 Alzheimer's Association.

Ask: What might be the roles and responsibilities of a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer's? Open responses. FACULTY GUIDE 41 SLIDE 2 3: Alzheimer's & Dementia Caregivers22,23 Caregiver profile o 2/3 are women (typically daughter or wife ) o Middle -aged o Over half currently employed Caregiving responsibilities o Help with activities of daily living o Medica l and financial management o Provide increasing levels of care as disease progresses TALKING POINTS: The term caregiver is used to describe a person who provides a level of care and support for another that exceeds typical responsibilities of daily life. This is usually a family member or friend. This does not include hired help, such as home health aides , which we'll disc uss in a few slides. According to caregiver data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the typical caregiver for a person with Alzheimer's or another dementia is the middle -aged daughter/daughter -in-law who is also often still employ ed or self -employed. Caregiving responsibilities, especially in the moderate and severe stages of Alzheimer's , often include: Help with activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing, toileting, and feeding Shopping, meal preparation, transportatio n 22 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 43 SLIDE 2 4: Caregivers : Challenges24 Physical, psychological, social challenges o $11.8 billion additional health care costs (201 8) o 60% rate emotional stress as high or very high o 30-40% suffer from depression o Increased likelihood of new or worsening health problems TALKING POINTS: Caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias often experience physical , psychological , and social challenges. Several recent findings highlight these challenges: Due to the physical and emo tional toll of caring for someone with Alzheimer's or other dementia s, these caregivers had $11.8 billion in additional health care costs in 201 8. Nearly 60% of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers rate the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high. About 30-40% of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers suffer from depression , as compared to 5-17% of non -caregivers of similar ages . Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's can put caregivers at increased risk for new or worsening health conditions. Nearly 75% of caregivers express concern about the ability to maintain their own health since becoming a caregiver. Many caregivers delay attending to their own health care needs due to lack of time and/or resources. 24 Alzheimer's Association. (201 8) Alzheimer's Disease Caregivers.

FACULTY GUIDE 45 SLIDE 2 6: Caregivers : Length of Care26,27 86% at least one year 50% f our or more years May range from 4 -20 years Burden of care higher than for non -dementia caregiving TALKING POINTS: Caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementia s spend much more time providing care than caregivers of individuals with other conditions. In 201 7, of the unpaid Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers: 86% had been providing care for at least a year 50% had been providing care for f our or more years All rates for length of care are significantly higher for dementia caregivers than for non -dementia caregivers. In addition to the overall length of time care is provided, the intensity and variety of care provided is greater among those carin g for someone with dementia than among caregivers for individuals without dementia. According to a report by the National Alliance for Caregiving, the burden of care index for dementia caregivers is much higher than the burden for non- dementia caregivers. The burden of care index is based on the number of hours of care, types and number of care activities performed. 26 Alzheimer's Association.

(2017) Dementia Caregiving in the U.S. Image source: Pexels.com FACULTY GUIDE 46 SLIDE 2 7: Caregivers : Critical Role Health care sys tem could not sustain costs of care without caregivers Support for caregivers is a public health issue TALKING POINTS: The burden on caregivers is significant ; yet they play a critical role in supporting individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia. More broadly, w ithout caregivers, the health care system could not sustain the costs of care for persons with Alzheimer's and other dementias . Assuring caregivers receive needed support is a public health issue .

Furthermore, many professionals already in the workforce are often not adequately trained on the needs of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Current estimations of workforce shortages include: The U.S. will need an additional 3.5 million health care professionals by 2030 just to maintain the current ratio of health care professiona ls to older adults . The U.S. has approximately half the number of certified geriatricians than it needs . Currently, this equates to 1 geriatrician for every 1,924 adults age 65 or older. Less than 1% of registered nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists identify themselves as specializing in geriatrics. 28 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 48 SLIDE 29: Direct Care Workforce30 Provide majority of care for Alzheimer's (after caregivers) Include s nurse aides, home health aides, person al- care aides and home -care aides Help with daily activities: bathing, dressing, eating Costs range from $48,000 to over $90,000 a year TALKING POINTS: Many older adults, including those with Alzheimer's and other dementias , receive a large part of their care from direct -care workers , such as nurse aides , home health aides , personal -care aides , and home- care aides . These workers help with bathing , dressing , eating , and numerous other daily tasks , both at home and within institutions. It typically costs $132 per day or $48,000/year for a home care agency to provide care in the home . For care provided in a long term care facility, the cost is about $48,000 per year for assisted living and upwards of $90,000 or more per year for nursing home care . Given that Medicare and most privat e insurance (other than long term care insurance) do not cover the se costs, most individuals and/or their families pay out of pocket for this care . 30 Alzheimer's Association. (2019) 2019 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association FACULTY GUIDE 49 SLIDE 30: Direct Care Workforce : Challenges31 Workforce shortage o Rapid increases in number of workers needed as population ages o High turnover o Recruitment and retention difficult Challenging job given nature of the work Limited training , especially on Alzheimer's and dementia TALKING POINTS: Challenges within the direct care workforce include shortages in the number of workers needed and insufficient training. As with family caregivers, the role of providing ongoing, extensive care for a person with Alzheimer's and other dementias is physically and emotionally taxing. This makes finding, hiring, and retaining the right person for the role difficult. Added to that is the challenge of finding the large amount of workers needed to care for the rapidly increasing population needing care services . These jobs typically pay slightly more than minimum wage , often have inconsistent work hours , and usually includes working week ends, holidays, overnight hours...whenever an individual needs care . Subsequently, turnover rates are high among direct -care workers, and recruitment and retention are persistent challenges. Many direct -care workers receive little training on Alzheimer's and dementia care although there is a growing awareness of the need for training related to the special care needs and considerations for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. For most direct -care workers 31 Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute (PHI). (2018) U.S. Home Care Workers Key Facts. FACULTY GUIDE 50 currently , the a verage training is 75 hours, with little focus on Alzheimer's and dementia. Many people wish to remain in their own home or a loved one's home as they age. Therefore, there is tremendous growth in the home care industry. The home care workforce more than doubled between 2007 and 2017, with the expectation that the field will need to add another one million jobs by 2026 to keep pace with the growing tide of older adults needing care. FACULTY GUIDE 51 SLIDE 31: PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TALKING POINTS : Fortunately, there are ways to intervene using public health tools and techniques . The public health approach can be used to improve the quality of life for those living with the disease , their caregivers, and to reduce the costs associa ted with the disease. FACULTY GUIDE 52 SLIDE 32: Healthy People 203032 Proposed objectives for Alzheimer's and other dementia s: o Increasing diagnosis and awareness o Reducing preventable hospitalizations o Increasing number of older adults discussing their memory issues with a health care professional TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's and other dementias were included for the first time in Healthy People 2020 . Healthy People , released every ten years by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , is a framework of goals and objectives that is used to guide national health promotion and disease prevention efforts in the U.S. The proposed objectives for Healthy People 2030 include s the topic area \"Dementias, including Alzheimer's\" and contains speci fic objectives regarding increasing diagnosis and awareness , reducing preventable hospitalizations , and increasing the number of older adults who discuss their confusion or memory loss issues with a health care professional . Public health has a role to play in reaching those objectives. Inclusion in Healthy People underscore s the growing public health threat that Alzheimer's and other dementias pose to the nation. 32 Department of Health and Human Services. (n.d.)

Image source: Unsplash.com FACULTY GUIDE 54 Early detection and diagnosis: Public health play s an important role in efforts to increase early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's, including : Educating the public about the warning signs of dementia, benefits of early detection, and training to health care providers and newly diagnosed individuals, families, and caregivers. Identifying and promoting strategies designed to promote early detection Safety and quality of care: Caring for those with Alzheimer's and dementia requires specialized knowledge about the disease continuum and skill to effectively communicate and care for individuals and their family caregivers. Providing t raining for health care providers and caregivers can increase the quality of care and safety of the individual and the caregiver. Information sharing is also important for those in the community who may interact with individuals with Alzheimer's such as first responders, public transportation providers, pharmacies, faith communities, etc. As mentioned earlier, d ementia caregivers also face challenges such as emotional and physical stress, lack of time for self -care, financial issues, isolation, etc. Caregivers need support and access to resources that will enable them to maintain their health and well -being during the years of caregiving. FACULTY GUIDE 55 SLIDE 3 4: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities Dementia capable systems o Support services o Workforce training and education Dementia friendly communities o Safe, supportive environments TALKING POINTS: (See module 4 for more information.) Public health also has a role to play in supporting dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities. At a larger level, states and communities can become dementia capable and accommodate the needs of a population with Alzheimer's and other demen tias. A dementia capable system is one t hat meet s the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers by providing education, support , and services. Public health can contribute to a dementia capable system through: Ensuring access to support services for people with dementia and their caregivers Workforce training and education Public health also can s upport the creation of dementia friendly communities . These are cross -sector , community- wide effort s to have support services, resources , and safe environments that allow people with dementia and their caregivers to stay connected to the communit y. Over time, these partnerships should: Enhanc e support services and resources Address accessibility and mobility barriers Provid e dementia training for health care providers and first responders Provid e a range of resources to support family caregivers such as respite care services.

FACULTY GUIDE 68 SLIDE 4: Cognitive Health1 Cognition: the ability to think, learn, and remember Cognitive health continuum: \"optimal functioning\" to severe disability TALKING POINTS: To understand what happens to a person when he or she develops Alzheimer's or dementia, it is helpful to first consider cognitive health . Cognition refers to the ability to think, learn, solve problems, and remember. Cognitive health can be viewed along a continuum. At one end is \"optimal functioning,\" which refers to a healthy brain that can perform the following mental processes: Learning new things Intuition Judgment Language Remembering At the other end of the spectrum are people with severe Alzheimer's, dementia, and other brain injuries with limited cognitive functioning . 1 National Institute on Aging.

Physical structures in the brain change, and its ability to carry out various functions tends to decline. Wisdom and expertise can increase with age, while the speed of processing information, making decisions, and recall of information can slow down. This process is known as cognitive aging, which refers to a decline in memory, decision -making, processing speed, and learning. For example, a person might need longer to learn a new skill, have more difficulty recalling certain words or finding common items such as glasses or keys. These changes are considered a normal part of aging and varies from person to person from day to day. When changes in a person's cognitive ability affects their daily life, it may be an indication that it is due to something other than normal aging changes. Subjective Cognitive Decline is self -reported confusion or memory loss that is happening more often or is getting worse. A growing body of evidence suggests that Subjective Cognitive Decline is one of the earliest warning signs for Alzheimer's and other dementias.

Over half of those respondents reporting Subjective Cognitive Decline had not talked about their memory issues with a health care provider. FACULTY GUIDE 71 SLIDE 6: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)5,6 Difficulty with cognitive processes Not severe enough to interfere with daily life Increased risk of Alzheimer's or dementia May be caused by external factors (vitamin B12 deficiency, depression) T ALKING POINTS: M ild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which people have memory or other thinking problems that are noticeable, but their symptoms are not severe enough to interfere with everyday activities. Symptoms of MCI may include forgetting important information that he or she would have previously recalled easily (such as appointments, conversations, or recent events), or a decreased ability to make sound decisions, judge the time or sequence of steps needed to complete a complex task, or have trouble with visual perception. A person with MCI is at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's or other dementia. In some cases, however, the condition may be caused by external factors , such as medication, vitamin B12 deficiency, and depression. In these cases, the condition may be reversed if the underlying cause is addressed, reverse on its own, or remain stable. 5 Alzheimer's Association.

When a per son has trouble with cognitive processes that begin to affect the things he or she does in everyday life, it is often referred to as cognitive impairment . Cognitive impairment spans a wide range of functioning. It can occur as a result of Alzheimer's or other dementias, or with other conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. 7 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FACULTY GUIDE 73 SLIDE 8: Dementia8 Decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life Not a specific disease Not normal aging Caused by damage to brain cells from disease or trauma Many dementias are progressive TALKING POINTS: Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia is not a specific disease. Rather, it's an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills. Dementia is NOT normal aging. It is caused by damage to brain cells from disease or trauma (such as a brain injury or st roke). This damage interferes with the ability of brain cells to communicate with each other. When brain cells cannot communicate normally, thinking, behavior, and feelings can be affected. Many dementias are progressive, meaning symptoms start out slow ly and gradually get worse. There are several types of dementia. Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, followed by vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is a decline in thinking skills caused by conditions that block or reduce blood flow to the brain such as a stroke that deprives brain cells of vital oxygen and nutrients. Other types of dementia include Lewy Body dementia, frontotemporal, Huntington's disease and others. 8 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) What is Dementia? Retrieved from http://www.a lz.org/what -is- dementia.asp#causes FACULTY GUIDE 74 Researchers increasingly believe a large number of dementia cases are mixed dementia when a person has multiple types of dementia. Sometimes dementia- like symptoms can be caused by other conditions, such as depression, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and some infections, that when treated will result in improvement of dementia- like symptoms. A key difference between these conditions and dementia is that the symptoms usually appear suddenly, whereas dementia develops slowly over time. This is one reason why it is important for someone with memory changes to be seen by a health professional to determine a possible cause of confusion or memory loss. FACULTY GUIDE 75 SLIDE 9 : ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE TALKING POINTS: The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. We will focus our attention on understanding more about the stages of Alzheimer's as well as risk factors, treatment, and management of the disease. FACULTY GUIDE 76 SLIDE 10: Alzheimer's History9 Identified in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer Examined brain of woman who died after living with profound memory loss Found abnormal clumps (plaques) and tangled fibers (tangles) in the brain TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's disease was first identified in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer. He noticed certain changes in the brain tissue of a woman in her 50s who had died after several years of progressive cognitive impairment, hallucinations, disorientation, and unpredictable behavior. Dr. Alzheimer examined her brain after death and found many abnormal clumps (now called amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (now called neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles). These plaques and tangles in the brain are still considered some of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, along with the loss of connections between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. 9 National Institute on Aging.

It accounts for an estimated 60% to 80% of cases. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, in which brain changes may go unnoticed for years, but gradually worsen over time as the brain deteriorates due to the disease. The image on the slide shows a healthy brain (left side) as compared to a severe Alzheimer's brain (right side). The Alzheimer's brain is significantly smaller than the healthy brain. Alzheimer's is viewed as a continuum where brain c hanges can begin a decade or more before symptoms begin to appear. Eventually the brain changes caused by Alzheimer's may result in the first symptoms of cognitive decline, and over time reach the mild cognitive impairment stage. The term Alzheimer's demen tia refers to the stage of the disease when an individual has observable symptoms such as memory loss, mood/behavior changes, and difficulty with activities of daily living. In mild (early) stages of dementia, people experience some memory loss, but with s evere (late -stage) Alzheimer's, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. The degenerative nature of the disease means many in the severe stage have difficulty moving, often become bed -bound, and need round -the- clock care. 10 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.)

Experts agree that in the vast majority of cases, Alzheimer's, like other common chronic conditions, probably develops as a result of complex interactions among multiple factors, including advancing age, genetics, environment, lifestyle, and coexisting medical conditions. 11 Alzheimer's Association.

Over time, the brain shrinks dramatically, affecting nearly all its functions. Scientists are not absolutely sure what causes cell death and tissue loss in the Alzheimer's brain, but plaques and tangles are prime suspects. Plaques , abnormal clusters of protein fragments, build up between nerve cells in the brain. Plaques form when protein pieces called beta -amyloid clump together. Dead and dying nerve cells contain tangles , which are made up of twisted strands of another protein. Plaques and tangles tend to spread through the brain in a predictable pattern as Alzheimer's progresses. *Note: The image on the slide shows a microscopic illustration of Alzheimer's tissue with plaques and tangles.

Challenges in planning or solving problems 3. Difficulty completing familiar tasks 4. Confusion with time or place 5. Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships TALKING POINTS: In the last slide we looked at the physical changes that take place inside the brain as a result of Alzheimer's, but what most people associate with Alzheimer's is the cognitive and behavioral symptoms. These symptoms also change and become more severe as the disease progresses. Alzheimer's affects people in different ways. The most common symptom begins with gradually worsening ability to remember new information . As damage spreads, individuals experience other difficulties. The following are ten early signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's : 1. Memory loss that disrupts daily life One of the most common signs of Alzheimer's dementia, especially in the early stages, is forgetting recently learned information. Others include: forgetting important dates or events; asking for the same information over and over; relying on family members for things they used to handle on their own. 2. Challenges in planning or solving problems 13 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) 10 Early Signs and Symptoms of Alzheimer's. Retrieved from https://www.alz.org/alzheimers -dementia/10_signs Image source: National Cancer Institute, NCI Visuals Online FACULTY GUIDE 82 Some people may experience changes in their ability to develop and follow a plan or work with numbers. They may have trouble following a familiar recipe or keeping track of monthly bills. They may have difficulty concentrating and take much longer to do things than they did before. 3. Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home, at work or at leisure People with Alzheimer's may have a hard time completing daily tasks. Some times, people may have trouble driving to a familiar location, managing a budget at work, or using a cell phone. 4. Confusion with time or place People with Alzheimer's can lose track of dates, seasons, and the passage of time. They may have trouble understanding something if it is not happening immediately. Sometimes they may forget where they are or how they got there. 5. Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships For some people, having vision problems is a sign of Alzheimer's. They may have difficulty with balance or judging distance, and trip over things at home, or spill or drop things more often. In terms of perception, they may pass a mirror and think someone else is in the room. They may not recognize their own reflection.

Decreased or poor judgment 9. Withdrawal from work or social activities 10. Changes in mood and personality TALKING POINTS: 6. New problems with words in speaking or writing People with Alzheimer's may have trouble following or joining a conversation. They may stop in the middle of a conversation and have no idea how to continue, or they may repeat themselves. They may struggle with vocabulary or call things by the wrong name (e.g., calling a watch a \"hand clock\"). 7. Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps A person with Alzheimer's may put things in unusual places. They may lose thing s and be unable to go back over their steps to find them again. Sometimes, they may accuse others of stealing. 8. Decreased or poor judgment People with Alzheimer's may experience changes in judgment or decision -making. For example, they may use poor judgme nt when dealing with money, such as giving large amounts to telemarketers. They may pay less attention to grooming or keeping themselves clean. 9. Withdrawal from work or social activities 14 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) 10 Early Signs and Symptoms of Alzheimer's.

They may have trouble keeping up with a favorite sports team or remembering how to complete a favorite hobby. 10. Changes in mood and personality The mood and personalities of people with Alzheimer's can change. They can become confused, suspicious, depressed, fearful, or anxious. They may be easily upset at home, at work, with friends, or in places where they are out of their comfort zone. FACULTY GUIDE 85 SLIDE 17: Stages of Alzheimer's15 Average lifespan 4 -8 years after diagnosis; as long as 20 years Progresses slowly in 3 stages: o Mild (early -stage) o Moderate (middle -stage) o Severe (late -stage) TALKING POINTS: On average, a person with Alzheimer's lives four to eight years after diagnosis, but can live as long as 20 years, depending on many factors (such as the progression of the disease, other co -occurring conditions, infections, and unintentional injuries). The symptoms of Alzheimer's worsen over time, although the rate at which the disease progresses varies . Alzheimer's typically progresses slowly in three general stages -mild (early -stage), moderate (middle -stage), and severe (late -stage). The beginning of Alzheimer's - or the presymptomatic stage - starts years before the re are noticeable changes or symptoms. Eventually the brain changes caused by Alzheimer's may result in the first symptoms of cognitive decline, and over time reach the mild cognitive impairment stage. For many of these individuals, dementia will progress through early, mid, and late stages. *Note: The image on the slide shows the progression of changes to the brain, from preclinical Alzheimer's (top), mild to moderate (middle), to severe (bottom). 15 Alzheimer's Association.

He or she may still drive , work, and be part of social activities . Despite this, the person may feel as if he or she is having memory lapses , such as forgetting familiar words or the locati on of everyday objects . Other common difficulties in the mild stage of Alzheimer's include: Trouble remembering names when introduced to new people Having greater difficulty performing tasks in social or work settings Forgetting material that one has just read Increasing trouble with planning or organizing 16 Alzheimer's Association.

In the moderate stage, damage to nerve cells in the brain can make it difficult to express thoughts and perform routine tasks. During this stage, symptoms will be noticeable to others and may include: Forgetfulness of events or about one's own personal history Confusion about where they are or what day it is The need for help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion Trouble controlling bladder and bowels in some individuals Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping during the day and becoming restless at night An increas ed risk of wandering and becoming lost Personality and behavioral changes, including suspiciousness and delusions or compulsive, repetitive, behavior like hand -wringing or tissue shredding 17 Alzheimer's Association.

In the severe stage of Alzheimer's, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation, and, eventually, to control movement. They may still say words or phrases, but communicating becomes difficult. As memory and cognitive skills continue to worsen, personality changes may take place, and individuals need extensive help with daily activities. At this stage, individuals may: Require full- time, round -the-clock assistance with daily personal care Lose awareness of recent experiences as well as of their surroundings Experience changes in physical abilities , including the ability to walk, sit, and eventually, swallow Become vulnerable to infections , especially pneumonia 18 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 90 SLIDE 2 2: Risk Factors: Age19,20 21 #1 risk factor is advancing age Risk d oubles every 5 years after age 65 1 in 3 people age 85 TALKING POINTS: Currently, researchers don't fully understand what causes Alzheimer's disease in most people. As described earlier, in most cases it is likely a combination of genetic , environmental , and lifestyle factors that take place over a long period of time. A nu mber of risk factors have been identified that contribute to the development of Alzheimer's. Other risk factors are associated with dementia but need additional research. The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's dementia is advancing age . Most individual s with Alzheimer's diagnoses are age 65 or older. However, Alzheimer's and dementia are not normal parts of aging. The risk of developing Alzheimer's increases with age. It approximately doubles every five years after age 65. In persons age 85 or older, ab out one in three have Alzheimer's. 19 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) Causes and Risk Factors .

Y ounger - onset Alzheimer's (also known as early -onset) affects people beginning in their 40s and 50s. Although it is not known why younger -onset cases occur, scientists have identified rare genes that directly cause Alzheimer's in a few families. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 200,000 people have younger -onset Alzheimer's disease - up to 5% of the population with Alzheimer's. 22 Alzheimer's Association. Image source: National Cancer Institute, NCI Visuals Online, Rhoda Baer (Photographer) FACULTY GUIDE 92 SLIDE 2 4: Risk Factors: Family History , Education 23 Family history Environmental factors Years of formal education TALKING POINTS: In addition to advancing age, another strong risk factor is family history . People who have an immediate family member -a parent, brother, sister, or child \u2014 with Alzheimer's are more likely to develop the disease. This risk increases if more than one family member has the disease. When diseases tend to run in families, either hereditary (genetics) or environmental factors, or both, may play a role. Scientists have identified a number of hereditary genes that either increase the likelihood or guarantee that people with the gene will develop Alzheimer's. Researchers are trying to determine the link between dementias and possible environmental factors such as exposure to pesticides, food additives, air pollution, and other problematic chemical compounds. Several studies have demonstrated that fewer years of formal education and lower levels of cognitive engagement may be r isk factors for dementia. People who have more years of formal education have lower rates of Alzheimer's and other dementias than those with less education. Additional studies suggest that remaining socially and mentally active throughout life may support brain health and possibly reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias. Some researchers have proposed a \"cognitive reserve\" hypothesis to explain why some people maintain cognitive 23 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) Causes and Risk Factors .

They posit that mental activity and stimulation over the life course (such as through education, mentally stimulating jobs, or leisure activities) enable some brains to flexibly and efficiently use cognitive networks (networks of neuron- to-neuron connections) in ways that may mask or delay appearance of symptoms. FACULTY GUIDE 94 SLIDE 25: Risk Factors: Race & Ethnicity24 African -Americans: 2 times greater risk Hispanics : 1.5 times greater risk Cardiovascular risk factors more common Lower levels of education, socioeconomic status TALKING POINTS: Race and ethnicity may also contribute to increased risk of developing Alzheimer's and other dementias. In the U.S., older African -Americans are about two times more likely than older white s to h ave Alzheimer's. Older Hispanics are about one and one -half times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's . Variations in health, lifestyle, and socioeconomic circumstances across racial groups likely account for most of the differences in risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias by race. For example, African -American and Hispanic communities have higher incidence of certain Alzheimer's risk factors: Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes which are risk factors for Alzheimer's, are more common in African -Americans and Hispanic populations than in whites. Lower levels of education and other socioeconomic characteristics (such as lower income and access to quality care ) among older racial and ethnic minorities may also contribute to increased risk. Some studies suggest that differences based on race and ethnicity do not persist in rigorous analyses that account for such risk factors. 24 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 95 SLIDE 26: Risk Factors: Women25,26 2/3 of affected population 16% of women age 71 (11% of men) After age 65, have more than 1 in 5 chance (1 in 11 for men) T ALKING POINTS: Almo st 2/3 of U.S. adults with Alzheimer's are women . Among those aged 71 and older, 16% of women have Alzheimer's and other dementias, com pared with 11% of men. At age 65, women without Alzheimer's have more than a one in five chance of developing Alzheimer's during the remainder of their lives, compared with a one in 11 chance for men. This may be partially explained by the fact that women live longer, on average, than men. Men who live longer may also be healthier and not have some of the chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease that can heighten risk for Alzheimer's and other dementias. However, researchers are questioning whether Alzheimer's risks for women could be higher at any age due to biological and/or genetic variations or differences in life experiences such as educational attainment. Although rates of Alzheimer's are higher among women, the risk for some other types of dementia, such as vascular dementia, are greater in men. 25 Alzheimer's Association.

Research has linked moderate and severe traumatic brain injury to a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's or another type of dementia years after the original head injury. One of the key studies showing an increased risk found that older adults with a history of moderate traumatic brain injury (unconsciousness lasting more than 30 minutes) had a 2.3 times greate r risk of developing Alzheimer's than their peers with no history of head injury. Those with a history of severe traumatic brain injury (unconsciousness lasting more than 24 hours) had a 4.5 times greater risk of Alzheimer's. Also, people with repeated head injuries (such as boxers, football players, and combat veterans) are at an even higher risk of developing dementia. 27 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) Traumatic Brain Injury . Retrieved dementia/what -is-dementia/related_conditions/traumatic Modifiable Risk Factors: Lifestyle28,29 Increases risk o Current smoking o Midlife obesity Decreases risk o Physical activity o Heart -healthy diets: DASH, Mediterranean diet o Mental and social activity TALKING POINTS: Certain lifestyle factors may help to lower the risk for developing Alzheimer's and other dementias. There is fairly strong evidence that current smoking increases the risk of cognitive decline and possibly also dementia, and that quitting smoking may reduce the associated risk to levels comparable to those who have never smoked. Diet and physical activity may help to prevent against obesity; midlife obesi ty has been shown to increase risk for Alzheimer's and other dementias. Exercise may also directly benefit brain cells by increasing blood and oxygen flow in the brain. Current evidence also suggests that eating a heart -healthy diet may also help protect the brain against cognitive decline. 28 Morris, MC, Tangney, CC, Wang, Y, Sacks, FM, Benne tt, DA, and Aggarwal, NT. (2015) MIND Diet Associated with Reduced Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease. Alzheimer's & Dementia, 11(9), 1007 -1014. from https://www.alz.org/alzheimers - dementia/research_progress/prevention Image source: National Cancer Institute, NCI Visuals Online FACULTY GUIDE 98 Two diets that have been studied and may be beneficial are the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet. The DASH diet emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and fat-free or low -fat da iry products; includes whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, nuts, and vegetable oils, and limits sodium, sweets, sugary beverages, and red meats. The Mediterranean diet includes relatively little red meat and emphasizes whole grains, fruits and vegetables, fish and shellfish, and nuts, olive oil, and other healthy fats. More recently, researchers have been studying a combined version of the DASH and Mediterranean diet called the MIND diet, which stands for Mediterranean -DASH Intervention for Neurode generative Delay. This diet has more emphasis on foods that support a healthy brain, such as those with omega -3 fatty acids . Some studies have also indicated that staying cognitively and socially active may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline. This involves mentally stimulating activities and social connections. FACULTY GUIDE 99 SLIDE 29: Modifiable Risk Factors: Cardiovascular30,31 Heart -head connection Cardiovascular risk factors: o High blood pressure in midlife o Heart disease o Stroke o Diabetes TALKING POINTS: Growing evidence suggests that the health of the brain is closely linked to the overall health of the heart and blood vessels. The brain is nourished by one of the body's richest networks of blood vessels. With every beat, the heart pumps blood to the head, where brain cells use the food and oxygen carried by the blood i n order to function normally. As a result, many factors that damage the heart or blood vessels may also damage the brain and may increase the risk for developing Alzheimer's and other de mentias. Several conditions known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, appear to increase the risk of developing dementia. Some autopsy studies show that as many as 80% of individuals with Alzheimer's also have cardiovascular disease. Controlling high blood pressure may reduce the combined risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. In addition to treating high blood pressure, reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease also includes not smoking, preventing or effectively managing diabetes, as well as avoiding obesity. This is especially important for people in their 40s -50s (midlife) when the early brain changes of Alzheimer's can begin. 30 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) Prevention.

FACULTY GUIDE 101 SLIDE 3 1: Diagnosing Alzheimer's Dementia32 No single test Medical evaluation o Medical history o Mental status testing o Information from family and friends o Physical and neurological exams o Rule out other causes TALKING POINTS: Physicians can almost always determine if a person has dementia ; however, it can be difficult to identify the exact cause. Establishing a diagnosis for Alzheimer's can be more challenging. There is no single test that can show whether a person has Alzheimer's. A careful medical evaluation is required, which includes: A thorough medical history Mental status testing Information from family and friends Physical and n eurological exams Tests (such as blood tests and brain imaging) to rule out other causes of dementia -like symptoms 32 Alzheimer's Association.

Drug and non-drug treatments may help with both cognitive and behavioral symptoms , but don't affect the underlying disease. Medications are used to tr eat symptoms and are more effective if administered after early diagnosis. The chief goals of existing treatment are to: Maintain quality of life Maximize function in daily activities Enhance cognition, mood, and behavior Foster a safe environment Promote social engagement, as appropriate Clinical trials are ongoing for a search for a cure and better treatment of the A lzheimer's and other dementias. Researchers need people at -risk of or living with dementia, caregivers, and healthy individuals to participate in clinical trials to test potential treatments and methods of prevention. 33 Alzheimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 103 SLIDE 3 3: Alzheimer's: Co -Morbidities34,35 Additional chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, depression) Difficult to manage Higher rates of hospitalizations and costs Preventable hospitalizations TALKING POINTS: Treating people with Alzheimer's often requires the management of co -morbidities . Co-morbidities refer to additional chronic conditions - such as heart disease, diab etes, depression, and arthritis - that are present in combination with a primary disease. People with Alzheimer's and other dementias are more likely to have co - morbidities than other older people without dementia. It is estimated that more than 95% of people with dementia have one or more chronic conditions. The cognitive problems associated with Alzheimer's and dementia can lead to poor self -management of co-morbidities. On average, people with dementia have twice as many hospital stays and have signific antly higher Medicare costs of other older people. Most of the hospitalizations are not for Alzheimer's itself, but for these other conditions that are often complicated by, or result from, Alzheimer's, such as falls. Many of these hospitalizations are p reventable (or potentially avoidable) with better quality care and management of co -morbidities and injury risks. 34 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Image source: pixabay.com FACULTY GUIDE 104 SLIDE 34: Alzheimer's: Unique Aspects36 Financial hardship o May lose income and savings o Increased reliance on public programs Stigma Vulnerability to abuse Caregiver burden TALKING POINTS: People with younger -onset dementia may lose income and savings when they become unable to work. Those with dementia at any age may need to pay for additional services, especially as the disease progresses. As the need for care intensifies, many people with Alzheimer's and dementia may live in nursing homes for long periods of time. The financial burden of this care can result in turning to Medicaid and other public programs to help pay for their services and support. People with dementia report being afraid of the reactions of others and a l ower perceived status within society because of the diagnosis. The stigma associated with dementia may contribute to social exclusion , a reluctance to seek help or even a diagnosis , a sense of shame and inadequacy , and low self-esteem. People with Alzheimer's and other demen tias tend to be especially vulnerable to abuse because the disease may prevent them from reporting the abuse or recognizing it. Abuse can occur anywhere, including at home and in care settings. Abuse can take many forms: physical or emotional abuse, negle ct, and/or financial misuse. Another unique aspect of Alzheimer's is the level of care that must be provided as the disease progresses and the 36 Alzheimer's Association. (n.d.) Abuse. Retrieved from https://www.alz.org/help - support/caregiving/safety/abuse Image source: pixabay.com FACULTY GUIDE 105 stress this can put on the caregiver. An individual with Alzheimer's will need ever- increasing levels of care. Mo st people with Alzheimer's disease have a primary caregiver, often a family member , who is crucial to ensuring appropriate care. As the person with Alzheimer's declines, the primary caregiver often takes on an increasing role in advocating for and attending to all aspects of the person's health and well -being as well as all their financial affairs. Given the level, duration, and intensity of care needed, caregivers for people with dementia have a greater burden of care than non -dementia caregivers. FACULTY GUIDE 106 SLIDE 35: Alzheimer's: Caregivers37 Types of care activities include daily living activities, medication management, financial management Level of care needed increases and often r esults in complete dependence Caregiving has significant physical and emotional stress TALKING POINTS: The term caregiver is used to describe a person who provides a level of care and support for another that exceeds typical responsibilities of daily life. Caregiving responsibilities, especially in the moderate and sever e stages, often include: Helping with dressing , bathing , using the toilet , and eating Shopping , meal preparation, transportation, medication management , and financial management Providing emotional support People with Alzheimer's require increasing levels of care as the disease progresses; more severe stages may require constant supervision and result in complete dependence on caregivers (paid or unpaid). Being a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer's can take a significant physical and emotional toll. Caregivers of someone with Alzheimer's or other dementias are at increased risk for negative health impacts Nearly 60% of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers rate the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high 37 Alzheimer's Association.

Four key public health intervention tools that can reduce the burden of Alzheimer's disease are: Surveillance/monitoring that allows public health to compile data and use it to: o Develop interventions o Inform public policy o Guide r esearch o Educate populations Promoting primary prevention can be used to promote risk reduction and promote cognitive health Public health may play an important role increasing early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease Safety and quality of care: Caring for those with Alzheimer's and dementia requires specialized knowledge about the disease continuum and skill to effectively communicate and care for individuals and their family caregivers. Providing training for health care providers and care givers can increase the quality care for and safety of the individual, as well as help caregivers sustain their role. Information sharing is also important for those in the community who may interact with individuals with Alzheimer's such as first responde rs, public transportation providers, pharmacies, faith communities, etc. Image source: Copyrighted image ; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association FACULTY GUIDE 108 SLIDE 37: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities Dementia capable systems o Support services o Workforce training Dementia friendly communities TALKING POINTS: (see module 4 for more information) Public health also has a role to play in supporting dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities. At a larger level, states , and communities can become dementia capable in accommodating the needs of a population with Alzheimer's and other dementias. A dementia capable system is a system or infrastructure that works to meet the needs of a people with dementia and their caregivers through providing education, support, and services. Public health can contribute to a dementia capable system through: Ensuring access to support services for people with dementia and their caregivers Workforce training and education Publ ic health can also support the creation of dementia friendly communities . These are cross - sector, community -wide efforts to have support services, resources, and safe environments that allow people with dementia and their caregivers to stay connected to the community. This can include enhancing support services and resources, addressing accessibility and mobility issues, providing dementia training for health care, police, EMS, and firefighters, and providing resources to support family caregivers such as respite care services.

The term dementia is a general term for a decline in mental abilities that is severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia, which is not a disease but a syndrome, is characterized by damage to brain cells due to age, brain injury, other conditions or diseases , heredity , or a combination of factors . There are several types of dementia and most occur in those over 65; however, there are types of dementia that occur in those younger than 65. The term Alzheimer's dementia is used to describe the stage of Alzheimer's disease when an individual has observable symptoms such as memory loss, mood/behavior changes, and difficulty with activities of daily living. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's is a disease that progressively 1 Alzheimer's Association. (2019) 2019 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures. FACULTY GUIDE 122 damages and eventually destroys brain cells over the course of many years , even decades . There is no cure for Alzheimer's. While there are approved drug treatments , the goal of existing treatment is to delay or reduce symptoms, not to cure or reverse the course of the disease. As the person with Alzheimer's loses memory and function, caregivers , who are most often family members, are needed to provide inc reasing amounts of assistance. This assistance can range from helping to manage finances and household tasks to hands -on care, such as bathing, dressing, feeding , and o ther activities of daily living. Given the nature of the disease and its increasing prevalence, there is a huge financial, emotional and physical impact on people with Alzheimer's, their families, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole. Public health plays an important role in addressing Alzheimer's disease through surveillance, prevention, detection, and support of dementia -capable systems. In this presentation, we will be focusing on the role of public health. FACULTY GUIDE 123 SLIDE 4: Alzheimer's: A Public Health Crisis Historically viewed as a medical or aging issue Growing recognition of public health crisis: o Large and growing epidemic o Significant impact o Ways to intervene TALKING POINTS: Historically, Alzheimer's and other dementias have been view ed primarily as medical or aging issue s. Yet as more is learned about these conditions and the impact they are having on society, there is a strong recognition of Alzheimer's and dementia as issues in which public health has an important role to play. Alzheimer's disease is a public health crisis because : The epidemic is large and growing The impact on populations and communities is substantial There are ways to intervene using a public health approach to achieve meaningful improvements in health outcomes FACULTY GUIDE 124 SLIDE 5: Alzheimer's: Epidemic (U.S.)1 Nearly 6 million adults 1 in 10 adults age 65 1 in 3 adults age 8 5 By 2050, expected to reach 13.8 million TALKING POINTS: Today, nearly 6 million adults in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer's, including an estimated 200,000 under the age of 65. One in ten adults age 65 and older (10%) currently has Alzheimer's disease; approximately one in three people age 85 and older have the disease. By 2050, the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease is expected to total 13.8 million and could be as high as 16 million . 1 Alzheimer's Association.

In the U.S. the annual costs of direct care for people with Alzheimer's disease is nearly $ 300 billion . \"Direct care\" includes both paid health care and long -term care. It does not include caregiving (an essential part of Alzheimer's care). Alzheimer's disease is the most expensive disease to treat and provide care for in America, costing more than heart disease and cancer. 2 Alzheimer's Association.

Women make up 2/3 of the population with Alzheimer's. In the U.S., African -Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of Alzheimer's and other dementias than whites. Available data indicate that in the United States, older African -Americans are about two times more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's and other dementias. Older Hispanics are about one and one -half times more likely than older whites to have these conditions. 3 Alzheimer's Association. (2019) 2019 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures.

Later stages may require constant supervision and involve complete dependence on caregiv ers. Currently, it is estimated that over 16 million family members and friends provide nearly 18 billion hours of unpaid care annually. Financially, these contributions are valued at over $230 billion . As a result of their role in caring for someone with Alzheimer's, c aregivers often face significant hardships related to their own health, emotional wellbeing, and financial stability. 4 Alzheimer's Association.

Individuals with Alzheimer's disease use a disproportionate amount of health care resources. For example, they have twice as many hospitalizations than older adults without the disease. In addition, nearly 7 in 10 of residents in assisted living facilities have some sort of cognitive impairment. Many people with Alzheimer's and other dementias receive care in their home or a loved one's home as long as possible before entering an assisted living or nursing home. Care is most often provided by family membe rs or paid home care workers. With the growing number of older adults in the U.S. population (both with and without Alzheimer's and other dementias), the country is facing a workforce shortage of health care and home care professionals who are trained to meet the needs of older adults. Many professionals already in the workforce are not adequately trained on the needs of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. 6 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Surveillance activities are done at the federal, state, and local levels. Surveillance is used to compile data on a population level, including: The prevalence of certain diseases to understand how common or wides pread they are Health risk factors (such as tobacco use, high blood pressure, and overweight/obesity) Health behaviors (such as nutrition and physical activity) Burden of particular diseases and conditions (such as financial costs, mortality, and morbidity ) Developing effective responses to the Alzheimer's epidemic necessitates understanding how Alzheimer's and dementia impact states and communities. As it relates to Alzheimer's and other dementias, the availability of state -level data is growing, but gaps remain regarding prevalence and impact of cognitive decline as well as roles and impact on caregivers of those with dementia. 7 Alzheimer's Association.

The BRFSS is the nation's premier system for collecting d ata on health -related risk behaviors, chronic conditions and use of preventive services. The survey is conducted by telephone and is collected at the state level by all 50 states and U.S. territories. It is a partnership between the Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments. The survey is conducted by state health departments and is comprised of core component questions, optional modules and state -based questions. CDC has developed two BRFSS modules that allow states to collect data on the prevalence of and impact on those experiencing cognitive decline as well as provide insight into the role and challenges faced by caregivers. The two BRFSS modules are the Cognitive Decline module and the Caregiver module . 8 Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention. (2014 ) About BRFSS .

FACULTY GUIDE 140 SLIDE 21: Primary Prevention16 Designed to prevent a disease or condition from developing in a population Causes of Alzheimer's not fully understood Primary prevention for Alzheimer's: o Risk reduction o Promotion of cognitive health TALKING POINTS: An important role of public health is promoting primary prevention which is intervening before health effects can occur. Common examples of primary prevention in public health include regular physical activity to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease, vaccination against infectious diseases, bike helmet laws, and anti -tobacco use campaigns. Secondary and tertiary prevention refer to identifying and managing a disease or condition at its earliest stage, and minimizing or reducing complications of or disability resulting from a disease or injury, respectively. Research hasn't yet revealed the exact causes of Alzheimer's in most people. However, a growing base of evidence suggests there are ways to reduce risk for cognitive decline and possibly dementia, as well as ways to promote cognitive health at the populati on level. 16 Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention.

The risk remains even years after the original head injury, and the risk of dementia increases with the number of TBIs sustained. Prevention efforts for the general publi c may include: Promoting (through education and policy) the use of: o Seat belts o Helmets when bicycling and participating in certain sports Falls prevention , including: o Putting safety measures in place at home (such as reducing tripping hazards, adding grab bars, and improving lighting) o Exercise to improve balance and coordination o Reviewing medicines and vision with health care provider 17 Alzheimer's Association.

Several conditions known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease -including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes \u2014 also appear to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Some autopsy studies show that up to 80% of individuals with Alzheimer's also have cardiovascular disease. Many cardiovascular disease risk factors are modifiable -that is, they can be changed to decrease the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease. Many experts believe that controlling cardiovascular risk factors may be the most cost -effective and helpful approach to protecting brain health and reducing the risk of cognitive decline. Risk factors that may be modified include: Quitting s moking : Smoking has a negative effect on cardiovascular health. There is evidence that 19 Alzheimer's Association.

Diet: Current evidence also suggests that eating a heart -healthy diet may also help protect the brain. Two diets that have been studied and may be beneficial are the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet . A third dietary intervention is the Mediterranean -DASH Intervention for Neurod egenerative Delay ( MIND) diet, which is a combination of the two diets and focuses on foods that support cognitive health. Physical activity : Regular physical activity is important for heart health and may help lower the risk of Alz heimer's and vascular dementia. Exercise may directly benefit brain cells by increasing blood and oxygen flow in the brain. Adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) a week and muscle -strengthening activities on 2 or more days a we ek that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms). FACULTY GUIDE 145 SLIDE 25: Risk Reduction: Avoidance/Management23,24 Prevent onset of or effectively manage conditions that can increase risk for Alzheimer's o High blood pressure (hypertension) o Diabetes o Midlife obesity T ALKING POINTS: G rowing evidence suggests that the avoidance and management of high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes , and midlife obesity may reduce risk for Alzheimer's and other dementia s. There is even stronger evidence that these factors may also help protect against cognitive decline in general. A large -scale clinical trial showed that medical treatment to reduce blood pressure can significantly lower the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and combined outcome of MCI and dementia in older adults with hypertension. Controlling blood pressure is also important for reducing risk for stroke, another source of cognitive impairment. Preventing and managing these and other chronic diseases and conditions have been priorities of public health practice for many years. The increasing evidence base about the impact of these conditions on cognitive health must also be taken into account and incorporated into public health practice going forward. 23 Alzheimer's Association.

Mentally stimulating activities may include: Learning new information and skills that challenges the brain in novel ways Volunteering Reading Playing challenging games (such as bridge, chess, Sudoku, etc.) Other studies have also suggested a link between social connections and cognitive health. Keeping strong social connections with others through activities such as clubs, friends, social groups, volunteering may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and possibly delay the onset of dementia. 25 National Institute on Aging.

FACULTY GUIDE 149 SLIDE 28: Risk Reduction: Public Health Interventions27,28 Health education and promotion campaigns o Brain and cardiovascular health o Detection/treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure o Smoking cessation Programs and policies o Injury prevention o Cardiovascular health TALKING POINTS: Public health may design and implement health education and promotion campaigns that directly promote brain health and risk reduction strategies, or incorporate brain health messages into cardiovascular health and injury prevention campaigns. Similarly, reducing risk for cognitive decline and possibly dementia is in line with public health efforts to improve detection and treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes and promote smoking cessation . Such campaigns should include in their target audience midlife and older adults . Specifically, evidence -based interventions are needed to increase physical activity, promote smoking cessation and heart- healthy diets, and control high blood pressure. To achieve health equity goals, public health campaigns need culturally appropria te education and awareness campaigns for heart health and brain health. These are especially important for African -Americans and 27 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Although there are no pharmacological treatments that change the course of the disease, there are numerous reasons why early detection is important: Access to treatment and services : A formal diagnosis allows individuals and their caregivers to have access to available treatments , build a care team , and identify support services . It may help individuals: Begin medication to help manage symptoms Identify health care professionals to help with different aspects of the disease (such as primary care, neurologist, occupational therapist, etc.) Manage co-morbidities (such as high blood pressure, diabetes) and potentially minimize or avoid further complications 29 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention.

Image source: pixabay.com FACULTY GUIDE 153 Access community -based services, such as support groups and services to assist with daily life All of these factors may help reduce the burden on people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers . Health care costs could be reduced if better care averts avoidable hospitalizations or delay s admission to long - term care facilities. Planning : Early detection of Alzheimer's and other dementias can also help individuals and their families make important decisions and plans surrounding care, treatment options, and finances. Many people with Alzheimer's and their families may benefit from creating a dvance directives -legal documents that specify the type of m edical and end- of- life care a person wants to receive once he or she can no longer make or communicate these decisions. Such a document allows the person's wishes to be carried out by their family. Reversible Causes : In some cases, dementia -like symptoms are not actually dementia, but are due to reversible causes. Common causes of dementia -like symptoms are depression, untreated sleep apnea, delirium, side effects of medications, thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies and excessive alcohol consumpt ion. Unlike Alzheimer's and other dementias, these conditions often may be reversed with treatment. Clinical Trials: Having access to clinical trials provides individuals with the opportunity to access the latest experimental approaches available and provides them with care by clinical research staff. It is important for diverse populations to participate in clinical studies. This is especially true for African American and Hispanic populations, both of which are at increased risk for Alzheimer's and are traditionally under -represented in research .

FACULTY GUIDE 155 SLIDE 32: Early Detection: Factors Influencing Diagnosis Rates33,34 Many people with Alzheimer's and other dementias either: o Have n ot been diagnosed o Have a diagnosis but have not been made aware Fear of Alzheimer's and/or lack of knowledge about cognitive decline by individuals Only 35% aware of diagnosis , yet vast majority say they'd want to know Health care disparities TALKING POINTS: Despite the many benefits of early detection and diagnosis, many people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias either: Have not been diagnosed, or Have been diagnosed but have not been made aware of the diagnosis Individuals, their families, and health care providers have to overcome barriers to diagnosis in order for early detection to occur. Many people of all ages fear getting Alzheimer's more than any other disease, and others may lack basic knowledge about cognitive decline, including the early signs of Alzheimer's. These are two of many reasons why we saw, as with the BRFSS data on subjective cognitive decli ne, many people experiencing memory issues are not discussing the symptoms with their doctor. Yet, 90% or more of people would want to know if they themselves or a family member had Alzheimer's. 33 Alzheimer's Association. (2019) 2019 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures. 34 Alzh eimer's Association. (2018) Race, Ethnicity, and Alzheimer's Fact S heet. FACULTY GUIDE 156 A key challenge with early detection and diagnosis of Alzhei mer's is that many individuals and their caregivers are not being told of the diagnosis, even when their doctor has diagnosed it. An analysis by the CDC found that among people with Alzheimer's or another dementia, they or their caregivers reported being aware of the diagnosis only in 35% of the cases . (For more information: https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/data - search/Search -the-Data#objid=4158 ) These rates are far below diagnoses for other chronic diseases. Analyses have shown that 90% or more of those diagnosed with cancer and cardiovascular disease, for example, were aware of their diagnosis. There are also health care disparities surrounding diagnosis. Med icare data show that African -Americans are even less likely than whites to be diagnosed. Furthermore, when they are diagnosed, African - Americans and Hispanics, possibly due to issues surrounding access to health care, are typically diagnosed in later stages of the disease , resulting in higher use of health care services and substantially higher costs. In the next slide, we will look at possible reasons for the lower rate of diagnosis and disclosure. FACULTY GUIDE 157 SLIDE 33: Early Detection: Challenges35,36 Diagno stic uncertainty Time constraints, lack of support Communication difficulties Fear of causing emotional distress Reluctance to discuss with health care provider TALKING POINTS: There are many reasons why Alzheimer's and other dementias go undiagnosed or diagnosed but not disclosed to the patient. Diagnostic uncertainty: Health care providers frequently cite the complexity and uncertainty of the diagnosis as barriers to disclosure. Time constraints and lack of support: Disclosing a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or another dementia to a patient usually requires discussion of treatment options and support services, as well as education about the disease and what to expect. In many health care settings, providers may perceive t hey have insufficient time to properly assess and effectively communicate with the patient. However, to address this barrier, Medicare created a billing code for conducting comprehensive assessments for patients diagnosed with cognitive impairment, develop ing a care plan, and referring the patient and caregivers to community resources. 35 Alzheimer's Association.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 67, 753- 757. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6727a1 FACULTY GUIDE 158 Communication difficulties : Many providers report challenges in communication skills related to disclosing a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or other dementias. It is also important for providers to be culturally competent and aware in presenting information on Alzheimer's that is respectful of and responsive to the needs, concerns, and belief systems of diverse patient populations. Fear of causing emotional distress : One of the most common reasons family members and health care providers give for not disclosing an Alzheimer's diagnosis is fear of causing emotional distress . However, studies have found that few patients become depressed or have other long -term emotional problems be cause of the diagnosis. Reluctance to discuss with health care provider : Many people are reluctant to discuss memory or cognitive issues with their health care provider. The BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) survey found that the majorit y of people who have experienced subjective cognitive decline have not talked to their health care provider about it. [Note to Presenters: It was more common in the past for physicians to withhold a serious diagnosis from patients. For example, survey res ults published in 1961, indicated that 9 in 10 physicians said it was their usual policy to not tell patients that they had been diagnosed with cancer. Typical reasons included not causing patients unnecessary anxiety or depression, a perceived lack of effective treatments, and not wanting to take away hope.] FACULTY GUIDE 159 SLIDE 34: Early Detection: Most Want to Know37 89% of U.S. adults would want to know Of those age 60 and older, 95% would want to know 97% would want to know for family member TALKING POINTS: Despite the barriers to diagnosis, studies show that most U.S. adults would want to know if they had Alzheimer's disease. Nearly 89% of Americans say that if they were exhibiting confusion and memory loss, they would want to know if the cause of the sympto ms was Alzheimer's disease. Of those aged 60 and older, 95% say they would want to know. Over 97% say that if they had a family member exhibiting problems with memory loss, they would want them to see a doctor to determine if the cause was Alzheimer's dise ase. 37 Alzh eimer's Association.

FACULTY GUIDE 164 SLIDE 38: Safety and Quality of Care39 Workforce supply and training/development Safety of those with dementia and their caregivers Caregiver support and resources TALKING POINTS: Given the epidemic of Alzheimer's and other dementias, it is vital that health systems and communities infrastructure are equipped to serve the growing number of individuals needing care and services. A well-trained , adequate workforce is needed to enhance the safety of those with Alzheimer's and dementia and deliver high -quality care . The public health challenge is two -fold: Currently, in many communities, there is a shortage of care professional s (geriatricians, nurses, personal care attendants, home health aides, etc.) needed to provide care to people living with Alzheimer's and dementia. Workforce shortages are likely to worsen as the popula tion with Alzheimer's increases At the same time, those who work with individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias do not often have the specialized knowledge and training needed to best meet the needs of these individuals Both of these issues will impact the quality of care and safety of those with Alzheimer's. At present, many health care and other care professionals have received little formal training in Alzheimer's and other dementias. 39 Alzheimer's Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association FACULTY GUIDE 165 For example, in 2015, only 23 states required training in dementia for staff in nursing homes. A variety of stakeholders have created training opportunities in recent years, so the situation is slowly changing . Caregiver Support and Resources: Currently about 70% of pe ople with Alzheimer's and other dementias live in the community, not in a long -term care facility. Therefore, the care provided to these individuals is most often by family caregivers, followed by paid home -care staff. Both family and professional caregive rs need to understand the unique nature of Alzheimer's and how to effectively communicate with and care for an individual with cognitive impairment. Caring for a family member or friend with Alzheimer's , especially in the later stages, is a very challeng ing job . Caregivers need knowledge about the disease , changes to expect, and ways to care for a loved one over the course of the disease. The health of caregivers can be negatively impacted by the physical and emotional stress experienced in providing a high level of care for multiple years . In addition to education and training, c aregivers need community support, such as respite care (short -term care for the person with Alzheimer's) , adult day services, financial/legal planning assistance, peer support g roups, and resources that promote self -care. (Module 4 covers more information on these topics.) FACULTY GUIDE 166 SLIDE 39: Conclusion: Public Health Impact 4 key ways public health can have an impact: Surveillance/monitoring Risk reduction Early detection and diagnosis Safety and quality of care TALKING POINTS: Public health addresses Alzheimer's disease from a population perspective in four primary ways: 1. Surveillance and monitoring allows public health to compile data and use it to: Develop strategies and interventions Inform public policy Evaluate programs and policies Educate populations Guide research 2. Risk reduction Primary prevention strategies can be used to promote risk reduction for Alzheimer's and dementia , as well as to promote cognitive health in general. Public health may design and implement health education and promotion campaigns to promote brain health and risk reduction strategies, reaching wide audiences and affecting change on the popula tion level. Public health and its partners may also initiate or strengthen programs and policies aimed at risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease. Programs and policies could help ensure access to: Injury prevention resources (e.g., helmets, falls prevention assets) FACULTY GUIDE 167 Safe and accessible public spaces Health care services that improve management of cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and midlife obesity Options for help with quitting smoking, healthy eating, physical activity, and social connections 3. Early detection and diagnosis Public health may play an important role in efforts to increase early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, including: Educating the public about the warning signs of dementia (such as the \"10 Warning Signs\"), and th e benefits of early detection Identifying and promoting culturally appropriate strategies designed t o promote early detection Providing education and training to health care providers and newly diagnosed individuals, families, and caregivers 4. Safety and quality of care Alzheimer's affects individuals and their families who are often the primary caregivers throughout much of the disease progression. Public health can support individuals and their caregivers by ensuring safety and quality of care through workforce training and development and by providing information and support to caregivers . Provid ing specialized training on Alzheimer's and other dementia to prepare a health care workforce that understands and adequately meets the need s of those with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families FACULTY GUIDE 168 Provide caregivers with the training and support services needed to care for loved ones with Alzheimer's and dementia Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association FACULTY GUIDE 169 SLIDE 40: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities Dementia capable systems o Public health research and translation o Support services o Workforce training Dementia friendly communities TALKING POINTS: (See module 4 for more information) Public health also has a role to play in supporting dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities. At a larger level, states and communities can become dementia capable in accommodating the needs of a population with Alzheimer's and other deme ntias. A dementia capable system is a system or infrastructure that works to meet the needs of a people with dementia and their caregivers through providing education, support, and services. Public health can contribute to a dementia capable system throu gh: Public health research and translation Ensuring access to support services for people with dementia and their caregivers Workforce training and education Public health can also support the creation of dementia friendly communities. These are cross -sector, community- wide efforts to have support services, resources, and safe environments that allow people with dementia and their caregivers to stay connected to the community. Over time, these partnerships should: Enhance support services and reso urces Address accessibility and mobility barriers Provide dementia training for health care providers and first responders Provide a range of resources to support family caregivers such as respite care services Image source: Copyrighted image; used with permission from the Alzheimer's Association FACULTY GUIDE 170 SLIDE 41: For More Information For more information, please visit the Alzheimer's Association: http://www.alz.org CDC's Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Program: https://www.cdc.gov/aging/ TALKING POINTS: For more information on the topics covered in this presentation, please go to the Alzheimer's Association website at http://www.alz.org or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Program at https://www.cdc.gov/aging/ .

SLIDE 1: Module 4: Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities TALKING POINTS: This presentation entitled, Dementia Capable Systems and Dementia Friendly Communities , is part of a curriculum for public health students entitled, A Public Health Approach to Alzheimer's and Other Dementias . It was developed by the Emory Centers for Training and Technical Assistance for the Alzheimer's Association with funding from the Cen ters for Disease Control and Prevention. This presentation addresses the public health response to the Alzheimer's epidemic at the state and community levels and the importance of dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities . FACULTY GUIDE 181 SLIDE 2: Learning Objectives Define dementia capable system and dementia friendly community Explain how public health can contribute to dementia capable systems through support services/programs, workforce training, and dementia friendly communities List at least two services that may benefit a caregiver Identify at least three professions that would benefit from workforce training Describe at least two components of a dementia friendly community TALKING POINTS: By the end of the presentation, you will be able to: Define dementia capable system\" and \"dementia friendly community\" Explain how public health can contribute to dementia capable systems through support services/programs, workforce training, and dementi a friendly communities List at least two services that may benefit a caregiver Identify at least three professions that would benefit from workforce training Describe at least two components of a dementia friendly community FACULTY GUIDE 182 SLIDE 3: Introduction: Dementia & Alzheimer's Disease1 Dementia is a decline in mental abilit y that interferes with daily life Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia o Progressive loss of memory and brain function o Requires increasing aid and assistance o No cure and limited treatment options Huge financial and emotional burden Public health plays important role in addressing Alzheimer's disease TALKING POINTS: Before we begin discussing dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communit ies in addressing Alzheimer's disease , it may be helpful to know a little more about Alzheimer's and dementia. The term dementia is a general term for a decline in mental abilities that is severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementia, which is not a disease but a syndrome, is characterized by damage to the brain cells due to age, brain injury, other conditions or diseases, heredity, or a combination of factors. There are several types of dementia and most occur in those over 65; however, there are types of dementia that occur in those younger than 65. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease that ranges from mild to severe cognitive impairment that occurs on a continuum over the course of many years, even decades. The term 1 Alzheimer's Association. (2019) 2019 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . FACULTY GUIDE 183 Alzheimer's dementia is used to describe the stage of Alzheimer's disease when an individual has observable symptoms such as memory loss, mood/behavior changes, and difficulty with activities of daily living. There is no cure for Alzheimer's. While there are approved drug treatments , the goal of existing treatment is to delay or reduce symptoms, not to cure or reverse the course of the disease. As the person with Alzheimer's loses memory and function, caregivers , who are most often family members, are needed to provide increasing amounts of assistance. This assistance can range from helping to manage finances and household tasks to hands -on care, such as bathing, dressing, feeding, and other activities of daily living. Given th e nature of the disease and its increasing prevalence, there is a huge financial, emotional, and physical impact on people with Alzheimer's, their families, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole. Public health plays an important role in addressing Alzheimer's disease through surveillance, prevention, detection, and support of dementia -capable systems . In this presentation, we will be focusing on dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities, both of which involve government and health care agencies, organizations, and communities accommodating the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers through education, services, and support within their community. FACULTY GUIDE 184 SLIDE 4: Alzheimer's: A Large r Context2 States/communities play significant role o Assessing burden o Risk reduction o Care services: health care, support services , government agencies o Public and private resources: transportation, grocery stores, places of worship , financial institutions, l aw enforcement TALKING POINTS: Alzheimer's and other dementias affect not only the individual but also families and communities . Communities have many people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias and many others who are at risk for developing these conditions. As many as 70% of people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias live in the community, with 74% of those individuals living with a caregiver. F amily caregivers also need support . Professionals who interact with both individuals with dementia and their caregivers need training on how best to provide services and support to both . Individuals with dementia and their caregivers r ely on many care services , including health care, support services (in - home, community, and long -term care), and government agencies to meet their ongoing and changing care needs. People with Alzheimer's and other dementias also interact with and depend on community services and businesses such as transportation, grocery stores, places of worship, banks, and law enforcement. Later in the module, you will learn how a public health response to the epidemic considers the unique needs of people with dementia and their caregivers on state and local levels, within institutions, and across communities. 2 Alzheimer's Association.

The vast majority of older adults want to remain independent in their homes and in their communities for as long as possible. This means having communities prepared to meet the changing and increasing needs of older adults in terms of community resources and infrastructure, health care, and social services. Many of the issues discussed in this presentation tie into the concept of dementia friendly communities and what it means to have dementia capable systems in place that help communities be more accommo dating to people with dementia and dementia caregivers. These two frameworks aim to help communities plan for and address the challenges associated with the growing impact of dementia. While also used in other countries, in the United States, the concept of dementia friendly communit ies is intended to involve multiple sectors by 3 Turner, N., Morken, L. (2016) Better Together: A Comparative Analysis of Age- Friendly and Dementia Friendly Communities . AARP International -Research -Report.pdf Image source: Dementia Friendly America FACULTY GUIDE 187 bringing together community members and key stakeholders to enhance support and improve quality of life for all affected by dementia. The federal Administration for Community Livin g has also championed the dementia capable system framework , which may focus on a single sector or organization . Both frameworks are designed to meet the needs of the rapidly increasing population affected by dementia (including caregivers) by preparing communities, health systems, and governments . Both aim to help people living with dementia remain independent and in the community as long as possibl e. Each of these frameworks has the potential to help communities begin to address the overall needs of older adults and the unique needs of people with dementia and their caregivers. FACULTY GUIDE 188 SLIDE 7: Dementia Friendly Communities4,5 Health care, community services, resources Safe and accessible o Transportation o Mobility Respectful and supportive Public education and workforce training Technology o GPS, GIS o Registry TALKING POINTS: In the dementia friendly community framework, people with dementia, their family, and caregivers are understood, respected, supported, and able to continue to engage with and contribute to their community. The effort to become dementia friendly is made at a community level and requires pla nning and participation from all sectors with involvement of those with dementia and dementia caregivers . Although overlap exists between the concepts of dementia capable and dementia friendly , a dementia friendly community encompasses a broader goal of s upporting a higher quality of life for people with dementia beyond simply meeting their physical and health needs. In this framework, dementia friendly communit ies would have : Access to quality health care and community services .

Having this support in place within the community is referred to as having dementia capable systems . Dementia capable means being able to help people with deme ntia and their caregivers. This definition applies both to dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities. More specifically, being dementia capable means being skilled in identifying people with possible dementia and working effectively with them and their caregivers, being knowledgeable about the kinds of services needed, and being able to inform or refer to agencies and individuals that provide such services. A dementia capable system is a system that accommodates the needs of a population that, in addition to memory loss, experiences a variety of physical , cognitive , and behavior al 6 Alzheimer's Associatio n and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dementia capable systems can be implemented at different levels , such as within a care system, a business or organization, or within a community or state. The focus of dementia capable systems is often on: Increasing knowledge and skills of those who will help care for or interact with people who have dementia and their family members Addressing service gaps and specialized assistance needs Providing long term services and support systems to fulfill the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers Public health must take an active role in fostering dementia capable systems and helping to bridge the gap between the needs of individuals and caregivers and the larger establishments within states and communities that can best meet those needs.

Public health practice can actively incorporate evaluation into training and programs. P rograms (such as support programs for caregivers) can evaluate how accessible, effective, and impactful the program is for participants. Evaluation is key to creating and sustaining an effective program. The number of people with Alzheimer's is projecte d to triple in the next 35 years, with the number of caregivers also continuing to rise. As these populations grow, the workforce that provides support will also need to grow. This workforce includes professions such as: Adult day workers Community -based a nd long- term care services Social workers Occupational therapists Healthcare professionals Public health can prepare the workforce to provide support to people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers by estimating demand for different types of professiona ls and identifying gaps in workforce readiness. 9 Alzheimer's Association.

The family caregiver is part of the \"workforce\" in the sense that they have definite training needs. At the same time, they also need support thems elves as they care for someone living with dementia. Caregiving can be a rewarding experience, but also one that is high stress. As dementia progresses, caregivers often face a steep learning curve as well as the need for extra support as the person livin g with dementia needs more and more care. Part of making a dementia friendly community is putting in place supports and services for the caregiver. Let's look at the needs of the dementia caregiver. FACULTY GUIDE 217 SLIDE 28: Support Services: Caregivers18,19 Education/information/training o Alzheimer's/dementia o Behavioral management o Available resources o Self-care TALKING POINTS: When some one has Alzheimer's or dementia, family members and friends who are caregivers will face an ever - changing set of needs that increase as the disease progresses. The majority of people with Alzheimer's and dementia live in the community with many living independently until it becomes unsafe for them to continue living alone. In 2017, 16 million family members and friends provided 18.4 billion hours of unpaid care to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. It is usually a daughter or daughter -in- law who takes on the role of being the primary caregiver for the individual. As the disease progresses, the individual becomes more reliant on others for all their care needs. Many family caregivers try to meet these care needs themselves as long as possible, often reducing work hours or quitting their jobs as the level of care inc reases. Many arrange for the help of paid caregivers to provide additional assistance in the home, until the individual's care needs exceed what can safely and continuously be provided in the home. Most family caregivers are initially unprepared for the role. There is much to learn about the disease itself. At the same time, the caregiver is also taking on more of the individual's 18 ACT on Alzheimer's.

These responsibilities typically add up to the caregiver needing support services for the person living with dementia and themselves, as well as training and ongoing education. Support services and programs that have been found to be most effective for caregivers include multiple components to address different needs: Education/information/training on: o Alzheimer's and dementia and its effects on behavior throughout the continuum o Training on working with dementi a-related behaviors designed to train caregivers to use specific techniques to manage behaviors that can be challenging (such as agitation, repetition, aggression, wandering) o Information on the availability of resources o Self-care , such as stress management , using respite services FACULTY GUIDE 219 SLIDE 29: Support Services: Caregivers (continued)20,21 Counseling/support groups Case management Respite services TALKING POINTS: Support services for caregivers vary based on the individual need, but some of the most common forms of support include emotional support through individual counseling or support groups; care management to help manage the needs and coordinate care; and res pite care which provides temporary time off. Counseling/support groups : o Individual and family counseling o Support groups that have been found to have the most positive outcomes focus on specific objectives, such as teaching certain skills or strategies Care management : helping to identify and manage care needs, and coordinate across care systems and providers. Professional care managers can help alleviate some of the tasks associated with caregiving, such as managing medical appointments, securing resources and services, and finding long term care if needed Respite services : provides care for a person with Alzheimer's disease on a temporary basis, providing much -needed time off for a family caregiver 20 ACT on Alzheimer's.

Two approaches are creating dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities . The concepts are similar and can overlap, but the focus of both is on accommodating those with dementia and their caregivers through providing support and services within their communities. Public health must take an active role in fostering dementia capable systems and dementia friendly communities throu gh: Analyzing community support needs for those with dementia and their caregivers, and using those findings to design effective programs, policies, and best practices Serving to provide, inform, and connect individuals and caregivers to support services a nd programs Designing and implementing workforce training to ensure workers across a wide range of professions are able to identify and meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's and dementia Providing caregivers with the support and training they need to b etter care for the person living with dementia Supporting the creation of dementia friendly communities that help people with Alzheimer's and dementia remain safe and as independent as possible FACULTY GUIDE 221 SLIDE 31: For More Information For more information, please visit : Alzheimer's Association website at http://www.alz.org CDC's Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Program at https://www.cdc.gov/aging/ TALKING POINTS: For more information on the topics covered in this presentation, please go to the Alzheimer's Association website at http://www.alz.org or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Program at https://www.cdc.gov/aging/ .

Mrs. Williams lived on a Native American reservation in Arizona before moving in with her daughter, Delma, in Los Angeles. In many tribal communities, obtaining an Alzheimer's diagnosis is a challenge; for example, tribal communities may not have a word for dementia. Native American cultures have historically considered aging and signs of Alzheimer's (memory issues, forgetfulness, getting lost) as part of the cycle of life: people begin life as children and leave as children. Mrs. Williams' daughter did not know what Alzheimer's disease is because no one ever talked about it. Once in Los Angeles, Mrs. Williams' memory problems grew increasingly worse. Mrs. W illiams began wandering and becoming lost. During moments of lucidity, Mrs. Williams begged her daughter to return her to her home on the reservation. Eventually Delma and her family moved back to the reservation. Mrs. Williams has 13other children who liv e in that area, but Delma is the only one who cares for their mother. Delma is not sure why her siblings do not visit their mother FACULTY GUIDE 227 and their absence upsets her. Delma also feels guilty for doubting her mother when she first mentioned having memory issues. Discussion Questions: Why is cultural humility and respect important in public health? In this story, what are cultural barriers to diagnosing and understanding Alzheimer's disease? How can public health address Alzheimer's disease misinformation and stigma in a culturally competent and relevant way? What is the role of family and care in an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis? What components may be useful in creating a community outreach program for this particular community? 2.\"When Mom Has Alzheimer's: A Stranger Comes (2015). Audio/Transcript Link: Run Time: 2:44 minutes (au dio) Key Terms: caregiver burden, family, long term care, social stigma Modules: 1, 3, 4 Description: Helen was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease seven years ago and now lives with her son, Terry, and his wife, Mary. Terry and Mary have created a structured routine for Helen that involves time at the adult day center that provides socialization with other older adults, engaging activities, and care. This routine has become an important part of maintaining Helen's health and wellness. The winter holidays are coming up, and Terry and Mary must strategize about how to celebrate with family and friends withou t disrupting Helen's routine. The winter holidays are additionally stressful to families caring for members with Alzheimer's and can make caretakers feel overwhelmed. Terry and Mary must prepare visiting relatives for Helen's worsening condition. They also must mentally prepare themselves for the disappointment of fewer and fewer friends visiting to celebrate the holidays. Terry and Mary are exhausted all the time and say that they are just trying to get through Christmas now. As Helen's Alzheimer's progre sses, Terry and Mary have come to accept that their lives are very different than from seven years ago when Helen moved in, and they continue to make personal sacrifices in order to take the best possible care of Helen. For example, Terry and Mary can no longer go to all of their friends' and family's various holiday celebrations anymore, and often friends and family don't understand why. Terry and Mary have accepted they can no longer do everything FACULTY GUIDE 228 they once did during the holidays; however, they still fee l the sense of missing out and being excluded. Discussion Questions: What are ways that extended family and friends could be more inclusive and understanding of this couple's difficult situation? How can public health reduce social stigma surrounding Alzheimer's disease? What kinds of basic information about Alzheimer's should most people know? What kind of modifications can be made in the home to increase safety and independence for the individual with Alzheimer's disease? 3.\"Inside Alzheimer's: What's I t Like to Live with Early -Onset Alzheimer's Disease?

Writer Greg O'Brien was diagnosed with younger -onset Alzheimer's disease six years ago when he was 59 years old. Not only was he diagnosed with younger- onset Alzheimer's, but he was also diagnosed with stage -three prostate c ancer a few years later. Greg is a journalist and writer living in Cape Cod with his wife, Mary Catherine, and their three children. Greg began demonstrating signs of Alzheimer's dementia, such as memory loss and getting lost, as his own mother was in the end stages of Alzheimer's. Mary Catherine says that Alzheimer's changed Greg's personality in many ways. On one hand, Greg discusses certain topics with her more openly than he would have in the past, but she also has noticed that he gets angry now, somet hing he never used to do before. In the past, Greg was a loud, outgoing man who was often was at the center of discussion. Now he is quieter and more solitary, even disappearing into a different room when crowds of visitors become overwhelming for him. Gre g also used to run upwards of six miles daily as a part of his daily routine; however, he began getting lost and switched to running in a gym. FACULTY GUIDE 229 Greg's personality is not the only thing that has changed since his younger - onset Alzheimer's diagnosis. Greg's appetite and sense of taste and smell have declined. Greg says that food now often tastes the same, like \"rolled up newspaper.\" Greg does buy fr ozen fruit bars and states that although they have no taste, they do feel cold, which is a different and enjoyable sensation. As Greg's Alzheimer's has progressed over the past six years, so have his hallucinations. Hallucinations are a rarely discussed aspect of Alzheimer's but can often accompany memory loss. According to Greg's doctors, these hallucinations are due to the changes in his brain as a result of the disease. Mary Catherine's and Greg's outlook on life has also changed over time. For examp le, Mary Catherine says that she no longer can get impatient, which is difficult, but important. In the beginning of his diagnosis, Greg used to get very angry, but now he no longer does as he tries to focus on the moment instead of the past or future. Ma ry Catherine believes their marriage has gotten even stronger. Because of Greg's Alzheimer's, Greg and Mary Catherine have had to make many difficult decisions, including deciding to sell their house that Greg built, where they raised their three children and planned to grow old together. Growing old in that house together is no longer a realistic possibility. Greg, Mary Catherine, and his physician have discussed \"exit strategies\" for Greg while he is still aware and able to make these types of decisions. One of these exit strategies includes not treating his stage three prostate cancer. Greg's physician says that not treating the prostate cancer will most likely shorten his life, but Greg is okay with this because he would rather his life be shortened by the prostate cancer than by Alzheimer's. Greg states that he is most afraid of the \"in -between.\" He loves living and he is not afraid to die, but he fears the middle portion, the loss of identity and independence, and dreads his family's suffering as they watch his slow decline. Discussion Questions: Why is it important that individuals with Alzheimer's disease are diagnosed early? In what ways can Greg can maintain his independence as his Alzheimer's progresses? Discuss the importance of end of life pla nning and role of public health in encouraging people to make plans. Discuss the importance of a strong social network and family support. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of deciding not to treat stage -three prostate cancer as Alzheimer's progress es.

Audio/Transcript Link: http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?s (audio) Key Terms: care givers burden, financial burden, healthcare system, family support, technology, monitoring systems, long term care Modules: 2, 3, 4 Description: Aurora is 78 years old and lives with her husband, Arturo, in a small apartment in San Rafael. Aurora's daughter, Maria, comes by their apartment almost daily to help her mother bathe, grocery shop, do laundry, provide medical care, and do many other tasks around the house to help her father and care for her mother. Early in her Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, Aurora began wandering at night. Afraid that she might wander into the street, Arturo, began sleeping on the floor in front of the bedroom door in or der to keep Aurora from leaving the apartment. Maria had the idea of attaching wind chimes to the door so that Arturo can hear when the door is opened and closed. Maria and Arturo are currently able to provide all the necessary care for Aurora to live saf ely in her own home. However, caring for people living with Alzheimer's tends to be mentally and financially exhausting. As Aurora's Alzheimer's progresses, her safety in the apartment becomes an increasing concern. The story discusses ways that technolog y, such as remote sensor monitoring systems, can help people with dementia stay independent longer while giving caregivers a way to monitor activity and safety. Discussion Questions: What are some technologies available to help monitor the health of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease? What are ethical dilemmas about these kinds of technologies that may be considered invasive of an individual's privacy and health? What are other ideas for technology that will allow for increased safety and prolonged independence of older adults with Alzheimer's disease?

Video Link https://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/11/world/europe/wus - holland -dementia -village/index.html Run Time: 3:27 minutes (accompanying news article included in link) Key Terms: long term care, stigma, financial burden, caregiver burden, community, cultural context, increasing aging population, healthcare system, health policy Modules: 4 Description: Hogewey, or \"Dementia Village\" as it is known, is a facility created in 2009 in Weesp, Netherlands that is home to 152 residents with dementia. The village is comprised of dormitories uniquely decorated like patients' homes, a grocery store, restaurants, t heater, salon, courtyards, and gardens for residents to enjoy. There is only one exit at the facility, which allows the many skilled caretakers to come and go while the residents are free to wander safely inside the village. The creator of the nursing home , Yvonne van Amerongen, has taken considerable time to create a space unique to each resident that reminds of them of their early life. While this facility seems ideal to many, some question the ethics of creating a \"fake\" reality or \"duping\" the resident s. For example, residents can go to the supermarket and not worry about paying. The staff will take care of payment later, without including and potentially confusing the resident. Yvonne defends the model of care, explaining that the facility is the true reality of the residents and provides them peace of mind. Additionally, this facility costs the same amount of money as any other nursing home in the Netherlands due to the state health care system that all residents pay into and covers expenses such as t his as individuals' age. Discussion Q uestions: What are the pros and cons of living in a community like this? Discuss the criticism that Hogewey is \"duping\" the residents. Could you see this model of care being implemented in the US? Why or why not? How can a community like Hogewey impact the family of residents? What would you change (or not change) about Hogewey?

Yvonne Russell, a recreation therapist discusses how music has positively impacted one of her patients, Henry. Henry has been in a nursing home for ten years after he began having seizures and his wife was no longer able to care for him at home. His daughter recalls how her father was always singing and dancing when she was a child. At the nur sing home, Henry is typically unresponsive and spends most of the day looking down sitting in his chair, unable to carry on a conversation or speak more than a few words. After learning about his love of music, Yvonne had all of Henry's favorite songs down loaded on to an iPod. When she puts the headphones on Henry and plays the music, he immediately sits up, eyes go wide and begins to sing along and dance in his chair. After listening to the music, Henry is asked a series of questions and is able to respond quicker and with more detail than usual. He recalls the name of his favorite singer and even sings his favorite song. Discussion Questions: How did music impact Henry? Discuss ways that caregivers and care facilities can better engage individuals with Alzheimer's.

Video Link: https://vimeo.com/314071595 FACULTY GUIDE 234 Run Time: 5:30 minutes Key Terms: American Indian, Native Alaskan, oral tradition, memory loss, research, diversity Module: 3, 4 Description: Becky Bendixon talks about her mother's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Becky first noticed that her mother was experiencing some memory loss wh en she struggled to fill out a form with her basic information. She then realized that something was seriously wrong when her mother's pharmacy called because her mother was having issues remembering to take her medications, putting her life in danger. Bec ky describes the importance of oral tradition in her culture and how memory loss due to Alzheimer's prevents generations from passing down these oral traditions, resulting in a loss of culture and identity of the community. Researchers at the University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease Research Center discuss their goal of increasing representation of American Indian and Alaska Native populations in their research. Discussion Questions: Why is cultural humility and respect important in public health? Why is diversity of participants important in Alzheimer's disease research? How might Becky's community and culture change if Alzheimer's disease becomes more prevalent? The following case studies (10 -14) are pulled directly from the Health Brain Initiative 2018 - 2023 Road Map, which was developed by the Alzheimer's Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to advance cognitive health as an integr al component of public health.

These efforts support implementation of the Washington State Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias regarding culturally -appropriate strategies to educate the public about reducing risk for cognitive decline and possibly dementia. DOH prioritized African American women as a main audience for cognitive health education based on national prevalence data. DOH then reviewed evidence - based, brain health messages developed by the Alzheimer's Association for the Healthy Brain Initiative. After securing approval from Washington's state health officer, DOH partnered with the Seattle based, nonprofit Center for MultiCultural Health (CMCH) to help tailor and disseminate brain health messages to African American audiences. CMCH identified African American churches as a promising venue to rea ch women and recommended creating hand fans printed with culturally -tailored messages. Additionally, the National Asian Pacific Center on Aging (NAPCA) and the University of Washington Healthy Brain Research Network (UW -HBRN) partnered to conduct outreach and education for Seattle AAPIs. Through six focus groups, they solicited input from local Chinese and Japanese adults with at least one living relative age 65 or over. The focus groups assessed the acceptability of messages developed by the University of Pennsylvania HBRN Center to encourage non-Hispanic white or African American urban adults concerned about the cognitive health of an older relative to accompany that relative to an appointment with a healthcare provider. NAPCA and UW -HBRN released two brie fs on their findings: Connecting with AAPIs about Dementia: An Action Guide for Service Providers and Connecting with AAPIs about Dementia: An Action Guide for Policymakers. Each offers dementia resources and information on treatment options. The importanc e of early detection of cognitive impairment is emphasized in the guide for service providers, as these professionals play a crucial role in facilitating older AAPIs' and their caregivers' access to cognitive assessment resources. The Dementia Action Collaborative provided guidance on the action briefs and also helped to disseminate FACULTY GUIDE 236 them. UW -HBRN received a 2017 Seattle Innovation Fund grant for its work on the AAPI action briefs. If you would like to learn more about this case study, a supplemental video h as been provided to illustrate public health in action. Discussion Questions: Why is cultural humility and respect important in public health? How did the Washington DOH address Alzheimer's disease in a culturally competent and relevant way? What stakeholders did the Washington DOH involve in this two -part initiative? How do these efforts align with the Health Brain Initiative Road Map goals? 11.\"Improving Early Detection during Medicare Annual Wellness Visits,\" Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map: Ut ah Key Terms: early detection, cognitive impairment, screening, providers, assessment tools Modules: 3, 4 Supplemental Video: start at 33:00 minutes and end at 47:20 minutes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_sQ4arm8UU&index=19&t=0s&list=PLb1 5WDa0LdCYxu4ZX9pISVFCtNCxxrpnU Supplemental summary.pdf Description: Utah is one of the most rural and fastest growing states in America. Currently, about 11% of the state's three million residents is aged 65 or older, and the state has about 30,000 people with Alzheimer's dementia, which is expected to rise 40% to 42,000 by 2025. Diagnoses of dementia in later stages may lead to higher levels of disability while receiving care, delays in accessing timely primary care, lack of care coordination, and duplication of services. To improve early detection of cognitive impairment, a focus of Utah's State Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias , the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) contracted with HealthInsi ght, a quality improvement organization. HealthInsight interviewed providers about their experiences and processes conducting cognitive assessments during the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV). While some providers reported performing routine cognitive assessments during the AWV, others reported screening only under certain conditions, such as when patients FACULTY GUIDE 237 request assessment or when patients have specific risk factors for cognitive decline, etc. Providers also expressed a need for better tools to detect early stage memory loss. The resulting report, Cognitive Assessments during Medicare Annual Wellness Visits, was a collaborative product from HealthInsight; UDOH; the Center for Alzheimer's Care, Imaging and Research at the University of Utah; and Intermo untain Medical Center. Actions in the Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map include improving healthcare providers' ability to recognize the early warning signs of dementia and knowledge of validated cognitive assessment tools. As a step in this process, UDOH sent the study report to all Utah primary care physicians, along with a list of resources for people with cognitive impairment and a recommendation from UDOH's executive director for routine cognitive assessment during the AWV using the Mini -Cog as the pr imary assessment tool, followed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA). The project deepened UDOH's understanding of some challenges that physicians face in assessing cognition during the AWV, one of which is uncertainty about which validated to ol to use. Receiving clear recommendations from UDOH's executive director may begin increasing physician use of the tools during AWVs or other occasions in which a physician has concerns about potential cognitive impairment. Use of validated early detectio n tools helps physicians assess cognitive functioning and detect potential concerns early, the first step in increasing early diagnoses. With some legislative support, UDOH plans to continue collaborating with HealthInsight to develop: Cognitive assessment training for primary care physicians and their office staff that will include use of recommended tools and workflow improvement techniques to instill a reliable, repeatable process in clinics; and Cognitive health and wellness toolkit to help health professionals navigate the cognitive assessment process, including assessment, diagnosis, referrals, and community resources. Discussion Questions: What stakeholders did the Utah DOH involve in this initiative? Why is early detection of cog nitive impairment important? Describe some of the barriers to early detection of cognitive impairment and the recommendations that came from this evaluation to overcome those barriers. Why is it important that public health professionals conduct evaluati ons like this? How does this study align with the Health Brain Initiative Road Map goals? FACULTY GUIDE 238 12.\"Preparing First Responders for Interactions with People with Dementia,\" Healthy Brain Initiative: Colorado Key Terms: EMS, healthcare system, stigma, first respond ers, increasing aging population, community outreach, training, education, cultural context Modules: 3, 4 Supplemental Materials: https://www.alz.org/media/Documents/case -study-co- ems-training.pdf executive -summary.pdf Description: Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers receive many calls to assist people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. However, they often have little or no formal training to prepare them for the unique physical, behavioral, and communication challenges rela ted to dementia. To develop a dementia -competent workforce throughout Colorado, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE) partnered with the Alzheimer's Association Colorado Chapter to deliver its Approaching Alzheimer's: First Responder Training Program . CDPHE marketed the availability of the free, in - person training through its internal networks and all 11 of Colorado's Regional Emergency and Trauma Advisory Councils. The training helps first responders serve people with Alzhe imer's in situations involving wandering, disasters or other emergency situations, abuse or neglect, \"shoplifting\" because they forgot to pay, and driving. At the completion of training, participants receive a poster\u2014 Tips for EMS Working with People with A lzheimer's\u2014 to display and reinforce effective responses. See the supplemental material link to learn more about this example of public health workforce education. Discussion Questions: Why is it important that EMS providers have formal training on assis ting people with Alzheimer's and other dementias? What other professionals or community members may benefit from this formal training? Discuss the ways that public health providers can expand upon or improve this program. FACULTY GUIDE 239 Review the Tips for EMS working wi th people with Alzheimer's listed in the supplemental material and discuss the \"do's\" and \"don'ts\" of interacting with someone with Alzheimer's disease.

One component was a collaborative educational initiative called Un caf\u00e9 por el Alzheimer . With special attention toward decreasing stigma, this initiative used social media and in -person gatherings to support informal but structured conversations with experts about Alzheimer's disease, risk factors, diagnosis, pharmacological and non - pharmacological treatments, management of behavioral changes, and healthy living. The Alzheimer's caf\u00e9s enabled participants to have informal conversations in coffee shops across the island. Parti cipants could raise questions at any time and were encouraged to share testimonials and comments. At the end of the gatherings, the participants were invited to continue the conversation online by following the Facebook page. These social media efforts rei nforced key messages and helped engage and educate the wider audience. Pre/post surveys in four sessions with a total of 212 participants showed improved knowledge and high satisfaction ratings. All participants said they learned something new from the pr ogram, and 80% said most of the information presented was new to them. A total of 250 messages were posted on the Un caf\u00e9 por el Alzheimer community Facebook page over a seven -month period. An average increase of nearly 65% in the number of people reached by the Facebook page offered evidence of the program's success in helping participants remain actively engaged while fostering social support and reducing stigmas and myths surrounding the disease. FACULTY GUIDE 240 Discussion Questions: How did public health professionals help to reduce social stigma surrounding Alzheimer's disease? Why do you think this educational initiative was successful? How could this model be implemented in your community? What would you change or keep the same? How does this initiative align with the Health Brain Initiative Road Map goals? 14.\"Encouraging Advance Care Planning for People with Dementia,\" Healthy Brain Initiative: Maryland Key Terms: increasing prevalence, increasing aging population, family support, caregiver burden, policy, healthcare, advance directive, end of life decisions, education, community outreach, long term care Modules: 2, 3, 4 Supplemental materials: Healthy Brain Initiative Roadmap o https://www.alz.org/media/Documents/healthy people with Alzheimer's dementia is projected to rise\u2014from 110,000 people in 2018 to 130,000 in 2025, an 18% increase in eight years. As the number of people with dementia rises, so too does the need to assist families in planning for future care needs. The passage of Maryland House Bill 1385 in May 2016 aimed to increase advance care planning among families impacted by dementia. Among other mandates, the law directs the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) to encourage the use of el ectronic advance directives, develop an electronic platform to connect with healthcare providers at point- of-care using the state -designated health information exchange, and conduct outreach to increase public awareness of the Advance Directive Program. An early assessment found that advance care planning in Maryland is offered primarily through hospitals and hospice providers, with limited free care planning services available through Maryland Legal Aid and Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Service Pro Bono Resou rce Centers. To increase advance care planning, MDH collaborated with the Maryland Faith Health Network to lead a year- long series of community engagement activities on electronic advance directives. More than 500 Marylanders learned about advance care planning through health fairs, faith -based events, and end- of-life seminars. In FACULTY GUIDE 241 addition, three local health improvement coalitions hosted seven advance -planning educational sessions, with a combined total of 144 participants. More than twice as many participants were able to identify core legal and financial advance planning documents post- session (25%) as pre -session (10%). Also, a greater number of participants (post -session compared with pre -session) reported understanding the importance of involving people with cognitive impairment in advance planning. The medical director of the MDH Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control served as a co -chair (along with a representative from the Maryland Department of Aging) of the governor -appointed Virginia I. Jones Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Council during this time. The Council monitors implementation of the Maryland State Plan on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders . As a tenet of the Maryland State Plan, MDH used this unique opportuni ty to engage partners to discuss potential cognitive health education and establish interventions in Maryland's public health programming. Discussion Questions: Why is it important for an individual diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease to have an advance di rective? What challenges may arise if an individual with Alzheimer's disease does not have an advanced directive? Consider the different perspectives of the individual, family, and medical providers. Discuss the different levels of action taken to promote the use of advance directives among persons with dementia. Who were the key players or stakeholders?

The village is comprised of dormitories uniquely decorated like patient's' homes, a grocery store, restaurant s, theater, salon, courtyards, and gardens for residents to enjoy. There is only one exit at the facility, which allows the many skilled caretakers to come and go while the residents are free to wander safely inside the village. The creator of the nursing home, Yvonne van Amerongen, has taken considerable time to create a space unique to each resident that reminds of them of their early life. While this facility seems ideal to many, some question the ethics of creating a \"fake\" reality or \"duping\" the resid ents. For example, residents can go to the supermarket and not worry about paying. The staff will take care of payment later, without including and potentially confusing the resident. Yvonne defends the model of care, explaining that the facility is the tr ue reality of the residents and provides them peace of mind. Additionally, this facility costs the same amount of money as any other nursing home in the Netherlands due to the state health care system that all residents pay into and covers expenses such as this as individuals' age. 10. \"Diagnosing Alzheimer's: The Case for Public Health Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_sQ4arm8UU&index=19&t=0s&list=PLb1 5WDa0LdCYxu4ZX9pISVFCtNCxxrpnU Run Time: minutes Key Terms: early education, public health Modules: 2, 3 Description: This webinar explains why early diagnosis of Alzheime r's and other dementias is a public health priority.

FACULTY GUIDE 256 Additional Learning Activities The following suggestions are additional learning activities that can be used to increase student interaction and engagement with the, A Public Health Approach to Alzheimer's and Other Dementias curriculum. Revers e Classroom Approach The r everse classroom, also known as the flipped classroom, is an approach that provides students with instructional materials to review outside of the classroom and encourages assignments that mirror homework to be used during the des ignated instructional time. Examples of incorporating this approach are as follows: Think, Pair, and Share. Assign students to review the curriculum, video, case study, or related assignment and propose a question about the material at the start of the next class. Students will first think quietly for a minute or two to collect their thoughts and questions about the material. Next, students will pair up and discuss their thoughts with a partner or small group. Finally, each pair will briefly share their discussion with the class. This activity can be used at the start of class to help students review any assignments. Alternatively, this activity can also be used at the end of class to help students reflect on the day's teachings . Mini Curriculum. Divide the class into four groups and have each group present one module to the class. Ask students to create a \"mini curriculum\" to teac h their peers about Alzheimer's disease and the role public health and related disciplines plays. This assignment is meant to be creative and allow s students to use any platform they think would work best for their peers to learn the material by using video, lecture, handout, games, or discussion . This may also provide insight into your students' preferred learning style. Reflectio n Paper . Reflection papers allow students not only to reflect on the curriculum, but also on the larger effect Alzheimer's and other dementias have on society. Students will review a module, case study, or video as assigned and then write a reflection pape r that will be used to guide discussion during the next c lass. These reflections should ask students to critical ly think about the topic at hand, but do not ne ed to be a specific length. This activity may also be done during class time by setting a 5-minut e timer and ask ing students to write down their reflections from the class that day. FACULTY GUIDE 257 Learning Lab A learning lab instructional approach is participatory and results -oriented with the sole objective of students working together to innovatively solve an issue or public health challenge. In each activity, students are tasked with thinking through various potential actions to solve the challenges raised using a public hea lth lens. Examples of incorporating this approach are as follows: Assistive Technology. Break the class into groups and ask them to come up with an innovative assistive technology or monitoring system to support individuals living with dementia and their caregivers. This is meant to be a creative project and students do not have to produce an actual product; however, students should demonstrate their knowledge of the behavioral and physical changes associated with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Policy B rief. Ask students to write a one -page policy brief and present it to the class. Using what they have learned from the curriculum, videos, and case studies , students should be able to identify a need of someone living with dementia or their caregiver that can affect policy change. The policy brief should include the follo wing sections: title, summary, scope of problem, policy alternatives, policy recommendations, and sources. Students should also have a specific audience in mind for the policy brief, such a s a Member of Congress. This activity can be done by an individual or group. What's Happening in the N ews? Ask students to find a recent scholarly article or news article related to Alzheimer's . Students may find articles related to prevention, clinical t rials, intervention s, or other related topics and be prepared to briefly explain them to the class. The purpose of this activity is to expose students to the current state of Alzheimer's research and to learn more about public health and related discipline s in action. Helpful resources may include the N ational Institutes of Health , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alzheimer's Association, credible newspapers, scholarly articles, and research happening at your own university. Case Study S tations: This activity allows students to get up and move around the class as they visit different case studies placed around the room. It is suggested that you use the My Typical Day case studies (available at http://www.mytypicalday.org/ ) for this activity, but feel free to use any examples from the provided case studies in the curriculum. Print a copy of each case study you have selected (as many as appropriate for your class size) and place them around the classroom. Students will then break into small groups and rotate around the room to read and discuss each case study. Students should discuss each case both from the perspective of the individual, but also the caregiver and others involved if applicable. Prompts for the students are listed below . o In what ways has life changed since their diagnosis? FACULTY GUIDE 258 o How have they reacted to their diagnosis? Positively? Negatively? o How have they adapted their everyday routine? o What support do they have? o What changes have they noticed? o What role do their family and friends play? Dementia Friendly C ommunities . The sources below provide visual images and key takeaways on how communities can be dementia fri endly. After reviewing the example images as a class , students will be asked to draw their own community and identify ways in which their community is dementia friendly and ways their community could improve. Students may choose the town or city where the university is located or even their own hometown if they would like to offer a different example to the class. If you would like to make this a group activity, project a map of your university on a chalkboard or whiteboard and have students dr aw directly on it during class time. o Fostering Dementia Friendlin ess : https://www.dfamerica.org/communities - overview o Building Dementia -Friendly A Priority for Everyone: https://dementiapartnerships.com/resource/building Dementia Friendly Community Toolkit: https://www.actonalz.org/dementia - friendly -toolkit Guest Speakers Pairing the curriculum with guest speakers is an instructional approach that allows students to learn from th e experiences of people who have been affected by Alzheimer's and other dementias or work in a related field. Examples of guest speakers include: Caregivers of someone with dementia. An individual with early stage dementia. Local Alzheimer's Association chapter. Nonprofit organization working on issues related to dementia. A local department of public health, another government agency, or a community - based group such as an Area Agency on Aging. Nurses, doctors, social workers, and other professionals who work with individuals with dementia . Faculty and staff at your university who are conducting related research. FACULTY GUIDE 259 Test Your Knowledge Quiz the class using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). The ADKS contains 30 true or false items to assess their knowledge about Alzheimer's dis ease. The scale addresses topics such as risk factors, assessment and diagnosis, symptoms, course, life impact, caregiving, treatment, and management. This is a quick way to gauge what the students have learned, without creating a formal exam. Students can take the quiz independently (5 to 10 minutes) and then review the answers as a class. The ADKS and answers to each question can be found at the Resources for the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale website using this link: https://pages.wustl.edu/geropsychology/adks FACULTY GUIDE 260 References ACT on Alzheimer's.
