He further states that the use of energy medicine may be used to help heal illness, sickness and disease where conventional medicine may not succeed. Treat a person using pure energy healing Dr Richard Gerber in his best-selling book \"Vibrational Medicine\" explains that \"instead of conventional drug and surgical approaches, vibrational medicine attempts treat a person using pure energy healing. This theoretical perspective is based on the understanding that the molecular arrangement of the physical body is actually a complex network of interweaving energy fields. My wife applied bio energy healing therapy From my own experience, over the past 30 years I have attended for various forms of therapy for different ailments. I slipped on a copper pipe which a plumber had been cutting and fell on my back on top of a heavy transformer. The pain from this was excruciating all across my lower back. My wife who is a bio energy healing therapist applied bio energy as I lay on the floor in great pain. Slowly but surely the pain began to ease and eventually dissipated, and after about 45 minutes I could stand up and walk around again. Energy healing eased the pain On another occasion, I was involved in a car accident when my car hit an embankment near our home and turned over on its side on the roadway. I injured two fingers on my left hand. Again, my wife came to my rescue and bandaged up my two injured fingers using 4 lollipop sticks as splints. She immediately started to apply energy healing to my hand and fingers. This eased the pain to such an extent; that I did not require any medical intervention. She applied energy healing therapy each day for about a week and finally I could remove the bandages and thankfully my hand and fingers were okay again. During my own training in bio energy healing many years ago, at the famous Zdenko Domancic Bio Energy Clinic in Slovenia, where I attended four times and worked for a short period, I witnessed at first sight the transformational changes that took place as bio energy healing was applied to patients.

Bio energy can be integrated with convention medicine We have been operating the Oisin Healing Centre, in Ireland where clients have attended for a wide range of health issues. We also provide holistic, online, training courses in bio energy healing and sound healing. In our own opinion bio energy is a profound, powerful and effective healing modality which works on every level of the energy field; physical, emotional, mental and spiritual as a stand-alone therapy or can be integrated with convention medicine in the ever-expanding area of complementary medicine.
