We still believe that 'the technological achievements of medical science mean that doctors can do more than ever before to restore health by replacing or repairing worn-out or damaged joints and heart valves and even transplanting kidneys and other organs' . In these Post-Modern times, however, there is perhaps less confidence in the absolute power of science and a turning towards other methods, either as an alternative to conventional medicine or to run alongside it (hence 'complementary therapies'). Unorthodoxy to convention In 1982, Prince Charles, who is a strong advocate of alternative medicine and has a multi-faith approach to belief, told a meeting of the British Medical Association (BMA) that 'today's unorthodoxy is probably tomorrow's convention'. The following year, the BMA set up a scientific committee 'to consider the feasibility and possible methods of assessing the value of alternative therapies, whether used alone or to complement other treatments'. The report identified the following reasons for the popularity of these therapies: (a) alternative practitioners are able to offer patients more time (b) practitioners are more compassionate and concerned, caring for whole person (c) use of touch (d) the sense of benefiting from a powerful healing force, 'magical' qualities of therapists My personal feeling is that many of these therapies work and produce an effect in the patient, often creating an intense loyalty to the particular therapy. Many therapies appear to be very attractive, especially as they take regard of the whole person. I suspect, but cannot prove, that once initial problems are solved, new problems (emotional and spiritual as well as physical) may emerge. I wonder if using complementary therapies opens a small door to the occult, through which many ills can come, for example fear, unbelief (in God), difficulty in responding to the Holy Spirit, etc. Origins Some of the 'new' therapies are extremely ancient in origin, many from faiths and belief systems other than the Christian faith. Some are explicitly anti-church - for example, a global New Age meditation event in 1992 which had as its object 'to close the old door of the church's spiritual power and to open a new door for ancient powers'. Since many therapies have their roots in ancient religions or have been created by those who follow practices such as freemasonry (e.g. homeopathy), is it possible that Christians may unwittingly be participating in worship of 'foreign gods'. Do they perhaps put themselves in a dangerous position spiritually, since God has said that he will have not other gods beside him? Or could it be the case that some Christians are more susceptible to unhelpful spiritual influences than others and therefore have to be more careful? (Like 'food offered to idols'?) For Christians who do believe in alternative medicine, challenging their beliefs will provoke a big reaction. Perhaps this is another indication of their power. A rough guide Many of these therapies have now become 'mainstream' exactly as Prince Charles predicted. There are a huge number of alternative therapies which are prevalent at the moment. I've tried to research the ones most often seen by using a collection of leaflets and books such as the [Reader's Digest Guide to Alternative Medicine](http://www.amazon.co.uk/-Reader-s-Digest-Family-Guide-Alternative-Medicine/dp/0276420101/ref=sr_11_1/026-3950863-6224469?ie=UTF8). They are listed in alphabetical order. Unfortunately, the information available is not always clear and straightforward! - ACUPUNCTURE (healing system) Ancient Chinese therapy (practised for at least 3,500 years, introduced to Europe by Dutch physician Willem Ten Rhyne in 1683), uses needles - stuck into the patient's skin at particular points, believed to lie along invisible energy channels called 'meridians'. The needles are said to block, increase or decrease a flow of energy ('Qi) through the meridians Introduced by F.M. Alexander (1969-1955). Patients, referred to as 'pupils' are taught how to improve posture so body is able to work in a more natural, relaxed and efficient manner. Said to promote harmonious state of mind and body and help with various medical conditions - AROMATHERAPY (complementary therapy) Treats illness with highly concentrated oils extracted from plants. Used in various ways: massage, inhled, added to baths, used for compresses, sometimes swallowed. Some have proven antiseptic qualities, others said to effective against infection Source is unknown but Chinese, Persians Greeks and Romans all appear to have had knowledge of medical use of plant oils, first recorded use in UK 13th century. - AURA DIAGNOSIS (diagnostic system) 'Aura' described as a the body's 'energy field' a magnetic field around the body which is in contact with a universal field of spiritual energy. Many practitioners claim to be able to see auras in areas of light around their patients and use them to aid treatment. - AYURVEDIC MEDICINE (healing system) Traditional system of Indian medicine, which aims to prevent illness. It is a holistic system and the patient keeps in close touch with the therapist. Three forces (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) are thought to control physical and mental processes and need to be kept in balance. Therapists use a variety of methods: conventional surgery, plant-based drugs and mineral supplements. - CHAKRA BALANCING (diagnostic system) (see Aura Diagnosis and Crystal Healing) Chakras are 'energy vortexes that exist within the aura'- there are thought to be seven charkas running down the centre of the body. This therapy, based on an Indian system of healing uses aromatherapy, and touch to 'cleanse' the auras. Visualisation and breathing techniques may be used also. [note the claim that this 'encourages spiritual growth] - CRYSTAL HEALING (healing system) (see Aura Diagnosis) Crystals are used to effect changes in the body's energy field (aura). Stones and crystals are laid on and around the body. Therapists uses machines to monitor changes in patients' physical and mental states. It can be used to train patients to alter their response, sometimes in combination with visualisation, meditation and breathing. - BREATHING AND RELAXATION EXCERCISES (self help) Patients can learn techniques to control breathing and voluntarily relax muscle groups in order to alleviate stress. [Useful book: Jane Madder 'Stress and Relaxation'] See also Yoga, below. - CHIROPRACTIC (healing system) Invented by a 'magnetic healer' Daniel David Palmer in 1895. Relieves pain by manipulating joints. Particularly corrects disorders of the spine. Uses conventional means such as X-Rays for diagnosis. A Chinese system of healing physical spaces, such as the home to bring good luck by increasing energy flow in buildings - HAIR ANALYSIS (diagnostic system) Laboratory tests on a lock of hair are used to detect whether the body contains any harmful mineral imbalances. - HERBAL MEDICINE (healing system) The usual form of medical treatment until the 18th century. Most of current knowledge can be traced back to ancient Egyptians. Ancient Greeks and Romans used herbal medicine. Forms a key part of Indian Ayurvedic medicine and also important in Chinese medicine. Many drugs currently in use are based on the use of herbs. - HOMEOPATHY (healing system) Homeopathy means 'like disease'. First proposed by German physician Samuel Hahnemann. Aims to treat the whole person. Illness is seen as a sign of disharmony or inner balance. Homeopaths aim to resolve underlying problems rather than just deal with particular symptoms. Plant, mineral and animal substances are used to make homeopathic medicines which are then diluted progressively, many times over. It is believed that the medicines become more powerful with each dilution. A typical power of solution is 1 to 1,000,000,000,000. [so a very tiny amount remains in the final medicine - where then does the 'power' come from?] - HYDROTHERAPY (complementary therapy) Use of spas, hot or cold baths, vapour baths, hot and cold compresses, showers, foot baths, whirlpools, underwater massage, water-births. Use to cure ailments and to relieve stress. - IRIDOLOGY (diagnostic system) Diagnoses problems in the body and the mind by studying markings on the irises of the eye and observing changes in them. Began with Hungarian doctor Ignatz von Peczely 1881. - KINEISOLOGY (healing system) Developed in 1964 by American chiropractor George Goodheart. Belief that muscles are linked to other parts of the body -organs, digestive system, glands, bones and circulation. Practitioners look for imbalances or deficiencies in nutrition and energy or locate physical problems, then try to revitalise them by giving light massage to 'pressure points on body and scalp' which may be some distance from the muscles they relate to. This is said to affect the 'energy flow' in the body. - MASSAGE (complementary therapy) Practised in Middle and Far East from at least 3000 BC. Most common use is to relax body and mind, aims to improve blood, muscular and nervous systems and to help the body get rid of waste products, may be used for pain relief. Has been practised by Christian religious orders. Has been practised in India and much of the rest of Asia for thousands of years. Yoga developed from it. Mantras may be used for meditation (as advocated by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi). Meditation is seen as a way of reaching a tranquil state that refreshes the mind and relaxes the body. - NATUROPATY(healing system) Concentrates on helping the body to cure itself using various therapies including: chiropractic, diets and dieting, exercise, hydrotherapy, massage, osteopathy, relaxation and breathing and yoga. Holistic approach to patient. - OSTEOPATHY (healing system) Founded by an American doctor, Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917). Osteopathy aims to diagnose and treat mechanical problems in the framework of bones joints, muscles and ligaments. Osteopaths use their hands for massaging and manipulating the framework to restore normal function. - REFLEXOLOGY(healing system) By massaging 'reflex areas' found in the feed, reflexologists treat diseases in parts of the body they claim to be related to those areas. It is thought that illness occurs when 'energy channels' in the body are blocked, causing damage to one area or the other. It is said to have originated in China some 5,000 years ago. It has links with acupuncture, acupressure and shiatsu massage. Developed by Mikao Usui in Japan in early 20th century. 'Reiki' means universal energy (Japanese). [the energy referred to as 'ki' in Japan 'chi' in China and 'prana' in India. Links with acupuncture, tai chi and yoga. The practitioner places their hands on or over the body and the recipient 'draws in as much energy as is needed' (see Native English Shamanism and Majik leaflet) This appears to use meditation amongst other tools for 'healing empowerment, protection and healing'. Shamans exist in a variety of traditions. [This involves pagan practices (witchcraft?), and declares itself to be completely 'heathen'.] 'Shiatsu' means finger pressure (Japanese) although more than the fingers are used. It uses pressure pints along the body's meridians to stimulate the flow to the Qi (life force) through the paths (see Acupuncture, above) - SPECIAL DIETS (self help) Alternative practitioners consider diet to be one of the most important factors in health and disease. Examples of specialist diets include fasting, raw food diets, macrobiotics, Hay diet, low fat diets, salt-free diets. - SPIRITUAL HEALING (complementary therapy) A wholistic approach helping the person to return to 'wholeness of being' - harmony of body, mind and spirit. By prayer and meditation healers channel divine healing energies which are said to change the patient's personal life force for the better. [This is not exclusively a Christian practice, so the source of the 'divine healing' needs to be questioned.] A series of slow-moving, circular, dance-like movements best performed in the open air. Based on the belief that following emotional and or mental disturbance, illness stems from imbalances of energy (Qi) in the body (see Acupuncture). - VISUALISATION (self help) Patients are taught imaginative techniques to benefit their health to help natural healing processes and to reinforce positive feelings, behaviour and images of themselves. Used by shamans in Africa and South America since ancient times. Always formed a part of medical treatment until the birth of modern science in the 17th century, when body and mind began to be seen as more separate. An extremely ancient system which has had a wide-ranging influence on Indian culture. Used in Ayurvedic medicine (see above). For many centuries the full practice of yoga was restricted to a small elite, to philosophers and meditators who lived apart from the world (yogis). The word 'yoga' is Sanskrit for 'yoke' or 'union' and is a system of spiritual, mental and physical training. [I suspect that Christians who use yoga choose to ignore the spiritual element.] There are four systems Hatha (physical) Raja (focussing on mind control) Karma (moral action) Batkti (devotional). Postures are designed to develop flexibility and controlled relaxation. Breathing plays an important part in yoga - breath embodies the individual's 'prana' or life "}
