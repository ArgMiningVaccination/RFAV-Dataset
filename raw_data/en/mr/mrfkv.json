The COSMOS ORGANIC certificate is a certification that is awarded to those products that contain organic raw material from sustainable crops. The COSMOS-standard AISBL has been developed by the following founding members: - BDIH (Germany) - COSMEBIO y ECOCERT (France) - ICEA (Italy) - SOIL ASSOCIATION (United Kingdom) The main objective of this certificate is to achieve sustainable development, which reconciles economic progress, social responsibility and natural balance. Air Natur Home is involved in this project. To carry out this sustainable production and consumption, should be used several simple rules: - Promote the use of products from organic farming and respect biodiversity. - Use natural resources responsibly and with respect to the environment. - Use clean processes of transformation and manufacturing that are respectful of human health and the environment. - Integrate and develop the concept of \"green chemistry\". Therefore, the ultimate objective of the COSMOS-standard is to tackle the main problems related to the environment and human well-being. It is intended to guarantee the transition between current and future possibilities of technological advances. And so promote the development of increasingly natural and ecological products. It is essential to ensure the respect of our consumers, who must be informed in a totally clear and transparent way, and thus be able to participate in a more sustainable development. Storage: Storage areas must be clearly labelled to avoid any confusion or risk to the integrity of our products. Manufacturing: The different manufacturing processes must be separated to avoid contamination of organic or natural ingredients. So, must be established a quality control system such as: - complete traceability of ingredients and products - procedures of manufacturing at all stages - ingredient and product testing - records of analysis, manufacture and storage Packaging: The following steps must be done to minimize the possible direct and indirect environmental impacts of the packaging: - minimize the amount of used material - maximize the amount of material that can be reused or recycled - prioritize the use of recycled materials All this solutions with their respective documentation that proves that these measures have been taken, should be inspected every 3 year. Fabrics: Must fulfil this standard. The material must be 100% certified organic. Prohibited: - Nano materials - Genetically modified organisms (GMOs): GMOs or derivatives. - Irradiation: by gamma rays and X-rays - Animal experimentation: they cannot be tested on animals by the manufacturer or by third parties. - Raw materials from live or sacrificial animals - Obtaining raw material that causes a negative impact on natural ecosystems - For packaging cannot be used: polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other chlorinated plastics; and polystyrene and other plastics containing styrene.

Also it is necessary to carry out a cleaning and hygiene control using cleaning and disinfection materials which ingredients respect this Standard. A COSMOS ORGANIC product must be properly labelled. This label must include: - The signature \"COSMOS ORGANIC\" together with the logo of the COSMOS-standard member ISBL - Indicate the percentage of weight of ingredients of organic origin in the total finished product.
