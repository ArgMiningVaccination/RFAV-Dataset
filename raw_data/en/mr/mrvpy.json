Shaping our ne w identity Canberra Health Services was established on 1 October 2018 foll owing the split of ACT Health into two directorates. In early 2019 we commenced work on a new Visi on, Role and Values for the organisation to enable us to shape our identity now and into th e future. This involved reaching out to Ca nberra Health Services staff, p atients, consumers, family members and carers, to ensure a shared understanding of the Vision and Role that we set for our health service. We had approximately 80 staff, also known as 'conversa tion starters' who conducted extensive consultation, and we received over 5200 pieces of fee dback. Our new Vision and Role was officially launched on 14 May 2019. Canberra Health Services 13 Annual Report 2018-19 Vision Creating exceptional health care together Together we are a caring team. We will be successful when, every day, people say 'I trust you to look after me when I am at my most vulnerable', carers and family members say 'I feel safe to leav e my loved one in your care', and our staff and health care partners say, 'I have pride in my work an d I want to help us all improve'. We celebrate our successes as one community and we create a wor ld where people flourish in their best health. Role To be a health service that is trusted by our community We build trust with our communit y at all stages of their health journey. We do this when we provide warm, welcoming and high quality experiences wherever we delive r care. Every day, we use our resources wisely and sustainably to reduce waste and improve ef ficiency. We foster a diverse, safe and happy workplace where we help each other to succeed, improv e and innovate. That way our staff are supported to communicate well and deliver safe and re liable services together with our community. Values Following the launch of our vision and role, we did further wor k to define our values. More than 2500 staff provided input to develop the following values.

Strategic planning We have started developing our first Strategic Plan to align wi th our new Vision and Role. It will set out what we want to achieve as a health service, the actions we will take to achieve our organisational objectives, key projects and initiatives, and ho w we will measure our achievements. The Canberra Health Services Str ategic Plan will establish a st rong foundation for the future success of our new organisation. We are seeking input from multiple sta keholders and will publish our Strategic Plan in the second quarter of 2019-20. Summary of performance Canberra Health Services is responsible for reporting on progre ss against seven specific strategic objectives that relate to elective surgery waiting lists, emerg ency dental health services, breast screen participation rates, timeliness of access to radiotherap y use of seclusion in mental health, rates of patient return to acute psychiatric inpatient care, an d optimum occupancy rate for overnight hospital beds. During 2018-19, Canberra Health Services performed well in the following areas: ! Elective surgery \u2014A record number of 14 015 elective surgeries were delivered. T his was over 600 more than in 2017-18, with improvements across all categori es. ! Dental \u2014Canberra Health Services assessed 100 per cent of emergency de ntal clients within 24 hours. ! Cancer and ambulatory support \u2014For radiotherapy, 100 per cent of emergency patients commenced treatment within the targeted timeframe of 48 hours. ! Breast screen participation \u2014For women aged 50 to 74 years the participation rate was 57 per cent, close to the 60 per cent target for 2018-19, and c omparable to other jurisdictions. BreastScreen ACT continues to actively promote the program thro ugh General Practitioner surgeries, at community events and through media opportunities. ! Optimum bed occupancy rate \u2014The overnight bed occupancy rate for Canberra Hospital just slightly exceeded the 2018-19 target of 90 per cent, at 91 per cent, and was consistent with previous years. Canberra Health Services 22 Annual Report 2018-19 We have further work to do in these areas: ! Elective surgery \u2014A total of 635 patients waited longer than clinically recommen ded timeframes for surgery, which was 205 patients above the 2018-19 target. ! Cancer and ambulatory support \u2014The results for patients comm encing palliative and radical radiotherapy treatments were below the 90 per cent target for 2 018-19. Contributing factors included increased referrals, increasingly complex treatment te chniques, and treatment delivery time. ! Mental health, justice health and alcohol and drugs services \u2014The proportion of clients with a mental health seclusion episode was 17 per cent, compared with a target of less than five per cent. The reasons for this incre ase are complex and partly due to the inclusion of data from the Dhulwa Mental Health Unit. Performance against strategic objects and priorities for the re porting period is discussed in more detail the Performance analysis section from page 24. Outlook for 2019-20 In the year ahead we will embed th e Canberra Health Services' i dentity and finalise foundational plans and strategies for our organisation. Providing timely care to consumers\u2014the right care, at the right time, in the right place\u2014is a key strategic priority. To effectivel y manage demand for our servic es, alleviate pressure on staff and the system, and support improved patient flow throughout the health service, we are implementing several initiatives as part of the Timely Care Strategy. In th e year ahead, we will continue to embed strategy initiatives, including: ! morning and afternoon multi-disci plinary team huddles as part o f the 'Red2Green' program ! early identification and discharging of appropriate patients be fore 9.00am and commissioning of an All Care Discharge Unit that accepts non-ambulant patients ! review of daily hospital wide flow management meetings ! streamlining discharge process an d reducing barriers that delay a patient's stay in hospital ! developing pathways in the Emergency Department for the managem ent of simple limb fractures and providing travel options for those with not means for arranging transport home. We have established six working groups to support the Timely Ca re Strategy. Another priority for the coming year is addressing occupational violence. Occupational violence is an increasingly challenging issue fa ced in the health care sector. Canberra Health Services is committed to improving reporting and reducing the incidence of occupation al violence across our organisation. We have developed an overarching occupational violence strategy that defines the strategic objectives relevant to preventing and managing occupational vio lence in Canberra Health Services. This overarching strategy will ce ment governance processes to e nsure accountability structures and appropriate risk based prevention strategies are in place. Key components of the strategy will improve and strengthen how Canberra Health Services approaches prevention, training, and Canberra Health Services 23 Annual Report 2018-19 response to incidents, as well as the support provided to staff , investigation of incidents and enhanced consumer awareness. Over the next three years, we will prioritise and implement initiatives under this strategy based on risk. We are also continuing to work on our organisational culture an d will conduct a Workplace Culture Survey during the first half of 2019-20. Workplace Culture Surv ey champions have begun encouraging staff to participate and will assist staff with the survey as required. In addition, we will continue to implement recommendations of t he Independent Review into the Workplace Culture within ACT Pub lic Health Services, released i n March 2019. We will do this in close collaboration with ACT Health Directorate and Calvary Hos pital Bruce. We will build on all this work by continuing to identify system s and processes we can improve. Improvements are expected to continue and become embedded into our regular processes and policies across Canberra Health Se rvices, so that we continue t o deliver high quality, safe and timely care to our community. Canberra Health Services 24 Annual Report 2018-19 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND INDICATORS The 2018-19 ACT Health Budget included 15 strategic objectives and associated indicators. This year, Canberra Health Services i s responsible for reporting on progress against objectives 1 to 7 (noting that strategic objectives 1 and 7 include territory wid e information) and ACT Health Directorate is responsible for reporting on indicators 8 to 15. Strategic objective 1: Reducing the waiting list for elective surgery This is an indication of improved access to surgical care. Strategic indicator 2018-19 target 2018-19 outcome Reducing the number of patients waiting longer than clinically recommended timeframes for elective surgery 430 635 Elective surgery is planned surgery that can be booked in advan ce following a specialist clinical assessment, resulting in placeme nt on an elective surgery waiti ng list. The surgeon determines the urgency, based on nationally agreed criteria of three main urge ncy categories: urgent; semi-urgent; and non-urgent. To improve access to surgical care in the ACT, the Government has committed to increasing the number of elective and emergency surgeries being delivered and to reducing the number of people waiting longer than the clinically recommended times for surgery. Through this commitment, a record number of elective surgeries were delivered across the ACT during the year, with 14 015 surgeries delivered against a targ et of 14 000. This was over 600 more than in 2017-18. The percentage of elective surgery cases admit ted on time was also positive, with improvements across all categories compared with 2017-18. The 2018-19 results show that delivery has kept pace with deman d, with the number of removals from the waiting list roughly equalling the number of additions .1 There were 635 patients waiting longer than clinically recommend ed timeframes for surgery at th e end of the year, which represents around 12 per cent of the total elective surgery waiting list, and is 205 patients above the target of 430. The increasing demand in emergency surgery had an impact on ele ctive surgery performance. The ACT Health Directorate and Territory Wide Surgical Services are developing an elective surgery plan for 2019-20. The plan's fundamental strategy is to shift routin e, non-tertiary services away from Canberra Hospital, to allow Canberra Health Services to concent rate on emergency, trauma and tertiary level services, while providers with lower caseloads o f emergency surgery perform elective surgeries. In addition, the surg ical list will continue to be c oordinated at a whole-of-territory level 1 Elective surgery data is dynamic, meaning it is current at a po int in time, and continues to change over time. Canberra Health Services 25 Annual Report 2018-19 (rather than hospital-by-hospital) to spread the workload as ef ficiently as possible. ACT Health Directorate will also continue to coordinate with the surroundi ng NSW Local Health Districts as much as possible. Contact details: For more information, refer to the ACT Health Directorate 2018-19 Annual Report , or contact LHNCoord@act.gov.au Strategic objective 2: No waiting for access to emergency dental health services This is an indication of the responsiveness of the dental servi ce to emergency clients. Strategic indicator 2018-19 target 2018-19 outcome Percentage of assessed emergency clients seen within 24 hours* 100% 100% * This does not include clients who are offered an appointment within the required timeframe but do not accept that appointment. Contact details: For more information, contact DDGClinical@act.gov.au Strategic objective 3: Improving timeliness of access to radiotherapy services This is an indication of the effectiveness of public hospitals in meeting the need for cancer treatment services. Strategic indicator 2018-19 target 2018-19 outcome Percentage of radiotherapy patients who commence treatment within standard timeframes Category Emergency\u2014treatment starts within 48 hours 100% 100% Palliative\u2014treatment starts within 2 weeks 90% 70% Radical\u2014treatment starts within 4 weeks 90% 50% Patients requiring emergency treatment continued to be seen wit hin the target of 48 hours. The performance in radiotherapy wait times was affected by the increase in number of referrals, increasingly complex treatment techniques and treatment deliver y time. Canberra Health Services 26 Annual Report 2018-19 In addition, the replacement of two end of life machines commen ced in 2018-19, with the decommissioning of one machine from early February 2019.

Strategic indicator 2018-19 target 2018-19 outcome Proportion of women in the target age group (50 to 74 years) who had a breast screen in the 24 months prior to each counting period 60% 57% The overall number of screens completed in 2018-19 increased co mpared with 2017-18. The population of women aged 50 to 69 years has increased in the AC T, resulting in an overall reduction in the participation percentage rate in this age group, however , the ACT has the second highest participation rate in Australia. Contact details: For more information, contact DDGClinical@act.gov.au Strategic objective 5: Reducing the usage of seclusion in mental health episodes This measures the effectiveness of public mental health service s in the ACT over time in providing services that minimise the need for seclusion. Strategic indicator 2018-19 target 2018-19 outcome Proportion of mental health clients who are subject to a seclusion episode while being an admitted patient in an ACT public mental health inpatient unit <5% 17% During 2018-19 a small number of complex patients with signific antly high acuity had multiple events of seclusion. As this indicator is currently configured , with patient separations as the denominator, this scenario can significantly impact the rate. Canberra Health Services 27 Annual Report 2018-19 For 2019-20 we have adopted the national standard and counting methodology for this indicator, which is reported as a rate per 100 000 bed days. Contact details: For more information, contact DDGClinical@act.gov.au Strategic objective 6: Maintaining reduced rates of patient return to an ACT public acute psychiatric inpatient unit This indicator reflects the quality of care provided to acute m ental health patients. Strategic indicator 2018-19 target 2018-19 outcome Acute psychiatric unit patient 28 day readmission rate <10% N/A This is intended to indicate the proportion of clients who retu rn to hospital within 28 days of discharge from an ACT acute psychiatric mental health inpatient unit following an acute episode of care. However, there is no 2018-19 data to report for this indicator. This is because unplanned readmissions could not be separated from planned readmissions, for a range of reasons at a time of significant organisational change. This indicator will be revie wed, with a proposal to align the ACT definition with the national definition, for future reporting. Contact details: For more information, contact DDGClinical@act.gov.au Strategic objective 7: Reaching the optimum occupancy rate for all overnight hospital beds This indicator measures the overall occupancy rate for the ACT, based on average available overnight beds across Canberra Hospital, Calvary Public Hospita l Bruce, and University of Canberra Hospital. Strategic indicator 2018-19 target 2018-19 outcome Mean percentage of overnight hospital beds in use 90% 91% Bed occupancy is a measure used to manage capacity in hospitals . Bed occupancy figures fluctuate hourly, daily and monthly, and va ry substantially with the leve l of demand experienced across each hospital campus. The aim is to manage occupancy at around the 9 0 per cent level, to ensure hospitals are being used efficie ntly while retaining the flexib ility to respond to peaks of demand. Canberra Health Services 28 Annual Report 2018-19 It is important to note that occupancy is calculated using over night beds and does not include beds assigned for day procedures. The overnight bed numbers are a ca lculation of the daily available beds, averaged over the reporting period. Bed occupancy rates should not be considered in isolation to th e overall performance of the system. For example, the average length of stay in hospitals is also an important indicator of efficiency. By reducing the average length of stay, patient flow across the ho spitals can be improved, resulting in more new admissions and improved timeliness.

Canberra Health Services 45 Annual Report 2018-19 ACT Public Maternity Access Strategy ! During 2018-19 we sought community feedback to inform the ACT P ublic Maternity Access Strategy. To understand whether the proposed strategy would be effective, we engaged the Women's Centre for Health Matters to hold targeted face-to-face public consultations. This included sessions with community service providers, as well as with women who had accessed ACT public maternity services in the past 12 months, who were p regnant, or who were planning on having a child. Overall, the women were very positive about the early concept and the idea of connecting women at an early stage with information and midwive s. The Women Youth and Children project team also discussed the early concept with exe cutives at both Canberra Health Services and Calvary Public Hospital Bruce, Southern NSW Area H ealth Service, Australian Medical Association, General Practitioners, local obstetricians and women in culturally and linguistically diverse groups, and young mums clinics. ! The resulting strategy aims to make it easier for women to acce ss public maternity services appropriate for their situation and as close to home as possibl e, as well as getting personalised information earlier in their pre gnancies. We plan to start impl ementing the strategy in late-2019. Preterm Birth Prevention Initiative ! Canberra Health Services is part icipating in the Australian Pre term Birth Alliance program that aims to safely and effectively lower the rate of preterm birth, saving lives and preventing life- long disability. The 'Whole Nine M onths' project was launched i n Canberra on 28 February 2019. It is part of a national initiative that has successfully reduc ed the rate of preterm births by eight per cent. ! Funded through a generous donation from the Liangis family, the project employs a midwife to run the Preterm Birth Prevention Clinic at the Centenary Hospit al for Women and Children. In addition, ultrasound practices around the region have received education on screening for cervical length as predictor of preterm labour, and we have upd ated the pathways for screening and management of preterm labour to support this. The project a lso aims to raise awareness about the importance of stopping smoking, as this is an indepen dent risk factor for preterm labour. Early Family Support Initiative ! Sustained Home Nurse Visiting has been demonstrated to improve the outcomes for children in families that require extra suppo rt. This initiative will redes ign the current service in collaboration with consumers to ensure a better understanding o f consumer needs and best practice. We will focus on improving the collaboration between programs and explore opportunities to improve system processes between external agen cies and other directorates. We anticipate the redesign will be completed in May 2020, ready to commence implementation. Strengthening Hospital/Health Responses to Family Violence ! Trusted health professionals are in a unique position to identi fy family violence and provide information and access to support. Addressing family violence r equires a whole-of-organisation approach to identifying and responding to patients and staff wh o may be experiencing family violence. Canberra Health Services 46 Annual Report 2018-19 ! This year we secured funding to deliver the Strengthening Hospi tal Responses to Family Violence program. Based on best practice guidance that has been evaluate d and embedded across Victoria Health, the program will support health staff and faci litate early access to support for people experiencing family viole nce.

The Microbiology Unit performs microbiological analysis of food and water on a fee-for-service basis as well as to support various ACT regulation activities and in vestigations of food related il lness outbreaks. The Environmental Chemistry Unit conducts ambient air quality m onitoring and performs asbestos identification and fibre countin g on a fee-for-service basis. The Forensic Chemistry and Toxicology Unit provides analytical support for forensic investigations related to drugs and poisons and supports coronial investigatio ns, road transport legislation and other legislation and supports drug treatment programs. 'Samples analysed' is an indicator of the laboratory's workload for the year as a count of samples coming to the laboratory that have had testing performed on the m. Sample types can be: ! food, water and environmental ma terials that undergo microbiolo gical analysis ! asbestos confirmations ! fibre counting ! air quality data ! forensic and coronial toxicology samples ! road transport blood and oral fluid samples ! seized controlled substances ! samples relating to investigatio ns of clandestine drug laborato ries. The indicator demonstrates that ACTGAL exceeded the pro rata ta rget for samples analysed for the period October 2018 to June 2019 by 30 per cent. The higher tha n target result is due to a higher proportion of samples analysed occurring in the first quarter o f the financial year. The number of samples submitted for analysis fluctuates throughout the year a nd is driven by multiple external variables, such as seasonal variation, changes in the populatio n, agency specific targeting practices, emergency management and reaction to community expectations. Food safety The Health Protection Service conducts inspections of food busi nesses to: ! identify potential food safety issues ! ensure compliance with the requirements of the Food Act 2001 and the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. From 1 July 2018 to 30 September 2018, Health Protection Servic e Public Health Officers' conducted 460 inspections of food businesse s, including business operatin g at Declared Events. Health Protection Service fell short of the pro rata target of 625 foo d inspections for the reporting period. The lower than target result was due to a higher proportion of inspections and site visits occurring in the last three quarters of the financial year. The number of inspections does not directly reflect the number of businesses inspected, as a business may be inspected more than once, particularly where en forcement action occurs. Canberra Health Services 69 Annual Report 2018-19 Public Health Officers serve Improvement Notices where identifi ed issues require correction but do not pose a serious risk to public health. If the risk to public health is serious, a Prohibition Order is served, resulting in the closure of the business until the issu es of non-compliance have been rectified. Immunisation Data on immunisation coverage for the primary immunisation sche dule are extracted from the Australian Immunisation Register. For the purpose of immunisati on reporting, a child aged 12 months to less than 15 months is regarded as one-year-old. To b e considered fully immunised at one year of age, a child should have completed their primary immuni sation series with: ! three vaccinations against dipht heria, tetanus and pertussis ! three against poliomyelitis ! either two or three against Haemophilus type B and Pneumococcal ! three vaccinations against Hepatitis B. In the ACT, for the reporting period 1 July 2018 to 30 Septembe r 2018, 95 per cent of one-year-olds were fully immunised based on data provided by the Australian I mmunisation Register. Consistently high coverage rates for one-year-old children in the ACT have b een achieved by working collaboratively with over 200 immunisation providers in the com munity. To achieve this outcome, ACT Health Directorate: ! provides information and promotional material ! sends postcard reminders and overdue letters to families ! assists with transcribing ove rseas immunisation records ! develops catch-up plans for children with delayed vaccination s chedules.

The division also provides financial support for Pri vate Practices, Visiting Medical Officers, Interstate Patient Transfer and Hospital Cashiers, and invoicin g services for medical services, hospital accommodation and debt management. With the organisational restruct ure in March of 2019, the Clini cal Record Service was renamed Health Information Services and transferred to the Finance and Business Intelligence Division. The Health Information Service p rovides a range of functions in cluding clinical record scanning, hard copy clinical record management, clinical coding of all inpatie nt separations, Diagnosis related Group (DRG) and casemix data generatio n, patient identifier maintenan ce and duplicate resolution, clinical record forms design and access to records and personal health i nformation for patient care, research, quality improvement, medicolegal and other purposes. Finance and Business Intelligence achievements in 2018-19 ! We commenced a clinical documentation improvement project. In S eptember 2018 we launched a pilot project to trial the use of Clinical Documentation Impr ovement Specialists to improve the accuracy of Diagnosis Related Gr oup allocation and potential Ac tivity Based Funding revenue. This limited trial involved three registered nurses fr om clinical units being trained as Clinical Documentation Improvement Specialists and engaged to w ork with clinicians on the wards to ensure the complexity of the patient is accurately ref lected in the documentation and captured in the clinical coding, to ensure that the appropriate Diagnosis Related Group is assigned. The three units for the initial trial were Neonatolog y, Paediatrics and Respiratory and Sleep Medicine. The potential increased revenue for the first t hree months of the trial was approximately $200 000. We have extended the trial for a furthe r 12 months to 30 June 2020. Canberra Health Services 71 Annual Report 2018-19 ! We completed a documentation compliance audit of 150 clinical r ecords from Surgery and Oral Health, scoring and overall results of 85 per cent. !

Agreed Scoping to build allied health services within Hospital in the Home will be undertaken as part of the Territory Wide Clinical Services Framework. Two Hospital in the Home services (HITH) currently operate in the ACT, one at Canberra Health Services and one at Calvary Public Hospital Bruce. Similar HITH services are offered by each program. A Care Close to Home (CC2H) project commenced in May 2018 to expand use of HITH over four years. The aim of the project is to consolidate the two current HITH services and integrate HITH with other existing community/home based services. This is expected to improve the quality and accessibility of home based care and reduce the burden on existing hospital based in- patient services. Through the work of the CC2H project, consultation has taken place with key stakeholders, In progress Canberra Health Services 82 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Select Committee on Estimates 2017-2018 including Medical, Allied Health, Nursing and Administration Staff as well as consumer representatives, to identify the Allied Health resource profile required to support HITH expansion. Work has been undertaken to determine additional Allied Health staffing requirements to support the HITH expansion over the next four years. Recommendation 12 The Committee recommends the ACT Government conduct a review of access to youth mental health services to ensure timely access and continuing support. Agreed ACT Health will undertake a review into access to youth mental health services provided by Canberra Hospital and Health Services and non-government organisations. ACT Health Directorate has collaborated with Education Directorate to identify mental health services, programs and referral pathways for children and young people. This information has been collated for use by Education staff specifically, and will be available more broadly. The Office for Mental Health and Wellbeing has received Commonwealth funding to build on this work and develop an Online Youth Navigation Portal to assist in identifying the right service at the right time for young people. A key deliverable of the Office for Mental Health and Wellbeing Work Plan is a review of Children and Young People's Mental Health and Wellbeing across the continuum. In progress Recommendation 59 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that future Budget Papers include the National Efficient Price for the provision of health services. Agreed Future Budget Papers will include the National Efficient Price for the provision of health services. ACT Health Directorate will provide input to future Budget papers on the prevailing National Efficient Price for public hospital services. Page 68 of Budget Statements C of the 2019-20 Budget papers includes the National Efficient Price. Complete Recommendation 60 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure accountability indicators include the cost of care as well as National Weighted Activity Units (NWAU) for each accountability item and for each hospital. Noted The ACT Government will consider this recommendation in future reporting, noting that not all accountability indicators relate to NWAU. The inclusion of cost of care and NWAU in accountability indicator reporting will continue to be considered in future reporting, if appropriate as an indicator. Complete Canberra Health Services 83 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Select Committee on Estimates 2017-2018 Recommendation 61 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure future Budget Papers provide an explanation of National Weighted Activity Units for the provision of health services. Agreed Future Budget Papers will provide an explanation of National Weighted Activity Units for the provision of health services. ACT Health Directorate will provide input to future Budget papers to explain the concept and interpretation of NWAU as a metric for the provision of public hospital services. Page 68 of Budget Statement C of the 2019-20 Budget papers provides an explanation of NWAU for the provision of health services. Complete Recommendation 62 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government update the ACT Legislative Assembly on the issues that cause a deviation from the National Efficient Price by November each year. Agreed The Government will provide an update on ACT performance relative to the National Efficient Price in its Annual Report. See response to recommendation 63. Complete Recommendation 63 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government regularly update the ACT Legislative Assembly on measures to, and progress on, narrowing the gap between the National Efficient Price and ACT-wide cost of care. Agreed The ACT Government will continue to update the Legislative Assembly annually through existing mechanisms including the ACT Budget, Annual Reports and performance reporting. Changes to the health system in October 2018 mean Canberra Health Services is responsible for Canberra Hospital, and is now a separate entity distinct from ACT Health Directorate. New service level agreements are being developed with Canberra Health Services and Calvary Public Hospital Bruce. These new service level agreements are being built on an incremental transition to an Activity Based Funding model. Through this process, ACT Health Directorate is analysing costs in the ACT public hospital system to determine efficiencies. The National Efficient Price for 2018-19 (NEP18) is $5012 per NWAU. It is important to acknowledge several factors beyond the control of ACT Health Directorate and the ACT public hospital network that contribute to a higher cost per NWAU for delivering public hospital services in the ACT than the prevailing National Efficient Price. Despite its relatively small population base as a metro area, the ACT provides services at the highest level of hospital service classification as defined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority\u2014with both of Complete Canberra Health Services 84 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Select Committee on Estimates 2017-2018 the ACT's public hospitals being Principal Referral Hospitals. However, the ACT Local Hospital Network does not have a support network of hospitals of different service classification, in comparison to many other metro areas in Australia. This is a likely contributing factor to the difference between the National Efficient Price and the cost per NWAU of in-scope clinical activity in the ACT. This is because the ACT lacks the support of a broader range of high service capacity hospitals like other capitals and the associated opportunity for efficient specialisation, while at the same time the ACT public hospital system has limited opportunities to take advantage of economies of scale as a hospital network. In addition, the ACT is a relatively high cost jurisdiction with respect to labour costs and the cost of living. On average, the ACT faces high costs to retain clinical staff. This is exacerbated by the ongoing difficulties the ACT faces in attracting and retaining specialised medical staff. Compounding the issue of relatively high labour costs in the ACT is the impost of high, ongoing superannuation costs accrued by the Commonwealth prior to self-government and inherited by the ACT Government. The latest available data from the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare indicates that overall, the average cost of salaries for staff in ACT public hospitals exceeded the national average by 2.7 per cent in 2017-18. Recommendation 64 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government review the accountability indicators for Output 1.4 (Cancer Services) to cover more services than breast screening services alone, and that they include more meaningful Agreed The ACT Government routinely reviews its accountability indicators to ensure they remain relevant. It should be noted that Breast Screen activity targets are set nationally so it is difficult to provide longer term targets. The National Cancer Expert Cancer Australia is undertaking work on behalf of the National Cancer Expert Reference Group to identify indicators against the National Optimal Care Pathways for cancer.

To further strengthen those obligations, ACT Health Directorate may consider including an explicit statement/requirement in the contract with Calvary Public Hospital to ensure compliance with specific ACT Health Directorate policies and standard operating procedures, or consider amendments to the Mental Health Act 2015 as part of the planned 2019 review process. Recommendation 2 That the ACT Health Directorate should review and promulgate processes for recording communications with relevant Agreed ACT Health's current Clinical Records Documentation Policy requires staff to document relevant clinical communication The updated Clinical Records Management Policy was published in March 2018, and includes explicit reference to the Mental Health, Alcohol and Drug Services, Justice Health Complete Canberra Health Services 88 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity ACT Auditor-General parties, including carers, government agencies and General Practitioners so that all communications are documented on a patient's record in the Mental Health Assessment Generation and Information Collection system (MHAGIC). with external parties in the patient's Clinical Record. As a Directorate-w ide Policy, it is generic in nature and principle based. ACT Health acknowledges that the Directorate-wide Policy does not specifically articulate procedures for the electronic record, MHAGIC. ACT Health will review the current Policy and ensure that policy documents are explicit to ensure compliance with documentation standards so that all relevant parties record all communications appropriately. MHJHADS will review training and learning development opportunities to ensure that all staff are aware of the important role that carers and external providers can have in positive consumer focused recovery outcomes. Integrated Care eRecord as the clinical record system. This Operational Procedure also includes a revision section to list the area responsible for the Procedure. The Clinical Records Policy and Clinical Records Management Procedure review date is March 2022. Governance for the review is managed by the Canberra Hospital and Health Services Policy Committee. Recommendation 3 That the ACT Health Directorate should clearly assign responsibility for creating, reviewing and maintaining a person's recovery plan. Agreed Existing ACT Health Procedures clearly articulate that the primary responsibility for completing Recovery Planning documentation lies with Clinical Managers in community mental health settings. However, ACT Health acknowledges that there are several other procedural documents which require further clarification, and will review these to ensure consistency across all program areas. ACT Health will improve processes regarding reviewing recovery plans and treatment and care plans in the Adult Mental Health Unit as a priority. A dedicated MHJHADS Recovery Planning Working Group has been established to progress this recommendation. A MHJHADS Recovery Planning Working Group was formed in March 2018. The working group developed The Recovery and Care Planning Framework, which was endorsed at the June 2018 MHJHADS Corporate Governance meeting. The Framework provides a minimum set of standards that are mandatory for all MHJHADS services to meet within their recovery planning procedures. With the endorsement of the Framework, work continues on the program specific operationalisation procedures in line with the overarching Framework throughout 2019. For example, as part of implementing the Adult Community Mental Health Services Model of Care new Recovery Care Planning documentation and procedures are being trialled within the adult community teams. The documentation and procedures will be able to be used within the Adult Mental Health Unit. Complete Canberra Health Services 89 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity ACT Auditor-General Recommendation 4 That the ACT Health Directorate should review policy and procedural guidance for the use of MHAGIC so that guidance: a) identifies MHAGIC as the single electronic record for each patient provided with mental health services in the ACT b) clearly outlines the mandatory requirements for using MHAGIC to record patient nursing and clinical notes. Agreed ACT Health acknowledges that clear reference material for staff is important in ensuring that the standard of documentation within clinical records is appropriate. ACT Health is currently upgrading the electronic clinical record, MHAGIC. The new system is anticipated to go-live in November 2017. As part of the implementation, ACT Health will ensure that Policy, Procedure and Guidance Manuals support the changes to the electronic records. ACT Health will ensure that this documentation forms the basis for the initial and ongoing training of staff, and that all staff are retrained to ensure they are fully aware of their legal obligations regarding record keeping. In October 2017, MHJHADS implemented an updated version of MHAGIC, known as MAJICeR (Mental Health, Alcohol and Drug Services, Justice Health Integrated Care eRecord). Staff completed e-learning packages to access the new system. The training included the mandatory requirements for the use of the electronic system. MAJICeR has system capability for staff to track completion of tasks through the reminders and notifications in the system. The audit function has also been included in the system, and the Performance Reporting and Data Unit will undertake the management of the reporting functions and requests for reports to be developed. See Recommendation 2 concerning the updated ACT Clinical Records Management Policy. Complete Recommendation 5 That the ACT Health Directorate should document the procedures for manual reports to identify appropriate controls and separation of duties to prevent errors and manage conflict of interest.

ACT Health has already implemented immediate staffing changes to avoid any perceptions of conflicts of interest. ACT Health will rectify the absence of the documented process highlighted by this Audit. Canberra Health Services has documented procedures for manual reports. Complete Recommendation 6 That the ACT Health Directorate should enforce their own policy that the Suicide Vulnerability Assessment Tool be completed every three months for all patient and address areas of non compliance (or amend the policy if the ACT Health Directorate considers it inappropriate). Agreed ACT Health acknowledges that a Suicide Vulnerability Assessment Tool (SVAT) is a vital component of good mental health care. ACT Health and the Chief Psychiatrist is currently reviewing the policy, data collection and documentation requirements for use of this assessment tool. The current data collection methodology around this target does not account for: x services where a SVAT may not be specifically required x where suicide vulnerability assessment has been documented in the body of a clinical record rather than The Suicide Vulnerability Assessment Tool Working Group was convened to examine factors contributing to the completion rates for the Suicide Vulnerability Assessment Tool. The group conducted an audit, which demonstrated that the policy and data management system for measuring compliance with the policy, required re-definition of service areas where the Suicide Vulnerability Assessment Tool clinically needs to be completed. The policy has been updated with this re-definition, clarifying that the Suicide Vulnerability Assessment Tool is to occur in the community, and should be completed every three months. Complete Canberra Health Services 90 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity ACT Auditor-General specifically using the SVAT Form x where the SVAT has actually been completed, but outside the 3 month period. The Chief Psychiatrist has convened the Suicide Vulnerability Assessment Tool (SVAT) Working Group to progress this recommendation. ACT Health will make adjustments to the SVAT Policy to account for clinical variations. The updated policy was published on 26 June 2018. Recommendation 7 That the ACT Health Directorate should review and rationalise its performance information reports by: a) reporting the performance of provisions of the Mental Health Act 2015 that are intended to support collaborative planning (e.g. the number of people accessing mental health services that have an advance agreement in place) b) including outcome and outcome compliance measures (e.g. person outcomes from HoNOS and LSP-16 mental health well- being assessments or 28 day unplanned readmissions) c) including exception report identifying outliers d) including time series, including of outcome measures e) having it relate to management actions taken to achieve targets, including compliance targets f) aligning reporting to the relevant day-to-day reporting requirements of adult mental health operational managers. Agreed ACT Health has acknowledged in various data reviews, including the 2016-17 Price Waterhouse Coopers review, that there is a lack of documentation and linkages to data definitions and standards for performance reporting. ACT Health will ensure each of the strategic components of this recommendation are addressed under the Service Wide Review by March 2018. Further, over the same period ACT Health has committed to undertaking a complementary piece of work to develop detailed mental health focused outcome and compliance measures recommended above. ACT Heath Directorate has reviewed its performance information reports and completed this recommendation. ACT Health Directorate is continuing to implement improvements to health performance information reporting and addressing these recommendations as a key part of the System-wide Data Review Implementation Program.

Step Up Step Down facility and non-facility based supports are an evidence based, effective and contemporary model of care, and are a key component of the stepped care approach to mental health treatment. The relocation of any of these services has interdependencies with the availability of purpose built facilities elsewhere in the ACT. The addition of any further facilities would need to be subject to collaborative development of shared sector priorities arising from the Regional Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan, currently in development. Recommendation 67 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government continue to support pill testing and consider future opportunities to run pill testing at events and locations across the ACT. Agreed The pill testing trial at Groovin the Moo Canberra in April 2018 provided proof of concept that pill testing can be conducted at events in the ACT as a harm reduction measure. The ACT Government maintains a supportive policy environment for third parties to conduct pill testing at future events in the ACT with appropriate oversight and safeguards. A second trial of pill testing occurred at Groovin the Moo on 28 April 2019. ACT Health Directorate has commissioned an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of pill testing at festivals follow this trial. The Australian National University is undertaking the evaluation and is expected to report in December 2019. Complete Recommendation 68 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government sponsor an independent review of the pill testing trial, including legal, health and effectiveness issues and present this review to the Assembly. Noted The pill testing trial conducted at Groovin the Moo Canberra was evaluated by Safety and Testing Advisory Service at Festivals and Events (STA-SAFE). The report of this evaluation is available at: https://www.harmreductionaus tralia.org.au/wp- content/uploads/2018/06/Pill-ACT Health Directorate has engaged the Australian National University to undertake an independent evaluation of pill testing at festivals.

Recommendation 69 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government dedicate funding to determining why sexually transmitted infections are generally trending up. Agreed in principle ACT Health supports additional research into the epidemiology of sexually transmissible infections in the ACT. Targeted research projects could investigate whether increased transmission of sexually transmissible infections is occurring in the community, and identify emerging trends and risk factors to inform the development and implementation of more targeted prevention as part of future planning. ACT Health Directorate has funded a number of targeted research ventures during 2018-19 including: x Sexually transmissible infections and blood borne viruses in the ACT: Surveillance report 2018 by the Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales Sydney x market research with Canberra's youth to test potential campaign concepts to promote STI awareness in the ACT and explore local factors influencing sexual health behaviours in the ACT. The findings of these projects will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders and inform future policy refinement. Complete Recommendation 70 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government work with partner agencies like Sexual Health and Family Planning ACT, Aids Action Council, youth organisations and advisory committees to develop more targeted sexual health awareness campaigns to address the increase in STIs [sexually transmitted infections]. Agreed in principle ACT Health currently provides funding to non-government organisations including the AIDS Action Council of the ACT, Sexual Health and Family Planning ACT, and Hepatitis ACT to undertake a range of services related to prevention of sexually transmissible infections and promotion of safe sex. ACT Health has and will continue to work closely with these groups to develop targeted sexual health awareness campaigns based on known risk factors and emerging disease trends or issues in the ACT. ACT Health Directorate is reforming the peak sexual health stakeholder forum, previously known as ACT Ministerial Advisory Council on Sexual Health, HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis and Related Diseases (SHAHRD). SHAHRD will be replaced with a new Sexually Transmitted Infections/Blood Borne Viruses Health Advisory Committee. This will increase sector engagement, enhance stakeholder benefits and provide greater flexibility. ACT Health Directorate will continue to work with partner agencies to develop targeted sexual health awareness campaigns based on known risk factors and emerging disease trends or issues in the ACT. ACT Health Directorate is currently developing an action plan to address increasing rates of STI in the ACT. A key component of this will be implementing a social marketing campaign and outreach testing Complete Canberra Health Services 102 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Select Committee on Estimates 2018-2019 program targeting priority populations. Canberra Health Services is continuing work with government and non- government partners to develop more targeted sexual health awareness campaigns. Canberra Sexual Health Centre partners with Sexual Health and Family Planning ACT (SHFPACT) and the ACT Education Directorate for the Sexual health, lifestyle and Relationship Program (SHLiRP) in ACT Government Colleges. Canberra Sexual Health Centre also partners with the Aids Action Council and SHPFACT to provide the Partnership Approach to Comprehensive Testing (PACT). This is an outreach and education program encompassing sex worker outreach, sex on premises venues, youth outreach programs and community screening options. In addition, with the planning of SPIRE, Canberra Sexual Health Centre will be moving to a new location and is currently negotiating office space in its new clinic for non-government organisation services. This will enable direct and immediate support to patients. This work occurs currently and a dedicated space will further increase the ability for partnership with non- government organisations when working with high risk populations. Recommendation 71 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government investigate making free condoms available at more Government health centres and publish information on its websites about where free condoms are available. Agreed Free condoms are already available at many Government health clinics and non- government organisations, including the Canberra Sexual Health Centre, the Tuggeranong, Phillip and Belconnen Health Centres, the ACT Alcohol and Drug Service, the AIDS Action Council of the ACT, Sexual Health and Family Planning ACT, and Hepatitis ACT. ACT Health supports investigating the feasibility of other services which could provide free condoms, including the ACT ACT Health Directorate audited facilities that provide free condoms in October 2018. ACT Health Directorate website (Sexual Health Service) has been updated to provide a list of the facilities providing free condoms. Complete Canberra Health Services 103 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Select Committee on Estimates 2018-2019 Health Walk-in Centres. ACT Health will collate information about current sources of free condoms and make this available on the ACT Health website. Recommendation 72 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government consider reporting on sexual health including outcomes in public sexual health as part of the Budget Papers and include further statistical information as part of Annual Reporting. Agreed in principle ACT Health will explore the production of publicly available annual reports of public health data related to sexually transmissible infections. ACT Health Directorate is exploring the option of producing publicly available annual reports related to sexually transmissible infections, in consultation with relevant stakeholders. Ongoing Recommendation 73 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government work with Arthritis ACT and other interested parties on an arrangement for maintaining appropriate and affordable access to hydrotherapy pools on the southside of Canberra. Agreed The Canberra Hospital rehabilitation pool will close with the opening of the new facility at University of Canberra Hospital. Stakeholders including Arthritis ACT have requested continued access to the pool at Canberra Hospital. This relates to the availability of hydrotherapy facilities on the southside of Canberra. ACT Health has entered into an agreement with Arthritis ACT to continue access to the pool at Canberra Hospital until June 2019. ACT Health does not intend to keep the pool at Canberra Hospital open past that time, nor do we anticipate providing access to other groups. There are other options for hydrotherapy in the southside of Canberra, as outlined below. Private Southside Hydrotherapy Pools (heated to 33\u00b0C or greater): x Hughes Hydro\u2014Hughes x Kings Calwell\u2014Calwell x Kings Swim\u2014Deakin x Calvary John James Pool\u2014 Deakin. Southside ACT Government Public Schools with Hydrotherapy Pools (heated to 33\u00b0C or greater): x Malkara Special School\u2014 Garran. The ACT Government intends to close the Canberra Hospital rehabilitation (hydrotherapy) pool with the opening of the new facility at University of Canberra Hospital. ACT Health Directorate continues to work with key stakeholders to ensure an appropriate level of access at other suitable facilities is found. The User Agreement between Canberra Health Services and Arthritis ACT for access to the Canberra Hospital hydrotherapy pool has been extended from 1 July 2019 to 30 September 2019, with a month-to-month extension option. ACT Health Directorate engaged an external advisor, Nous Group, to: x assess current demand and referral trends x ensure that current policy settings and contractual arrangements are appropriate x determine the supply of hydrotherapy and warm water facilities across the ACT x provide advice to Government about securing sessions at these facilities. ACT Health Directorate is considering the outcomes of this work, to respond to the recommendations. Ongoing Canberra Health Services 104 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Select Committee on Estimates 2018-2019 Recommendation 76 The Committee recommends that the Health Directorate publish in each annual report a full account of (a) the money it receives from the Commonwealth government and (b) what the payments were for. Agreed The Local Hospital Network Financial Statements already provide (a) the amount of funding received from the Commonwealth and (b) the detail on what the funding is for, described in the notes to the Financial Statements (for 2016- 17, see pages 377 and 385 note 5 respectively). The Local Hospital Network Financial Statements will detail the amount of funding received from the Commonwealth and the ACT Government to operate territory wide public hospital services. Details on what the funding is for will be in the notes to the 2018-19 Financial Statements. Complete Recommendation 77 The Committee recommends that relevant officials from the Health Directorate provide the Assembly with all the reasons for the downgrade in the accreditation status for the radiology department. Agreed Information will be provided to the Assembly when practicable. In September 2018, Minister for Health and Wellbeing responded to Question on Notice 1568. As part of her response, she tabled an extract of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists' report, which outlined the reasons for the downgrade of the radiology training program at Canberra Hospital. Complete Recommendation 78 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide a detailed plan to the Assembly on measures being implemented to ensure the radiology training accreditation moves back to an A grade accreditation rating within the next 12 months. Agreed Information will be provided to the Assembly when practicable. During a routine site accreditation visit for registrar training in March 2018 accreditation for radiology training was downgraded from Level A to level D (remaining accredited). A total of 16 issues were raised by the accreditation team. These issues have been and continue to be addressed, with details provided to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists at the three and six month progress reports, following which the department was upgraded to a level C accreditation with notification of the upgrade on the 16 July 2019. The next progress report is to be submitted to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists by 30 September 2019, after which a repeat site visit will be undertaken prior to consideration of a further upgrade. There have been significant improvements within the department in regards to the health and wellbeing of registrars, above and beyond the recommendations. Complete Canberra Health Services 105 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Select Committee on Estimates 2018-2019 Recommendation 79 The Committee recommends the ACT Government provide advice to the Assembly on the current status of accreditation for ACT public hospitals and for each of the separate divisions and accreditation of services by individual medical colleges, including the anticipated dates for future accreditation inspections. Agreed Information will be provided to the Assembly when practicable. Information on the current accreditation status is being compiled and will be reported to the Legislative Assembly during 2019-20. Complete Recommendation 80 The Committee recommends the ACT Government continue to work with Epilepsy ACT to develop clear sustainable funding options for the organisation. Agreed ACT Health will engage with Epilepsy ACT and assess their proposal once it has been received. ACT Health is always interested in proposals which look to improve health outcomes for consumers, improve the health system, and help Canberrans to contribute to the social and economic fabric of the community. ACT Health Directorate will fund Epilepsy ACT in 2019-20 and undertake service planning to inform decisions about future community sector health services funding priorities. Complete Recommendation 91 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that ACT drug and alcohol rehabilitation services are adequately resourced to respond to demand, including any increased demand expected from the opening of the Drug and Alcohol Court. Agreed in principle ACT Health is working with the Alcohol and Other Drug treatment service providers, the majority of whom are non-government organisations, to understand current demands on the treatment system and the impact the proposed Drug and Alcohol Court will have on services, and to identify solutions and mitigation strategies. ACT Health Directorate continues to work with Alcohol and Other Drug treatment service providers to ensure the Drug and Alcohol Court is appropriately supported. Ongoing Recommendation 164 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government consider developing and reporting specific performance indicators that focus on youth issues such as inclusion and engagement, health and mental health, employment, and so forth. Agreed The Community Services Directorate will be undertaking a process during 2018-19 to review a number of the performance indicators to improve their relevance as a performance measure and the quality of information being provided through the indicator. The regular publication of A Picture of ACT's Children and Young People includes a range of indicators related to health, mental health, engagement with education and employment, lifestyles wellbeing and community engagement. The 2017 ACT component of the Australian Secondary Students' Alcohol and Drug survey collected information on the current prevalence of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use among secondary school students (aged 12 to 17 years of age). The 2018 ACT Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey collected information about physical activity, nutrition, healthy weight status, attitudes and general wellbeing among Year 6 students (aged 11 to 12 years). The 2018 ACT General Health Survey collected information on self-reported health status and Complete Canberra Health Services 106 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Select Committee on Estimates 2018-2019 ACT Health collects information and reports on a range of indicators relating to the health and wellbeing of the young people in the ACT.

In response, a number of significant improvements have been made to the ORT at AMC since the death of Mr Freeman. New policies and procedures are now in place that require, amongst other things: x collateral information to be sought from ACTCS [ACT Corrective Services] and other health services involved with the detainees care x urine screening to be considered by the medical officers when inducting a detainee into the ORT program x challenging cases to be discussed at the multidisciplinary Clinical Meeting before a detainee Refer to the government response. Complete Canberra Health Services 107 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission regarding opioid use and dependency. d) Ensuring that the ORT Clinical Meeting is conducted as envisaged by the Methadone Management Review Report and that all parties are invited to attend each meeting, including an addiction medicine specialist from the Wruwallin Clinic, and a representative from Justice Health Forensic Mental Health Services. e) Capturing accurate data of outcomes of all applications in relation to ORT to allow appropriate benchmarking against practice in the community and in other jurisdictions. is inducted onto the ORT program x input is sought from the specialist Addiction Medicine Physicians and mental health clinicians within ACT Health x auditing and benchmarking of ORT services provided at the AMC has commenced. Recommendation 2 That Justice Health ensures that an individual care plan is prepared for all vulnerable detainees being inducted onto the ORT program, as required by the ACT Guidelines, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees. Agreed Justice Health Services acknowledges the benefits of ensuring individual care plans are prepared for all vulnerable detainees being inducted onto the ORT program. The process of documenting individual care plans for all detainees on ORT at the AMC is now usual practice. ACT Health will audit compliance against this recommendation over the next six months to ensure that care plans continue to be developed for all detainees on the ORT. Refer to the government response. Complete Recommendation 3 That all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees be offered annual Aboriginal Health Assessments, and that ACT Health continue to seek an exemption to allow a Medicare rebate for these assessments occurring at the AMC. In the meantime, funding for these assessments should be considered in arrangements made between ACT Health and Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service to implement recommendation 5 of the Moss Report. Agreed in principle The Aboriginal Health Assessment is a specific federal Government initiative that is available and funded for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the community. Unfortunately to date, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody are not eligible under Medicare. However, this fact has not stopped health assessments being undertaken and or appropriate care being provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees at AMC. Winnunga will provide Aboriginal Health assessments through its provision of health services in the AMC. In progress Canberra Health Services 108 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission Furthermore, ACT Health is working with the federal Health Minister regarding the exemption to allow for Medicare rebate for annual Aboriginal Health Assessments for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in detention. The Moss Review also recognised the significant proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees at the AMC and concluded there is a need to better integrate Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Service to provide a holistic approach to health care at the AMC in a culturally safe way. In support of Recommendation 5 of the Moss Review, ACT Health and ACT Corrective Services have been working collaboratively with Winnunga to develop and agree to a best practice model of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Service Delivery at the AMC. Recommendation 4 That ACT Health establish a process for a periodic file review (at least once each year) of Hume Health Centre ORT assessment decisions, to be conducted by addiction medicine specialists from the Wruwallin clinic, to assist in maintaining consistency, appropriate record keeping and equivalence with assessment practice in the community. Agreed ACT Health acknowledges the benefits of conducting periodic file review of ORT assessment decisions at the AMC. A process for periodic reviews is currently being developed, with the first file audit to be undertaken within the next 6 months. The implementation of Mental Health, Alcohol and Drug Services Justice Health, Integrated Care eRecord (MAJICeR) across the Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services will enable this to occur. Medical staff working at AMC attend the Treatment of Opioid Dependence Training and Refresher Course for GPs, Pharmacists and Health Professionals. This is organised by the Alcohol and Drug Services Clinical Director and Canberra Hospital Pharmacy and completion of the course comes with certification. Refer to the government response. Complete Canberra Health Services 109 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission Recommendation 5 That Justice Health staff provide training to Corrective Services staff to observe signs of intoxication and overdose. Agreed Justice Health and ACTCS both acknowledge the importance of ensuring corrections officers working at the AMC are appropriately trained to support the health care outcomes of detainees and provide timely advice to health care professionals. A Health Notification form is completed by Justice Health Services and provided to ACTCS to notify of a detainee's commencement on ORT, and includes signs and symptoms to observe for signs of intoxication and overdose. ACTCS and ACT Health are currently developing a sustainable training and education program for corrections officers to attend so that they have the necessary skills to help identify if a detainee is intoxicated or overdosing. Refer to the government response. Complete Canberra Health Services 110 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission Recommendation 6 That ACT Health and Corrective Services make arrangements for Naloxone to be available at the AMC and ensure that it is able to be administered in an emergency situation, including an emergency occurring after- hours. Agreed in principle ACT Health and Corrective Services both acknowledge the benefits of naloxone in response to emergency situations to prevent the loss of life and agree with the intention of this recommendation. Naloxone is currently available at the AMC and is administered by medical staff only. When an emergency situation such as a suspected overdose is detected at the AMC, ACTCS contact medical staff to attend as soon as possible. All Corrections Officers have a duty of care to provide first aid until medical staff arrive. The Code Pink policy is followed for all emergency situations, and if an emergency occurs after hours, ACT Ambulance Service is called to transport the detainee to Canberra Hospital. In order for naloxone to be available over a 24 hour period at the AMC, processes, logistics and budget will need to be evaluated prior to any implementation. This recommendation will need to be implemented collaboratively between ACT Health and ACTCS. Discussions with Mental Health, Justice Health, Alcohol and Drug Services and ACT Corrective Services are continuing, with consideration of various options including nasal spray naloxone. In progress Recommendation 7 That Justice Health provide readily available, accessible information to detainees about signs of intoxication and overdose to enable detainees to identify and assist other detainees in emergency situations. Agreed Justice Health acknowledges the benefits of providing readily available, accessible information to all detainees about signs of intoxication and overdose to enable detainees to identify and assist other detainees in emergency situations. Detainees are advised to contact a Corrections Officer or medical staff immediately in an emergency. On induction onto the ORT program information is provided to detainees as part of the assessment which includes normal side effects and adverse side effects and how to notify ACTCS or ACT Health staff immediately when experiencing any adverse side effects. Refer to the government response. Complete Canberra Health Services 111 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission The same process occurs when a detainee is commenced on other medications. When a detainee is inducted onto the methadone program, ACT Health provides a Health Notification Form to Corrective Services, which outlines signs and symptoms to look for. Upon release from the AMC, sentenced clients are provided with information on the Alcohol and Drug Services dosing location on the Canberra Hospital Campus including the opening hours, and a map of where ADS is located. Recommendation 8 That Corrective Services routinely share information with Justice Health Services regarding the detection of illicit drug use or relevant contraband held by a detainee on the ORT program, to allow Justice Health to monitor and review dosing, and to educate detainees about risks of combining illicit drugs and prescribed methadone. Agreed An Information Sharing Schedule between ACT Health and ACTCS was signed by the Executive Directors of ACT Corrective Services and Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services on 20 November 2017. This is the first schedule of a high-level 'Arrangement for the provision of health services for detainees' that was signed by Directors-General of JACS [Justice and Community Safety Directorate] and Health on 14 August 2017. In support of the Arrangement, Justice Health are now embedded into the leadership team at the AMC. Justice Health are also represented on the weekly AMC management team meeting and the monthly Senior Management Team and Security Committee meetings. Information around illicit drug use is communicated to all parties in these forums. The Alcohol and Drug Nurse is able to access the ACTCS Urine Drug Screening information when undertaking a comprehensive drug and alcohol assessment Refer to the government response. Complete Recommendation 9 ACT Health ensure that: a) As far as possible, idoseTM is used for all methadone dosing at the AMC to address risks of Agreed Justice Health, with the support of ACTCS, are working to ensure that the full potential of the idoseTM system can be realised within AMC. Refer to the government response. Complete Canberra Health Services 112 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission identification errors, and that ACT Health and Corrective Services work together to upgrade dosing areas to allow idoseTM machines to be installed or used in each area where methadone dosing occurs. b) Additional procedural safeguards are immediately developed and implemented within Justice Health to ensure safety and accuracy of dosing in situations where the idoseTM machine is not operable and methadone is required to be dispensed manually. c) The Clinical Procedure for Opioid Replacement Treatment is amended to include a requirement to inform Corrective Services immediately of any detainee overdose, to ensure that the detainee can be adequately monitored and supported. In August 2017, the new technological system for methadone dispensing (idoseTM) went live in the AMC. idoseTM uses iris scanning, a form of biometric technology, to accurately identify people. idoseTM is monitored, recorded and controlled according to ACT Government regulations. The idoseTM system used at the AMC is networked with idoseTM at ADS in Building 7 at the Canberra Hospital, which enables continuity of care for those clients who are released from the AMC onto a methadone maintenance program at ADS. Additional idoseTM stations to those implemented in 2017 will be purchased and installed into the AMC over a 12 month timeframe. Improvements have already been made to Justice Health operating procedures for times when manual dosing is required if the system is not operable due to ICT failure, system malfunction or where idoseTM is not installed. An internal project post implementation evaluation is currently underway to fine tune both the idoseTM hardware and software to further reduce the risk of dosing errors. The Information Sharing Schedule to the Arrangement for the delivery of health services at the AMC, is a further mechanism for ACT Health and ACTCS to share information such as medication errors, including overdoses. Recommendation 12 That Justice Health revise its Clinical Procedure for ORT to provide further guidance to clinicians about considerations for involuntary withdrawal, consistent with practices in the community, including detainee rights to procedural fairness and humane treatment. Agreed The 2017 Justice Health Services ORT Clinical Procedures include detail on involuntary withdrawal from the ORT program. Additionally staff can access further guidance provided in the National Guidelines. The practice of involuntary withdrawal from the ORT program in the AMC is Refer to the government response. Complete Canberra Health Services 113 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission consistent with the practice in the community. Recommendation 13 That ACT Health establishes systems to accurately track and monitor the percentage of detainees inducted onto methadone at the AMC who continue methadone treatment in the ACT community after their release, both in the short term and longer term. Agreed ACT Health acknowledges the benefits of being able to accurately track and monitor the percentage of detainees inducted onto methadone at the AMC who continue methadone treatment in the ACT community after their release, both in the short term and longer term. The idoseTM systems at both the AMC and ADS, are linked and capture data that enables the tracking and monitoring of detainees who continue to dose at Building 7 upon release. Further improvements in tracking a person's continuation on the ORT program over the post release period will be enabled through the implementation of the Drugs and Poisons Information System (DAPIS) and DAPIS Online Remote Access (DORA). The DAPIS currently contains approval information for detainees on ORT within AMC. DAPIS also contains approval information for detainee only if they seek ORT from a prescriber on release. DAPIS does not currently collect ORT dosing information. The DORA is currently under development and is due for release in early 2019. The Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 2018, which was passed on 7 June 2018, amends the previous 2008 Act and the Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation 2008 to allow a monitored medicines database to be established in the ACT. Refer to the government response. Complete Recommendation 14 That ACT Health increase support and aftercare for detainees to continue to access methadone in the community to address the apparently high level of detainees who discontinue ORT on release. Agreed When a sentenced detainee (planned release) goes to Building 7 to dose upon release, they can be assigned a key worker who will work with the detainee regarding continuation on the ORT, including linkage Refer to the government response. Complete Canberra Health Services 114 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission with the Aboriginal Liaison Officer where appropriate and monthly medical reviews. Newly released detainees are recognised as high priority and are dosed on AMC scripts for up to 1 month to ensure timely continuity of care. New released detainees have priority access due to the high risk of relapse post release. JHS is notified in advance of the release date of a sentenced detainee and the JHS Alcohol and Drug Nurse notifies Alcohol and Drug Services of the client's release, and places relevant documentation on the electronic clinical record system MAJICeR. With the implementation of idoseTM at AMC, dosing history can now be tracked by Alcohol and Drug Services at Building 7. When a client agrees to participate in ORT, they agree to be responsible for complying with the requirements of the program including dosing regularly. JHS supports a client to continue on the program by reviewing the client before release (if the release date is known) and providing information on the location and business hours of Alcohol and Drug Services. ACTCS Extended Throughcare Program covers the period from three months pre-release to 12 months post-release and includes a single point of service coordination, client-centric case management, services responsive to offenders' needs, and established links with providers prior to release. The program assists clients to overcome barriers surrounding detainee re-entry, through combining reintegration planning with rehabilitation needs. This supports detainees to have access to targeted supports and interventions, including access to health care service providers. In 2017, the program was afforded a further four years of Canberra Health Services 115 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Human Rights Commission funding, enabling the program to function as part of routine ACTCS business. Recommendation 16 That the Justice and Community Safety Directorate, Corrective Services and ACT Health undertake further work to progress the implementation of the ACT Government policy of a needle syringe program in the AMC, consistent with services available in the ACT community, to reduce risks of blood borne virus transmission. Agreed in principle This recommendation is agreed in principle, however it is not achievable at the moment. In September 2016, ACT Corrective Service Officers voted overwhelmingly against the introduction of a Needle and Syringe Program (NSP) at the AMC. The process for considering the NSP was set out in the former Justice and Community Safety Directorate's Enterprise Agreement 2011- 2013 and in a subsequent Deed of Agreement between the ACT Government and Community and Public Sector Union. The current Enterprise Agreement expired on 30 June 2017. Negotiations for the agreement are underway and progress on the NSP is subject to the Enterprise Bargaining Agreement. ACTCS in consultation with ACT Health have developing a drug strategy to address alcohol and other drug issues and the transmission of blood borne viruses at the AMC. The strategy will focus on harm minimisation in a correctional setting, including activities to support demand reduction, supply reduction and harm reduction. This strategy will align with national and ACT drug policy frameworks and is anticipated to be finalised late 2018. Upon release, sentenced clients are provided with information regarding community NSP locations. Negotiations for the agreement are underway and progress on the NSP is subject to the Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.

Continued progress should be made to perform site- specific security risk assessments. Agreed The ACT Health Directorate is updating its enterprise-wide risk assessment and the Health Directorate Agency Security Plan. This work will be completed in the 2018-19 financial year. The Health Directorate is progressing the delivery of site-specific security risk assessments. This work is being done on a prioritised basis and is ongoing, with a focus on assessing new Health Directorate facilities and changes to services. ACT Health was split into two separate directorates in October 2018, known as ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services. This separation led to the security- related functions for ACT Health Directorate being managed by Canberra Health Services until 1 July 2019, when ACT Health Directorate appointed an agency security advisor and took over protective security responsibilities for ACT Health Directorate. Although the split of ACT Health resulted in two separate entities, ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services will continue to work together to review and update the respective security risks assessments and Agency Security Plans. This work will be completed in 2019-20.

This training should include: a) managing and documenting the conduct of preliminary assessments b) the need to fully consider options available prior to proceeding with a misconduct investigation (e.g. Underperformance management) c) processes for managing and documenting allegations of breaches of the ACT Public Sector Code of Conduct. Agreed The Addressing Workplace Issues\u2014Preliminary Assessment for Managers training, has increased our managers' understanding of their legal obligations under the Enterprise Agreements to conduct preliminary assessments to address bullying complaints. The skills based component of the workshop provides managers with the skills for conducting a preliminary assessment, and appropriately documenting and reporting such matters. ACT Health are currently reviewing the Preliminary Assessment training to reflect the new early intervention and Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms referred to below. With a view to further embed these changes to supporting a positive workplace culture, ACT Health is working on a number of short and medium term strategies and actions to shift the focus back to early intervention and alternative dispute resolution, and with the intention to recast existing frameworks in a way that results in a more joined up approach to employee behaviour and positive workplace culture, including: a. Modifying existing Preliminary Assessment process for bullying and interpersonal disputes to prioritise early intervention ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services will continue to review and implement training programs to address the findings of this ACT Auditor-General Report. In progress Canberra Health Services 118 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity ACT Auditor-General and alternative dispute mechanisms b. The introduction of an Employee Advocate position c. Introduction of a Preliminary Assessment Advisor position to assist managers in undertaking expedient assessment processes d. Ensuring that the REDCO network is aware of these changes and the emphasis on ADR processes to assist with the introduction of the aforementioned approach; e. Providing an external and independent avenue for employees of ACT Health on bullying matters f. Revisiting the People and Culture organisational structure to place resources at the workplace level to assist with early intervention. Recommendation 3 ACT Health should implement awareness training for Executives and Managers to reinforce requirements for receiving, documenting and managing reports of inappropriate workplace behaviours. Agreed In relation to both Recommendations 1 and 3, ACT Health have trained 206 managers in undertaking Preliminary Assessments, throughout the course of the 2017-18 financial year. ACT Health now reports higher Preliminary Assessment completions than any other Directorate, according to preliminary figures for the State of the Service Report. ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services will continue to review and implement training programs to address the findings of this ACT Auditor-General Report.

Agreed The ACT Government is committed to preventive health and will continue to explore opportunities across the Territory and across Government for innovation and investment in preventive health interventions (building upon existing, highly regarded services). ACT Health Directorate is leading the development of an ACT Preventive Health Plan. The plan, to be finalised towards the end of 2019, will focus on the key modifiable risk factors for chronic disease\u2014healthy weight, nutrition, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol\u2014 as well as broader population health and wellbeing factors. The plan will: x align with and support the ACT Government's Wellbeing Framework x provide a mechanism for collaborating with community partners on preventive health x guide future preventive policy direction and funding decisions. Ongoing Recommendation 4 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government investigate digital reform to provide a strategy for improving communication between acute services, community-based services, general practitioners and the patient and their carer. Agreed The ACTHD Digital Health Strategy is a Territory wide digital health strategy and well advanced in its development with launch expected early in 2019. This Strategy will provide a contemporary understanding of the strategic direction of the enabling functions that technology can provide to ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services into the future. It will inform the prioritisation of future investments and contribute towards ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services' primary focus of ACT Health Directorate Digital Health Strategy 2019-2029 is a territory wide digital health strategy and was launched on 6 May 2019 by the then Minister for Health and Wellbeing. This strategy provides a contemporary understanding of the strategic direction of the enabling functions that technology can provide to the ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services into the future. The strategy is informing the prioritisation of future investments as shown in the successful budget bid in 2018-19 for ACT Health Core ICT System Upgrade and 2019- 20 and the successful budget bid Complete Canberra Health Services 120 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Commu nity Services person centred, safe and effective care. for the Digital Health Record. These significant projects will be the primary focus of digital reform for the ACT public health system over the next five to 10 years and will positively impact the ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services' primary focus of person centred, safe and effective care. Recommendation 5 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide peer-based HIV testing for gay and bisexual men to help meet its goals and targets established in the National HIV Strategy. Agreed in part The ACT Health Directorate will continue to work in partnership with appropriate government and non-government organisations to explore opportunities to deliver peer- based HIV, STI and BBV testing for gay and bisexual men to help meet goals and targets established in the National HIV Strategy. There is evidence that peer-based HIV testing interventions are well received, however previous programs have demonstrated that an emphasis on HIV testing alone can come at the expense of other related STI and BBV testing important for this group (gonorrhoea, syphilis and chlamydia). Data from 2015 to 2017 show a decrease in the number of new HIV infections in this group, while the number of new cases acquired from heterosexual sex is increasing. Therefore, planning of any peer- based testing program requires the consideration of multiple factors including current data, the demand for and provision of clinical support, and the mitigation of unintended consequences, for example decreased testing for other STIs and BBVs. ACTHD commit to working with stakeholders in the ACT to address issues related to STIs and BBVs in all at risk populations. ACT Health Directorate will continue to work in partnership with appropriate government and non-government organisations to explore opportunities to deliver peer based HIV (and STI and BBV) testing for gay and bisexual men to help meet goals and targets established in the Eighth National HIV Strategy. ACT Health Directorate will investigate peer based models of care to improve diagnosis and treatment of HIV (and STIs and BBVs) taking into account priority populations and changing pattern of disease. Any such program will consider multiple factors including current data, the demand for and provision of clinical support, and the mitigation of unintended consequences, for example decreased testing for other STIs and BBVs. ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services are committed to working with stakeholders via the newly formed STI/BBV Health Advisory Committee in the development of a work plan which will consider priority areas in the ACT STI/BBV sector, including peer based HIV testing for gay and bisexual men. Canberra Sexual Health Centre is currently developing a Standard Operating Procedure and policy for the implementation of social media contact tracing, which will allow for notification to partners and access to screening after potential exposure to an STI or BBV, in particular HIV. This will bring contact tracing standards in the ACT in line with other Complete Canberra Health Services 121 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Commu nity Services sexual health services across Australia. Recommendation 6 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensures the development of a Territory wide health strategy, which is made available to the Committee and the public as soon as possible. Agreed The ACT Health Directorate has developed a Territory wide Health Services Strategy 2018- 2028. The Strategy is in its final stages and will be released to the public and made available to the Committee. The Strategy has been formed with input from the Territory wide Health Services Advisory Group, established in 2018 and comprised of community sector and Health Directorate representatives. After the transition of the former Health Directorate into two separate entities, ACT Health Directorate reviewed the status of the territory wide health services strategy in the context of these new service arrangements and the role of ACT Health Directorate. The key components of the strategy are now being incorporated into a territory wide health service plan, which will form the strategic direction for territory wide health service development and the ACT Health Directorate Strategic Plan. Complete Recommendation 7 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government consider adoption of patient- focused service delivery, as patient-focus services encourage the development of more efficient models of care. Agreed The ACT Health Directorate Governance Framework has the Strategic Goal 1: Putting patients at the centre of everything we do. This sets the expectation for the cascading of this strategic goal throughout all services. ACTHD's Vision is Your health\u2014Our priority . Improving the quality of healthcare across the ACT is a key priority for ACTHD, with the aim to be the safest healthcare system in Australia, delivering high- quality, person-centred care that is effective and efficient. ACTHD Clinical Governance Framework outlines the principles employed to ensure high quality, person-centred, safe and effective health service delivery, underpinned by a strong system of clinical governance. These principles include: x person-centred\u2014improving the experience of care x patient safety\u2014proactively seeking a reduction in patient harm x effective care\u2014best evidence of every person, every time. The ACT Health Quality Strategy (the Strategy) aims to deliver person centred, safe, effective The Office of Professional Leadership and Education has commenced a progress review of the implementation of priorities from the Quality Strategy 2018-2028. This will be completed in 2019. Canberra Health Services has developed and is monitoring an implementation plan to achieve the strategic priorities outlined in the Quality Strategy. Canberra Health Services continues to work with ACT Health Directorate to review progress of the implementation of priorities outlined in the Quality Strategy. Canberra Health Services Partnering with Consumers Committee meets monthly and is co-chaired by a consumer representative. It also has consumer representatives from Health Care Consumers' Association, the ACT Mental Health Consumer Network, Carers ACT and an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representative. The Committee has undertaken a mapping exercise to identify areas for further improvement. Two working groups have been formed and are reporting to the Committee. Both have Ongoing Canberra Health Services 122 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Commu nity Services and efficient care with the quality ambition to be a high performing health service that provides person centred, safe and effective care. The Strategy provides a framework through which improvements in services we offer to people can be focussed and measured. This Strategy has been the result of an extensive staff and consumer engagement and consultation phase which has informed the strategic priority areas and aims, making explicit ACTHD commitments through its adoption and implementation. The National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (the Standards) were developed by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission) with the Australian Government, state and territory partners, consumers and the private sector. The primary aim of the Standards is to protect the public from harm and improve the quality of health care. They describe the level of care that should be provided by health service organisations and the systems that are needed to deliver such care. Version two of the Standards came into effect on 1 January 2019 and addresses gaps identified in the first version including mental health and cognitive impairment, health literacy, end-of-life care and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. Standard 2: Partnering with Consumers describes the systems and strategies to create a consumer-centred health system by including consumers in the development and design of quality health care. CHS have established a governance committee, with a consumer Chair, to be accountable for the introduction of the new Partnering with Consumers Standard. A mapping exercise will be conducted in the first half of 2019 to identify key achievements to date and areas for improvement. The criteria consumer involvement through the: x Consent Working Group x Consumer Participation Working Group. The Consumer Feedback and Engagement Team processes have been reviewed to further improve increases in timely action to patient feedback. An education package has been developed for frontline staff and managers to assist in resolving complaints and issues at the point of care. Consumer Feedback and Engagement Team is currently collaborating with the Health Care Consumer's Association to improve written responses to consumer feedback. Canberra Health Services Consumer Handout Committee, a subgroup of Partnering with Consumers, has consumer representatives from the Health Care Consumer's Association and the ACT Mental Health Consumer Network. The Consumer Handout Committee continues to meet monthly to endorse consumer information developed by Canberra Health Services. Canberra Health Services 123 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Commu nity Services from the Partnering with Consumers standard includes: x Clinical Governance and quality improvement systems to support partnering with consumers x partnering with patients in their own care x health literacy x partnering with consumes in organisational design and governance. From 1 October the Consumer Feedback and Engagement Team was realigned to the Patient Experience Unit within Quality Safety Innovation and Improvement. A working group is being established to review, in partnership with consumers, consumer feedback mechanisms to ensure a person-centred approach. Canberra Health Services staff are provided with appropriate resources to achieve the Strategic Priority 1: Person-centred\u2014Improve the experience of care. The Consumer Handout Committee continues to review consumer information to ensure the publications are person-centred and adheres to health literacy principles. Recommendation 9 The Committee recommends that, as the ACT has less than the national in average primary and community health services providers, the ACT Government develop a workforce strategy to build on existing numbers. Agreed ACTHD is progressing work to improve access to primary and community health services. This work includes the analysis of the policy levers available to the ACT Government to influence the supply of the health workforce and the demand for primary and community health services. ACT Health commenced a project in June 2017 to develop a Workforce Strategy, to respond to the influences shaping the health system; to position ACTHD to achieve its strategic goals and meet future demands; and to support the delivery of ACT Government priorities. The Strategy provides useful insight and recommendations into the existing culture and performance of the organisation that can be harnessed to inform The Workforce Strategy project delivered a draft Workforce Strategy in October 2018. Finalisation of the Workforce Strategy was postponed to consider its implementation after the transition to two separate directorates (ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services), and to incorporate the findings and recommendations of the Independent Review into the Workplace Culture within ACT Public Health Services. ACT Health Directorate is currently reviewing the draft Workforce Strategy, with the view to finalising it during 2019-20 and agreeing to an implementation plan. In progress Canberra Health Services 124 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Commu nity Services and enhance ACTHD. The transition into two organisations provides an opportunity to reset the culture, refocus on person- centred, safe and high-quality care and to create a high performing and collaborative culture for the two organisations with a critical establishment period between now and 2020. The Report of the Independent Review into the Workplace Culture within ACT Public Health Services has also provided a number of recommendations that aim to enhance the workplace culture of the ACT's public health system to support workforce attraction and retention. Recommendation 10 a) The Committee recommends that the ACT Government investigate what the contributing factors are that cause the highest costs to the Canberra Hospital, as well as Calvary Public Hospital. b) The Committee further recommends that the ACT Government report back to the Legislative Assembly the cost analysis by the last sitting day of 2019. a) Agreed a) The hospital system is becoming more efficient, with the average cost per weighted separation in the ACT decreasing by around 18 per cent in five years, from $6,854 in 2012-13 to $5,598 in 2016-17. The program of work that supports these annual average costs include identifying opportunities for improvement. Further, over the medium-term, ACTHD will progressively implement an Activity Based Management (ABM) framework as the basis for defining and allocating funding to commission services across the system and to measure financial performance. Through the ABM structure, activity and cost information will be used to support strategic and operational objectives to further improve patient care and outcomes. Central to this will be a comprehensive review of the cost drivers of providing health services in ACT public hospitals. Since October 2018, Canberra Health Services, which is responsible for Canberra Hospital, has been a separate entity from ACT Health Directorate. As a result, new service level agreements are being developed with Canberra Health Services and Calvary Public Hospital Bruce. These new service level agreements are building on an incremental transition to an Activity Based Funding model. Through this process, ACT Health Directorate is analysing costs in the ACT public hospital system to determine where efficiencies can be improved. In progress Recommendation 11 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government establish procedures and protocols to ensure patients treated on time in emergency departments meet the national average benchmark. Agreed The ACT Government has a focus on delivering emergency services within clinically recommended timeframes, and procedures and protocols are in place to ensure patients are treated on time, according to The number of presentations to Emergency Departments (EDs) in the ACT continues to grow. There was a three per cent increase in ED presentations from 2016-17 to 2017-18. The 2018-29 estimates outcomes for ED performance Complete Canberra Health Services 125 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Commu nity Services the urgency of their clinical needs. ACT Health continuously reviews the processes for managing growing emergency department (ED) demand across the territory. Strategies are focused both on managing the flow of patients into EDs (diversion to alternative forms of treatment strategies) and improving the operational management of patients once in the ED. Such strategies include: x provision of alternate forms of clinical treatment through Walk-in Centres to allow for the right treatment in the right place x initiatives such as the Hospital in the Home (HITH) and more specifically the Geriatric Residential Acute Care Evaluation (GRACE) program which will provide treatment in residential aged care facilities RACF to reduce the flow of elderly patients into EDs x communication strategies and public education to keep consumers informed of their treatment options as an alternative to EDs x targeted initiatives for known high demand pressure periods such as a dedicated Winter Plans which incorporates additional beds and staffing to respond to the flu season through the winter months x at the operational level, daily strategies to improve patient flow and discharge, which includes the use of the Australasian Triage Scale to ensure that patients are treated in the order of their clinical urgency and allocated to the most appropriate assessment and treatment area. ACT Health will continue to focus on access to emergency services and care, reducing waiting times, and optimising indicate that 100 per cent of Category 1 patients were seen on time, and the 70 per cent target for Category 5 patients was exceeded, with 84 per cent of these patients seen on time. ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services are focused on delivering emergency services within clinically recommended timeframes. Challenges include that patients in the triage categories 2, 3 and 4 are reportedly presenting with increasingly complex conditions and complicating factors. This can add to the length of treatment times. ACT Health Directorate will continue to develop and implement strategies and solutions to improve timely care of patients across the health system. A considerable amount of work is underway to reduce demand, divert patients to the most appropriate service, maximise capacity and improve patient flow processes. The 2019-20 Budget builds on previous initiatives to improve access to emergency services and care. The ACT Government is investing in additional staffing and infrastructure at both Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital Bruce to increase Emergency Department capacity in the Territory. ACT Health Directorate, along with health service providers, continuously reviews the processes for managing emergency care across the Territory. This work is considered part of business-as- usual operational planning. The ACT's ED performance is measured regularly and reported in national reports, ACT quarterly performance reports, Budget papers and annual reports.

Recommendation 12 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government establish procedures and protocols to ensure that patients receive elective surgery in according with the national average benchmark. Agreed The ACT Government has a focus on delivering elective surgery within clinically recommended timeframes, and procedures and protocols are in place to ensure that patients are treated on time, according to the urgency of their clinical needs. ACT Health continuously reviews the processes for managing surgical demand across the territory. The Territory Wide Surgical Management Committee, which plans and monitors elective surgery waiting list performance across the territory, has developed an elective surgery plan to manage the increasing demand for elective surgery in the ACT over the next several years. Additionally, the development of Speciality Service Plans will promote a smooth and logical journey through the health system. Other elements of the strategy to manage increasing demand have included conducting additional surgeries, partnerships with the private hospital sector and reviewing current infrastructure. Updated modelling is being used to set targets for elective surgery into the future, with the delivery of approximately 14,000 elective surgery procedures anticipated for the 2018-19 financial year. This will be the highest number of elective surgery cases ever completed in the ACT in one financial year. Elective surgery performance has been positive in 2018-19, with an improvement in the number of elective surgery patients being admitted within clinically recommended timeframes across all triage categories. The 2018-19 results are: x 96 per cent for Category 1 patients, compared with 91 per cent for 2017-18 x 75 per cent for Category 2 patients, compared with 70 per cent for 2017-18 x 78 per cent for Category 3 patients, compared with 77 per cent for 2017-18. In addition, the 2018-19 target of 14 000 elective surgeries was exceeded and, in 2019-20, the ACT Government aims to deliver a record number of 14 250 elective surgeries. Services will also be expanded, with the delivery of two new theatres at Calvary Public Hospital Bruce, one in 2019-20 and another in 2020-21, along with expanded urology services to meet the growing demand for urology surgery in the ACT. The ACT Government has targeted strategies in place to improve elective surgery performance, including: x active management of the wait list with the Territory's service providers and x working with clinicians to renew the focus on 'treating patients in turn' wherever clinically possible. ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services Territory Wide Surgical Services Teams are preparing an elective surgery plan for 2019-20. ACT Health Directorate, along with health service providers, continuously review the processes for managing surgical demand across the Territory. This work is considered part of Complete Canberra Health Services 127 Annual Report 2018-19 Reporting entity Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Commu nity Services business-as-usual operational planning. Elective surgery performance across the ACT is measured and reported regularly through national reports, ACT quarterly performance reports, budget papers and annual reports. Recommendation 13 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government, in conjunction with Health Care Consumers Association, establish a forum to discuss value-based health care. Agree in principle ACTHD supports values based health care which is a key component to the National Health Reform Agreement. ACTHD continues to work with consumer groups and NGOs, including Health Care Consumers Association, to pursue the best quality and value health care for the ACT community. ACTHD is currently working to establish the Clinical Leadership Forum (The Forum). The Forum will provide strong leadership independent advice to the Ministers to contribute to the continuous improvement of the ACT's public health services. The Forum will: x provide the Ministers with advice on relevant clinical considerations in the sustainability, development and improvement of the ACT's health system, including input into planning and infrastructure considerations x consider and advise the Ministers on steps necessary to ensure that the ACT's health system has access to a sustainable, well trained and valued clinical workforce x consider and advise the Ministers on developments in other health systems that may provide lessons for the ACT heath system. ACT Health Directorate continues to support values based healthcare. A Clinical Leadership Forum has been established, with the first meeting held on 24 July 2019. The Clinical Leadership Forum provides independent and expert clinical advice to Ministers, with the aim of contributing to the continuous improvement of a high performing health system that keeps people well, provides the best care when required, and an industry-leading workplace. The establishment of the new Non-Government Organisations Leadership Group also provides an opportunity for coordinated and informed engagement between non-government organisations, ACT Health Directorate and Canberra Health Services, to ensure the role of non-government organisations delivering health services in the health system, and that their relationship to Canberra Health Services and ACT Health Directorate, is appropriately reflected in policy development and health service planning to meet the needs of the community. It is anticipated that the Non-Government Organisations Leadership Group will be established by October 2019.

In progress Canberra Health Services 134 Annual Report 2018-19 RISK MANAGEMENT We aim to provide safe, high-quality care and services to the c ommunity and to maintain a safe environment for patients, visitors and employees. Risk manageme nt is an essential process to maintain an appropriate balance between realising opportunities and addressing the uncertainty of achieving what we intend. We see risk management as a process o f continual improvement. Following the formation of Canberra Health Services as a separa te directorate last year, we prioritised the redevelopment of our Risk Management Framework, policy, protocols and related systems and processes to tailor them to the needs of our organi sation. We also ensured compliance with the International Standard for Risk Management, ISO 31000: 2018 and reference the new ACT Government Risk Management Policy and Implementation Guide. Our Risk Management Framework outlines our governance and progr am of risk monitoring. Our Executive staff are responsible for timely and effective identi fication and management of enterprise and operational/divisional risks, which we identify through Div isional Governance Committees and Risk Management work shops and forums. Our Executive staff are also res ponsible for managing the escal ation of risk to our Health Services Executive Committee, which oversees enterprise risks and risk m anagement activity reports. Our Audit and Risk Management Committee provides risk assurance for our organisation. In May 2019 our Chief Executive Officer and Executive staff par ticipated in a facilitated Risk Management Workshop. This workshop included training on risk ma nagement, and started our annual review of enterprise risks, and identification of risks for our 2019-20 Enterprise Risk Register. We will replicate this approach i n all divisions in the first h alf of 2019-20, for a consistent approach to risk management across our organisation. Canberra Health Services 135 Annual Report 2018-19 INTERNAL AUDIT Our Internal Audit Charter and Internal Audit Policy and Proced ures are based on the ACT Government Internal Audit Framework. They guide the work of our Finance and Business Intelligence Division through ou r Internal Audit Unit. This div ision supports governance oversight by conducting strategic internal audits, making recommendations fo r improvements, and monitoring actions emerging from recommendations. \u0003 During 2018-19 we conducted one strategic internal audit of sen ior medical officer attendance management. As at 30 June 2019 this audit had not been complete d, so there are no reportable outcomes for the year. \u0003 Audit findings and recommendations are rated in line with the A CT Government Risk Management Policy. Throughout the year, the Head of Internal Audit reporte d to our Chief Executive Officer, and the Audit and Risk Management Committee on matters relating to the Strategic Internal Audit Program, recommendations from audit findings, and matters of si gnificance as identified during the year.\u0003 The Audit and Risk Management Committee is also kept informed o f finance and performance audits undertaken by the ACT Auditor-General's Office, and any subsequent recommendations and actions as the apply to Ca nberra Health Services. The Audit and Risk Management Co mmittee of the former ACT Healt h Directorate met formally for the last time on 8 November 2018. A strategic planning meeting in January 2019 considered the new audit committee arrangements and established new Audit and Risk Management Committees for each directorate. On 10 April 2019, the Canberra Health Services Audit and Risk M anagement Committee met for the first time. There is a standing invitation for the ACT Auditor- General's Office to attend all meetings of the Audit and Risk Management Committee.

Canberra Health Services abides by the ACT Health Fraud and Cor ruption Control Plan and ACT Health Fraud and Corruption Control Policy, which aims to foste r an environment that promotes the highest standards of ethical behaviour. Following our transition to a separate directorate last year, w e began developing a Fraud and Corruption Control Plan and Fraud and Corruption Control Policy specific for Canberra Health Services. We undertake fraud risk assessments in our divisions, in line w ith our Risk Management protocols and put mitigating controls in place to address fraud threats a nd risks. Our Executive Staff are responsible for managing fraud and corr uption and ensuring compliance with the policy and plan at all levels within their areas. Our Senior Executive Responsible for Business Integrity Risk is responsible for analysing trends and risk assessments for fraud and o ther integrity breaches, provid ing biannual reports to the Audit and Risk Management Committee, ensuring processes for the detection and investigation of fraud, corruption and conflict of interest. Three allegations of fraud were reported in 2018-19. Also durin g the year, our Senior Executive Responsible for Business Integri ty Risk received and approved 4 0 applications of sponsored travel. Staff receive fraud control and prevention training during orie ntation and through our e-learning Ethics, Integrity and Fraud Prevention program. In 2018-19, 163 staff completed the e-learning program. We support staff and manager training with targeted in formation that alerts staff to the responsibilities and pr otocols intended to improve systems or m itigate identified fraud threats and risks.

Supporting Canberra mums and mums-to-be An example of community engagement work we did during the year was our consultation on access to public maternity services in the ACT. We heard from new parents that it is not always clear what to d o when they first find out they are having a baby. The Centenary Hospital for Women and Children an d Calvary Public Hospital worked together to develop a proposed system for a streamlined single entry point for public maternity services. We wanted to ensure pregnant women receive the right care at the right place, as close to home as possible. On 25 March 2019, we opened the Supporting Canberra mums and mu ms-to-be survey on the ACT Government's YourSay website, inviting the broader community to comment over a six week period. To engage the community, we: ! emailed more than 6000 YourSay subscribers notifying them about the survey ! boosted and targeted social media posts, which had a reach of o ver 28 000 ! featured on ACT Government social media pages ! ran digital signage across Can berra Health Services facilities ! produced web content including web banner on homepage of health .act.gov.au ! faxed General Practitioners and placed article in Capital Healt h Network digital newsletter ! published an intranet article and hardcopy memo to staff at Can berra Health Services and provided it to Calvary Public Hospital ! Generated media coverage on RiotACT. We received 735 responses compri sing 686 survey responses and 4 9 short comments. Overall, the response was very positive: ! 93 per cent of people said a single phone number would make it easier for them to access maternity services ! 86 per cent said it would be very important to meet a midwife e arly in their pregnancy to talk about pregnancy and birthing options through the public system. We used the feedback to refine t he new ACT system, which will l aunch by the end of 2019. Canberra Health Services 142 Annual Report 2018-19 ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER REPORTING We aim to build an inclusive workforce through employee awarene ss, understanding and engagement. We want to attract, recruit, develop and retain a w orkforce that reflects the community we serve, including Ab original and Torres Strait Isla nder peoples. Below are our Aboriginal and To rres Strait Islander employee pr ofiles before and after the restructure of ACT Health into two separate directorates on 1 O ctober 2018. Table 6: Previous ACT Health Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islan der Employee numbers Date Headcount of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Staff 30 June 2018 83 30 September 2018 81 Table 7: New Canberra Health Services Aboriginal and Torres Str ait Islander Employee numbers Date Headcount of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Staff Target for 2018-19 30 June 2019 76 77 On 30 June 2019, we demonstrated 99 per cent compliance with AC T Government wide targets. We recognise the important role our Aboriginal and Torres Strai t Islander staff play in sharing their skills and knowledge across the he alth sector. To increase our focus on employment and engagement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and further strengthen our ties with this group, we engaged a Workforce Inclusion Manager in June 2019. Our previous Reconciliation Action Plan 2015-2018 concluded on 31 December 2018, and our Workforce Inclusion Manager is developing a new plan tailored t o the needs of our organisation following the restructure and the formation of Canberra Health Services as a separate directorate late last year. We will revisit our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Workforce Action Plan 201 3-2018 after we finalise the Reconciliation Action Plan. We seek to increase th e number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people employed in the health workforce as this strengthens our ability to provide an effective, responsive and culturally safe health system, which is of mutual benefit to the community and our organisation. In 2019-20 we will form an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Steering Group to provide governance and direction to align workforce imperatives. We will also esta blish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Group Network.

Canberra Health Services 148 Annual Report 2018-19 ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Towards zero emissions Canberra Health Services supported ACT Health's asset managemen t requirements from 1 October to 30 June 2019, including through ecologically susta inable development. This section reflects the combined outcomes for both Canberra Health Service s and ACT Health Directorate. To help achieve the ACT Government's target of zero net emissio ns by 2020, we: ! engage with Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development D irectorate to develop a pathway toward a zero emissions health sector ! participate in the whole-of-gove rnment ecologically sustainable development initiatives ! continue to work towards embeddi ng sustainability initiatives i nto service delivery. We also work closely with the Environment, Planning and Sustain able Development Directorate on sustainability activities and initiatives. We also rely on whole-of-government documentation for guidance on digital health environment, sustainable transport and sustainable procurement, and on integ rating the related principles and practices into our decision-making. In 2018-19 we reduced our total greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions by more than 34 per cent on the previous year. This was mainly due to the reduction of emission s intensity of the ACT electricity grid due to the ACT's purchase of large-scale renewable energy. We continue to work closely with the Carbon Neutral Government team from Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate, using their tools and resources to promote staff behavioral changes. This year, for example, we: ! participated in training and education sessions on the Envizi E nterprise Sustainability Platform, the whole-of-government database used by directorates for track ing and reporting of utility consumption, cost and consequent emissions ! engaged with Energy Project Officers from the Carbon Neutral Go vernment team to identify potential energy and emissions reduction projects within Canber ra Health Services ! distributed promotional material designed to influence staff be havior in the workplace, for example, reporting water leaks and turning off lights in areas that are not in use. Canberra Health Services 149 Annual Report 2018-19 Energy We continually improve our built environment infrastructure thr ough our asset management program. During the year we upgraded or began upgrading key inf rastructure and plant and equipment including electrical and hydraulic infrastructure, bo ilers and chillers, as part of the Upgrading and Maintaining ACT Hea lth Assets program of works, g uided by the Strategic Asset Management Plan. In collaboration with the ACT Government's Infrastructure Finan ce and Capital Works unit, we upgraded a significant amount of electrical infrastructure on c ampus as part of the Electrical Main Switchboard Replacement project. This project will provide mete ring of all upgraded infrastructure, in addition to a modern Energy M anagement System. We will have significantly better understanding of how energy is c onsumed on campus. This will en able us to identify energy efficiency opportunities, and it will inform capital works proj ects and significant improvements in maintenance. We are upgrading the main chille r plant in Building 1 at Canber ra Hospitals to new highly efficient chillers with a best-in-class co ntrol system that will provide significant energy savings at low to moderate cooling requirements. Works are progressing well and d ue to complete by November 2019. We have also done modelling and forecasting of daily gas consum ption at the Canberra Hospital as part of managing the large market gas contract. This provides i mproved understanding of gas consumption at the site and allows us to routinely compare curr ent and historical consumption. We have also updated gas boilers in Building 1 and Building 3 t o optimise gas consumption. Building 1 boilers are the main boilers on Canberra Hospital campus, sup plying space heating and domestic hot water to a significant portion of the campus. We are also p lanning to upgrade a dditional boilers to more efficient units. The significant increase in dies el use for stationary energy is due to the use of embedded generators at the Canberra Hospital being used to facilitate the Electrica l Main Switchboard Replacement project. Embedded and additional temporary generators were used to take sections of the Canberra Hospital off the electricity grid to enable upgrade of grid con nections and main switchboards. Water The Upgrading and Maintaining AC T Health Assets program of work s has also involved significant works on the hydraulic infrastru cture of Canberra Hospital camp us. Hydraulic upgrades have: ! reduced the loss of water within the system due to leaks ! improved the ability to isolate specific sections of the hydrau lic infrastructure to enable maintenance and capital works ! improved temperature regulation throughout the campus ! simplified maintenance by standardising system components, and improved accessibility and identification of specific eleme nts through our asset naming co nvention ! created more robust systems by upgrading pumps and related infr astructure. Canberra Health Services 150 Annual Report 2018-19 Waste The total amount of general wast e generated during 2018-19 decr eased by an estimated 7.1 per cent compared with 2017-18. More than 120 tonnes of organic waste were diverted from landfi ll during the reporting period, an increase of more than 95 per cent on 2017-18. This significant increase was due to the introduction of an organic waste processing unit at the Canberra Hospital. We launched the 'Rethink Your Drink and Choose to Reuse' initia tive at the Canberra Hospital to further reduce coffee cups to la ndfill. The initiative includes a 20 cent discount for all staff, patients and visitors who use their own mug when buying a cup of coffee. We estimate more than 10 per cent of disposable cups are bei ng diverted from landfill throug h this initiative. In May 2019, ACTSmart held its tenth annual business sustainabi lity awards. Canberra Health Services was nominated in Waste Minimisation and Innovation Exc ellence categories. We won the category of Innovation Excellence, with the award presented by the Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability, Shane Rattenbury MLA. In addition, Canberra Hea lth Services became the first ACT Government directorate to achieve ACTSmart accreditation (for r ecycling) during the reporting period. Transport We replace our fleet vehicles in accordance with the ACT's Tran sition to Zero Emissions Vehicles Action Plan 2018-21. Where fit-for-purpose, at least 50 per cen t of passenger vehicles ordered to arrive in 2019-20 are zero emissions vehicles. At the end of 20 18-19, Canberra Health Services had a total of 82 hybrid vehicles and five Electric Vehicles (EV). During the year we worked with Environment, Planning and Sustai nable Development Directorate to install EV charge stations to su pport zero emissions vehicles a rriving in the next financial year. We continue to install Electronic Log Books into vehicles to impro ve reporting and enhance fleet usage data. At the end of 2018-19, we had 273 Electronic Log Books in stalled in fleet vehicles. Planning We are working collaboratively with ACT Health Directorate on m aster planning of the Territory's health infrastructure, to enable effective delivery of the infr astructure requirements we need to provide the health service the ACT and broader regional communi ty needs. The recently announced Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radi ology and Emergency (SPIRE) centre is a significant focus of current infrastructure planning. SPIR E is a key component of Canberra Hospital infrastructure developm ent and a significant step alon g the pathway to a zero emissions health sector. Canberra Health Services 151 Annual Report 2018-19 Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment Canberra Health Services provide s updates to the Commissioner f or Sustainability and the Environment on our progress implementing the Commissioner's rec ommendations from completed reports and inquiries.

Canberra Health Services 267 Annual Report 2018-19 PROCUREMENT PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES In 2018-19, Canberra Health Serv ices exercised procurement acti vities in accordance with the ACT Government tender thresholds and complied with procurement poli cies and procedures as stated in the Government Procurement Act 2001 and the Government Procurement Regulation 2007. To ensure compliance with ACT Government procurement legislatio n, Canberra Health Services: ! sought advice on government procurement policies and procedures from Procurement ACT ! notified Procurement ACT of all procurements over $25 000 under taken by Canberra Health Services ! appropriately referred procureme nts requiring single, restricti ve or open tender procurement processes to Procurement ACT ! referred all procurements requiring Government Procurement Boar d consideration and/or approval to Procurement ACT. In accordance with procurement legislation, Canberra Health Ser vices afforded the highest standard of probity and ethical behaviour towards prospective tenderers. Such behaviour included equality, impartiality, transparency and fair dealing. A competitive procurement process is conducted wherever possibl e. However, due to the specialised nature of the industry, Canberra Health Services fr equently accesses single select and restricted select procurement methodologies. These procurement methodologies are justified under the following circumstances: ! The procurement needs to be compatible with existing medical eq uipment, both hardware and software, within the clinical setting. ! Clinical units are seeking to standardise medical equipment wit h existing equipment. This mitigation strategy reduces the risk of human error in the deli very of clinical practice because equipment is familiar due to established equipment operating pr ocedures. ! A limited number of providers p ossess the specialised medical k nowledge and/or expertise that can fulfil Canberra Health Services' requirements. ! Timing may preclude public tenders being called in situations t hat could result in disruption to medical services. Single select and/or restricted select procurement processes ar e completed in accordance with the provisions of the Government Procurement Regulation 2007 and ar e approved by the Chief Executive Officer with a statement of justification, as require d by the Government Procurement Act 2001 . Frequently, Canberra Health Services relies on the NSW Departme nt of Commerce Standing Offer Agreements for restricted select procurement. Through open tend er, NSW has a selected panel of preferred suppliers/providers from which procurement is made. Canberra Health Services 268 Annual Report 2018-19 To use the buying power of the NSW Government, Canberra Health Services frequently asks panel suppliers to offer NSW Department of Commerce pricing on tender s. This strategy: ! increases the likelihood of bette r value for money to the Terri tory in comparison to a standalone open tender ! creates a more efficient procurement process. Social procurement is considered wherever possible. However, du e to the specialised nature of our operations, Canberra Health Services is not always able to cons ider using social enterprises. In 2018-19 Canberra Health Services engaged a Canberra Region Join t Organisation Indigenous supplier. External sources of labour and services To meet the healthcare needs of our growing city, Canberra Heal th Services engages consultants regularly to undertake work and provide expert advice in all ar eas of health care delivery and planning, including health infrastructure planning and design. These requirements vary from year to year. A large part of the expenditure for consultants in 2018-19 was associated with major health-related initiatives announced in the 2018-19 Budget. ACT Health engages a number of different types of consultants t o provide specialist technical advice on projects.
