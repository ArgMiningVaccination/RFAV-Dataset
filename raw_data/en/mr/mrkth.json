As such it provides deta ils on key legislation and the principal planning policies, wh ich are relevant to the Scheme, at both UK and Welsh levels, togethe r with the development planning policies of the local planning authorities, the administrative areas of which the Scheme runs t hrough. 5.1.2 Topic specific legislation and policies are set out in the assessment topic chapters (Chapters 6 - 15). 5.1.3 The Scheme will aid the achievement of the followin g legislative and policy objectives as outlined within this Chapt er. 5.2 Legislation Well-being of Future Generations Act (Wales) 2015 5.2.1 In order to strengthen the sustainable development framework in Wales, a pilot National Conversation was launched i n February 2014, to define the 'Wales We Want', led by the Com missioner for Sustainable Futures. The \"Wales We Want\" Repor t (Welsh Government and Sustain Wales, 2015), set out the se ven foundations for the well-being of future generation s. This resulted in the enactment of the Well-Being of Futu re Generations (Wales) Act 2015, in May 2015, which re quires 'public bodies to do things in pursuit of the econo mic, social, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales in a way that accords with the sustainable development principle' . 5.2.2 The Act defines sustainable development as 'the pro cess of improving the economic, social, environmental and c ultural well- being of Wales by taking action, in accordance with the sustainable development principle, aimed at achievi ng the well- being goals', and defines seven 'well-being' goals, as set out in Table 5.1 below. Table 5.1: Well-being Goals Goal Description of the Goal A prosperous Wales An innovative, productive and low carbon society which recognises the limits of the global environme nt and therefore uses resources efficiently and proportionately (including acting on climate change ); and which develops a skilled and well-educated population in an economy which generates wealth and provides employment opportunities, allowing Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-2 Goal Description of the Goal people to take advantage of the wealth generated through securing decent work A resilient Wales A nation which maintains and enhances a biodiverse natural environment with healthy functioning ecosystems that support social, economic and ecological resilience and the capacity to adapt to change (for example climate change). A healthier Wales A society in which people's physical and mental wel l- being is maximised and in which choices and behaviours that benefit future health are understoo d A more equal Wales A society that enables people to fulfil their poten tial no matter what their background or circumstances (including their socio economic background and circumstances). A Wales of cohesive communities Attractive, viable, safe and well-connected communities A Wales of vibrant culture and thriving Welsh language A society that promotes and protects culture, herit age and the Welsh language, and which encourages people to participate in the arts and sports and recreation. A globally responsible Wales A nation which, when doing anything to improve the economic, social, environmental and cultural well- being of Wales, takes account of whether doing such a thing may make a positive contribution to global well-being. 5.2.3 The Well-Being of Future Generations Act 2015 place s a duty on public bodies in Wales, including Welsh Government, to work towards achieving these goals, in order for actions to align to the Welsh Government's principles of sustainable develo pment. 5.2.4 The Act identifies the following five things that p ublic bodies must take account of when acting in accordance with the sustainable development principles. Long-term - the importance of balancing short term needs with the need to safeguard the ability to also meet long-term needs; Integration - considering how the public body's wel l-being objectives may impact upon each of the well-being g oals, on their other objectives, or on the objectives of oth er public bodies; Involvement - the importance of involving people wi th an interest in achieving the well-being goals, and ens uring that those people reflect the diversity of the area whic h the body serves; Collaboration - acting in collaboration with any ot her person (or different parts of the body itself) that could help the body to meet its well-being objectives; and Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-3 Prevention - how acting to prevent problems occurri ng or getting worse may help public bodies meet their obj ectives. 5.2.5 Following the next National Assembly for Wales's el ection, each public body is required under the Act to publish a set of well-being objectives 'designed to maximise their contribution to achieving each of the well-being goals'. The well-being goals will form the framework of these objectives, as well as indicator s to be used to measure well-being, which the Welsh Government r ecently consulted on (\"How do you measure a nation's progre ss?\" (Welsh Government, 2015a)). 5.2.6 When publishing its well-being objectives each publ ic body must publish a statement explaining why it considers tha t meeting the objectives will contribute to the achievement of th e well-being goals and how it has applied the sustainable develo pment principle. Following the initial statement public bodies are required to publish an annual report showing the pr ogress they have made in meeting their objectives. Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013 5.2.7 The Active Travel (Wales) Act gained Royal Assent o n the 4 November 2013. It legislates for the provision of travel routes designed for cycling and walking and in particular makes provision: For approved maps of existing active travel routes and related facilities in a local authority's area; For approved integrated network maps of the new and improved active travel routes and related facilitie s needed to create integrated networks of active travel routes and related facilities in a local authority's area; Requiring local authorities to have regard to integ rated network maps in preparing transport policies and to secure that there are new and improved active travel route s and related facilities; Requiring the Welsh Ministers to report on active t ravel in Wales; Requiring the Welsh Ministers and local authorities , in the performance of functions under the Highways Act 198 0, to take reasonable steps to enhance the provision made for walkers and cyclists and to have regard to the need s of walkers and cyclists in the exercise of certain oth er functions; and Requiring the Welsh Ministers and local authorities to exercise their functions under the Act so as to promote acti ve travel Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-4 journeys and secure new and improved active travel routes and related facilities. 5.2.8 The Act created new duties for local authorities in Wales and the Welsh Ministers. It also gives the Welsh Ministers the power to issue guidance on the location, nature and conditio n of active travel routes and facilities to ensure they are sui table for use. Such guidance has been published in the form of gui dance notes. The Welsh Government has published guidance: The Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013 - Design Guidanc e (Welsh Government, 2013); Statutory Guidance for the Delivery of the Active T ravel (Wales) Act 2013 (Welsh Government, 2014); The Active Travel Action Plan (Welsh Government, 20 16). 5.2.9 Powys County Council are addressing the requirement s of the Act in the \"Draft Mid Wales Joint Local Transport P lan 2015- 2020\". Gwynedd Council are addressing the requireme nts of the Act in the \"North Wales Joint Local Transport Plan Consultation 2015-2020\". Both of these Local Transport Plans hav e undergone consultation. 5.2.10 Welsh ministers have identified those built-up area s with a population greater than 2,000 people in which the A ctive Travel Act will apply. Within the Powys unitary authority area, Machynlleth is listed as a named settlement area wh ereby Powys County Council has to identify, improve and promote designated \"active travel routes \" within any town that has a population of over 2,000 residents. 5.2.11 The Active Travel Routes is at the post-consultatio n stage. Powys County Council considered the requirements of the new duties through the development of an \"Active Travel Routes - Machynlleth\" map which identified seven cycling \"ac tive travel routes\" in Machynlleth, further details of which ar e provided in Chapter 13 (Effects on All Travellers). This was co nsulted on in September to October 2015, with the consultation cl osing on Friday 27 November 2015. By law each authority had to produce a draft map of their County showing all the designa ted active travel routes and to have submitted this to the Min ister by 22 January 2016. Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 5.2.12 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) (WCA) has been and remains the principal mechanism for the pr otection of wildlife in the UK for more than three decades. WC A comprises four parts. Part 1 covers the protection of wildli fe, including birds, their nests and eggs; wild animals, mammals and wil d plants. Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-5 Part 2 extends to the countryside, national parks, the designation of protected areas including Sites of Special Scien tific Interest (SSSI), limestone pavements, national nature reserv es, and grants by the national nature conservation bodies i n England and Wales. Part III covers public rights of way, inclu ding footpaths and bridleways whilst Part IV deals with miscellane ous provisions. 5.2.13 Sections 28 to 33 of Part 2 of the WCA detail the l aw regarding SSSIs. The WCA provides for the notification and c onfirmation of SSSIs - sites identified for their flora, fauna geological or physiographic features by the relevant national con servation body, in Wales, Natural Resources Wales (NRW). 5.2.14 Schedule 9 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (CROW, 2000) introduced a new Section to the WCA, Section 28G, which places a duty on the Welsh Government \"i n exercising its functions so far as their exercise is likely to aff ect the flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features by reason of which a site of special scientific interest is of special i nterest \" to \" take reasonable steps, consistent with the proper exerci se of the authority's functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of the flora, fauna or geological or ph ysiographical features by reason of which the site is of special scientific interest \". Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 5.2.15 The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2 006 (NERC Act) was designed to help achieve a rich and diverse natural environment and thriving rural communities through modernised and simplified arrangements for deliveri ng UK Government policy. The Act implemented key element s of the (then) UK Labour Government's Rural Strategy publis hed in July 2004. 5.2.16 The NERC Act established Natural England and made amendments to both the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Sectio n 40 sets out a duty to conserve biodiversity whereby \"every public authority must, in exercising its functions, have r egard, so far as is consistent with the proper exercise of those fun ctions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity\", whilst Section 42 requires the National Assembly of Wales to \"publish a list o f the living organisms and types of habitat which in the Assembl y's opinion are of principal importance for the purpose of cons erving biodiversity\". \"Conserving biodiversity includes, in relation to a living organism or type of habitat, restoring or en hancing a population or habitat\" (Section 40(3)). Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-6 Climate Change Act (2008) 5.2.17 The Act makes it the duty of the Secretary of State to ensure that the net UK carbon account for all six Kyoto greenho use gases for the year 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 b aseline, toward avoiding dangerous climate change. The Act a ims to enable the United Kingdom to become a low-carbon ec onomy and gives ministers powers to introduce the measure s necessary to achieve a range of greenhouse gas reduction targ ets. 5.2.18 The Scheme aims to ensure that flood risk to third parties is not increased and to minimise the impact of transport i mprovements on biodiversity and water resources. Environment Act (Wales) 2016 5.2.19 The Environment (Wales) Act (2016) came into force on 21 March 2016. The Act will enable Wales' resources to be managed in a more proactive, integrated and sustain able way and to establish the legislative framework necessar y to tackle climate change. 5.2.20 The Act compliments the Well-being of Future Genera tions (Wales) Act 2015 and the Planning (Wales) Act 2015 (see above). The principle that connects these three pie ces of legislation is the commitment to sustainable develo pment as the best way to improve the well-being of Wales now and for future generations. 5.2.21 The Act is divided into seven parts of which the fo llowing are directly relevant to the Scheme: Part 1: Sustainable management of natural resources ; Part 2: Climate change; and Part 7: Flood and Coastal Erosion Committee and lan d drainage. 5.2.22 Section 6 of the Environment Act (Wales) 2016 place s a duty on public authorities to 'seek to maintain and enhance biodiversity' so far as it is consistent with the proper exercise of those functions. Public authorities must also seek to 'pr omote the resilience of ecosystems'. To assist in complying w ith this duty, public authorities must have regard to the list of living organisms and habitats published under section 7 of the Act. 5.2.23 The specific provisions of the Act include helping to plan and manage Wales' natural resources at a national and l ocal level through three key features - a State of Natural Res ources Report (Natural Resources Wales, 2016), a National Natural Resources Policy (Welsh Government, 2015b), and Area Statemen ts. Collectively these are designed to ensure that the sustainable Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-7 management of Wales' natural resources will be a co re consideration in decision-making. 5.2.24 The first key feature is the requirement for NRW to produce every five years before each National Assembly of Wales e lection a 'State of Natural Resources Report' that provides a n assessment of natural resources and how well they are being ma naged in a sustainable way. 5.2.25 The second key feature is the requirement for the W elsh Government to produce a 'National Natural Resources Policy' that sets out the priorities and opportunities for managing the natural resources of Wales sustainably, taking into account the findings of the State of Natural Resources Report. The policy will take into account other sources of information, suc h as the Future Trends Report and evidence from progress tow ards the well-being goals contained within the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 (see above). 5.2.26 Through the National Natural Resources Policy, Wels h Ministers will set priorities and opportunities for the susta inable management of natural resources in Wales, including actions to be taken in relation to climate change. 5.2.27 The policy will promote a joined up approach to oth er/future policies that the Welsh Government develops, as wel l as supporting the achievement of the well-being goals in the Well- being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and th e Planning (Wales) Act 2015 (see above). The policy will also set the context for the area statements (see below) to ensu re that the national priorities for sustainable management of n atural resources in Wales inform the local delivery approa ch. 5.2.28 The third key feature is the preparation of Area St atements by NRW which set out the priorities, risks and opportu nities for managing the natural resources of Wales sustainably and outline what action needs to be taken at a local level. Ar ea Statements will consider the evidence from the State of Natura l Resources Report 1 and implement the priorities and opportunities ide ntified by the National Natural Resources Policy for the su stainable management of natural resources at the local level. NRW can also use the Area Statements to help deliver any of its functions, for example rationalising, where appropriate, any p lans, programmes or strategies. 5.2.29 The Act replaces the existing duty in Section 40 of the NERC Act 2006 (see above) in relation to Wales, with a duty on public authorities to seek to maintain and enhance biodive rsity. 1 Natural Resources Wales (September 2016), A summar y of the State of Natural Resources Report: An assessment of the sustainable management of natural resources Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-8 5.2.30 The Act also introduces statutory emission reductio n targets and carbon budgeting to support their delivery. The fi rst budgetary period will be for 2016-2020 and then every five ye ars up until 2050. Each carbon budget will be set in advance, w ith the first and second carbon budgets set before the end of 201 8. Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2016 5.2.31 The Historic Environment (Wales) Act came into forc e on 21 March 2016 and forms part of a suite of legislation , policy, advice and guidance that makes important improvements to t he existing systems for the protection and sustainable manageme nt of the Welsh historic environment. In broad terms, the Ac t gives more effective protection to listed buildings and schedu led monuments, enhances existing mechanisms for the sus tainable management of the historic environment, and introdu ces greater transparency and accountability into decisions take n on the historic environment. 5.2.32 The Act makes important changes to the two main UK laws that provide the legislative framework for the protectio n and management of the historic environment: the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Act also incorporates three stand-alone provisi ons. The Act will: give more effective protection to listed buildings and scheduled ancient monuments; improve the sustainable management of the historic environment; and introduce greater transparency and accountability i nto decisions taken on the historic environment. 5.3 National Planning Policy 5.3.1 Current national planning policy is contained withi n the Welsh Spatial Plan, Planning Policy Wales (Edition 9, Nov ember 2016) and is supplemented by various Technical Advice Not es (TANs). People, Places, Future: The Wales Spatial Plan (Update 2008) 5.3.2 The Wales Spatial Plan will be replaced by the Nati onal Development Framework (NDF) which is provided for i n the Planning (Wales) Act 2015. The purpose of the NDF i s to identify national scale areas of growth and new investment, setting out key Welsh Government land use policies. The NDF is currently programmed to be approved by the National Assembly in 2019. Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-9 5.3.3 The Wales Spatial Pan - People, Places, Future was originally adopted by the Welsh Government in November 2004 an d was updated in July 2008. The overall role, purpose and principles of the Wales Spatial Plan are set out at paragraph 1.2 they include: Making sure that decisions are taken with regard to their impact beyond the immediate sectoral or administrat ive boundaries and that the core values of sustainable development govern everything we do; Setting the context for local and community plannin g; Influencing where money is spent by the Welsh Gover nment through an understanding of the roles of and intera ctions between places; and Providing a clear evidence base for the public, pri vate and third sectors to develop policy and action. 5.3.4 It is a principle of the Wales Spatial Plan that de velopment should be sustainable. Sustainable development is about i mproving wellbeing and quality of life by integrating social , economic and environmental objectives in the context of more eff icient use of natural resources. 5.3.5 The A487 New Dyfi Bridge is located in Central Wale s as defined by Chapter 19 of the Wales Spatial Plan. The vision for the Central Wales is for 'High-quality living and worki ng in smaller- scale settlements set within a superb environment, providing dynamic models of rural sustainable development, mo ving all sectors to higher value-added activities' (WSP, 200 8, p 39). Planning Policy Wales (Edition 9, November 2016) 5.3.6 Planning Policy Wales (PPW9) sets out the land use planning policies of the Welsh Government. It seeks to prom ote resource efficient settlement patterns that minimise land ta ke and urban sprawl, especially through preferences for the full and effective re-use of previously developed land and buildings. 5.3.7 Section 8 of PPW9 refers to the Welsh Government's aims to extend choice in transport and secure accessibility in a way which supports sustainable development and helps to tackle the causes of climate change by; encouraging a more eff ective and efficient transport system, with greater use of the more sustainable and healthy forms of travel and minimis ing the need to travel. Paragraph 8.1.1 of PPW8 states that thi s will be achieved through integration: within and between different types of transport; between transport measures and land use planning; Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-10 between transport measures and policies to protect and improve the environment; and between transport measures and policies for educati on, health, social inclusion and wealth creation. 5.3.8 The main change between PPW9 and the previous versi on of Planning Policy Wales published in January 2016 (PP W8) is that Chapter 4 (Planning for Sustainability) has been up dated to take into account the statutory purpose of the planning system which was introduced by the Planning (Wales) Act 2015. Th ere have also been minor amendments to take account of the c oming into force of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wale s) Act 2015. In addition, minor changes have been made regarding Design and Access Statements, linked to the Planning (Wale s) Act 2015. 5.3.9 With respect to the Well-being of Future Generation s (Wales) Act 2015 the amendments insert information on the provi sions of the Act, including the seven well-being goals and the s ustainable development principle. The description of legislat ive requirements for sustainable development in the pla nning system has also been updated. The changes also ill ustrate how the Welsh Government's planning policy objectives l ink to the well-being goals. Technical Advice Note 15: Development and Flood Risk (July 2004) 5.3.10 TAN 15 provides technical guidance which supplement s the policy set out in Planning Policy Wales in relation to development and flooding. It advises on development and flood r isk as this relates to sustainability principles and provides a framework within which risks arising from both river and coas tal flooding, and from additional run-off from development in any location, can be assessed. 5.3.11 For proposals located in zone C (the applicable des ignation for the Scheme) developers need to demonstrate that the development can be justified in that location and t hat the consequences associated with flooding are acceptabl e, please refer to Chapter 15 Drainage and Water Environment. One of the acceptability criteria under Appendix 1 of TAN 15 i s that a development should not increase the risk of floodin g elsewhere. Technical Advice Note 18: Transport (March 2007) 5.3.12 TAN 18 encourages an efficient and sustainable tran sport system as a requirement for modern society. It sta tes that to achieve a more sustainable pattern of development i t is necessary to understand the interactions and linkag es between Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-11 land use and transport and devises integrated strat egies, objectives and policies at the national, regional a nd local levels. 5.3.13 PPW8 and the Wales Transport Strategy (at paragraph 2.2) both aim to secure the provision of transport infrastruc ture and services, which improve accessibility, build a stro nger economy, improve road safety and foster more sustainable com munities. This includes: Integration of transport and land use planning; Integration between different types of transport; a nd Integration of transport with policies for the envi ronment, education, social, justice, health, economic develo pment and wealth creation. 5.3.14 TAN 18 continues to state that planning authorities should identify improvements that need to be made to the e xisting public transport interchange that could improve their use. Technical Advice Note 12: Design (July 2014) 5.3.15 TAN 12 is aimed principally at promoting sustainabi lity through good design, planning for sustainable buildings and Design and Access Statements. In so doing it takes a holistic view of design and explains how, for example, environmental sustai nability, through achieving efficient use and protection of n atural resources, enhancing biodiversity, and designing fo r change, can be integrated into the design process. 5.3.16 Referring back to PPW (see above) it defines design as \" the relationship between all elements of the natural an d built environment. To create sustainable development, des ign must go beyond aesthetics and include the social, enviro nmental and economic aspects of the development, including its construction, operation and management, and its relationship to i ts surroundings \". Programme for Government 5.3.17 Taking Wales Forward 2016 - 2021 sets out the gover nment's programme to drive improvement in the Welsh economy and public services, delivering a Wales which is prospe rous and secure, healthy and active, ambitious and learning, united and connected. Taking Wales Forward 2016-2021 outlines this government's priorities for delivering those improv ements. They are ambitious measures, aimed at making a differenc e for everyone, at every stage in their lives. 5.3.18 Taking Wales Forward sets out the four areas where the Welsh Government can make the biggest difference to the l ives of the Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-12 people of Wales, now and in the future. Our aim is to create a Wales that is: Prosperous and Secure; Healthy and Active; Ambitious and Learning; and United and Connected. 5.3.19 Taking Wales Forward aims to: Deliver an M4 relief road, and improvements to the A55, the A40 in West Wales and other trunk roads; Ensure better access to active travel for all; Make progress towards our goal of reducing our gree nhouse emissions by at least 80% by 2050 and continue our work to protect and enhance biodiversity and local ecosyste ms; Further our lead over other nations in recycling an d minimising landfill; Connect communities through sustainable and resilie nt infrastructure; and Manage, use and enhance Wales' natural resources to support long-term well-being. 5.3.20 The Scheme aims to ensure better access for all and connect communities through sustainable and resilient infra structure. 5.4 Other Relevant Documents at National Level 5.4.1 Other documents published by Welsh Government of di rect relevance to the Scheme can be grouped under the ge neral headings of transport, economics, environment, and climate change. However, all have been written within the f ramework of sustainable development, and as such need to be con sidered collectively as well as individually. One Wales: One Planet (May 2009) 5.4.2 One Wales: One Planet was first launched by the Wel sh Government in May 2009. This document sets out the objectives to achieving the goal of sustainable development. One Wales: One Planet defines sustainable development as \" enabling all people throughout the world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life without compromising the quality of life of future generations .\" (One Wales: One Planet, 2009, page 8). 5.4.3 In Wales this means achieving a better quality of l ife for our own and future generations by: Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-13 Promoting social justice and equality of opportunit y; and Enhance the natural and cultural environment and re spect its limits - using only our fair share of the earth's r esources and sustaining our cultural legacy. 5.4.4 One Wales: One Planet also sets out sustainable dev elopment as a core principle to the Welsh Government's found ling statute and has a statutory duty to create a Scheme setting out how they propose to promote sustainable development. The Sch eme is not separate from One Wales agenda, but provides a unifying vision set of operational principles that will thre ad through, support and drive all policies and programmes succi nctly to deliver sustainable development. 5.4.5 Within the document, five main chapters will demons trate the actions that will be taken to deliver sustainable; they are set out under the following headings: Sustainable Resource Use; Sustaining the Environment; A Sustainable Economy; A Sustainable Society; and The Wellbeing of Wales. Wales Transport Strategy - One Wales: Connecting the Nation (April 2008) 5.4.6 One Wales: Connecting the Nation is the Wales Trans port Strategy published in April 2008. The document est ablishes a National framework for transport planning in Wales. 5.4.7 The main aim of One Wales: Connecting the Nation is \"to promote sustainable transport networks that safegua rd the environment while strengthening our country's econo mic and social life.\" The One Wales Programme is working towards promoting sustainable transport between communities in different parts of Wales to access services, jobs a nd facilities and sustainable, which will support the growth of the e conomy. 5.4.8 Connecting the Nation endorses that a good transpor t system is central to achieving a vibrant economy and social j ustice through equality of access and greater mobility. It sees tr ansport as having a leading role to play in adapting to the im pacts of climate change. Fundamentally, economic prosperity is at th e forefront of Connecting the Nation in order to connect people with businesses for employment and businesses with their customers and suppliers. Chapter 4 of the strategy provides t he focus for the national and regional plans.

Welsh Government's Nationa l Transport Finance Plan was released in July 2015. T he plan sets out investment for transport and services, with the delivery of the timescale extending beyond the Plan period 2015 to 2020. The foreword to the plan emphasises that: 5.4.10 'Transport has a critical role to play in improving Wales' economic competitiveness and provides enhanced access to job s and services. When delivering our investment in transpo rt, it is important to focus on how it can serve the needs of businesses to enable them to prosper; and allow people to acce ss the opportunities they need to live healthy, sustainabl e and fulfilling lives' . 5.4.11 The plan sets out in detail how the Welsh Governmen t proposes to deliver the outcomes set out in the Wales Transp ort Strategy from 2015 and beyond. The Finance Plan is not a pol icy document but provides the timescales, budgets and l ikely sources of financing for Schemes being undertaken b y Welsh Government. 5.4.12 A delivery schedule is set out in Annex A of the Fi nance Plan to cover the next five year period (between April 2015 and March 2020) and in the medium term (beyond April 2020). U nder new road Schemes to be constructed, Scheme reference R2 3 is 'A487 Dyfi Bridge' with a delivery period of 2015 t o 2020. Mid Wales Joint Local Transport Plan 2015-2020 5.4.13 The Local Transport Plan (LTP) has been jointly pro duced by the three Mid Wales Local Authorities of Ceredigion Cou nty Council, Gwynedd Council, and Powys County Council. The Loca l Authorities are required to produce a Local Transpo rt Plan under Section 108 of the Transport Act 2000 as amended by Transport (Wales) Act 2006 5.4.14 The Mid Wales LTP draws on the TraCC Regional Trans port Plan (RTP) and recent work following the RTP includ ing strategies for walking and cycling/ active travel, highways and the bus and community transport network. 5.4.15 The Plan has been developed in accordance with the Welsh Government 'Guidance to Local Transport Authorities - Local Transport Plan 2015' (May 2014). The Plan sets out the regions intended Outcomes and Higher Level Interventions fo r transport in Mid Wales.

The LTP is a stat utory document that will sit alongside the Local Developm ent Plans and other policies and plans of each of the Local A uthorities once adopted. Trunk Road Estate Biodiversity Action Plan (2004- 2014) 5.4.17 The Welsh Government, as the Highway Authority for Wales, has direct responsibility for the maintenance, improvem ent and development of the trunk road and motorway network for Wales. Under the Countryside and Rights of Way (CRoW) Act 2000, Welsh Government has a duty to have a regard for th e conservation of biodiversity in its work. The Welsh Government Transport Directorate is already incorporating biod iversity into its work, and the Trunk Road Estate Biodiversity Action Plan (TREBAP) is to contribute to this ongoing process. The Objectives of the TREBAP, within the constraints of recourses and road safety, are to: set practical and realistic actions and targets for the period 2004 - 2014; link with other relevant Biodiversity Action Plan t argets for habitats and species; increase awareness of the Transport Directorate's s taff and contractors, its environmental partners, and the ge neral public, of the biodiversity interest of the trunk r oad and motorway network; encourage the use, and dissemination, of best pract ice for biodiversity in the management and development of t he trunk road and motorway network; and reflect the requirements of the Assembly's Sustaina ble Development Scheme and Action Plan where relevant. 5.4.18 TREBAP sets out a number of Habitat Action Plans an d Species Action Plans some of which are directly relevant to the Scheme, further reference to which is provided in Chapter 9 (Nature Conservation). Although the action plan is dated up to 2014, it is still current. Economic Renewal, A New Direction (July 2010) 5.4.19 Economic Renewal, A New Direction published in July 2010, sets out the role that the Welsh Government can play in providing the best conditions and framework to enable the private sector to grow and flourish. Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-16 5.4.20 Part 3 of the document encourages investment in hig h quality and sustainable infrastructure to underpin economic growth. People, businesses and communities need to be well connected within and beyond Wales, and to have access to the right facilities and services where they live and work. I nvestors and indigenous businesses must be able to count on communications, transport, energy and other infrast ructure necessary for 21st century enterprise. 5.4.21 The document continues to state that people cannot work if they are not linked to their jobs, training and public s ervices. Businesses cannot operate without access to the lab our forces, materials and markets. Furthermore, faster physica l connections like an efficient and reliable road network increas e productivity because they save time and therefore lower costs. Environment Strategy for Wales (2006) 5.4.22 The Environment Strategy for Wales was published in 2006 and outlines the Welsh Government's long-term strategy for the environment of Wales for the next 20 years. It pro vides a framework within which to achieve an environment, w hich is clean, healthy, biologically diverse and valued by the people of Wales. 5.4.23 The last Environmental Strategy annual progress rep ort for 2010 - 2011 was published at the end of 2011 which coinc ided with the end of the second action plan. The action plan foc uses on ten themes, of which seven - biodiversity, access and r ecreation, flood and water management, ecosystem services, the historic environment, people and the environment, and enviro nmental quality - are relevant to the A487 New Dyfi Bridge. The most recent State of the Environment Report was publishe d in July 2012.Welsh Government is currently reviewing the En vironment Strategy to ensure that it reflects the relevant co mmitments in the Natural Resource Management Programme. Capturing the Potential - A Green Job Strategy for Wales (July 2009) 5.4.24 The strategy delivers the commitment made in the On e Wales programme of Government to develop a Green Jobs Str ategy. The Green Jobs Strategy provides an important deliv ery mechanism for our Sustainable Development Scheme, O ne Wales: One Planet and describes in more detail how we can achieve the vision of: 5.4.25 'A resilient and sustainable economy for Wales that is able to develop whilst stabilising then reducing, use of na tural resources and reducing its contribution to climate change'.

The Framework for the strateg y's delivery is organised into three-high level priorities. 5.4.28 These being: Priority 1: Supporting Business; Priority 2: Fostering Innovation and Technology; an d Priority 3: Investing in a More Sustainable Economy The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan (July 2009) 5.4.29 The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan was published in July 2009; it is the UK Government's plan to tackle climate ch ange. The UK Government has a five point plan to tackle climate change by: Protecting the public from immediate risk; Preparing for the future; Limiting the severity of future climate change thro ugh a new international climate agreement; Building a low carbon UK; and Supporting individuals, communities and businesses to play their part. 5.4.30 Within the Low Carbon Plan a section is dedicated t o transport. It highlights that domestic transport in the UK con tributes to approximately a fifth of the UK's greenhouse gas em issions. In an effort to combat the increasing emissions the pl an states it will: Continue to improve fuel efficiency of new conventi onal vehicles; Support the low carbon vehicles and fuels of the fu ture; Encourage people to make low carbon travel decision s; Require international aviation and shipping to redu ce emissions; and Secure oil supplies to the UK by sustaining investm ent in the North Sea and work to improve the functioning of in ternational Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-18 oil markets and working with the downstream oil ind ustry to address the issues that sector face. Climate Change Strategy for Wales (October 2010) 5.4.31 The Climate Change Strategy for Wales sets out the Welsh Government's plan to tackle the causes the conseque nces of climate change. The Welsh Government's key target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3% per year from 2011 i n areas of devolved competence. 5.4.32 Section 8 of the Strategy refers to the transport s ector, which is most relevant to the Scheme. To reduce transport em issions the Welsh Government sets out the following actions: Develop sustainable travel centres and supporting ' Smarter Choices'; Promote eco-driving, walking and cycling; Invest in bus and rail services and improve traffic management; and Promote infrastructure of electric and hydrogen veh icles. 5.4.33 The Strategy states that the transport sector is re sponsible for a fifth of gas emissions are caused by the transport sector and there is no one solution to combat the emissions, i t therefore requires a combination of actions, as outlined abov e, to reduce carbon emissions and encourage behavioural change w ithin the transport sector. Climate Change Strategy for Wales - Adaption Delivery Plan (2010) 5.4.34 The Climate Change Strategy for Wales includes an ' Adaptation Delivery Plan'. This will help to recognise our beh aviour and how we can adapt to changes that may affect many aspect s of our lives in the future. 5.4.35 The adaption plan sets out specific policies and pr ogrammes that the Welsh Government expects to implement in delive ring the Adaptation Framework. The Delivery Plan has 24 acti ons which will be addressed under the following categories: Strategic Actions; Natural Environment; Infrastructure; Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-19 Climate Change Strategy for Wales - Emissions Reduction Plan (2010) 5.4.36 The Climate Change Strategy also includes an Emissi ons Reduction Plan. To reiterate the Government intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3% per annum, therefore the emissions reduction plan sets out the actions that will take place to achieve this target. This Plan is updated every year to ensure that the target is being delivered. 5.4.37 The plan outlines the contribution each sector acro ss Wales has to make to achieve the 3% reduction target. The We lsh Government state in the plan: \"At this point, we anticipate that measures implemented by the Welsh Government will d eliver emissions savings of 2.71 MtCO2e in 2020. This will contribute 0.89% towards our 3% target (or 30% of the total re quired emission reductions).\" (Emissions Reduction Plan, 2010, page 3). 5.4.38 In particular to transport, it is expected that emi ssion reductions from the Welsh Governments actions will contribute to 0.29 MtCO2e in 2020, which will be a 0.10 to the 3% emis sion reduction target. 5.5 Local Planning Policy 5.5.1 The Scheme falls within Powys County Council and is partly within the Snowdonia National Park (largely coverin g the part of the Scheme which is within Gwynedd). The Snowdonia National Park Authority is the local planning authority with in the National Park. It should be noted that Snowdonia National Pa rk Authority and Powys County Council are statutory consultees f or planning applications and Gwynedd Council has no planning ju risdiction within the study area. 5.5.2 The local planning context which the Scheme has reg ard to is set out within the Unitary Development Plans (UDPs) and draft Local Development Plans (LDP) for the local authority are as in which the Scheme is located, namely Snowdonia National Pa rk Authority and Powys County Council. Powys County Council 5.5.3 The Powys Unitary Development Plan 2011-2021 was ad opted in March 2010. The UDP is made up of two parts. Par t 1 contains: The broad Strategic Vision; The 19 Strategic Aims; The Sustainable Growth Strategy; Llywodraeth Cymru / Welsh Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-20 A hierarchical approach to settlements and communit y development; and 14 Strategic Policies. 5.5.4 Part 2 of the UDP contains more detailed and (in so me cases) site-specific policies and proposals. Where the Str ategic Policies and site-specific policies are relevant to the Sche me, further details are provided in the Policy and Guidance sec tions of the relevant environmental topic chapters (chapters 6 - 15). Snowdonia National Park Authority 5.5.5 The Eryri Local Development Plan (LDP) 2007-2022 is the adopted plan in the Snowdonia National Park. It was adopted by Snowdonia National Park Authority on the 13 July, 2 011. This takes precedence over the council UDPs where the tw o overlap. 5.5.6 The Local Development Plan aims to reflect the land use implications of the Snowdonia National Park Managem ent Plan (2010-2015) as well as providing an opportunity to deliver the spatial elements of other plans and strategies at t he national, regional and local level. The Eryri LDP sets out th e following objectives: Protecting, enhancing and managing the natural environment; Protecting and enhancing the cultural and historic environment; Promoting healthy and sustainable communities; Supporting the rural economy; and Promoting accessibility and inclusion; 5.5.7 The LDP includes strategic policies and development policies which will deliver the long-term spatial vision for the future of Snowdonia National Park. Strategic policies provide the overarching approach for development while the deve lopment policies help in delivering the strategic policies by providing further detailed guidance against which planning ap plications will be assessed. The following Eryri LDP policies are r elevant to the Scheme and are outlined in detail within the Policy and Guidance sections of the relevant environmental topic chapte rs (chapters 6-15): SP:A National Park Purposes and Government A487 New Dyfi Bridge Environmental Statement - Volume 1: Chapter 5 Legislative and Policy Context 900237-ARP-ZZ-ZZ-RP-YE-00027 | Final Issue | Septem ber 2017 Page 5-21 SP:Ch Social and Physical Infrastructure and Traditional Buildings; and SP:L Accessibility and Transport.
