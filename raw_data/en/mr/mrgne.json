To help our ACAAI Annual Scienti c Meeting exhibitors and industry partners in ful lling the mandatory reporting provisions of the Sunshine Act, the College is requesting U.S. health care provider attendees to supply their 10-digit NPI (National Provider Identi er) number when registering for the Annual Scienti c Meeting. The NPI will be embedded in the bar code data on the attendee's badge - it will NOT be printed on the badge. Exhibitors can download the NPI information by scanning the badge through a lead retrieval system so that they can record and track any reportable transactions.
