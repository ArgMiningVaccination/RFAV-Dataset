Dysregulation in any phase of the wound healing cascade delays healing and may result in various skin pathologies, including nonhealing, or chronic ulceration. Indigenous and traditional medicines make extensive use of natural productsandderivativesofnaturalproductsandprovidemorethanhalfofallmedicinesconsumedtodaythroughouttheworld. Recognising the important role traditional medicine continues to play, we have undertaken an extensive survey of literature reporting the use of medical plants and plant-based products for cutaneous wounds. We describe the active Centella asiatica, Curcuma longa, andPaeonia are popular wound healing products used by severalculturesandethnicgroups.4Z'hepopularityandevidenceofcontinueduseclearlyindicatesthattherearestilllessonstobelearned from traditional practices. Hidden in the myriad of natural products and derivatives from natural products are undescribed reagents, unexplored combinations, and adjunct compounds that could have a place in the contemporary therapeutic inventory. 1.Introduction Ourskinisthekeytooursurvival,sensingtheenvironment, maintaining physicochemical and thermal homeostasis,actingasareservoirofessentialnutrients,providingpassive andactivedefence,andrespondingtotraumaandinjury[1]. Maintaining these critical functions requires robust andeective mechanisms to protect it from trauma and insultand to repair and replace critical skin functions whendamaged or lost. Humans have been treating their woundsformillennia[2].Traditionalwoundmanagementislimitedby what is immediately at hand or can be acquired locally,such as water, soil, and plant and animal products, and isfrequently complemented with ceremony and ritual as anadded measure. For millions of people across Asia, Africa,the Middle East, and Latin America, traditional medicinesderived from local plants, animals,and natural productsarethemainstayofwoundcare;forsome,itistheonlysourceofwound care [3]. We discuss herein some of the evidencesupporting the use of medicinal plants as eective and af-fordable treatments for cutaneous wounds. 2.Cutaneous Wound Healing Maintaining homeostasis is critical for the survival of theorganism; hence, skin needs and possesses a robust andeectiverepairmechanism.Cutaneouswoundhealingistheprocess by which skin repairs itself following injury causedby surgery, trauma, and burns [4]. 4Z'he healing process isclassically divided into 4 phases (Figure 1): coagulationHindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2019, Article ID 2684108, 30 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2684108(a.k.a. haemostasis), inflammation and proliferation (a.k.a. granulation),andremodelling(a.k.a.maturation)[5].Upon injury, a brin clot rapidly forms to restore haemostasis [6, 7]. Platelets present in the blood trigger the clottingcascade and secrete several growth factors,initiating woundhealing [8]. In the following inflammation phase, neutro-phils migrate into the wound site engulng foreign debrisandkillingbacteriabyphagocytosisandreleasingproteolyticenzymes[8, 9].Coincidently,bloodmonocytes inltratetheinjury site and growth factor-beta1(TGF-1),thatstimulatesthemigrationofbroblasts it involves extracellular matrix (ECM), mainly colla-gen, to form the granulation tissue which replaces thedamaged tissue. Meanwhile, the keratinocytes migrate,proliferate,dierentiate,andre-formafunctionalepidermis(reepithelialization), closing the lesion and protecting un-derlying tissues from further trauma [13]. As the wound matures,thecharacteristicdisorganizedECMofgranulation tissue is actively remodelled by the dermal of wound healing isscartissue(akabrosis)withsparselydistributedbroblastswithin a collagen-rich ECM. Compared to the originaltissue, scar tissue, having distinct texture and reducedbiomechanical and functional properties, is characteristi-cally altered [16].Healing of acute wounds follows an orderly sequence of overlapping, interacting physiological processes (Figure 1). 4Z'hissequencecantakeoverafewdaysinjuvenilesorovera few weeks in adults to occur. Most wounds heal withoutcomplication and reestablish homeostasis, skin barrierfunction, pliability, and physiological functions in less than4weeks. Clinical evidence indicates that shorter periods towound closure are associated with reduced brosis andscarring.Incontrast,full-thicknesswoundsandwoundsthatare slow to heal are associated with increased brosis, de-veloping in some individuals into hypertrophic scars andkeloids. Deep, full-thickness, and partial-thickness woundsthat do not heal within 6weeks appear to \"stall\" and fail to progressthroughthephasesofhealingdescribedinFigure1 (Figure 2). 4Z'hese hard-to-heal wounds are considered to be\"chronic\" wounds [17]. Hard-to-heal wounds become\"chronic\" for a number of including as vascular disease, hyper-glycaemia, ischemia, and neuropathy. 4Z'he underlying causeof the is often used to describe the wound: diabeticfootulcers,venouslegulcers,arteriallegulcers,andpressureulcers. Nonhealing, chronic wounds clearly pose a risk to the health and well-being oftheindividual;patients often suer from pain, impaired mobility, excessive exudates, wound malodour, and restricted social life [18], resulting in sub-stantial disruption, morbidity, and indirect costs to socialandhealthcaresystems[19].Asmanyas1-2%ofindividualsin all populations worldwide will acquire a chronic woundduring their life-time [20]. In the USA, chronic wounds arereported to aect 6.5million people and cost over US$25billioneachyear[21].Alarmingly,theburdenofchronicwounds is expected to intensify due to global increases in Coagulation (i) (ii)Proliferation/migration/ reepithelialization/granulation Remodelling/maturation proliferation Collagen/ECM synthesis Formation of granulation tissue Resolution of inflammation AngiogenesisKilling Removing debrisVasoconstriction Platelet aggregation Figure1: Wound healing cascade\u2014humans. 4Z'he wound healing process is an orderly sequence of overlapping, interacting processes commonly categorised into four distinct phases: coagulation, inflammation, proliferation/migration/reepithelialization/granulation, and remodelling/maturation. (1) Coagulation: a clot is formed, providing a temporary barrier to fluid loss and pathogen entry, restores haemostasis; acts as a reservoir of bioactive factors and antimicrobials; provides provisional ECM which supports immune cell inltration and migration; and initiates tissue repair pathways. (2) Inflammation: damage-associated molecular free radicals, and reactive cells secretes amplifying alarmin (also known as activation of keratinocytes and broblasts. of the population [21]. Although themechanismsofwoundhealingarerelativelywellknown,thepathogenesisofchronicwoundsremainpoorlydened[22].It is generally accepted that chronic wounds result from some dysregulation of the normal wound healing process. For example, microbial biolms, overexpression of in-flammatory cytokines, high levels of reactiveoxygen species (ROS), and reduced mitogenic activity stallwound healing in the inflammation phase, inhibiting pro-gression to the proliferation and reepithelialization phases.In addition, overactive matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)have been shown to contribute to delayed healing [23]. 4Z'heresult is a wound that remains open, does not heal, andbecomes chronic [24]. Selecting an appropriate clinical strategy to manage cutaneous wounds is dictated by the aetiology underlyingeach wound. Consideration is given to (1) removingnonvital (necrotic) tissue, termed debridement; (2) in-flammation or infection; (3) controlling moisture (too wetor too dry); and (4) state of the tissue surrounding thewound [25]. 4Z'his approach has its roots in Greek andRoman medicine [26], where removing these \"barriers tohealing\" was prescribed to allow the healing cascade toprogress to completion. Debridement is considered tobenetwounds,restartingthehealingprocessbyreturningit to an acute presentation. Debridement exposes healthy and well-perfused tissue, facilitating cell proliferation and migration [27]. In addition to removing dead and necrotictissue, debridement eectively and microorganisms from the wound. Mi-croorganisms in wounds have long been considereddeleterious[28];however,recentevidencesuggeststhatnotall microbes impede healing. Microbial pathogens such asStaphylococcus sp.,Streptococcus sp.,Propionibacterium sp., and Pseudomonas sp. are commonly equated with infection, while others including Malassezia sp.,Candida sp., and Corynebacterium sp. can be isolated from non- infected wounds and may even contribute to wound healing [29]. 4Z'he optimal frequency and when to perform debridement, however, remains unclear [27]. Dressingsprovide a physical barrier to reinfection from commensaland adventitious microorganisms, can deliver antimicro-bial agents (e.g., honey and iodine), and, in some designs,absorb wound exudates, providing a measure of moisturecontrol. 3.Traditional Medical Practices Traditional medicine is often described by practitioners of \"modern\" (western) medicine using sceptical terms such as \"alternative,\" \"nonconventional,\" \"indigenous,\" and \"com-plementary,\" when in fact many of the techniques andpractices of \"modern\" medicine are little dierent fromtraditional practices when it comes to wounds. Traditionalapproaches depend almost entirely upon natural resources,suchaswater,plants,animals,andminerals,andcontinuetobe valued and widely practiced by a majority of the world'spopulation[3].4Z'hepracticeoftraditionalChinesemedicine(TCM) is based on the Five-Phases theory and Yin-Yangtheory, recorded in the ancient Chinese medical documents such as \"Shen Nong Ben CaoJing\"and \"BenCao GangMu.\" Many, but not all, TCM makes extensive use of plants,ensuring it is eective, aordable, and accessible [30]. In-terestingly, of the new anticancer drugs developed between1940 and 2002, approximately 54% were derived fromnaturalproducts[31].Anotherstudyhasdeterminedthatofall current pharmaceutical products, about 73%, includeingredients derived from natural products [32]. 4Z'he ther-apeuticactivity of many traditional medicinesare conferredby natural ingredients produced within the plant; Coagulation (i)Proliferation/migration (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) Nonhealing/chronic wounds\u2014humans. 4Z'he orderly sequence of overlapping, interacting wound healing processes fails to progress in chronic wounds, frequently due to failure to resolve inflammation. (1) Coagulation: usually unaected. (2) initiation de novo granulation tissue formation; failure to sustain proliferation; failure to initiate angiogenesis; failure of keratinocytes to migrate and reepithelialise(failureofwoundclosure);failuretoresolveinflammation;andfailuretoaccumulateECM.(4)Remodelling/maturation:fails to initiate reorganisation and maturation of ECM.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3consequently, the eciency of TCM preparations can vary widely and are determined by the genotype, environmental,and growing conditions encountered by each source plant[30, 33]. Urbanization and industrialization of pharma-ceutical engineering have increased demand for \"o theshelf\" TCM products with consistent composition, quality, and clinical ecacy. Concomitantly, industrialization has also introduced rigorous product testing for evidence ofbiological activity and clinical ecacy. 4.Traditional Use of Medical Plants in Wound Healing 4.1. Aloe vera. Applied to wounds for over 5000years by Egyptians, Romans, indigenous peoples of Africa Asia, andtheAmericas, Aloevera continuestobearst-linetreatment for burns, ulcers, and surgical wounds [34]. Acetone aqueous extracts. Gram-positive bacterialspecies appear to be more sensitive than Gram-negative species to Aloe vera [36]. Compounds with a potent stimulator of macrophage and T-cell activity and induces the transcription Coincidently,glycans stabilize secreted cytokines, growth factors, and other bioactives, prolonging their activity. Topically applied acemannan has been reported AKT/mTOR veraglycans are also reported to signicantly improve de novo formation of granulation tissue by an unknownmechanism [40]. 4.2. Arctium lappa. Arctium lappa, commonly known a widely cultivated perennial herb [41]. Arctium lappais used in North America, Europe, and Asia to treat sore throat and skin pathologies such as wrinkles in human skin in vivo[51].Arctium lappais also reported to regulate cell adhesion and gene expression in canine dermal broblasts, aecting the Wnt/-cateninsignallingpathway,knowntobeakeyregulatorofwound healing [52]. In a pilot study of one commercialpreparation including Arctium lappa, Burns and Wounds topical ointment (B&W), pain and healing of rst- andsecond-degree burns in humans was demonstrated to bemanaged more eectively than the control has been broadly propinquus Rehmannia glutinosa was initially reported to be clinically eective for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers [56]. 4Z'hisoutcomehassubsequentlybeencorroboratedindiabeticrats[57]. Tam et al. reported that the root of Astragalus pro- pinquusandRehmannia glutinosa promote diabetic wound postischemic by and attenuating tissue oxidative stress in di-abetic rats [58]. demonstrated that the root ofAstragaluspropinquus andRehmanniaglutinosa activatethe TGF-1 signalling pathway and ECM in human skin broblasts [59]. 4.4.Ampelopsisjaponica. Growing throughout eastern Asia andeasternNorthAmerica,therootsof Ampelopsisjaponica are used as a traditional treatment for burns and ulcers, amongst other indications [60]. Multiple pharmacologicalactivities have been documented for Ampelopsis japonica, including neuroprotective [61], antimicrobial, and anti-cancer [62] activities. Lee et al. demonstrated that ethanolextractsfromdriedrootsof Ampelopsisjaponica accelerated the healing of cutaneous scald injury in rats [63]. Tumournecrosisfactor-alpha(TNF-)andTGF-1wereobservedtobe elevated 2days after injury and declined as healing progressed. In contrast, interleukin-10 (IL-10) was found to be elevated after 14days, coincident with wound closure[63]. When compared with wounds treated with Vaseline \u00ae(petroleum jelly) or silver known as green chiretta, is used in China, India, and southeast Asian countries as a traditional treatment for fever,snake bite, dysentery, infections, wounds, and itchiness[64-67]. a 10% aqueous leaf pan- [76]. Andrographolide, a from the leaves of Andrographis pan- iculata, has been formally evaluated in clinical trials and shown to have positive eects on several autoimmunedisorders [77]. 4.6.Angelicasinensis. 4Z'he dried root of Angelica sinensis is widely used in TCM prescriptions for the management of female maladies, inflammation, headaches, mild anemia,fatigue, and broblasts [83]. Extracts have also been tostimulate calcium fluxes, increasing cell vi-abilityduringtissuerepair[83].4Z'heroleof Angelicasinensis in angiogenesis remains unclear, with several studiesreporting contradictory eects of Angelica sinensis on de novo blood vessel growth. An aqueous extract of Angelica sinensiswas reported to promote blood vessel growth via activation of JNK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, a bioactive isolated from Angelica sinensis, inhibits cell induces apoptosis, and at-tenuates angiogenesis [86]. 4.7. Blumea balsamifera. tropics of Asia, Blumea balsamifera (also known as ngai camphor) is used widely as a traditional medicine. In the Philippines, Blumea balsamifera is known as sambong andisusedasadiuretic.InAyurveda, Blumeabalsamifera is known as kakoranda and is used to treat fevers, coughs,aches, and rheumatism. Leaf extracts are directly applied to eczema, dermatitis, skin injury, bruises, beriberi, [87].Extracts that oils from Blumea balsamifera improve wound healing in mice by promoting angiogenesis, perfusion,collagen deposition, formation of organised granulationtissue, reepithelialization, a resinous extract from Boswellia sacra, is valued in Africa, India, and the Middle East for the treatment of trauma and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [93, 94]. It has also been re- ported that the boswellic acid acetate extracted ANBP moderates inflammation andaccelerates the growth of organized granulation tissue andreepithelialization, events that reduce scar formation [96].Intriguingly, ANBP was also noted to attenuate collagenbiosynthesis and accelerate the maturation of the collagenextracellular matrix, contributing to reduced scarring andimproved skin tissue repair. Recently, Hou et al. further indiabeticmiceviadirecteectsonneovascularization[97]. 4.9. Caesalpinia sappan. 4Z'he heartwood of Caesalpinia sappanis well known for its qualities as a dye and has been used in TCM to improve blood circulation and reduce oedema and pain [98].

Camellia sinensis. Green tea, an aqueous extract made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, is revered throughout Asia for its reputed health benets [111]. Centuries of an- ecdotal evidence has been experimentally by dem-onstrating al. found [124] inhibit keloidsby STAT3 signalling [125]. Methanol extractsfromCamellia reportedly increase Furthermore, in vivo studieshavedemonstratedthat Camelliasinensis increasing angiogenesis in rats[121,126].Extractsfrom Camelliasinensis arealsoreportedto improve wound healing in a diabetic mouse treatment of blood disorders. Recent experimentation has identied it is associated with a wide range of biologicalactivities, (4mg/mL) improves diabetic woundhealing, promoting neovascularization, reepithelialization,and granulation tissue formation in streptozotocin-induceddiabetic rats [130]. In contrast, at high doses ( healing is inhibited [135, 136]. 4.13.Celosiaargentea. Celosiaargentea,alsoknownassilver cock's comb, is used in traditional medicine to treat skinsores, eruptions, ulcers, mouth ulcers, and other skin dis-eases [137]. Leaf extracts of this demonstrated that an alcohol extract of Celosia argentea accelerates burn wound closure in rats by increasing collagen and hexosaminecontent in granulation tissue wounds. In addition, the ex-tract increased the proliferation from the aerial parts of Centella asiaticaarereportedtoimprovethehealingofchroniculcers inSprague-Dawleyratsintermsofwidth,depth,andlength[142]. Wounds associated [143]. Asiaticoside isolated from Centella has been found to enhance collagen deposition and epithelial-ization in a punch wound model in the guinea pig [144]. Triterpenes isolated from Centella asiatica elevate collagen remodelling and glycosaminoglycan synthesis in a rat wound model [145]. Furthermore, oral administration ofmadecassosidefrom Centellaasiatica wasshowntofacilitate collagen synthesis Cinnamomum cassia. flavouring agent, and the bark of Cinnamomum cassia is also used to increase blood circu- lation as an analgesic [147]. Cinnamomum cassia is TCM prescribed for chest discomfort as-sociatedwith coronaryarterydisease[148].SBPiscurrentlythe subject of a randomized double-blinded clinical trial forthe treatment of coronary artery disease not amenable torevascularization [149]. Attention is also focussed on a component from Cinnamomum cassia, a inhuman umbilical vein endothelial cells [147]. Cinna-maldehyde is also to improve Medicinalapplications of myrrh include the treatment of gastro-intestinal diseases, fractures, arthritis, obesity, parasiticinfections, and as an anticoagulant [160- 162]. Myrrh has been used topically to clean wounds, reduce oedema, andprovide pain relief (analgesia) [163]. Myrrh is commonlyused in combination with other ingredients. Galehdariet al. showed that the combination of controls the recurrence of mouth ulcers inhumans [165]. In common with several other herbalpreparationsdescribedhere,myrrhisfoundtomodifytheexpression of TGF-1 and VEGF in mouse dermal - broblasts in vitro, suggesting a common mechanism of action [166].6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine4.17.Curcumalonga. Curcumin,anactivesubstancefound in the root of Curcuma longa and a member of the ginger family, has long been used as a medicine and as food seasoning [167]. Practitioners of traditional Ayurvedamedicine use curcumin to treat inflammation, respiratorydisorders,liverdisorders,anddiabetes[168].Intraditional Chinese medicine, curcumin is a favoured treatment for abdominal pain. Having widespread use for centuries bydiverse ethnic groups, curcumin is one of the most ex-tensively studied nutraceuticals. 4Z'his highly pleiotropicmolecule has been demonstrated to interact with keycellular pathways at transcription, translation, and subject of more than 100 clinical trials, in vivostudies, have largely focused on curcumin as a treatment for epithelial cancers.

Daphne genkwa is used as an the ERK/MEK pathway regu- the expression of in improved wound healing [171]. 4.19.Entadaphaseoloides. Entada phaseoloides, also known as St. 4Z'homas bean, is a liana in the pea family of climbing vines common throughout lowland tropical forests andcoastalforestsofAfrica,Australia,Asia,andWesternPacic.4Z'he bark and seeds of Entada phaseoloides are rich in sa- ponins and tannins and are used as analgesic, bacteriocide,haemostatic, and anticancer agents and as a topical treat-ment for skin lesions [180, 181]. Su et al. reported thatextracts enriched with tannins from Entada phaseoloides reduced the time taken to heal infected wounds in rats.Analyses of the data concluded that the improved woundhealing was due to the antibacterial, proproliferative, and promigration activity of the Entada phaseoloides extracts [182]. 4Z'hese data are yet human patients.4.20. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, or shoeblackplant, is Eastern Asia [183]. 4Z'he flowers of Hibiscus rosa- sinensisareedible.Traditionaltextsdescribepreparationsof the leaves and flowers promote hair growth and preventgreying [184]. Alcoholic extracts of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis flowers are claimed to provide women with control of theirfertility [185]. Extracts from Hibiscus rosa-sinensis have also been antibacterial wound healingproperties [187]. 4Z'hey attenuate inflammation, and collagen deposition, as well asupregulate VEGF lucidum, the lingzhi mushroom, is well known to the Chinese, Korean, andJapaneseas\"themushroomofimmortality\"[189,190].Usedin TCM to boost the patient's immune system [191],Ganoderma lucidum stimulates a variety of B; and symptoms of hypertension [189, 198-202].Laboratory-based studies reveal that components fromGanoderma lucidum interact with and modulate key en- zymes with known roles in lipid metabolism. However,clinical ndings remain equivocal and suggest that Gano- derma lucidum is most eective when used as an adjunct with other therapies [203]. Polysaccharide extracts from thefruiting body of Ganoderma lucidum have been shown to improve wound healing in diabetic rats, potentially bystimulating broblast proliferation and migration [190],angiogenesis, and quenching oxidative stress [204]. Nev-ertheless, these responses may also represent indirect re-sponses to Ganoderma lucidum via its ischemic disorders, menstrual disorders, and headache [205-207]. 4Z'hus far, about 174chemical components have been isolated striatum, among which phthalide lactones and alkaloids arethe most numerous, pharmacologically active species [207].It has been that essential oils from Ligusticum striatuminhibitdermalscarringintherabbitearscarmodel [208]. 4.23. Lonicera japonica. Lonicera japonica, also known as honeysuckle, has a notable place in traditional medicinethroughout its native range of Japan, Korea, and China,Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7where it has been used for thousands of years to treat in- fectious diseases [209]. In the 1980s, the Chinese StateMinistry of Health performed extensive pharmacologicaland clinical analyses japonica support reepitheliza- tion, angiogenesis, plantmay be consumed 4Z'he root bark of Paeonia suruticosa is the source for bioactive ingredients used for suruticosa is commonly applied to cracked skin to assist healing and relieve pain [219]. When tested in vitroat lowconcentrations( 10g/mL),Paeoniasuruticosa isfound to stimulate the viability and proliferation of human primary dermal broblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes, suggesting its potential use as a wound healing therapy [220]. 4.25. Panax ginseng. Panax ginseng is one of the most popular medicinalplants consumedinChina,Japan,Korea, andEasternSiberiatoimprovethinking,concentration,andmemory.Itisalsoclaimedtosupportimmunityandphysicalstamina and to reduce fatigue [221]. Panax ginseng is thus used to treat depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue syn-drome [222]. Panax ginseng has been demonstrated among a class of saponins (termed ginsenosides by Asian researchersandpanaxosidesbyRussianresearchers)representthemostpotent active constituents of Panax ginseng [232]. 4Z'he root extracts of Panax ginseng have been shown to protect skin in C57BL mice from acute UVB irradiation[233] and signicantly improve healing after laser burn injury and excisional wounding [221, 234, 235]. Studies demonstrate Panax ginseng extracts enhance keratinocyte migration[221,236],aswell asstimulateproliferation [237]andincreasecollagensynthesisinhumandermalbroblasts[238]in vitro. In addition, Choi demonstrated that the ginsenoside Rb2, isolated from Panax ginseng, induces the formation of the epidermis in raft culture via increasedexpression of epidermal growth factor and its receptor, -bronectinanditsreceptor,andkeratin5/14and collagenaseI [239], all of which have critical roles Panax notoginseng. Panax notoginseng, not to beconfused with Panax ginseng and other ginsengs, is used to stop bleeding, reduce oedema, reduce bruising, and reducepain[240,241].TerpenesaponinsisolatedfromtheleavesofPanax notoginseng key factors in wound healing[240, 241]. Mechanism of action studies has found Panax notoginseng flower extracts block NF-B signalling [248, 249], thus aecting the expression of to contribute keloidpathogenesis vitroandin vivoin a rat model [252]. It was proposed that when administered orally, key bioactive constituents responsible for the haemostatic ac-tivity could be modied, which does not occur when ad-ministered topically. Of particular note, it is now evidentthat signicant stereospecic 4Z'hese ndings mayaccount for some of the confusing and contradictory ex-perimental observations. For example, 20(R)-ginsenosideRh2 inhibits osteoclastgenesis for treating coughs, hepatitis, jaundice, amenorrhea, leucorrhea, arthralgia,burns, and snake bite [255]. A diversity of compounds have been isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum, dominated by resveratrol, polydatin, and anthraquinones and onerecentin wound healing in rats, ex- tracts of Polygonum cuspidatum were found to increase TGF-1 expression and to signicantly improve woundhealing in terms of granulation tissueformation,collagensynthesis,andangiogenesis[259].Novelanthraquinones is indigenous to northeast China and has potent biological activities, including anti-in- flammatory, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggeringprogrammed cell death in cancer cell lines [262]. 4Z'hesecharacteristicspromptedinvestigationofshikoninasanovelscarremediationtherapy.4Z'hesestudiesfoundthatshikonin inhibits cell proliferation and collagen production in hy- pertrophic scar-derived human skin ospermum reported to synergisewith VEGF, resulting in signicantly improved woundhealing in model [264]. for con-stipation, chronic liver and kidney diseases [265, 269], and skinlesions[270].Usingaratexcisionalwoundmodel,Tang et al. found healing was stimulated via TGF-1-relatedpathways [270]. 4Z'he nature of the active component re-sponsible for this activity is not clear. Emodin [1,3,8-tri-hydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone], an anthraquinonederived from the roots of Rheum ocinale, has been shown to act as a ligand for PPAR-c and interact with HSP90 and androgenreceptors,inpartexplainingitstherapeuticbenetfor chronic high altitudes (4000-5000m) of the western Himalayas, is cou-marins, and phenyl 4Z'hese medicines.

Salvianolic acids isolated from Salvia miltior- greatest clinical benet of salvianolicacids appears to be cardiovascular protection, via thepromotion of cardiac angiogenesis and inhibition (DSU) and salvianolic acid B (SAB), have been shown to enhance the proliferation of broblasts and in- crease collagen synthesis [293]. Salvianolic acid B is also apotent antagonist of epithelial-to-mesenchymal wound closure a lipid-soluble terpenoid isolated from family Rosaceae and commonly known as great burnet, is widely distributed in the cooler northerndistricts of Asia, Europe, and North America [296]. Rootsof this plant are a istocontrolbleedingdisorders.It is also applied to heal scalds, burns, allergic skin diseases,urticaria, eczema, and allergic dermatitis [299]. Aqueousextracts made of Sanguisorba ocinalis suppress mast cell degranulation, as STAT-1, oral administration of polysaccharides isolated fromSanguisorba ocinalis is claimed to stimulate wound contraction, reduce the time required for reepithelization(wound closure), increase collagen synthesis, and improveangiogenesis [296]. Administration of the polysaccharideextract also resulted in and VEGF in mice [296]. 4.33.Sophoraflavescens. Sophoraflavescens isaspeciesfrom a genus of over 50 plants distributed throughout Asia, Oceania, and the islands of the Pacic. 4Z'he root of Sophora flavescens is used for conditions involving the heart, liver, intestinal tract, and skin. Experimental investigations in-dicate extracts from Sophora flavescens stimulate anti- cancer, andantipruritic responses and benets wound healing [302]. One recent report claims it is a potent inhibitor of ty- rosinase,theenzymeresponsibleforsynthesizingmelanin,thus has potential cosmetic applications as a skin whitener[303].

Zanthoxylumbungeanum is afloweringplantbelongingtotheRutaceaefamily,nativetoeastern provinces of China. It yields important food in-gredients such as sichuan pepper [313]. Over 140 com-pounds have been isolated from alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, and free fattyacids, known in traditional Western folk medicine as \"toothachetrees,\" useful for treating pruritus (itch) and chronic pain.4Z'he pericarp from the fruit berry is commonly used toformulate TCM oils, powders, tinctures, elixirs, and pills[319]. Extracts from Zanthoxylum bungeanum are also prescribed for skin infections, including acne, eczema,scalds, and wound healing [320]. One unique property offruit husk extracts from Zanthoxylum bungeanum is as a lifting agent for skin wrinkles. When applied topically toskin, subcutaneous muscles are relaxed, reducing skinwrinkles, thus has attracted the attention of cosmeticmanufacturers [321]. Another interesting property re-portedly associated with essential oils of Zanthoxylum bungeanum is the capacity to enhance percutaneous drug delivery [322]. 5.Conclusion We have surveyed and presented an overview of evidencethat explains why many medicinal plants are used as tra-ditional treatments for cutaneous wounds and clinical skindisorders. Medicinal plants have been the rst line oftreatment for trauma, infection, disease, and injury fromprehistory.Overmillennia,humanshavelearnedtoidentifyand transform the botanical resources from the immediateenvironment, and with the development of trade, as food and medicine. A great many of these \"ancient\" and tradi- tional medical plants have been validated to confer thera-peutic benets, albeit not always in controlled clinical trials.Oneunexpectedoutcomefromvalidationstudiesisjusthowmanymedicalplantssynthesizeequivalentorcloselyrelatedcompounds. Consequently, it is not surprising that manybiological properties are also shared by unrelated species.Also shared are many of the same biological targets andpathways; many of these are also key events in the mam-malian wound healing cascade. Many of the identiedcompounds target mitogenic (e.g., AKT, (e.g., -SMA). ingredients, part of use, type of extract, as- sessmentmethods,bioactivities,clinicaluse,formulation,andcommercial product of the medicinal plants are summarizedinTable1.Whileexperimentalevidencehasbeenacquiredforeach documented plant from in vitroorin vivoanalyses, not everymechanismofactionhasbeenveried.Onthecontrary,several compounds, including acemannan andstilbenoid(from have been demonstrated to have properties benetwound healing. In particular, Centella asiatica, Curcuma longa,andPaeonia suruticosa are popular medicinal products in several global markets. We provide these data in the belief that we still have much to learn from traditional practices, some of whichundoubtedly could deliver novel reagents and therapies fortoday's therapeutic challenges. Notwithstanding, we rec-ognise that modern medicine and drugs remain eectivelyinaccessible(andunaordable)tothemajorityoftheworld'spopulation. For this reason alone, traditional medicinecontinuestobetherstlineoftreatment,indeed,frequentlythe only line of treatment for many.
