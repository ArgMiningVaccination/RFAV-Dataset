Well, I used it that night then 2x the next day. Not long after my shower on the 2nd night & appying the oil mixture to my belly I was in labor. :D This is probably the only true thing that isn't hit or miss that will put you into labor. That \"have sex\" crap wasn't working for me lol Many alternative medicine health care providers feel that using certain herbal teas during pregnancy is a great way to support optimal pregnancy health. Herbal teas can often provide an additional source of nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and iron. However, due to the lack of studies on most herbs, the FDA encourages caution when consuming herbal teas. To understand which herbal teas are safe to consume during pregnancy, let\u00e2\u20acs first look at the different types of teas and how they are made.Difference in Teas: Non-herbal and Herbal Teas There are two different types of teas, non-herbal and herbal. The non-herbal teas can also be broken down into 3 categories: black, green, and oolong.Non-Herbal Tea - Black tea is the most common type of non-herbal tea, including blends such as English breakfast, Earl Grey, and Orange Pekoe. - Green tea has a more delicate taste than black tea; the oolong teas are a combination of green and black tea. - Non-herbal teas contain varying amounts of caffeine and antioxidants. - Non-herbal teas are made from leaves of tea plants. - The longer the oxidation time (fermenting) of the leaf, the higher the caffeine level. - The amount of brewing time and the size and type of tea leaf can also influence how much caffeine is in the tea. - Decaf versions of non-herbal teas still contain a bit of caffeine. - Made from the roots, berries, flowers, seeds, and leaves of a variety of plants\u00e2\u20ac\"not from actual tea plant leaves. - True Herbal teas do not contain caffeine ( this does not include any other drinks called \"tea\" that truly are not, such as mate tea.) - These teas can also be used as \u00e2\u20acmedicinal\u00e2\u20ac remedies. (relating to, or having the properties of medicine) Although non-herbal tea is assumed to have great health benefits due to the antioxidants, it also contains caffeine, which pregnant women are often encouraged to eliminate or cut down on during pregnancy. The average cup of non-herbal tea contains about 40-50 milligrams of caffeine. Decaffeinated non-herbal tea does still contain a bit of caffeine, however the amount is usually only about .4 milligrams. Caffeine does cross the placenta and reaches your developing baby, and the baby cannot metabolize caffeine like an adult can. For this reason, there is much controversy on how much caffeine is safe or if it should be avoided altogether. We know that the less caffeine consumed, the better it is for your pregnancy. Talk with your midwife or doctor about what amount you feel is safe for you. This will then help you make the decision on whether to consume non-herbal teas (green or black ).Herbal teas Herbal teas are naturally caffeine free, so caffeine is not an issue when consuming this type of tea. The concern with consuming herbal teas during pregnancy is the lack of data available on most herbs and their effects on a developing fetus. There are mixed opinions on the safety of herbal teas, for both pregnant and non-pregnant women. Most commercial brands of herbal teas are thought to be safe for anyone to consume in reasonable amounts. Herbal tea companies, such as Celestial Seasonings, report that they do not use any herbs that are considered dangerous and choose to use herbs from guidelines that the FDA has published. The herbal teas that are considered to be unsafe are those that are not made commercially, those made with excessive amounts of herbs (amounts larger than those found in common foods or drinks), or those made with herbs that are known to be toxic. As with most things, it is always best to talk with your midwife or doctor about any herbal teas that you are interested in drinking.Are the herbal teas called \u00e2\u20acPregnancy Teas\u00e2\u20ac safe to drink? There are a number of teas labeled as \u00e2\u20acPregnancy Teas\u00e2\u20ac or herbs such as red raspberry leaf that are in teas, that are considered to be good for pregnancy. Many midwives and professionals who work with herbs believe that the regular consumption of these teas may help prevent pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, preterm labor, prolonged labor, and postpartum hemorrhage. Medical studies have shown that red raspberry leaf can be consumed safely during pregnancy and can decrease the length of labor and decrease the number of interventions used such as artificial rupture of membranes (AROM), assisted delivery, and cesarean delivery.1 Red raspberry leaf also seems to help prevent pregnancies from pre-or post-term gestation (delivering too early or too late).Herbs Used in Teas The following are common ingredients you may find in herbal teas. Note that some have a questionable safety rating. The safety ratings given here are from the [Natural Medicines Database](//www.naturaldatabase.com/). More extensive research and discussions with your health care provider will help you make the decision about what herbs are safe for you to use in teas. - Red Raspberry Leaf ( [Likely Safe](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)) - Rich in iron, this herb has helped tone the uterus, increase milk production, decrease nausea, and ease labor pains. Many of the \u00e2\u20acPregnancy Teas\u00e2\u20ac commonly contain red raspberry leaf to help promote uterine health during pregnancy. There is some controversy about whether this should be used throughout pregnancy or just in the second and third trimester, so many health care providers remain cautious and only recommend using it after the first trimester. - Peppermint Leaf ( [Likely Safe](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)) - Helpful in relieving nausea/morning sickness and flatulence. - Lemon Balm ( [Likely Safe](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)) - Has a calming effect and helps relieve irritability, insomnia, and anxiety. - Ginger root ( [Possibly relieve ( [Insufficient Reliable Information Available](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)) - Rich in Vitamin A, calcium and iron; dandelion root and leaf can also help relieve mild edema and nourish the liver. - Chamomile (German) ( [Insufficient Reliable Information Available](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)) - High in calcium and magnesium, also helps with sleeplessness and inflammation of joints. - Nettles (Stinging Nettles) -( [Likely Unsafe-see note](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)) High in vitamins A, C, K, calcium, potassium and iron.

(*Note on the safety of nettles: Natural Medicines Database gives nettles a rating of [Likely Unsafe](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html), even though it is used in countless pregnancy teas and recommended by most midwives and herbalists. This may be in relation to which part of the nettles plant is used, the root or the leaves, and how much is used. According to other sources, the use of nettles is encouraged during pregnancy because of all its health benefits.2) - Rose Hips ( [Insufficient Reliable Information Available](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)) - Very good source of Vitamin C and helps boost the immune system. - Alfalfa ( [Possibly Unsafe)](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)- Has Vitamin A, D, E and K; particularly good in later pregnancy to boost Vitamin K, which helps prevent postpartum hemorrhage. - Yellow Dock ( [Possibly Unsafe](//www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/naturalsafetyrate.html)) - Used to help treat anemia in pregnant women due to the high level of iron.

Few studies have been done to measure the effects of various herbs on pregnant women or a developing fetus. What are some herbs I should be cautious about during my pregnancy? Depending on the source, some information will list an herb as safe to consume during pregnancy, whereas another source may list the same herb as unsafe. Therefore, it is best to consult with your health care provider or someone trained in using herbs before taking any natural medicine or herb during pregnancy. Some organizations that specialize in herbs have done extensive testing on their safety. Often these organizations will list herbs with their safety ratings for the general population and also safety during pregnancy and lactation. These ratings can often be confusing and hard to interpret; this is why speaking with a professional who is familiar with using herbs during pregnancy is recommended. One key thing when understanding the safety ratings is to pay attention to what type of use the rating is for. For example, the rating for Rosemary is considered [Likely Safe] ...when used orally in amounts typically found in foods. (Rosemary has a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US.) But in pregnancy, Rosemary is considered [Possibly UnSafe] ...when used orally in medicinal amounts. Rosemary might have uterine and menstrual flow stimulant effects; avoid using. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of the topical use of rosemary during pregnancy.1 This is a prime example of how the method of use of the herb changes its safety rating. We know that rosemary sprinkled in your tomato sauce is not a risk to you and your baby. If you were to use Rosemary in a large dose, like that used in medicinal amounts, it could be dangerous for your pregnancy. The same goes for herbs such as Garlic, Sage, Ginger and Tumeric. All of these herbs could be contraindicated in pregnancy when used in large or concentrated doses, but are considered safe when used in amounts found in food. 2Herbs to avoid during pregnancy The following herbs are considered [Likely UnSafe] or [Unsafe] during pregnancy : 3 - Saw Palmetto - when used orally, has hormonal activity - Goldenseal - when used orally, may cross the placenta - Dong Quai - when used orally, due to uterine stimulant and relaxant effects - Ephedra - when used orally - Yohimbe - when used orally - Pay D\u00e2\u20ac Arco - when used orally in large doses; contraindicated - Passion Flower - when used orally - Black Cohosh - when used orally in pregnant women who are not at term - Blue Cohosh - when used orally; uterine stimulant and can induce labor - Roman Chamomile - when used orally in medicinal amounts - Pennyroyal - when used orally or topically Depending on what type of health care provider you see, he/she may recommend using herbs to help promote the health of your pregnancy. Remember, never try to self dose or diagnose with any medications, including herbs. Because each pregnancy is different, with its own specific details, the best way to use herbs is under the care of a midwife, physician, herbalist, naturopathic or homeopathic doctor. Herbs used in Pregnancy Choosing to use herbs during pregnancy is a personal choice, but to ensure the best outcome for you and your baby, you should be well educated on the types of herbs, parts of the herb (root, leaf, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) and the way that they could be used (caplet, tonic, tea). The herbs that are considered safe to use during pregnancy are often food or tonic herbs. These often will be found in either tablet form, tea, or infusion form. The following herbs have been rated [Likely Safe] or [Possibly Safe] for use during pregnancy:4 - Red Raspberry Leaf - Rich in iron, this herb has helped tone the uterus, increase milk production, decrease nausea, and ease labor pains. Some studies have even reported that using red raspberry leaf during pregnancy can reduce complications and the use of interventions during birth.5 You may see pregnancy teas that are made from red raspberry leaf to help promote uterine health during pregnancy.
