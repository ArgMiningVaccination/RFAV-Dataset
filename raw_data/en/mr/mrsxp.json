The unique integrity of each individual is evident and valued. Naturopathy combines centuries-old natural, non-toxic therapies with current advances in the study of health and human systems, covering all aspects of family health from prenatal to geriatric care. Trained to use the most efficient and least toxic methods to manage health problems, the naturopath looks at the whole picture and considers the whole person. The role of a professionally schooled and trained naturopath is to listen, identify the cause, and teach the individual how to maintain health. Rather than merely eliminating or suppressing symptoms, the naturopath's focus is on removing obstacles to the recovery of health. "}
