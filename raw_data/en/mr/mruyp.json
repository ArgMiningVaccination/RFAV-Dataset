Getting a repeat vaccination If you got your repeat vaccination after 18 September 2022, you are sufficiently protected against severe illness, hospital admission or death as a result of Covid-19. You do not have to get another repeat dose from the municipal health service (GGD). People in certain at-risk groups may require an extra repeat dose, however. These individuals can be referred for repeat vaccination by their doctor. If you have received your primary vaccination series, you can get a repeat vaccination. Go to [coronatest.nl/en](https://coronatest.nl/en) or call [0800 7070](tel:0800%207070). There are many locations where you can get vaccinated without making an appointment.

If you got your repeat vaccination after 18 September 2022, you are sufficiently protected. You do not have to get another repeat dose from the GGD. No new round of repeat vaccinations in the spring There will be no new round of repeat vaccinations in the spring. This is because Covid-19 has become endemic. There is also a high level of immunity in the population, and the dominant Omicron variant does not cause serious illness in most people. New repeat vaccinations would therefore offer very limited additional protection. People in certain at-risk groups may require an extra repeat dose, however. These individuals can be referred by their attending doctor. The coronavirus situation is being closely monitored by RIVM, the GGD and other experts. They publish [weekly updates about developments](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/actueel/responsteam). The Outbreak Management Team on Vaccination (OMT-V) can advise the government on whether a new round of vaccinations is necessary. Repeat vaccination with updated vaccines The mRNA vaccines developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna have been adapted to offer better protection against other coronavirus variants, like Omicron. The updated vaccines have been used for repeat vaccination since 18 September 2022. There are 2 updated vaccines: - A vaccine targeting the Omicron BA.1 variant (Moderna or BioNTech/Pfizer) - A vaccine targeting the Omicron BA.4/5 variant (BioNTech/Pfizer). Studies show that both vaccines are effective in protecting against severe illness and death due to coronavirus.

At that time, only original vaccines (rather than updated ones) were being used: : - people aged 60 and over (including people turning 60 in 2022) - nursing home residents - adults with Down's syndrome - adults with a [severely weakened immune system](https://www.rivm.nl/en/covid-19-vaccination/questions-and-background-information/immunocompromised-people).
