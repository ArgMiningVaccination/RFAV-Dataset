For Final Evaluation/Review1: Project Outcome: To what extent h as the project already achieved its outcome(s) according to the Logframe Matrix? Please, tick appropriate box Outcome(s) was/were: Fully achieved: Almost achieved: x Partially achieved: Not achieved: Please, also explain your assessment: What exactly wa s achieved and why? If not achieved, why not? (Please, consider description of outcome and relevant indicators) Indicator 1: Increased women's participation and contribution to decisions on conflict prevention, management and response at continental, regio nal and national level This aspect of the project outcome was partially achieved as the implementation model ensured that women were engaged in the project activities at national and regional levels. The project was able to develop a database of experts, m ostly women, in the area of SGBV and conflict at a continental level. The evaluation concluded that there were some levels of awareness raised in raised concerning SGBV in conflict and the role of women's participation on the same. The evaluation team have identified some weak links which narrows down the work 1 Please, only fill in incase this is a final project evaluation/review. x x iv undertaken at national levels and how it is linked or replicable at the regional and continental levels. Indicator 2: States policies provide for effective prevention and response to sexual and gende r based violence in conflict At a country level the project was successfully implemented in Nigeria and South Sudan through Oxfam country offices and local partner organisations. This was aligned to the project design however it could have been strengthen ed as there was no baseline assessment undertaken to establish the extent to which states were preventing and responding to SGBV in conflict. Significant results were obtained with respect to debate and development of National Action Plans on various inter national and regional policy frameworks (UNSCR 1325 and Maputo Protocol). These results however, are not clearly attributable to the work of the KcM project. Use of baseline data would have assisted to quantify the contribution of the project to this inten ded outcome. For Mid -Term Evaluation/Review2: Project Outcome: To what extent do you think the project will most likely achieve its outcome(s) according to the Logframe Matrix Please, tick appropriate box Outcome(s) will most likely be: Fully achieved: Almost achieved: Partially achieved: Not achieved: Please, also explain your assessment: (Please, consider description of outcome and relevant indicators) A mid -term project evaluation/ review was not commissioned. Project Outputs: To what extent has th e project already achieved its outputs3 according to the Logframe Matrix ? Please, tick appropriate boxes Output 1 (Please, include as stated in the Logframe Matrix): Policy and legal responses to sexual and gender based violence before during and after c onflict are influenced by empirical evidence on the economic, social and political cost of conflict for women in the Egypt, Nigeria and South Sudan Output was: Fully achieved: Almost achieved: x Partially achieved: Not achieved: Please, explain your ass essment: (Please, consider description of output and relevant indicators) Empirical evidence on economic, social and political cost of conflict for women in Egypt, Nigeria and South Sudan was obtained through both country and regional studies on SGBV in th ose countries. These studies however were finalised after the end of the project owing to several security concerns for individuals and institutions involved in the research. These security concerns made the publication and dissemination of the data on cer tain components of the studies extremely difficult in the way envisaged and intended thought of the project design. Several attempts to modify and redesign/ recast the research design and therefore findings had limited success. This had the effect of delay ing the use of the research findings for purposes of policy advocacy and litigation on SGBV. Overall, the project produced useful studies on SGBV both in and out of conflict situations with important data on the economic, social and political cost of confl ict on women in three countries. Output 2 (Please, include as stated in the Logframe Matrix) : Survivors of conflict related sexual and gender based violence are supported to access justice through increased use of international instruments and policies on prevention and response to SGBV at continental, regional and national levels. 2 Please, only fill in in case this is a mid -term evaluation/review. 3 In case there are more than three outputs, please, add them. v Output 2 was: Fully achieved: Almost achieved: x Partially achieved: Not achieved: Please, explain your assessment: (Please, consider description of output and relevant indica tors) Much of the work at the country level was designed to flow from the research. National actors were intended to make use of the empirical evidence from research to undertake advocacy and litigation with local systems as well as at the AU level. The ev aluation concluded that as a result of the delayed outcomes/ finalisation of the research component of the project, national actors readjusted the activities and project focus to undertake trainings, engage in advocacy on policy and engage policy makers in Nigeria and South Sudan. Activities did not hold in Egypt because of security concerns and access. Project partners in Nigeria and South Sudan undertook robust and dynamic activities that appeared to the evaluation team to leverage existing Oxfam country office work. This result would have been fully achieved had project partners been able to implement activities on the basis of empirical evidence from the research and if SOAWR members in the countries and at regional level had been more involved in the implementation . Output 3 (Please, include as stated in the Logframe Matrix): Increased and meaningful participation of women in continental, regional and national decision making platforms on prevention, management, response and resolution before, during a nd after conflict Output 3 was: Fully achieved: Almost achieved: Partially achieved: x Not achieved: Please, explain your assessment: (Please, consider description of output and relevant indicators) The evaluation report states that Result Area/ Output 3 of the KcM project was the least achieved of all results. This was largely because the basis for this work, the country and regional level research, was never completed. Additionally, the evaluation team concluded that the project design that closely lin ked high level engagement and advocacy at regional levels with specific research outputs, in a very limited amount of time may not have been the most appropriate. Those who conceptualized the project relied on a variety of assumptions about how change at national and continental levels could be achieved but did not build in sufficient time into the approach to ensure this could happen. The significant delays experienced with the research component of the study made it extremely difficult for project partner s to readjust and find alternative approaches for completion of the regional piece of the work. The evaluation team is also of the opinion that more could have been achieved under this result area, had the project design taken into account various initiati ves being undertaken at a regional level that was directly related to the overall project outcomes. In case there are more than three Outputs please, state as above. Impact/Beneficiaries: How many women, men, girls, boys and people in total have alread y benefited from this project directly and indirectly? Please, explain: What exactly has already changed in the lives of women, men, girls, boys and/or institutions from this project? Please, explain: In Nigeria, there have been some successes recorded th rough several cases that have been prosecuted with the support of local partners working on the KcM project. Project partners in both South Sudan and Nigeria have been engaged in advocacy initiatives on the domestication of SGBV related policy frameworks e .g. UNSCR 1325 NAPs and SGBV related legislation. Which positive and/or negative effects/impacts in terms of gender can be possibly be attributed to the project? vi Please, explain: A growing awareness for addressing SGBV in conflict holistically, beyond a f ocus on legal remedies for physical violations, but also taking into consideration the economic, social and political costs of conflict (and especially SGBV) on women. If applicable, which institutions have benefitted from this project/programme and how? Institutions at local levels in Nigeria and South Sudan have largely benefitted from this project. These include the police, local courts and various government departments and ministries dealing with gender and women's issues. Mainstreaming cross -cuttin g issues: Gender: To what extent was gender mainstreaming included in the project? To what extent were the recommendations - if any - from the ADA internal gender -assessment considered and implemented? Gender was well mainstreamed into the project. While i t largely focused on women, there was a good balance in most aspects of the programme for implementation processes. The one area where gender mainstreaming could have been improved was in the composition of the research team. The team was largely made up o f men and with little expertise on SGBV and women's rights more generally. The ADA gender assessment did not contain specific recommendations but indicated that gender indicators would have to be refined on the basis of a baseline study. This study was not undertaken and as a result indicators could not be readily refined. This however did not diminish attention paid to gender mainstreaming in the project. Environment: To what extent was environmental mainstreaming included in the project? To what extent w ere the recommendations - if any - from the ADA internal environment -assessment considered and implemented? There were no recommendations from ADA . Which positive and/or negative effects/impacts in terms of environment can be possibly be attributed to the project? Please, explain Social Standards: To what extent were the social standards monitored by relevant partners? Have any issues emerged? Please, explain Project partners monitored the context they were operating in and attempted to adhere to the social and contextual peculiarities in each. Overall/Other Comments: The KcM is a timely and relevant project with an important contribution to make to the broader area of SGBV in conflict. The evaluation concluded that the project design though innovative, ma y have been overly ambitious and required readjustment to make it more manageable in the available time frame. The evaluation recommends that work such as that outlined in the KcM project continues and continues to be supported. 1 The rev iew study was commissioned to evaluate the results (outputs, outcomes and impacts) of the Kilio Cha Mabadiliko project (KCM) . The KCM project, which commenced towards the end of 2013, through Austrian Development Agency (ADA) funding and commissioned by th e Oxfam Pan-Africa Program office, Nairobi - is a multi -level project implemented at the continental and country levels . The project was pioneered in the Federal Republic of Nigeria , the Republic of South Sudan and to a very small degree in Egypt and, implemented at the African Union . The project, which focused on Sexual and Gender based Vio lence (SGBV) issues across communities in the selected countries and fostering interaction with regional policy processes , was able to raise awareness about SGBV. KcM was implemented on the basis of the assertion that SGBV is used as a tactic of war during conflict, and also occurs in unplanned and spontaneous ways in ensuing lawlessness and insecurity in conflict and post conflict periods4. Post conflict reconstruction occurs on the basis of initial plans that are hurriedly put together to bring an end to conflict, followed by more systematic mechanisms that are for the most part devoid of gender considerations, and which are not informed by the voice or participation of women. This makes it difficult for women to access justice for sexual and gender based violence perpetrated during conflict as the post conflict justice mechanisms for addressing the violations in conflict place very little importance on SGBV. The work of the evaluation team examined the assumptions derived from the project, the project contribution versus attribution across a number of areas that include beneficiaries, policy linkages and institutions to name a few. This report outlines several findings and makes recommendations targeted at the project, Oxfam as the lead implementor and the A DA as the funding partner. These recommendations are intended to inform future similarly designed projects. Summary of a ssumptions derived from the project The KCM project is based on a social change theory that holds that individuals can cause broader social change when they possess the requisite skills, capacities, networks and courage of conviction . This basis of social change theory was underpinned by the followi ng assumptions as expressed in project documents as well as derived during the project evaluation : Assumption 1: SGBV in conflict is attributable to broader structural and socio -economic factors than just the physical dimension of harms perpetrated. Howeve r, the KCM project was designed to looking at the physical and rape dimension of SGBV and this impacted on its ability to engage in the broader SGBV discourse. Its workshops and research papers aptly demonstrate that SGBV is about broader structural socio -economic and political power issues and a vehicle by which men control power as well as confine and define the parameters of women's participation within safe havens5. This assumption is further highlighted in KCM research papers that public power, decisio n-making and economic opportunities are inaccessible to women because they lack money, material resources, linkages to formal networks of power required to succeed in the context of modern day African politics. This historical and structural disarticulatio n and disempowerment of women is exacerbated by the high incidence of corruption, state violence, poverty, inequality and negative identity politics; Assumption 2: O nce African women residing in conflict zones become aware of their rights and the obligatio ns of states under international and regional frameworks (e.g. UNSCR 1325 and Maputo 4 KcM Project Document: \"Ensuring accountability for SGBV and increased participation of women in Africa\" 5 KcM Project Document 2 Protocol), they would naturally desire and seek to collaborate post the events (with or without Oxfam) ; this is notwithstanding t heir very varied socio -economic , political and legal circumstances; Assumption 3: the Oxfam project area and beneficiary selection process is sufficiently inclusive and thorough to be able to identify the movers and shakers who can have a multiplier effect to the KCM project interventions. That th e women and implementing partners selected by the KCM programme necessarily possess the legitimacy and influence at the local/national level to mobilize the envisaged transformative action; Assumption 4: W omen in conflict and post -conflict settings are le ss effective politically because they do not understand how the international human rights systems in their own countries work; and Assumption 5: K nowledge about the international hu man rights instruments on SGBV would necessarily lead to consciousness , social mobilization, collective organization and transformative action on both local and continental platforms. These assumptions were both implicit and explicit in the project design, implementation and structure. The evaluation therefore sought to interr ogate how - if at all - some of the assumptions have proven to be correct or otherwise. In interrogating assumptions made within the project design , the Evaluation relied on the perceptions of different stakeholders and the data (quantitative verification of perception) generated by the KCM Project. Summary of p roject contribution versus attribution The evaluation team opted to adopt a programmatic approach that looked at the stated achievements either against existing national and regional data that coul d be derived from African Union, United Nations, World Bank and other relevant reports. Though this is an imperfect approach to a review, it enabled the evaluation to account for the achievements against some standard and reduce the reliance on perceptions of project commissioning and implementing personnel alone. The weakness of this pragmatic approach is that the evaluation may, therefore, have erred on either extreme when it comes to attribution of success and identification of weaknesses. Regarding the latter, we have sought to temper our evaluation conclusions based on viva voce evidence gathered from the field and OI Partners. With several players working on SGBV, women and conflict, it is difficult to attribute results relating to SGBV work at the country-level exclusively to Kc M interventions . What can be said however is that the project, in its own way, did contribute to mobilizing civil society organizations and certain levels of government to strengthen the direct agency of women in conflict preven tion, resolution and management processes. Some of this work was already happening prior to the inception of the Kc M project, especially in Nigeria and South Sudan . Even after its completion, t he KcM project r etains great potential to contribute significa ntly to regional level responses and approaches to SGBV especially in conflict settings. This report will later detail various intiatives at a regional and continental level through which KcM could have leveraged such a contribution based on findings and l earnings from country level work. The assessment of the evaluation team on the project's contribution versus attribution with regards SGBV in conflict include the areas of: beneficiaries, policy linkages/ changes, institutions, project indicators and monit oring and evaluation as a measure for tracking contribution and attribution. 3 Summary of Project Findings For ease of reference, we have clustered our findings into five broad categories as follows: Project Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Efficac y and Sustainability. We list under each theme the respective findings and recommendations. Overall, the Evaluation found the following: The KCM Project (the Project) is timely , relevant and potentially sustainable provided that appropriate adjustments ar e made to it as detailed hereunder; The Oxfam Pan Africa Programme, Oxfam liaison offices and Oxfam country offices have the relevant experiences and skills which was very pivotal in implementing this project. An implementation model of relying on local organizations coupled with supporting both national and drawing evidence from the work of country level staff was helpful in building a continental experience while regional NGOs/ networks remain critical in this type of work. The high staff turnover seeme d to c ause delays but did not stop the project as activities were implemented as Oxfam and partners took deliberate steps which led to the significant completion of activities , which evidenced the positive project management principles put in by Oxfam. The achieved results are broad and show that the project may have influenced other outcomes but the indicators do not reflect broader outcomes but narrow down t o specifics. While this may have shown some weak links, the project concept remains very relevant a nd as such, indicators should be well thought through in the next phase of this project. This will improve the outcomes and business model for implementing the project given that advocacy and influencing is fluid in nature . The Project business model or d elivery method was sufficient in achieving the results given that it was crafted as a pilot initiative , but a second phase is required to catalyze the nature of envisaged change within the present African context and lifespan of the Project given that more time and efforts is required in the long term to achieve advocacy outcomes. KcM activities as envisaged within each of its three (3) result areas have achieved remarkable progress which needs to be built on to build the nature of critical mass and politic al influence required to achieve the project's stated outcomes and impact. Moreover, the complex three -layered result areas approach was never provided with sufficient life in order to work and intersect as planned; The Project budget was utilized mainly u nder result area 2 which comprised of country level engagement to draw evidence for continental influencing. By December 2015, 55% of the budget had been utilized while the budget for continental engagement (translation, interpretation and communication) h ad not been utilized which may be normal given that the country level engagement was meant to draw and build a body of evidence for the Africa level influencing and engagement. This limited access to non -speaking English regions. Of note is the learning th at training materials need to be adapted for semi -literate and non-literate women. The theory of change and the project design were aligned but could have been strengthened since there was no baseline to benchmark progress and results. Furthermore, the out put and outcome indicators were in line with the ToC and project design but they were not crafted as results. The development of outcome and results indicators was dependent on the finalization of the continental research. This would have enhanced qualitat ive and quantitative measurement of results for this project. While the project had substantive and sustained programme or technical partners, the successful delivery relied on its country implementing partners, SOAWR and the research consultant. This part nerships and network needs to be fully utilized. For example, the partnership with SOWAR could have been better utilized given its broad base. Other partnerships which Oxfam does have including with the Peace and Security Council, Special Envoy on Women Pe ace and Security, critical African peace and security 4 research institutes, Universities and CSOs working specifically on SGBV and Conflict at the regional and sub-regional levels were very useful and can be better utilized in a possible next phase of this project. It is important to also note that where partnerships and collaborative approaches to working were implemented, such as the research reference group, the evaluation teams were unable to determine the extent to which these were maintained and consis tently used. The approach to communication generally and social media in particular was tied to formal activities such as workshops and beyond these there was limited social media activity and engagement. A communication strategy for the project might have strengthened participation and local ownership . Though there are mixed results, as over 64 per cent of project beneficiaries at the country -level in South Sudan and Nigeria generally found the project of benefit in increasing knowledge about SGBV, UNSCR 1325. Country -level work on SGBV is on -going. Most Oxfam partners in the two project countries remain engaged and interested in taking the Project objectives forward with facilitation from Oxfam and its partners . Summary of Project R ecommendations Based on the findings above, the report proceeded to make the following general recommendations on the KCM project. Although some of the programme design is pegged to current and emerging trends with the S ub-Saharan region , a new study needs to be carried out that will enable Oxfam to strengthen its theory of change, project scope and focus, its business model, communication, advocacy and social media strategy and financing. Using the proposed baseline study, Oxfam should develop a revised project with more stream lined focus and appropriately linked outputs and outcomes. Once revised the Project can be used to broaden the financing base beyond the existing single contributor; The revised project should have a comprehensive partnership strategy to reach out to Afri can knowledge and research institutions that have expertise in women's rights, governance, and peace and security, including aspects relating to elections and SGBV . Equally critical will be partnerships with various African Union ( AU) organs and institutio ns, including the AU -PSC, AU Special Envoy on Women, Peac e and Security; the Gender Directorate, Pan African Parliament (PAP), regional economic communities (RECs) , regional parliaments ; regional tribunals , organizations representing African judges and lawyers, psycho - social support institutions and etcetera. The Project needs to develop a comprehensive performance management system, including a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems and risk log. KCM project managers should be given sufficient sp ace to innovate and adjust activities and processes to suit demands of the target constituency and constantly changing operational context. In particular, the project management team should comprise of the three levels and be able to make requisite adjustm ents to the project in keeping with the overall objective and intended outcomes The revised Project would need to seriously engag e with IDPs, refugees and the Diaspora s (non-resident citizens of conflict affected areas) . These constituencies are linked to survivors displaced by conflict as well as resources and mediation capacities . These constituencies are often re -victimized within recipient countries and within refugee and IDP camps. This would create a unique opportunity of linking the UNSCR, Maputo Protocol and IDPs convention wor k as well as open up various advocacy channels/ connections/ networks. 5 Specific Recommendations for OXFAM and ADA Pre-approval 1. Baselines are important - the complexity of the subject area and proposed approach to SGBV -conflict nexus implied by the KcM project requires that multiple level baselines and political economy analysis be undertaken prior to project inception in order to be able to demonstrate impact upon project closure 2. Prior to approving a project, theory of change an d results chain must be clarified 3. Depth and breadth of proposal must be analyzed, especially if its single donor support 4. Critical institutional support (staffing vs. nature of task) 5. Incorporate potential partners at project conceptualisation phase and take full advantage of long -term partnerships. Business model 1. Adopting a bottom -up and participatory, focused approach to programme design 2. Developing a more comprehensive p erformance management system for the project, including M& E and Risk Log 3. Catalyzing or facilitating linkage with similar -focused projects 4. Strengthening investment in partnerships and project management 5. De-linking success of result areas on the successful implementation of another result area - or providing more time for the achievement of result areas Content issues 1. Strengthening outputs and outcomes related to economic and social values (e.g. economic participation and addressing inequality) at different levels of the project cycle 2. Strengthening diversification of PARTICIPATION metho ds, Impact Assessment & Shared Learning 6 1.1 Background In most African societies, sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) is an issue that is hardly mentioned publicly due to the stigma that is associated with it; not only to the victim but also the family. Women suffer sexual molestation, rape, battery and are often denied their economic and political rights, as well as opportunit ies to contribute to decision making at family and the community levels . Perhaps because often, the perpetrators are known to the victims or are even family members or close relations, the families involved try to (in the claim of protecting the family name) keep it in the family without much consideration for the physical, emotional and psychological damage to the victim s. During conflict, there is a fundamental breakdown of the structures of law and order and t he unfortunate reality is that s exual and gender based violence which is an issue even in peace time escalates exponentially. Studies have shown that SGBV is oft en used as a strategy by opposing forces and as a result the scourge of SGBV disproportionately affects women . Despite this reality, there is a lack of accountability on the part of national governments to tackle the appalling trend that render women's bod ies' sites of war. Furthermore, women are largely excluded from formal processes both during and after conflict thereby denying them a voice both about obtaining access to justice and ensuring that conflict and post conflict plans are appropriately gendere d. 1.2 Africa: The Continental Women, Peace and Security Framework In January 2014, coincid ing with the inception of the KC M Project , the then African Union Commission Chairperson, Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini -Zuma appointed a Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Secur ity (Mme Bineta Diop)6 whose mandate is to, \" ensure that voices of women and the vulnerable are heard much more clearly in peace -building and in conflict resolution \". The Special Envoy's work aims to close the gap between policy and implementation. The Spe cial Envoy's mandate is anchored on the priority pillars of the landmark United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, subsequent related UN resolutions and African Union instruments and policies. It is hence articulated around four main strands: The p revention of violence against women and girls in conflict, situations of in security and in times of peace The protection of women and girls from sexual and gender -based violence(SGBV), including in humanitarian situations; The participation of women at al l levels of decision -making in the prevention, management, resolution of conflict and peace building processes. The recognition and incorporation of gender perspectives in relief and recovery efforts. The overall goal of the Office of the Special Envoy's (OSE) programme is to accelerate the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in Africa and contribute to the overall African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), based on the following objectives: Support women and women's groups in conf lict prevention and peace -building Develop a continental results framework for monitoring and reporting on the implementation of women, peace and security commitments at national, regional, and continental levels Monitor, evaluate and report on the imple mentation of the framework 6 Bineta Diop, the Founder and President of Femmes Africa Solidarit\u00e9 (FA S), an International NGO that seeks to foster, strengthen and promote the leadership role of women in conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa. 7 Promote women's leadership and initiatives and showcase best practices for replication Strengthen the efforts of the African Union on Women, Peace and Security for better impact Build partnerships with various stakeholders inc luding developmental agencies, civil society organisations, women experts and groups and peace and security partner In pursuance of this mandate from the 14th to 15th December 2014, the Special Envoy convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia a Consultative meet ing of AU member States and regional economic communities that have developed action plans on UNSCR 1325 in order to review and share experiences towards enhanced implementation and monitoring. Nigeria shared its country experience on resolution 1325. Th is experience is summarised later in this report. During the 25th African Union (AU) Heads of State and government Summit in June 2015, AU Heads of State and Government resolved to \"develop, implement, and report on National and Regional Action Plans on Un ited Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) to accelerate the Women, Peace and Security Agenda''. This was echoed by the resolve expressed by the African Union Commission ( AUC), member states and partners, during the PSC Open Session held in November 2015 celebrating the 15th Anniversary of UNSCR 1325, to firmly move from resolutions to actions that will effectively promote women's rights on the continent in line with global, continental and regional frameworks for the participation and prote ction of women and girls in Africa. The women, peace, and security agenda has developed an elaborate architecture at global, continental, and regional levels. This architecture comprises of a strong normative framework built around a basket of policy and legal instruments starting from United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and subsequent resolutions, which has been embedded and developed further at continental and regional levels; implementation frameworks which include national and regional acti on plans on UNSCR 1325 as well as other WPS commitments; regional policy engagement platforms on WPS; and institutional programs, measures and flagship initiatives. The continental results framework currently under development by the Office of the Special Envoy (OSE), funded through the AU Gender, Peace and Security Programme (GPSP), complement and strengthen this architecture by providing a monitoring, reporting, and accountability tool for performance on the WPS agenda7. In the process of developing the continental results framework, the OSE convened consultative meetings of AU Member States and Regional Economic Communities (RECs) that have developed Action Plans for the implementation of UNSCR 1325. In July 2016 , the African Union Commission Chairpers on , Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini -Zuma launched a report prepared by the OSE of the African Union Commission Chairperson on Women, Peace and Security. The report canvassed the core global, continental, and regional commitments to the WPS agenda; tracks the develo pment of UNSCR 1325 National Action Plans (NAPs) and Regional Action Plans (RAPs); and outlines the main areas of achievements on implementation at national, regional, and continental levels. It represents the first attempt to capture the state of implemen tation of women, peace, and security commitments at all levels in Africa. Furthermore, it provides data from further research on various case studies of achievements on participation in the nineteen Member States that have adopted NAPs, including on parlia mentary representation, leadership, and special measures; ministerial level representation; participation in peacekeeping police and military contingents; and in peace agreements. The bulk of the report then focuses on measures taken by Member States and RECs to implement their respective Action Plans, as well as elaborating the African Union Commission's significant work with regards to 7 www.peaceau.org>page>40 -5676 -stati; see also summits.au.int>events>au -chairperso n, February 8 the WPS agenda. It further fleshes out the challenges, as well as the current and emerging opportunities to accelerate i mplementation, concluding with specific recommendations at national, regional, and continental levels. It identifies key intervention areas to accelerate implementation, performance, and impact for women across the continent. This AUC report is a notewort hy contribution to the agenda for women, peace, and security. It highlights the State of Implementation of Women, Peace, and Security Commitments in Africa. This report forms the basis for enhanced dialogue and engagement with AU Member States and Regional Economic Communities on accelerating implementation, as well as better informing the African Union's engagement with international interlocutors and partners on the Women, Peace and Security agenda in Africa, a priority area in the delivery on the Africa Peace and Security Architecture. Of significance is that during the lifetime of the KcM, the OSE was at the forefront of three key AU enquries into SGBV in conflicts in South Sudan, Northern Nigeria and the Central African Republic (CAR). The OSE was a member of the Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan, led a fact finding visit to Borno State in Northen Nigeria following the abduction of the Chibok girls and was intimately involved in ensuring women in CAR were included in reconciliation and accountability efforts8. These are noted as significant moments that KcM could have taken advantage of in relation to the project implementation. 1.3 The Situation with IGAD, ECOWAS and EAC The regional economic communities are active interlocutors in the conflicts within the two KCM project countries, Nigeria and South Sudan. As such, it is important to situate national projects within their sub -regional contexts. We discuss these briefly below: 1.3.1 IGAD IGAD is constituted of eight Member States, namely: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. Its focus areas are structured into three pillars: Agriculture and Environment; Economic Cooperation and Social Development; as well as Peace and Security. Since its institutionalization, the Gender Affairs Program has accomplished many gender equality and women's empowerment initiatives. Among the major achievements of the program are the development of a Regional Action Plan (RAP) for the Implementation of UNSCRs 1325 and 1820. The RAP mainly focuse s on women's participation and inclusion in decision -making processes on conflict prevention, resolution, management and the prevention of sexual violence against women and girls during situations of armed conflict. An IGAD Women and Peace Forum (IWPF) was also established during the April 2011 Women and Peace Conference to oversee and/or monitor the adoption and implementation of the RAP at different levels. Among IGAD Member States, Uganda is the only country which has developed a NAP. Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan have reported developing their respective NAPs, but have not yet endorsed them through their policy organs. The IGAD Secretariat mobilizes funds from development partners for implementation of programs/projects as Members States' contributions a re meant for operational expenses. The technical support required by Member States and committed by IGAD Secretariat for developing additional NAPs and following up on the adoption of the RAP at national level could not be rendered due to a lack of funds. 1.3.2 ECOWAS The ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework (ECPF) adopted by the ECOWAS Mediation and Security Council (MSC) in January 2008 is the framework for operationalizing efforts to prevent conflict in ECOWAS Member 8 www.peaceau.org 9 states. To support the implementation of the ECPF, the Commission has set up an Internal Steering Committee in which the Directorate of Gender is an active member and has formulated a 2012 -2017 Women, Peace and Security Action Plan and prepared a 3 -Year Priority Plan for the Implementation of the Women, Peace and Security component. ECOWAS has a Strategic and Operational framework for the implementation of UNSCR 1325 and some of the key operational accomplishments include ECOWAS institutional mechanisms for conflict prevention and response, collab oration between ECOWAS and civil society in the design and implementation of peace and security initiatives and all ECOWAS Member states (except Cape Verde, Benin and Niger) having UNSCR 1325 NAPs at various stages of implementation with varying degree s of success. ECOWAS Heads of State are constantly reviewing legal instruments to ensure gender sensitive provisions. In spite of some challenges, there have been concerted and accelerated efforts by ECOWAS and partners to ensure the mainstreaming of gender an d women's concerns in the entire peace architecture in the region. 1.3.3 EAC Currently the EAC has a Peace and Security Unit which coordinates implementation of peace and security initiatives. There is also a Gender Unit which oversees gender mainstreaming acr oss all EAC sectors. The Peace and Security Unit and Gender Units are jointly working on implementation of 1325 at the regional level. The implementation framework proposes the establishment of a Gender Desk with a gender expert within the Peace and Securi ty Unit to oversee implementation of 1325 in the EAC Region. This proposal is yet to be considered by the relevant policy organs. The proposed implementation framework has an in -built monitoring and evaluation mechanism based on a clear logical framework w ith specific deliverables and timeframes. Key partners in implementing the 1325 Action Plan have been identified in the RAP from governmental and non - governmental sectors based on the EAC maxim of 'people -centred, private -sector driven integration'. The I mplementation Framework is yet to be considered by the Joint Meetings of the Sectoral Councils on Cooperation in Defence, Interstate Security and Foreign Policy Coordination. Once considered by this key policy organ, it will be subjected to the Council of Ministers as it has far reaching financial implications. The decision of the above captioned policy organs will thus provide a clear way forward on how 1325 will be implemented at the EAC level. 1.4 The National Context At the AUC SEO convened meetings, Niger ia pointed out that given the large geographical area that needs to be covered, it had resorted to training women at the grassroots level to talk to their children on the issues of terrorism and extremism as part of their counter -terrorism efforts and the domestication of Federal Laws to State levels for improving lower level reach. The country had also started admitting women in the cadet scheme in order to put women at the forefront of helping other women. Nigeria has also set up a steering committee to b ring actions together to strengthen the implementation of UNSCR 1325 by monitoring and reviewing NAP. On participation, Federal Government of Nigeria indicated that it had established sector -specific gender policies for the Nigerian Police and the Independ ent National Electoral Commission (IEC). It has also undertaken research with partners in target areas with an emphasis on women's preventive and res ponse interventions. In terms of protection and promotion, Nigeria has : carried out an IDP Charter of Dema nds; capacity building for over 30 civil society representatives on UNSCR 1325; it has commissioned a research into the 'Gender Dimension of Social Conflicts, Armed violence and peace -building to lead to policy. In the South Sudan context, political proces ses were continually disrupted by conflict, with parties missing the deadline to set up a Transitional Government of National Unity over a deadlock in establishing 28 states. Women were bearing the brunt of the conflict and incidents of SGBV continue d. It was expected that the African Union Summit w ould present a strong opportunity to remind South Sudan and the international community of the importance of ensuring that addressing SGBV is an important part of the peace and security processes and that 10 there i s redress for the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war as the conflict rages on. In addition the country was (and still is) experiencing a significant economic down turn and the rate of crime has risen proportionately. 1.5 The KCM Project Oxfam in collab oration with other stakeholders developed an intervention strategy 'Kilio Cha Mabadiliko: Ensuring Accountability for Gender Based Violence ' to mitigate the incidences of SGBV in localities that ha d suffered from conflicts over the years. In South Sudan, t he project was implemented by Oxfam South Sudan in partnership with Support the Children Organization (SUTCO) and in Nigeria it by Oxfam Nigeria in partnership with Community Based Development NGO (CBD -NGO). The overall objective of Kilio Cha Mabadiliko: E nsuring accountability for Sexual gender based violence(SGBV) Project ( hereinafter referred to as the ' KCM Project'), was -as the title suggests ,'to strengthen the political , economic and social response of African States to SGBV targeted at women in situ ations of conflict. The change that was sought to be achieved through the KCM project and hence the envisaged sustainable benefit for the target group ( women in situations of conflict ), was amplification of their 'voice in ensuring state accountability fo r SGBV before, during and after conflict through, amongst others: Research Strengthen ed access to justice for women, and Increased participation of women in decision -making. It was envisaged specifically that the result of the KCM project intervention wo uld include increased women's participation and contribution to decisions on conflict prevention, management and response at continental, regional and national level. Further that State policies would provide for the effective prevention and response to SGBV in conflict. The KCM project identified as pre -requirements the following sources of verification at inception of this work: Baseline analysis of women's participation in conflict management processes A Compendium of existing State policies that addre ss SGBV 1.5.1 Results, Risks and Resources The project set for itself three ( 3) key result areas ( KRAs ) with the following related indicators: i. Result Area 1: The Indicators for KRA.1, included the following: Terms of reference (ToR) reflecting project purpose Researchers suited to the ToRs identified in the 3 target countries and contracted Empirical data developed on cost of conflict related SGBV in post -conflict reconstruction Published research findings Research findings inform policy decisions and advocacy at national, regional and international levels to prevent, manage and resolve conflict The activities planned under KRA.1, included the following: Development of ToR of researchers per country Policy and legal responses to sexual and gender based violence be fore during and after conflict are influenced by empirical evidence on the economic, social and political cost of conflict for women in the Egypt, Nigeria and South Sudan 11 Identification and contracting of researchers Research underta ken in the three (3) target countries on the economic , social and political impact of SGBV before, during and after conflict Research findings published using print and electronic means Two high level consultations with target AU institutions and regional CSOs on governance , democracy and economic development for the dissemination and validation of the research findings9 Research findings validated at regional and national levels10. ii. Result Area 2 : The indicators of this KRA were: Audit of on-going peace and security initiatives undertaken and demonstrating clear strengths, weaknesses and gaps Two members of SOAWR develop policy papers on ending SGBV and use them as advocacy at the AU Summits in January and July 2014 through effective judicial mechanisms at national levels11 Two members of SOAWR are supported to mobilize civil society in five(5) target countries12 to monitor the implementation of AU decisions on women's peace and security using judicial means The activities under KRA.2 were to include the fo llowing: Identification of opportunities and gaps in laws of target countries for access to justice for conflict related SGBV survivors with regards to UNSCR 1325, 1820 Protoco l Support SOAWR and the women's re ference group to conduct targeted advocacy at PSC Public Forum Day for the ratification of the Maputo Protocol by Egypt and South Sudan as well as the post -ratification implementation in these countries and in Nigeria. More specifically, to advocate for th e implementation of the relevant UNSCRs in all three countries . iii. Result Area 3 : 9 The AU institutions in this project referred to institutions within the AU including Pan African Parliament amongst others. T he high level consultations were envisaged to ensure colloquial support in all arms ( governance, de mocracy and economic development ) towards sustained implementations 10 The validation of the research findings were planned to take place nationally where stakeholders including state officials an d national CSOs would be part. More so at the region, it was envisaged to utilize one of the regional meetings (Africa continent) and hold a side event to validate these findings. 11 The national contexts were to be used in defining and developing the Policy papers in relation to SGBV and use this to influence the na tional governments towards advocating for the rights of the women and survivors of CRSV in conflict situations 12 The reference to five (5) target countries in the Logical Framework is was a mistake as the project was only planned to be implemented in thre e countries. The CSOs in these countries were intended to hold governments to account in ensuring implementation of Peace and Security deals. Survivors of conflict related sexual and gender based violence are supported to acce ss justice through increased use of international instruments and policies on prevention and response to SGBV at continental, regional and national levels. 12 The indicators for this result area, included the following: Reference group of women established and participating in AU programs on peace and security ; Oxfam Pan Africa Pro gram (Gender Justice) sets up and manages an efficient listserv and data base on conflict prevention, management and resolution in collaboration with its regional partners ; High level dialogues informed by the work of the reference groups and the data base , and attended by reference group members, provide policy direction at the national, regional and continental levels ; Enhance capacity of AU peace and security architecture and AU member States to respond to conflict related SGBV through strengthened coord ination of initiatives on SGBV in conflict ; Increased number of women participating in the continental and international platforms ; Increased profiling of women in national, regional and international forums on conflict ; Some of the activities envisaged un der this KRA.3, included the following: Creation of data bases of women engaging in conf lict management at the national , regional and continental ; Establishment of reference groups f or each country drawn from the continental, regional and national levels13 Support the training of reference groups to engage in SGBV in Conflict prevention, management and resolution through preparation of policy briefs on the conflict situation in each of the three ( 3) countries and disseminating these at the national, regional and continental levels ; Support women in the reference groups to attend AU Summits and other international platforms and exercise leadership capacities in decision making ; Organize at least one high level dialogue and advocacy forum on SGBV in conflict at continental level to facilitate women's participation in decision -making ; Coordinate and manage information on sexual violence in conflict to inform policy decisions at regional level through regular analytical updates on processes and developments on pea ce and security (with a focus on women) in the AU developed and shared with implementing partners ; Support SOAWR partners to monitor the implementation of AU policies and decisions on women and girls in conflict sit uations; Coordination and harmonization o f Oxfam and partner priorities with regard to influencing AU and national governments on SGBV in conflict . iv. Sources of Verification The results from the three ( 3) KRAs would be verified using the following sources of information and data: Research reports Policy decisions of the AU and respective countries Publication of research findings Terms of reference Researchers contracts 13 The reference group was intended to include experts groups with an interest in or knowledge of the country and was intended to be that of national actors already engaged in either SGBV and conflict transformation a nd peace -building related work 'Increased and meaningful participation of women in continental, regional and national decision mak ing platforms on prevention, management, response and resolution before, during and after conflict' 13 Link to research report in various virtual spaces Online responses to research findings Report of validation sessions Report of training Reports of ACHPR14 Policy Briefs Activity reports of CSOs Reports of the reference group meetings Listserv Reports of the AU Peace and Security Council Reports of High Level Policy Dialogues Monitoring reports. v. Assumptions and Risks This section o utlines the assumptions of KcM as stated in the project document15 and discusses the assumptions as derived and concluded in the process of the evaluation exercise. Stated project assumptions Some organs of the AU were restriceted to CSOs and Oxfam and im plementing partners would rely on existing relationships to undertake advocacy work; The successful implementation of the project would be dependent on commitment of SOAWR partners at national levels; Political will would be necessary and important for ach ievement of results at the regional level and project partners would rely on close collaboration with the AU; Project partners would have access to exisiting partnership agreements with various AU mechanisms; and There was sufficient space for project par tners to work with various state entities at national levels towards amending laws on SGBV. Derived project assumptions The primary assumption of the project was the existence of both a policy and programmatic gap in the implementation of provisions of UN SCRs and the Maputo Protocol with respect to SGBV before, during and after conflict. Having made this assumption, the KcM project assumed that such gaps could be resolved through policy briefs and advocacy at the African Union level and more specifically w ith the Africa Peace and Security Council (PSC) and the African Commission on Human and People's Rights ( ACHPR). Fundamentally the project assumed that the gap between policy and implementation, and in the case of Egypt and South Sudan between the situati on on the ground and non -ratification of critical SGBV international and continental human rights instrument could be cured by more evidence of the socio -economic and political cost of SGBV against women and girls. As such the project targeted local and re gional policy -making platforms as its primary targets to carry out its policy change objectives. This evaluation takes the view that a thorough and 14 The project sought to specify its actions on only on ACHPR and APSC reports and not the Council of the Wise, AUC Chair Special Representative on Gender and Conflict and Regional Economic Communities (RECs) that were more engaged with . This should be included in the next phase. 15 KcM Project Document 14 evidence -based power mapping at both the local, regional and continental levels would have resulted in a mor e nuanced and comprehensive range of interventions, actions and targets. During project design, some critical stakeholders, i.e. religious and traditional leaders were left out and this ha d implications on delivery of the project. However, these groups were later engaged. The project posited states as the primary actors both in terms of making appropriate policies and creating the enabling environment. It assumed that states would be accountable; that they would implement the policies that they make and also that women in the affected countries would be able and willing to participate in these processes. The KcM project saw significant components turning on the groundbreaking research it intended to conduct on the cost -benefit analysis. In this regard, the project assumed that there would be support for the research at the national levels ( and by implication, at the local level as well). It was further envisaged that data and other information required to conduct the research would be accessible from offic ial/government sources. It further assumed that the governments in the three respective countries would prioritize addressing SGBV ; most poignantly that women survivors of SGBV would be interested and willing to engage publicly at the national, regional an d continental levels notwithstanding the social, economic and political constraints attendant to such engagement. The project assumed that the AU Summit and general policy space would be accessible to women drawn from the countries in question as well as CSOs. To the contrary, other than financing INGOs, there was documented and growing evidence to the contrary. The AU Summit was increasingly becoming a closed space for CSOs and African citizens. The KcM project also assumed the existence of capacity within the AU bureaucracy to comprehensively address SGBV pre, during and post -conflict. As demonstrated above, at a rhetorical level there seemed to be political will evinced by the establish ment of the office of the special envoy on women , peace and security a nd the special gender project within the AUC Chairperson's office. Indeed , the normative frameworks for addressing SGBV during conflict already exist within the AUC. The most prominent instruments are the Maputo Protocol; the African Charter on Democracy Elections and Governance (ACDEG) , the AU Post -Conflict Reconstruction and Development ( PCRD) policy Framework and the African Charter on Human and People's Rights ( ACHPR). The gap between normative frameworks, political declarations and implementation of t he stated aspirations points to capacity and reso urce constraints at the member state , regional and continental levels. The KcM Project could potentially position itself to resolve this strategic impasse. 1.6 Preconditions for the Successful Implementation of the Project The successful implementation of the project was premised on amongst others : Effective coordination between Oxfam and its regional partners ; Memoranda of Understanding (MoU ) between Oxfam its collaborative partners regarding the different aspe cts of the project ; Good rapport between Oxfam and existing leadership /government structures at national, regional and continental levels ; Close collaboration between Oxfam and the AU Commission, AU -PSC and other critical players ; The ability of the women 's movement to reach out beyond its core constituency and build/sustain effective partnerships with other continental associations working on broader social justice, governance and rights issues ; and Women willing and capable of taking up spaces opened up by the opportunities for participation in decision -making and generally for advocacy at the national, regional and continental levels . 15 In our view, we would add to this: the genuine engagement with a broad diversity of national actors, including policy ma kers, CSOs, traditional and faith leaders; and the quality of the baseline data and also cogency, relevance and currency of the pre -inception analytical work. In our conclusion, the K cM project was successful in amplifying the voices of women in ensuring state accountability for sexual gender based violence however, its intention to address the social, economic and political costs of SGBV during and post conflict was not fully achieved as the cost aspect that was brought out by the research did not get a c hance to be mainstr eamed into the overall project. 1.7 Purpose and Scope of Evaluation The Oxfam Pan Africa Programme partnered with Equality Now, Secretariat to a continental women's rights coalition, the Solidarity for Afric an Women Rights Coalition (SOAWR), and local implementing partners in Nigeria (CBD -NGO) and South Sudan (SUTCO) , to increase state accountability for CRSV and SGBV, and increase participation of women in decision making processes in conflict and post conflict settings. In Nigeria, the evaluation focused mainly in Plateau State, and across three local government areas na mely; Jos North, Riyom and Wase. In South Sudan, the evaluation focused in Juba across Muniki, Rajaf and Gondokoro payams. The evaluation also focused on the regional work o f the project, implemented through SOAWR/ Equality Now based in Nairobi, Kenya. The project addresses the issue of SGBV utilizing 3 approaches as follows: Advocacy based on empirical evidence to bring about positive policy and legal change through nationa l and continental research. This project also tackles the issue of access to justice for survivors of SGBV throughout the conflict continuum; from the need for reporting and appropriate management of incidents of SGBV by authorities to facilitating access to legal services and raising awareness of SGBV throughout communities. Furthermore, the project works to amplify the voices of African women in decision making by bringing together marginalized, vo iceless and unrepresented women. It brings together survivors of conflict, local organizations and communities, law enforcement officials, justice mechanisms (formal and informal), and continental mechanisms . The aim is to accelerate the realization of women's rights by amplifying African women's voices and pr omoting their meaningful participation in key decision making spaces by targeting attitudes, practices as well as policies that prevent the inclusion of women in post conflict decision making spaces. The evaluation therefore looks at the project achieveme nts/impacts in terms of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and its sustainability. This also includes identifying best practices that emerged as the project was implemented, project challenges and recommendations using the project objectives and expected results as guideline. 1.8 Methodology The evaluation team employed traditional methods of research. The team used a combination of primary and secondary research techniques including: desk review and interviews and focus group discussions respectively. This i ncluded a literature re view, Internet research, document analysis, in -depth interviews , focus group discussions and use of self -administered questionnaires. Focus Group Discussion (for an indication of the number of FGDs that were conducted and the number of people present and their affiliations, s ee Annex 2: Focus Group Discussions for PCCs and select community leaders) : The groups and interactive discussions engaged stakeholders, project beneficiaries and survivors of SGBV in both Nigeria and South Sudan. Participants for each of the focus groups' 16 discussions were homogeneously grouped (with gender consideration) depending on the category of target project beneficiaries and stakeholders. In-depth Interviews: Interviews were conducted using similar principl es as a focus group, but the interviewees were individually interacted with, but in few cases, there were two or three interviewees (for an indication of the number of interviewees in South Sudan for example, see Annex 2: Key informant interviewees) . This exercise took place either in offices of the interviewees and some in mutually agreed upon locations. Desk Research: This involved desk review of relevant related documents and materials available and other useful extant literature and reports on the subje ct. This essentially involved review of project documents and available related project reports. Evaluation limitations The major limitation to the evaluation process is the limited time frame allocated to the same , in particular time in the field . There were significant delays in appointing the evaluation team and some documents were made available at the request of evaluation team at different points of the evaluation process. Financial data for the final project year was provided after the first post -evaluation meeting , as at the time of this evaluation, the financials had not yet been audited . There was a clear sense of various amounts of knowledge residing with different team members, across all project partners. These may be limitations arising out of the high staff turnover within Oxfam and the other critical partners. At times perspectives on the same issue tended to differ depending on the time at which a particular member of staff either left or joined Oxfam or its implementing partner organizatio ns. The evaluation team did not receive any internal memoranda; notes to file or other such communication indicating how the staff turnover and interim project management arrangements were catered for. Certain aspects of the KCM project either did not tak e off or faltered for varied reasons. Cases in point are the Egypt country programme and the regional advocacy component to be implemented by Oxfam in partnership with SOAWR ; which did not take place due to the security situation in Egypt . The Oxfam Egypt country office was hesitant to pursue the project following the national laws restricting INGOs action and restricting support for national CSOs . In certain KCM project areas both in Nigeria and South Sudan (for example the outbreak of civil war in South S udan that led to the project being paused a period of time ) there were significant security concerns that limited access and therefore implementation . This made the triangulation of results from the local to the continental challenging. Mitigation strategi es were adopted to prevent these limitations from impacting the quality of the evaluation. For instance, the evaluators were able to reach out to community leaders and project beneficiaries to participate in different focus group discussions and in -depth i nterviews. The Oxfam country teams were also able to provide some useful background materials . The Evaluation used the DAC/OECD evaluation framework to interrogate the different outcome/result areas of the project with a dual purpose of assessing the extent to which expected results were achieved and to glean critical lessons, challenges and recommendations to strengthen the project. For areas with exemplary practices and successes, this report highlights these as scalable practices. T he specific criteria used in the evaluation covered the following issue areas: 17 i. Relevance: The consistency of the K cM intervention with respect to the participants needs and the extent to which this consistency evolved over the years; ii. Effectiveness: Attempt s to assess the extent to which the KCM project achieved its desired and planned outcomes. The evaluation team also analyse d the extent to which the key stakeholders remained satisfied with the interventions and what actions would have been appropriate to enhance the stakeholder satisfaction; iii. Efficiency: Examine s the relationship between the resources implemented and their costs, on the one hand, and the funded outcomes, on the other hand. In addition, the Evaluation team also assessed whether the resources of the project (funds, expertise, and time among others) have been converted into results in an economical manner in programme work processes. Based on the programme work plan, the evaluation establish es the extent to which the production and delivery of outputs / outcomes / impacts were achieved in a timely basis. iv. Impact: Measure s the benefits of the KcM programme on the relevant stakeholders, legal and policy frameworks, and particularly on the involvement of women. The team analyze d the long -term effect s (or the perception of effects), both positive and negative, primary and secondary, that are reasonably attributed either partly or entirely to the intervention under evaluation, whether directly or not (direct and indirect effects), or intentionally or n ot (expected and unexpected effects); v. Sustainability: Aim to determine the extent to which the approach/result/outcome/output from the project interventions are likely to continue over a long term. The evaluation team also assesses the sustainability of the structures/institutions initiated or supported under the project, as well as the sustainability of the effects created by K cM. In applying the above criteria, we deemed it necessary to begin with the conceptualisation of the programme, its design and ch oice of implementation tools, including its utilisation of information communication technologies (ICTs) and social media platforms. We also paid particular attention to the existing work by SOAWR, FEMME - Solidarity Trust, and national CSO platforms. We als o considered the K cM project's understanding of the context, role players, and factors of power and influence (both formal and informal). 18 2.1 PROGRAM CONCEPTUALISATION 2.1.1 The Theory of Change The Kilio Cha Mabadiliko (KCM)/SGBV project aims to increase state accountability for conflict related sexual and gender based violence and increase the participation of women in decision making processes in conflict and post conflict settings. It addresses the issue of access to justice by facilitating legal services to victims and ensuring appropriate management of cases by authorities. The project raises awareness about the dangers of SGBV and encouraging victims and families to speak out. The KCM/SGBV project also aims at bringing about positive policy and legal change through research at the national and the continental level. Additionally, it amplifies the voice of vulnerable and disadvantaged women and promotes their participation in decision -making especially in post conflict communities. It also addresses the issue of capacity building for Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), security personnel, government agencies and other stakeholders that are involved in the project. The KCM sought to create a platform which could provide information, training, civic education, l eadership skills imbued with a critical gender and women's rights lens on a broad set of governance values and development issues. It was assumed that this cohort of women leaders once equipped to understand the continental SGBV and Women's rights context and their own countries from this women's rights specific lens would become active agents for democratization and leadership transformation or changes in how conflict prevention, conflict resolution and post -conflict reconstruction is done. The theory of c hange did not sufficiently unpack the context, the range of actors and the driving interests beyond the local political elite. 2.1.2 The Scope of the KCM project The KCM was conceptualized as two -tier project (national and above national ) and was implemented in three ( 3) countries, Egypt, Nigeria and South Sudan. It defined women's justice needs using a very broad lens derived from the UNSCRs and the Maputo Protocol. The project focused on the broad subject of SGBV pre, during and p ost conflict in the three targ et countries . Differerent diversities e.g. women in urban settings, rural areas, unemployed, young professionals, nationality, political persuasion, religious affiliation and etcetera16 were missed out from the project design phase. The selection of the ref erence group seems to have focused on women, already in positions of leadership or potential leadership. At an aspirational level the programme set out to represent the full gamut of women across the socio -economic, political and geographic divide in the three countries. It had no specific activity targeting political parties, traditional leaders and leaders of faith based organizations. The project in the KR.1 was exceptionally using research institutions and did not target the educational institutions wi thin the targeted conflict areas . The evaluators therefore deem e ducational institutions as centers of learning and knowledge and considering the target age group of the project, the project should seek using such as these could provide added value. The ge ographic spread within each country was limited to specific areas and in South Sudan this was an area dominated by a single ethnic group. The project should therefore intend to develop programme that seeks to built collaboration across ethnic and religious groups. In Egypt, the restrictive national laws on INGOs action and restrictions towards supporting national CSOs, project understands of the emerging post -revolution dynamic as well as the unique position of the Oxfam country programme in that country le d to the KcM project not fully taking off. 16 Interview with Ms. Janah Ncube , Director OXFAM Pan -Africa Programme at t he time of the KCM project inception (23RD May 2017) 19 2.1.3 Programme Design and Approach Although the country research was commissioned to inform the issue relating to the socio -economic and political cost of SGBV before, during and after conflict, there was no comprehe nsive baseline study done before the programme was designed and rolled out. It was suggested that the use of existing data, country scoping studies aided the development of the KCM project, however the evaluation team has reason to believe that the project format and approach did not change in response to the study outcomes and some of the critical views raised by experts and implementing partners during the validation process. Given the project's ambition to utilize evidence, knowledge and data, this omiss ion is problematic in relation to its design, implementation and outcomes. An additional challenge is the full inclusion of project partners post design and resource mobilization of the project. While Oxfam relied on and was confident of existing partners hips, past collaborations and being a SOAWR member, trust and collaborative spirit could have been further consolidated through inclusive design and fund raising. The notion of a programme designed at the Oxfam Pan Africa level being cascaded to local Oxfa m's in Egypt, Nigeria and South Sudan created a number of communication and trust deficits, not least with local CSOs. SOAWR's constraints in implementing some of the components of the project, particularly lack of networks with the stakeholders whom the p roject was targeting affected the project's achievement of result 3 . There is a huge body of pre -existing work by United Nations (UN) Agencies, other non -governmental organizations ( NGOs), and bilateral aid agencies on a broad spectrum of women's rights an d SGBV issues in the three ( 3) countries. While a database of experts and a reference group were successfully formed, t here is limited reference in the project design to this pre -existing work and experiences17 on SGBV in conflict situations within the proj ect document . Existing expertise in the area18 was not sufficiently mapped and targeted for ongoing participation. This omission had the effect of re-inventing the wheel in an area where a lot of existing work was underway19. If such verification was indeed done, the method or tools of undertaking this verification were not shared with the Evaluation team and can therefore not be verified. This is particularly poignant because of the challenge of attribution of results and impact, especially at a national, regional and continental level. It creates a disconnect between activities undertaken and level of success claimed and attributable to the project. 2.1.4 A Critique of the Conceptual Basis and Parameters There are numerous and varied thematic issues relating to addressing SGBV and conflict nexus , and they include : Women's equal participation in governance ,policy and political processes ; Women's economic empowerment ; Access to justice and rule of law , which include :rights education ,legal empow erment, , demobilisation and reintegration; Peace -keeping and peace building ; Responsibility, coordination and cooperation. This required -of necessity that the KCM project tries to address the entire ecosystem of SGBV issues holistical ly, including issues of social transformation, social citizenship, social cohesion and violence. Related to this are 17 Gunilla de Vries Lindestam, UN Security Council Resolution 1325(2000) on Women, Peace and Security : Making it Work : Experiences in Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom with Recommendations for Sweden's Implementation, Upppsala University, 2005 18 Judy El -Bushra and Ibrahim M.G.Shal (eds), ' Cycles of Violence: Gender Relations and Armed Conflict, Accord,2005 19 Interview with SOAWR Staff 20 critical questions of women's economic participation and empowerment as well as psychosocial support for survivors of SGBV. The effective i mplementation of resolution 1325 and Maputo Protocol requires a victim or survivor -centred approach. Such an approach assumes both socio -economic and political agency of women in policy and development processes. The quest for justice by survivors of SGBV -as demonstrated in previous conflicts in Rwanda and Sierra Leone - cannot be satisfied by more laws and policies. Rather, it is possible to be subjected to recurrent SGBV even in the context of progressive laws and policies. A case in point is South Afri ca where incidents of SGBV have arguably surpassed alarming proportions. For interventions on such a sensitive and structural issue to have a transformative value, they need to address structural causes and broader socio -economic factors. The impact that the KcM Project planned to have was extremely broad and overly ambitious for the budgeted time, resources, processes and interventions. There is no causal link between the broad objective of the KCM project to \" strengthen the political, economic and social response of African States to sexual and gender based violence targeted at women in situations of conflict \", for instance, and de veloping a data base of experts , publishing research findings, and doing advocacy with the African Union(AU). Reports to the A U PSC and high level dialogues on SGBV could not necessarily affect and effect deeply embedded social pathologies and the power and privilege of patriarchy that causes particular types of constructions of violent masculinitie s. These processes require educ ation , conscientization, incentivization and penalties. In its actual implementation t he project tended to narrow down to an approach whose main change tools were: convening , research papers , lobby papers and occassionally court cases. We have noted elsew here in this report that the AUC Chairperson's office and the Special Envoy on Women ,peace and security had already undertaken several interventions or were in the process of so doing. These included the following : AU Commission of Inquiry into the confl ict in South Sudan , focusing amongst other things on SGBV ; AUC Report on the Status of Women, Peace and Security in Africa ; High Level dialogue of AU Member States and experts to review progress towards development of UNSCR 1325 and related national act ion plans ; and Fact finding visit to Borno State, Northern Nigeria. These interventions covered pertinent aspects of the KcM proj ect . Once these were on course , the project ought to have been re aligned to engage and inform these in a transformative mann er. The proposal to seek to convene similar meetings further nuancing in order to avoid duplication of efforts or limited contribution to transformative value . This evaluation found that in certain respects, the KcM project as framed proposed to undertake work that was already being done by the African Union Commission and openly supported by the AU Heads of State and government. Greater clarity and specificity was therefore required to articulate the residual intention to hold national governments and nece ssary stakeholders to account in implementing AU policies . This focus on strategies to ensure implementation of agreed AU positions should have been apparent in the mid -term project evaluation or review or post that moment. The evaluation sought to determ ine whether the KCM project interventions did strengthen Nigeria and South Sudan responses to SGBV and conflict nexus and how it did so on political, economic and social policy and programme levels as envisaged by the project objective? It specifically enq uired whether the planned results were achieved? And if not, the lessons learnt. We - in fairness to the recurrent staff turnover - recorded results that were not necessarily stated as intended, but were the result on project inputs and interventions. This acknowledgement of sub -intended or unintended results in our view does not serve as a substitute to what the 21 KcM's original project intention was. We thus conclude that though the project did not fully achieve its originally stated objective, it performed well on other fronts relating to the SGBV continuum. 2.1.5 Social transformation and Violence The pursuit in South Sudan of unproductive extractive -led development; the endemic poverty in Northern Nigeria and the polarization of post -revolution Egypt present th ree conflicts where the nature, causes and forms of violence differ. However, the devastation of such violence upon the lives of women is similar. The KCM project was focused on the sexual and gender -based (SGBV) against women and girls before, during and after conflict. It was hoped that Nigeria's oil wealth would result in economic development of the entire country. Many also hoped that the 2011 revolution in Egypt would result in greater freedoms and more opportunities for women. In South Sudan the pro mise of independence was meant to usher in a new era of hope, unity of purpose and prosperity. In all three countries, there was an overall expectation that the economic potential would increase well being of significant numbers of people. Howeve r, greed, grievance and identity politics has brought the rapacious quest for profit and power into sharp conflict with people's demands that their material and social needs should be fulfilled. Some argue that in all three countries, the political and economic clas s is no longer capable of acting as representatives of national interests because these clash with the profit and personal power motives. The systems of governance and political elite seem incapable of transcending the fundamental weaknesses such underutil ization of productive capacity, the persistence of large groups of unemployed youth, and recurrent economic crises. The economic models pursued by the three countries have created their own absurdities and irrationalities, such as vicious ethnic and religi ous chauvinism, grand corruption, and violence against workers and peasants. Women in the three countries under review have -as a result of conflict - been exploited, oppressed and reduced to dependency. Wealthy men or men with access to the state or means of violence have also sought to establish political, economic, military and cultural hegemony over the rest of society, which were economically or militarily weaker and therefore could not resist domination. This dominance is an extension of patriarchy wi thin the public sector, it exploits women and 'weak men', and it makes policy and forces everyone else to be its dependent. This has led to the under -development of large sections of the population, especially women and girls20.The system of economic produc tion and political governance have intensified their own political contradictions in trying to subjugate the masses of the people and maintain a veneer of normalcy to the international community, so that workers, peasants, youth and women in all these thre e countries have become self-conscious and are determined to take their destiny into their own hands . Such a determination is integral to the process of social transformation. The dominance of the economic and political elite in the three countries under review relies on its ability to discipline and reorder, rather than eradicate and replace, different forms of economic and political rationality. State ideologies, juridical forms, religious orders, traditional/customary law may perform such functions , which define the peculiarly subordinate condition of the rural African woman. This subordinate condition defines the rural economy and does not merely reflect it. Paradoxically the Egyptian, Nigerian and South Sudanese states' power rest upon the articulatio n of modern capitalist and pre-capitalist formations. These states have constructed a hierarchy of citizenship prerogatives based on education, income, gender and rural -urban divides. State 20 Celso Furtado, Development and Underdevelopment ; Frank, Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America; T.Szentes , The Political Economy of Underdevelopment.( Budapest, 1971) ; Samir Amin , 'The Class Struggle in Africa.

Dominan t ideological formations within these three states are both a class politics and a reflection of the objective economic relations that constitute class. There is, therefore , a compelling case to be made for critically addressing the respective state's poli cy discourse on women's rights, women's economic empowerment, participation and leadership as well as the social hierarchies that it presides over. These determine the social, economic and political agency of women within Egypt, Nigeria and South Sudan. I n other words, official policy discourse on gender equality defines and structures hierarchies of rights and citizenship for both peace and wartime . The policy discourse in all three countries has considered education, primary health care, and wage labour as the key vehicles for social inclusion, regardless to the fact that all three are facing profound crises in these countries. The adoption of austerity measures in Egypt and Nigeria resulted in the withdrawal from policies of redistribution in preference for social and public expenditure cuts and fiscal discipline. As a result, the social policy discourse in Nigeria and Egypt has continued to rely heavily on individual labour market participation as a primary condition for social inclusion of women. The g overnments talk a lot about 'job creation' and 'market access for women as primary tools for addressing the feminization of poverty. It is often drummed in the ears of women that full citizenship revolves around individual responsibility, labour market activation, and the 'avoidance of dependency' on public spending. Generally these governments have long abandoned policies that promote generalised social provisions funded via redistributive transfers. Official policymaking views most redistributive ideas as conducive to the creation of 'unsustainable' fiscal burdens, that while sapping private investor confidence, would encourage poor people's claims and expectations for more state 'handouts'. The KCM project seek to address issues of social citizenship, social policy and the transformation of SGBV factors in pre, during and post -conflict situations. 2.1.6 Social Citizenship T.H. Marshall21 and more recently G.Esping -Andersen22 defined the public provision of social benefits that do not strictly depend on individu al employment positions as a central feature of 'social citizenship'. This may include different forms of social insurance, social assistance, healthcare, retirement benefits, farming inputs, and other benefits funded through public spending23. These benefi ts are not intended to exempt beneficiaries from participating in waged jobs. In reality, Nigeria, Egypt and South Sudan have over the last couple of years witnessed deepening erosion in the social welfare functions of the State. Limited formal employment opportunities for women and limited public social welfare schemes have over the last decade or so meant that there is dominance of a social policy discourse that emphasizes, self-help, family -based solidarity, and community development to deliver social se curity to the majority of poor, unemployed, peasant or informal workers. In all three countries, formal employment as a basis to fund social security has significantly shrunk as a result of public spending cuts, wholesale privatization and trade liberalisa tion. The systems of social security in the three countries are poorly developed only covering a minority of formally employed workers and addressing a very limited number of contingencies24. Equally, social assistance funded through taxes has been increasi ngly confined to groups with special needs and vulnerabilities (children, elderly, disabled, terminally ill and etcetera). Public pension and health care is also very limited and in some instances are wholly privatised . As a result, the 21 T.H. Marshall, ' Citizenship and Social Class', in T.H. Marshall, Class, Citizenship and Social Developm ent (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1964),pp.71 -134 22 G.Esping -Andersen, The Three Worlds of Welfare ( Cambridge, Polity Press,1990) 23 F.Fox -Piven and R.Cloward, Regulating the Poor.

Annan -Yao( eds), Social Policy in Africa ( Dakar, CODESRIA, 2004),PP.23 -46 23 majority of women i n Egypt, Nigeria and South Sudan do not have access to, let alone enjoy any form of access to social security schemes25. The rural -urban divide defines citizenship in political, social and economic terms26. The development governance frameworks in Egypt, Nigeria and South Sudan are characterised by a contradiction between a social and political framework that enabled expectations for redistribution and access to jobs, services and resources and a macro -economic policy thrust based on containing social claims in the interest of fiscal discipline and austerity. In these contexts the government's responsibility towards the poor and unemployed is often de -emphasized and the responsibility for self -upliftment is placed on the poor and unemployed27. The rapid urbani zation that has taken place across Africa present opportunities to understand how quantitative changes in society ultimately lead to an entirely different society or one that is sufficiently reformed. This often happens when the social relations in a soci ety are no longer effective in promoting advance or when they begin to act as a hindrance to and on the productive forces. The increased interest in Africa's vast mineral wealth and natural resources by foreign nations and transnational corporations ( TNCs ) has been accompanied by violence in places like Sierra Leone, Libya, Niger Delta in Nigeria, Mozambique, Angola and etcetera. Equally so, the demand for more inclusive forms of development and governance, have led to violence. It is possible to surmise that violence occurs when the ruling classes in any society are threatened with removal by the process of change. When that ruling class is well defined and coalesces around specific identities such as ethnicity and religion, their consciousness is at a hi gh level. Both the political, bureaucratic, economic and military elite recognise what is at stake and resist any change that threatens their class, ethnic, racial and other privileges. In the recent revolutions in North Africa, these classes fought to hol d onto social relations that no longer corresponded to the new demographics and technological advances of their countries. Yet as was the case with Libya and most of post - independence Africa, the majority of the leaders had ascended to power through populi st revolutions premised on the clarion call to change. The notion of revolution, class and gender consciousness must be borne in mind when it comes to examining the situation of women in Egypt, South Sudan and Nigeria, whether they are workers or peasants . Notably, for the countries under review - and notwithstanding the 2011 revolution - the ruling classes have not been completely crystallized and the changes have tended to be gradual rather than revolutionary. More poignantly, development from a gender per spective has been grossly uneven, so much so that it is possible to talk about a 'gender apartheid'. While all three countries have experienced development, it is equally true that the rate of development differs from country to country, and within each c ountry different constituencies of women have increased their social, economic and political opportunities at different rates and for different reasons. There are no easy answers to the question why different countries, and regions of each country develo ped at different rates even in times of peace. One of the answers is that in the process of economic production, different countries have created or maintained forms of social relations, forms of government, patterns of behaviour and systems of belief tha t together either hinder or catalyse the development trajectory of any given society. The other is that imperial dominance and foreign occupation has imposed these and added to or distorted pre -existing indigenous institutions, beliefs and practices. The beliefs, practices and institutions as well as political culture are never the same in any two societies. Each element interacts with the economic system to produce different results. For instance, the political and religious patterns in Northern Nigeria af fect each other and are often intertwined. Equally so, the religious beliefs in Egypt, Northern Nigeria and South Sudan about the feminine purity, women's 25 W.van Ginneken, ' Extending Social Security: Policies for Developing Countries', International Labour Review, 142, 3(June 2003), pp.277 -294 26 M.Mamdani, Citizen and Subject, Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Late Colonialism ( Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1996),pp.218 -264 27 C.Offe, 'Towards a New Equilibrium of Citizens' Rights and Economic Resources?' 24 roles and responsibilities affect how women in these contexts engage with the political, public power , economic and social structures of authority. While in the final analysis the recent breakthrough to new forms of gender relations may be catalysed by increased uptake and use of information communication technologies (ICTs) by women, it must be borne in mind that the social and political relations in any given society have a marked impact on the rate of development. Further that invisible power wielded by religious and traditional authorities goes beyond that of elected officials in most rural settings. The body of beliefs, motivations and soc io-political institutions that derive from the economic structure and policies of any country also affect how the economies are shaped. In Egypt and parts of Nigeria religious, educational and bureaucratic qualifica tions are of utmost importance, especially amongst state officials. As such men tend to have greater powers as bureaucrats than as militia and the bureaucracy, therefore, it is an important instrument for transforming or defending the status quo. In 2011/1 2 Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the logic was that in order for the excluded majority to advance they needed to overthrow the status quo. The result was a sanitised return of elements that were part of the bureaucratic, economic and political elite under the overthrown regimes. Notwithstanding, the following presents the findings and analysis of the evaluation exercise in both Nigeria and South Soudan. 25 This e valuation is a key instrument for understanding the project implementation success and challenges that can then be used for learning and policy improvements. The outcomes from the evaluation aim to provid e insight on how the project has made changes in the areas of SGBV for the specific communities in Nigeria and South Sudan . The evaluation aimed to investigate how the approach/results (outputs, outcomes , impacts) enlighten these communities on SGBV issues, advocated for the passage of laws and policies, and established mechanisms that drive reporting, documentation and holding of perpetrators of SGBV accountable. The analysis is extended to discuss which other approaches/results were instrumental to achieve the project objectives. The findings from the evaluation serve as a source of knowledge for systematic learning in continu ous improvement for the modalities of implementing future project activities. 3.1 Relevance 3.1.1 KCM Relevance Result Area 1 The development of a solid evidentiary basis upon which to anchor responses and programming on SGBV in conflict lends great relevance to t he KcM project. The potential for KcM to contribute to the growing body of work on CRSV in Africa, and the particular focus on the economic, social and political costs of CRSV is relevant. The development of this project was intently dependent on the previ ous programming of Oxfam and its partners (especially SOAWR). This however did not fulfill all the indices as expected in this project. The absence therefore of a baseline study to inform and provide pointers to the most pertinent aspects of such a study, given the abundance of historical and ongoing work on CRSV, did not inform towards the relevance of this study, and especially analysis on the study objectives. The evaluation team concluded that in as much as the study was relevant, a new KcM project wou ld be desirable and might serve to achieve the specific objective of the existing project. In order to do this, it would have to : (i) Undertake a review of the lessons learnt in doi ng CRSV and SGBV work generally ; (ii) Analyse the successes and failures of projec ts intended to empower women socially, economically and politically ; (iii) Understand the gap s in policy implementation and s tate capacity on both CRSV and SGBV; and (iv) Would also have to define the knowledge and practice gaps in order to formulate its clear value -added as well as value -proposition . Result Area 2 In both Nigeria and South Sudan, to a very large extent the K cM programme was relevant. In the case of Nigeria, it was largely considered relevant by a t least 75% of the stakeholders and beneficiaries as observed from the participant's feedbacks during the interviews and focus group discussions. The approach by the CBO -NGO forum to partner with other CSOs, the media, National Human Rights Commission, the State Ministry for Women Affairs The project relevance section makes an overall assessment of whether the KCM project is operating in line with relevant gender frameworks in Africa and the current governance discourse. It also looks at the extent to which the program complies with the general known priority issues of the target group based on existing research amongst others. 26 and the State Minis try of Justice, the State Assembly, and traditional rulers among others gave the project additional influence. In South Sudan, the project commenced at the right time (i.e. post 2013 conflict) and created frameworks that speak to SGBV violations that came with that period, and which continue to exist. By 2013, there was a gap in the number of organizations working in response to SGBV cases in South Sudan, hence the relevance of K cM in the new nation. This conflict persists, as do challenges of accountabili ty and redress for SGBV. The South Sudan project would have - of necessity - to focus on, amongst others: access to justice , rule of law and state accountability ( including the accountability of belligerents ). It would also have to focus on documentation o f the unfolding atrocities committed against women by both sides of the conflict. The engagement with specific components of the international community ( e.g. UN, Canada, China, EU and USA ); regional actors ( e.g. IGAD and EAC) and the Africa n Union. There have been three Commissions of I nquiry (COI) into the South Sudan conflict since 2014 all with specific attention paid to SGBV as international crimes in conflict28. These have gathered extensive evidence and reported publically on the same , but with little transformational impact on the national context. The OHCHR Commission has received a renewed mandate from the Human Rights Council and will commence work in the third quarter of 2017. Result Area 3 The evaluation team found that more clarity was required in articulating the gap that the KcM project was filling at the continental/ regional level. As demonstrated above, much work has been undertaken at the AU through the OSE on Women Peace and Security. It is clear that both Oxfam and SOAWR possess signific ant experience and knowledge of engaging various policy and practi se stakeholders at the continental level and the scope for leveraging these is great. However, as was pointed out during the course of this evaluation, the existence of these relationships a nd networks did not necessarily translate into a ready -made network for advocacy on economic, social and political costs of CRSV29. In this regard, the evaluation team, found it necessary for the project to clearly articulate the KcM regional component and ensure its relationship to the other results areas . In particular , the evaluation team found that an operational and strategic impasse between implementing partners on the regional work resulted in country level work losing a critical linkage to the region al processes as observed above. There were many developments within the African Union Commission that KcM project was unable to fully take advantage of. 3.1.2 KCM Approach towards addressing SGBV issues and increased participation for women The project overall objective is ' to amplify the voice of women in ensuring state accountability for sexual and gender based violence before, during and after conflict through research, strengthened access to justice for women and the increased participation of women in decis ion'. In Nigeria, advocacy campaigns, sensitization and capacity building of the justice and gender affairs ministries helped to minimize ignorance around SGBV and provided women and families with knowledge and awareness of their rights and protection. Most participants interviewed acquiesce that at the time of the birth of South Sudan, in 2011, cultural norms were prevalent, which unfortunately viewed women in a certain negative light. Women's leadership and participation in all sectors of society (includ ing within the family unit); as well as the awareness of women's rights were not prioritized. To this end, such a project holds relevance in changing this thinking. 28 African Union Commission of Inquriy on South Sudan (AUCISS) (2014 - 2015), Office of the High Commission on Human Rights (OHCHR) Assessment Mission to South Sudan (2015 - 2016) and OHCHR Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRISS) (2016 - 2017) 29 Interviews with Oxfam and SOAWR/ Equality Now staff 27 3.2 Effectiveness Result Area 1 The opening summary of this report notes that from the inform ation shared with and available to the evaluation team, it was not possible to conclusively determine the extent to which the research outputs were used/ useful for the planned objective to use the empirical data for legal and policy responses. The results and activities described to the team at the country levels show success in implementing/ facilitating/ enabling some litigation and policy adoption. However, it is also clear that there was no visible linkage between the country (or continental) research and the programming on SGBV on the ground , following the restrictions and challenges in -country causing delays on finalization of the research report . On the other hand, the project can not claim standalone effectiveness under this Result Area if considerin g the research on its own. Despite several sets of feedback at country and regional levels questioning the sensitivity and representativeness of the research reports and research teams, comprehensive research reports that aimed to quantify the economic, po litical and social costs of CRSV were produced. Unfortunately, the extended amount of time it took to complete the reports significantly affected the effectiveness. Result Area 2 Feedback from a variety of stakeholders during the evaluation process conclu ded that the project was effective as implemented at country levels . The evaluation team gathered that in both Nigeria and South Sudan, though in some instances reporting SGBV is still difficult, particularly when committed by a family member or partner, t he majority of SGBV cases are now reported directly by the victims, witnesses or observers. In the case of Nigeria, the project was able to inculcate struc tures and mechanisms that drive prevention, reporting and resolving of SGB V cases across different le vels. T his includes the Peace Sisters mechanism, the secondary school children school club, the engagement of the of the Ministry of Women and Gender Affairs that has the statutory mandate to handle women and SGBV issues, the further engagement of existing structure including the Child Protection Network and the community/traditional and religious leaders. Furthermore, the project has contributed - along with other actors - to the inclusion of women in decision and policy -making positions. For instance, in the State House of Representatives, three women were successfully elected and played a huge role in ensuring that the State Assembly passed the Gender and Equal Rights Bill ; the Riyom Local Government was one of the project communities that successfully el ected a woman as its Local Government Chairman. Similar institutional and capacity building arrangements were set up in South Sudan to drive prevention, reporting and resolving of SGBV cases ; for example, the formation Protection Committees for Communit ies (PCCs) in the payams of Muniki, Rajaf and Gondokoro (in late 2013 and early 2014) as a response to SGBV occurrences. These areas - relatively close to Juba (with Gondokoro on the Island being the furthest) - became pilot study areas, which were targete d for SGBV awareness raising through the volunteer -based PCC mechanism. PCCs in all three payams comprise of a variety of community members (i.e. about volunteers in each PCC) including policemen/ women; youth; community leaders or traditional leaders; wom en representatives and social workers, amongst other stakeholders. In addition, in Juba Hospital, there is an increase in the numbers of people coming to seek services - all evidenc e that awareness raising on SGBV matters (largely through the radio This component looks at the extent to which the project was suc cessful in reaching its objectives. The effect is the immediate outcome of an activity as opposed to the impact. This parameter includes assessing whether the value from the activities could be optimized to for the achievement of OXFAM goals and those of t he beneficiaries. 28 and am ongst communities) by the CSOs has made a difference. In these establishments, select staff (i.e. social workers, midwives and/or nurses and doctors) have been equipped by organizations such as I nternational Rescue Committee (I RC) and UNFPA to address SGBV situations. Rape survivors are taken to specific social service providers who have been equipped to do this work. Furthermore, in both countries, the project advocacy and communication processes, messaging and stakeholder's engagements w ere very proactive , adequately addressing the issues and speaking to the appropriate stakeholders. One of the main output s of this, was the successful passage of the Gender Bills and acts (see table 3.4.1 and 3.4.2) in both countries that have helped to address the legal an d policy gaps relating to SGBV and women participation in decision and policy making. Below are some of the outcomes of the projects against some expected results in both Nigeria and Sudan as stated by the FGD and KII participants30. 3.2.1 Project Results and Ou tcome for Nigeria Results Area Outcome/Impacts Access to Justice. Survivors of conflict related sexual and gender based violence are supported to access justice through increased use of international instruments and policies on prevention and response to SGBV at continental, regional and national. Gender and Equal Rights Bill Passed; Changed the community's orientation about SGBV from not being an issue to an issue that demands attention and response; Improved and instill ed the culture of reporting of c ases of SGBV despite wrong cultural and religious believes; A good number of SGBV cases managed/resolved at community level by traditional rulers and other stakeholders with women in participation, according to respondents of Ganawuri, an average of 4 - 5 cases (minor cases) are handled at the community level per month; 3 cases of SGBV successfully went through the court processes and perpetrators were convicted and are serving their j ail terms; Good number of Magistrates and Police, especially in the proj ect communities understands the context, issues and challenges of SGBV - according to Director ate, Ministry of women and gender affairs, - our lawyers were further empowered on how to discharge their responsibilities on SGBV cases; Advocacy groups still su stained even after the project as they are still engaged in lobbying and advocating for the Gender and Equal Rights Bill to be gazetted even after the project has ended; Women's rights organizations such as the International Federation of Women Lawyers ar e now providing free legal services to victims of SGBV, thereby reducing the cost of litigation; 19 cases being handled on pro-bono basis by the women's rights organization and the police without victims paying fees; GEO Law has been simplified into local languages (Pidgin and Hausa); 30 Nigeri a and South Sudan field evaluations, April 2017. 29 Building Leadership Capacity: The voice of women is amplified through their increased participation in continental, regional and national decision -making platforms on prevention, management, response and resolution before, du ring and after conflict. Functional and sustained mechanism for first level response and documentation of SGBV cases at the community level - the Peace Sisters mechanism; Empowered and Improved women participation in decision and policy making engagement - for instance, a woman was appointed a district chief Gindiri; Improved stakeholder's coordination, engagement & interaction in responding to SGBV Issues /cases; Functional and sustainable secondary school Clubs on SGBV issues and the clubs has started replicating; Increased reporting of cases; Perpetrators are now been held accountable for committing SGBV violence - with three convicts already serving their jail terms Table 1: Matrix of KCM Project Results and Outcomes for Niger ia 3.2.2 Project Results and Outcome for South Sudan Results Area Outcome/Impacts Work with the media and local artists around changing community attitudes and perceptions on survivors of SGBV and awareness raising on SGBV. 76 members of Protection Committees for Communities (PCCs) community leaders, and women leaders trained on fundamental human rights and what constitutes human rights violations Communication materials on roles of PCCs in SGBV developed 1 radio show on SGBV held Short film on SGBV produced t o be used in community advocacy on SGBV 200 community members, leaders, police and local government officials were reached with SGBV awareness campaign Asses s and support information management systems at community level. 80 PCCs members on SGBV data, dat a collection methods, effective documentation and storing information on SGBV in safe and secure locations; STCO joined Gender National Sub -cluster meetings and the GBV Working Group for Central Equatorial State where they share updates on status of report ing of SGBV cases. Support establishment and training of references that would constitute 50% women, who work closely with the police and existing customary courts to resolve SGBV related conflicts. 16 police Stations, 4 law firms and 43 customaries court s were mapped and have agreed on modalities of working. Table 2: Matrix of KCM Project Results and Outcomes for South Sudan 30 Result Area 3 The Result Area 3 was recorded as averagely affective. Interviews with all stakeholders aff irmed that, generally, Result Area 3, or the regional component of the work, did not take place in a coherent manner. At the time of engaging the ACHPR empirical evidence to present as the research was incomplete , however the regional partner was innovativ e in using documentations related to the study findings (as referenced in the continental report) . We have already indicated that several other processes -independent of KcM - within the AUC had placed the issue of SGBV -Conflict nexus on the agenda. The eva luation team has provided evidence and recommendations that shall ensure effective business model or implementation approach to deliver on the objectives of the KcM project. While the intention to generate and use empirical evidence for policy advocacy and engagement is appropriate, to hinge the ability of undertakin g advocacy in a very limited amount of time renders the planning and the heavy dependency on new networks and collaborations partly ineffective. 3.3 Efficiency Result Area 1 The evaluation team es tablished that a research reference group was convened at the inception phase of the project. This reference group carried out its terms of reference successfully, providing support to the research consultants and enabling them to undertake their work. The evaluation team was however able to determine the usefulness of this reference group, and even their support or engagements in the research process by the consultants. Efficiency within Result Area 1 was also affected by the failure to finalise a version of country reports and continental report until the very end of the project. Research consultants experienced delays and numerous changes to report versions due to the security situations in these countries. Result Area 2 The Evaluation team gathered tha t overall the project experienced delays at the outset due to many factors. However, there were some mitigating steps implemented to recoup the time lost by liaising closely with the local implementing partners to review work plans and budgets to assess fe asibility of completion of key deliverables. In the case of Nigeria, the logical frame work was reviewed to suit the current changes from pushing for the GEO bill to be signed into law to sensitization of the public about the law using simplified local la nguages (Hausa & Pidgin), and the development of the implementation guidelines and gazette the law. In addition, incidence of ethno -religious crisis within the communities affected implementation of program activities at the community level. These adjustme nts at the national level are not adequately reflected at the Pan Afr ica Programme level and notably , the original KcM risk log was not adjusted from inception until the time of the evaluation. The innovativeness exhibited at the country level, to adjust o riginally intended interventions to suit changed context is a sign of good leadership at the country level. In South Sudan , the project encountered increased costs of implementation due to the significant depreciation of the South Sudanese Pound, high crim e rates that affect project staff free movement to project areas, and civil unrest between some communities in South Sudan during the project period that halted the implementation for about two months. Furthermore, due to the inaccessibility of some projec t areas due to bad roads during rainy season, activities planned for the raining season could not occur. In both cases, there was a strong recommendation on balancing budget allocation between military and social services that address SGBV in conflict sit uations. It is the parameter to measure the planning, organization, cost effectiveness and value for money in achievement of results. Efficiency assesses the appropriateness of the resource appropriation of the project. 31 Result Area 3 In addition to challenges of appropriateness of project design, capacity and inclusion of requisite stakeholders, Result Area 3 was also adversely affected by lack of clarity between key implementing partners. In addition, the abse nce of a coordinating, feedback or complaint mechanism through which to address a lack of consensus or sticking points, added to the poor communication. Lack of clarity over autonomy to alter or change activities on the part of implementing partners contri buted to inefficiencies of the project even to the point of limiting progress. The report and audited financials from December 2015 assist to provide further perspective on the project efficiency. December 2015 marked 2 years since the beginning of the pr oject but with about eighteen months of implementation. The above chart illustrates that with a project end slated for December 2016, there remained less than twelve months to expend more than half of the entire project budget. Result Area 1 had the lar gest percentage spent by December 2015 at 55% while Result Area 3 had spent only 16% and 27% (calculated only based on total project result -related costs) in 2015 and 2016 respectively of the entire budget for the reasons described extensively in this repo rt. More specifically from financial data available to the evaluation team, we found that the least expenditure (as per the April 2016 audit report - expenditures as at December 2015) was related to: (i) Result Area 1 - publishing and disseminating research ou tputs, translation of research materials, quality assessments of research outputs and convening to consider the research outputs31. (ii) Result Area 2 - all activities that relied on research outputs such as advocacy and lobbying activities and engaging activit ies on regional, continental and international normative frameworks32. 31 KcM Report and Audited Financial Statements for period 1 November 2013 to 31 December 2015 32 Ibid 32 (iii) Result Area 3 - this area had the lowest amount of spending at just 12% spent by December 2015. The highest percentage of spending was on office running costs33 while the lowest spending was related to all activities that included engaging with the AU on CRSV and SGBV34. The percentage of spent and unspent funds correspond with the assessment of achievements of the project. While eventually, there were research outputs to show for the coun try and continental research work that was undertaken, the fact that only 55% of the budget under this Result Area confirms a significant delay in completion of research that then had an impact on the completion of the other Result Areas, particularly Rese arch Area 3. SOAWR/ Equality Now returned a total of USD 24,372 unspent budget allocated to them to Oxfam in August 2016 due to inability to implement certain aspects of regional component and Oxfam took up the regional activities altogether; this was 2 mo nths prior to the initial end date of the project. Where the percentage of budget spent is low, this corresponds with the low burn rates of those same line items captured in the report and audited financial statements. 3.4 Impact Measures the benefits of the KCM programme on the relevant stakeholders, legal and policy frameworks, and particularly on the involvement of women, reasonably attributed either partly or entirely to the intervention under evaluation, whether directly or not (direct and indirect effect s), or intentionally or not (expected and unexpected effects) Result Area 1 Given that the research report was finalized at almost the end of the project, it is difficult to determine the impact of the outputs. It is important to note that , several unexpe cted developments emerged at different phases of the research including the need to remove sensitive data of research findings in order to preserve and protect individuals and institutions that participated in the research and were threatened for de -regist ration amongst other issues. The research report had to be re -edited after submission of initial report in October 2016 to avoid the risks referred to above. The evaluation concluded that the research report has been finalized , has been validated and will be launched again at a later stage . Result Area 2 In Nigeria, the media coalition has been instrumental in the successes of the project and they have been very helpful in airing programmes and ongoing advocacy visits with a dedicated phone line. Advocacy b y the group has also led to the development of an Action Plan by the State Government through the ministry for women affairs to address of SGBV and to promote equity for all people. Moreover, religious leaders who were trained under the programme have been helping to enlighten members of their faith who hide behind religion to perpetrate this crime. The project has collaborated with other existing organizations like the Peace Sisters, and Youth Peace led Platforms to become ambassadors for the project and c reated access for women and young boys and girls to participate in post -conflict dialogue. Below are some of the more detailed impact of the KCM Project: 3.4.1 KCM Project Impact in Nigeria Impact Area Explanation 33 Office running costs did not include Equality Now operational costs. 34 Ibid 33 The Gender and Equal Opportunity Rights Acts This is one of the tangible outputs of the project to be celebrated, it drives the issues of SGBV beyond just campaign, advocacy and awareness creation, and it gives it legal backing and opens great opportunity to hold perpetrators of SGBV accountable among other tangible outputs. The Peace Sisters Mechanism This has outlasted the project duration and has continued to exist, the evaluators observed that members of this group are still active and responding to their responsibilities in creating awareness, rep orting, documenting and participating in resolving conflicts in their respective communities and if they continue with momentum, the project outcome and impact will keep multiplying. The secondary school club Secondary school students in the SGBV clubs ha ve exhibited enthusiasm and an uncommon commitment to the cause. The students now sensitize other students and communities through the school morning assemblies, community outreach programs, and through discussions with their families. The idea is for eac h club student trained to transfer acquired knowledge to another 10 persons by te lling them their rights, educating them on what is SGBV, gender roles and how to access help in terms of need or how to help victims of SGBV Stakeholder engagement and coordi nation The project capacity to engage and coordinate different stakeholders was massive innovation and huge outputs, starting from the traditional rulers in the communities, the ministry of women and gender affairs, the media, other CSO's, survivors of SGB V, police, judiciary, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), legislators and their engagement as advocacy groups, their further coordination with other project established mechanism like the peace sisters and again the commitment of the individuals from these different stakeholders was very supportive to the project . The awareness creation approach The tools, messages and mechanisms used for the awareness creation and advocacy activities was well developed, innovative and implemented, starting from engag ing the peace sisters, to the football match, to use of media and their coordination as part of the project stakeholders .There was also wide engagement through press conferences, the documentary and most importantly empowering the traditional and communit y leaders to be part of the awareness and advocacy activities helped drive the message to the local and average citizens in the communities, most importantly is the fact that the awareness did not just end at informing the citizens about SGBV, it informed the citizens on what to do as a victims, (primary or secondary victim) witness/observer and established mechanism for taking steps to resolve the issues. Table 3: Summary Matrix of KCM Project Impact in Nigeria In South Sudan , there is a process achievement of KcM impact, however this does not negate the fact that the project has had an impact. There are many other qualitative ways in which the impact of KCM can be proven to be invaluable as seen in the matrix below: 3.4.2 KCM Impact i n South Sudan Impact Area Explanation Synergy and networks amongst CSOs working and creating awareness for GBV and SGBV related issues There is a GBV Cluster (at national level), a GBV working group (at State level), and the Women's Monthly Forum. This me ans that there are collective spaces and thinking that KCM can tap into with many pertinent reforms, which ultimately enhance GBV work and the KCM project. Establishment of a Rape Centre The Rape Centre in Juba, South Sudan clinically manages SGBV cases. Juba Hospital over the course of the KCM project has seen an increase in the numbers of people coming to seek services - all evidencing that awareness raising on SGBV 34 matters (largely through the radio and amongst communities) by the CSOs has made a differ ence. Education and awareness creation about key policies related to the gender discourse Several CSOs under the KCM project have worked together in pioneering GBV policy mapping. The following international/national policies and administrative instrument s were dominantly referred to as policy and legislative documents that have reinforced stakeholder advocacy and intervention in the South Sudanese context: The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women; The United Nations Security Cou ncil's adopted Resolution 1325; The South Sudan National Action Plan for the implementation of Resolution 1325 The Bill of Rights of South Sudan The South Sudanese Human Rights Commission The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights o n the Rights of Women in Africa, better known as The Maputo Protocol. It should be noted that the sheer existence of policies do es not precede that the policies will necessarily bring the required change. Policies are often in the written text, and are not always meaningfully domesticated and applied. However, CSOs reasserted that in the interim, they are more concerned about seeing these policies being brought into existence as well as ratified. The existence of policies was deemed important as it enables CSOs and other stakeholders to hold the State to account on matters related to SGBV. The production of a movie entitled \"The Cry of a Woman' (acted out in local Arabic), is an example of the medium used as part of the advocacy tools and which is particular ly well received in the rural areas. Inclusion and leadership of girls and women into social and political activities A core composition of women's rights defenders are present in the GBV Cluster as well as the GBV Working Group, and are actively holding key decision -making roles in these organizations . Table 4: Summary Matrix of KCM Project Impact in South Sudan Result Area 3 Completion of research outputs One significant finding of the evaluation was the impact of the absence of final research outputs on the implementation of Result Area 3 or the regional advocacy and policy engagement activities35. The absence of this element of the work meant a significant veering from the intended project approach, namely evidence led advocacy and policy engagement. SOAWR/ Equality Now described difficult conversations with AU personnel who requested the research outcomes and outputs as a basis for deciding how to proceed with collaborating on various activities on CRSV and SGBV in conflict at t he continental level. The evaluators therefore have recommended the use of this report in future advocacy interventions, as it intends to shed more light on the cost of SGBV, in comparison to the military spending. The next phase of this project should the refore capitalize on 35 Ibid 35 developing policy briefs and papers, packaged from the report to inform engagements at national and regional levels. Overall, respondents confirmed the un-achieved impact of the continental and regional piece of the project. Several hi gh level dialogues on CRSV with various AU stakeholders were planned but never held because of the absence of the research. The most significant effect was engagement with the PSC on military expenditure and its relationship to CRSV. Given the nature and s eriousness of the claims of an adverse relationship between military expenditure and CRSV added to the need to engage AU member states on these sensitive matters, there was need to have and present a solid evidentiary base. Ultimately, there was very littl e for SOAWR to work with for advocacy if sticking closely to the original framing of the project. Implementing partner interaction Result Area 3 was designed to deliver a database of SGBV/ CRSV experts and advocacy and policy responses to CRSV based on em pirical evidence. Several challenges, mostly due to the unavailability of the advocacy tools/ research report influenced the failed delivery of the planned outputs of Result Area 3. The challenges were largely characterised by the lack of clarity regarding implementing partner roles and responsibilities. The evaluation team characterises these as concerning: the use of the experts' database, use of resources and lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities between the two implementing partners for t he Result Area. The project successfully delivered a database of African experts on women peace and security and CRSV. The evaluation team established that implementing partners held differing approaches to the use of the database and beyond its developme nt was not utilised further. SOAWR/ Equality Now intended the database to be a robust and more dynamic tool; the evaluation established that this project sub -goal was not achieved36. It is important to point out that Oxfam Pan Africa programme are also SOA WR members. As such, the evaluation team concludes that the lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities was largely informed by an oversight to clarify the identity of all entities in the project. In other wo rds, who Equality Now or even Oxfam were r epresenting within the project was unclear. Related to this is a point raised by SOAWR/ Equality Now, that there was no staff time built into the budget for Equality Now staff37. Again the failure to distinguish between contracting Equality Now as SOAWR Se cretariat to oversee implementation versus Equality Now as a stand -alone entity that happens to represent SOAWR, was evident to the evaluatio n team. The team deduced that Oxfam believed some of the re -adjustments would be utilised for Equality Now operatio ns. This rationalisation by Equality Now is reasonable given the amount of time required for staff to co -ordinate SOAWR membership participation and project reporting etc. Lastly, the absence of research for SOAWR to undertake advocacy was probably the gr eatest impact on the inability to undertake the bulk of Result Area 3. Again, on this point, both Equality Now and Oxfam were divided about the research impact. Equality Now cited examples of the AU Summit and ACHPR session activities that could not be app roved or requests responded to after events had passed38. Some Oxfam suggestions were not agreed to by SOAWR / Equality Now citing risks of engaging in advocacy without a sound empirical/ evidentiary foundation given the quality of the draft report . Oxfam in dicated that despite these difficulties Oxfam and country partners including Equality Now participated in the ACHPR session (NGO forum and etcetera) that took place in Banjul 2016. At these meetings, the Nigeria and South Sudan report recommendations were shared in a panel, which later saw the South Sudan recommendations adopted . 36 Ibid 37 Intervie w with Equality Now staff 38 Ibid 36 3.5 Sustainability Result Area 1 The evaluation team learnt that ultimately, revisions were made to the r esearch report (internally by Oxfam) though its usefulness for future advocacy is uncertain39. The evaluators found that similar projects in the future may need to place the onus of commissioning research and disseminating findings on partner/ collaborating entities such as Equality Now with less or different operating risks than enti ties such as Oxfam. In the end, although the Nigeria report had been validated and the South Sudan had some reservations, these including the continental report were not available for use at the regional or national levels40. Result Area 2 The KCM project is based on creating strong local participation and ownership, amongst the target beneficiaries and institutions that play a leading role in identifying problems and developing sustainable solutions for the prevention of SGBV in conflict, as well as ensuri ng that women participate in decision making in post conflict and peace building contexts. F or instance, in South Sudan, the involvement of the County authorities and Payam administrators as key stakeholders in the project is significant in realizing sust ainability and the long -term goal of the project, furthermore establishments of the protection committees within the communities ensures ownership amongst the beneficiary communities. Secondly, the KCM project has enabled and empowered communities in Sout h Sudan. In the event that funding for KCM is ceased, the CSOs and community structures are well structured to continue the goals of the project, because people thus far have been involved in the KCM largely on a voluntarily basis without compensation. In Nigeria, the structures being created so far will greatly contribute to the sus tainability of the project. An examp le is the replication of youth -led peace platforms in the project communities; Peace Sister groups in the communities and the establishment o f mentoring relationships between the Peace Sisters and young women. Another structure that will ensure sustainability is the Anti -SGBV Advocacy Group, especially if empowered financially and replicated in other local gove rnment associations. Further examp le of stakeholders includes legislators, Police, Judiciary, traditional rulers are speaking and actively in support of the project in both state, local government and the communities. Collaboration with relevant Federal Government Ministries, Departments & Associations like Ministry of Women Affairs, Education, and Health in the state and relevant departments at the local government level to support the development of the GEO law implementation guidelines and gazette them - will also contribute to sustainab ility. State and local government level advocacy groups will continue advocating and support ing victims' access to justice and women participation in decision making platforms beyond the period of the project. Media engagement has also proved to be very ef fective and it is expected that after the project, the media will continue to report on SGBV issues as the foundation and knowledge base on responsibly reporting on SGBV has been laid. At community level, relevant structures had been put in place in the va rious communities (women peace sisters, men and women mentors had been trained to mentor younger girls on prevention and reporting SGBV cases). There has also been active participation and ownership of the project by community and religious leaders in the project communities. During the focus group discussions and interviews, several members of these constituencies confirmed the value of the KcM project and their tacit endorsement of the work on ending SGBV. 39 Interviews with OI and Equality Now staff 40 Ibid 37 Despite the limited interface between the regiona l and national players, SOAWR confirmed a sense that very good work was being undertaken through the KcM project at national and local levels41. They also suggested that they were viewed with a measure of suspicion by local players, however, by the time Oxfam convened a review meeting in January 2016, too much time and misunderstanding had passed to facilitate more positive interactions. 41 Ibid 38 Given the numerous actors working in the field of SGBV, SGBV in conflict (CRSV) and women's rights more broadly specifically in Nigeria, South Sudan and continental levels, it is difficult to attribute impact in these areas solely to the KcM project. It would also be incorrect for this evaluation to suggest that the KcM project was designed to attribute macro level changes and impact to its implementation. Below is a discussion of the project's contribution to SGBV in conflict. 4.1 Beneficiaries Other than the information relating to the number of persons who participated in workshops an d/or cases, we were not able to definitively conclude how many women, men, girls, boys and people in total have already benefited from the KcM project directly and indirectly. In our view the tracking and reporting tools applied by ADA/ADC should have been mainstreamed into the project and updated on a monthly or quarterly basis. This may have assisted to create a standard template for all levels of the project. Such quarterly reports would have been available for review by the evaluation team. 4.2 Policy link ages Many of the changes noted with respect to policies and governmental action plans; do not necessarily speak to the specifics of changes that occurred in the lives of women and girls in the project areas or that of the men and/or institutions from the i mplementation of the KcM project. In the concluding remarks to this report we argue that the project did not set clear or measurable outcomes and outcome indicators, it also did not evolve impact - level indicators. We concluded that it was premature to conc lude that specific positive and/or negative effects/impacts in terms of gender can possibly be attributed to the KcM project. However, we have noted the specific policy outputs. 4.3 Institutions Although we noted without question the observation by participa nts in a focus group discussion that traditional leadership and faith institutions have benefitted from the KcM project, we were not able to independently evaluate how and to what extent? This is moreso given the numerous actors working on SGBV in both Sou th Sudan and Nigeria. 4.4 Project indicators It was anticipated within the project document that outcome indicators would be derived from the research. As a result of the delays described herein, the research was only completed after the project was almost co mplete. Although the project had three result areas, it never developed clear outcomes and related indicators under each result area. This created evaluative difficulties as there were no pre -project and mid -term indications of numbers, percentages, quanti ties relating to resources, people, geographic spread or laws and policies to benchmark the sterling country level achievements against. Other work did happen parallel to and at times in collaboration with KcM as far as development of UNSCR 1325 National Action Plans (NAPs) and implementation plans. Reference to OI reports for the two countries for the period 2010 to 2013 further suggest that substantially related work was already underway both at the regional level under the SOAWR Coalition as well as at the country level financed by respective OI country programmes. It is fair to summise that the KcM project augmented, strengthened or extended the existing work. 39 The KCM project was - for practical reasons - implemented at the country and regional level i n order to build on existing work on SGBV. Some of this work bore no clear linkage to the SGBV -conflict nexus. The project conceptualization should have ideally avoided a mechanistic distinction between SGBV in non -conflict situations and its manifestation s within conflict, but rather looked at the continuum of SGBV from pre to conflict and post - conflict. The approach adopted in the project design was rightfully adjusted during implementation. Regrettably, the adjustment was not adequately documented and th is explains our critique of post -implementation attempts at attribution of success to SGBV as a stand -alone delinked from the conflict nexus as well as the socio -economic and political cost analytical matrices. 4.5 Monitoring and Evaluation , progress reportin g and tracking attribution We noted further that several other important elements remained tentative, as they were contingent upon the timeous completion of the research and use of its results to supplement the project design and process. A case in point is the KCM monitoring and evaluation system. This was not clearly embedded to enable the systematic capturing of key elements at output, outcome and impact levels, especially considering the magnitude of this project. Although omitted at inception for reas ons explained above, at some point during the project cycle this anomaly ought to have been remedied. The omission of this element had adverse ramifications for the holistic evaluation of the project. For instance, a lot of good work is reflected as havin g been done under the project and yet this work and achievements were more un -intended. F or example, most of the individual legal cases taken up in Nigeria while innovative ways of addressing SGBV, these cases are not clearly to conflict or post -conflict s ettings42. They also do not further the case of assessment of social, economic and political cost of SGBV in conflict and post conflict settings. We retained them as indicative of results because they helped address gaps in the law relating to SGBV crimes i n Nigeria. The enactment of the law on violence against persons -in our view, offers a basis for addressing SGBV during and post conflict. The KCM project has a hybrid character as a capacity development and advocacy platform. Three sets of evaluations are important when dealing with an advocacy or capacity development process. First, there is evaluation of the profile or biography of participants before (i.e. level of knowledge and expected learning outcomes); evaluation of the content or ideological orien tation of the training or interventions (i.e. responsiveness to identified needs) and evaluation after (i.e. ability and effectiveness post -training, advocacy or intervention to operate the knowledge/skill acquired). When doing this, it is also important t o evaluate whether the process of content development is sufficiently participatory to ensure effective participation, constant review and reflection as well as documentation of lessons learnt. This three -tier evaluation requires a systematic monitoring an d evaluation system and rigorous documentation. Though some documentation was available at both the regional and national levels ,it remained inadequate to explain the disparities between the work actually undertaken at the country level and the stated ob jectives of the project. This gap in both information and institutional memory left us no choice but to conclude that both the there was neither The evaluation team was provided with documentation on project implementation at both regional and national levels. The overall finding was that though sufficient to describe the work undertaken at country level, it did not 42 UHAI Investments, Nigeria field evaluation, April 2017 40 adequately frame the rationale for shifts in approach outlined in the stated project objectives43. This report observed a need for more consist ent and systematic application of a monitoring and evaluation system that ensured the closer use of the main project document and template. In addition greater oversight could have been provided to ensure rigorous process documentation of how delays in fin alization of research were mitigated in the actual project implementation. Such documentation would have further clarified the process of onboarding the two Oxfam country offices and specific accommodations made between existing work and new work envisaged under KcM or at least the unique approach implied by the KcM project. There are many expert institutions and multilateral agencies that work both on the selected countries and specifically on conflict and women's rights or conflict and sexual crimes. The researchers selected - albeit through a bidding process - did not seem to possess sufficient capacity to handle these specific areas and their various nuances. They were exceptional in general socio -economic and political analysis, but not the SGBV - confli ct related nexus. Oxfam may wish in future to headhunt different individual researchers and constitute a team that possess the various required area expertise under the leadership of one senior researcher. Oxfam may also wish to consider holding a thorough methodology workshop to standardize pre -research quality and assumptions. 4.6 Baselines and learning outcomes Oxfam did not -prior to the development of the KCM project - conduct any prior learning needs assessment or map the expected learning outcomes for w ould be beneficiaries. Further, the project document is silent on the need to engage traditional and faith leaders and governance systems. In the actual implementation in South Sudan and Nigeria, the engagement with faith and traditional leaders became ine vitable. This process is documented as an activity and not necessarily a learning process that could assist to measure the project's contribution. As intimated above, the KcM project was not subsequently adjusted to reflect this targeting of informal power networks that have the potential to reinforce or undermine patriarchy. The evaluation team has recorded the country level engagement with these forms of power as an output and was unable to account for it as an outcome as it was never identified as an ind icator. There is no clear indication in any of the documents whether Oxfam did utilize pre -existing knowledge from its other practices. In other words, the project document does not explicitly offer any insights as to the nature of gender -justice work Oxf am was doing in the two project countries before commencement of the KcM project. It is not clear whether the KcM project was the first Oxfam SGBV -related intervention in South Sudan or it merely built on existing work? This is a pertinent factor when it comes to attribution and contribution of the KcM project specifically. We have noted from previous Oxfam publications that there was SGBV -related work being done by Oxfam in Nigeria prior to KcM. The report on the socio -economic and political cost of SGBV in conflict was initially completed and launched in November 2016, but later recanted due to its sensitivities and the revised version was completed in January 2017. It is yet to be shared with the African Union (AU). The suggestions by Oxfam staff that th e regional report would be subjected to piecemeal validation did not accord with the project document. There is also no documented agreement with any of the partners indicating the change of validation timelines and processes. Even more poignantly, the cou ntry reports were meant to inform the regional report and vice -versa. The different challenges relating to some of the country reports as well as the regional report itself, suggests that the current 43 KcM Project Document 41 version of this report which was central to the programm e's conception is a significantly diluted version intended to placate specific country sensitivities due to unforeseen security concerns that emerged during the time the report was launched, posing a threat to staff and partners who had provided informatio n on the report. As intimated above, the very nature of the subject under research necessitated a robust risk matrix and management and mitigation system that the project lacked. We noted that OI specific standards for managing risk may have been employed and this would suffice provided that it should have been captured in the progress reports and inserted in mid -term project review. The evaluation team noted that during the time there was conflict in Burundi, resurgence of conflict in South Sudan and an a ttack at Oxfam South Sudan office that led to staff being pulled out due to insecurities. In any event, post -facto watering down on an empirical research as an approach effectively defeats the purpose of advocacy as well as project evaluation and reflectio n, which is to improve forthcoming projects. More importantly, this emphasizes possible shortcomings in the design of the KCM project and in particular the disconnect between the empirical research and the actual project that was implemented. There were se veral unique opportunities such as the new gender project in the AU Chairperson's office as well as a newly appointed Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security that the KcM project does not appear to have prioritized or deliberately targeted. Here the eva luation found that the project missed the unique advocacy opportunity as well as the opportunity to render technical capacity to these new initiatives directly related to the core project objective. Evidence gathered during this evaluation suggests that th ere were no formal engagements held between Oxfam AU Liaison Office and Equality Now, with the AU Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security. The evaluation established that the planned engagements with AU -PSC were cancelled, and the regional component of the KcM project faced significant challenges in launching the regional report as anticipated under result area 3 of the KcM project. 42 This section of the report aims to document lessons -learned over the duration of the KCM p roject; identify strengths and gaps; and suggest modalities that will allow for improvements in the project implementation. 5.1 Policy and Legislative Under Result Area 1 , a significant gap lay in the research design and failure to build in robust and broad risk mitigation measures. The extent to which the project and research design factored in the difficulty of undertaking research in conflict settings or closed societies, was not sufficiently taken into account. Future project and research design will need t o rely on a baseline study that clearly signposts the direction and nature of research as well as indicates the various types of expertise that should make up research teams. It may also be necessary going forward to build in resources for securing local r esearchers as opposed to relying on external researchers who may not have the requisite contextual knowledge. For Result Area 2 there are many lessons that Nigeria and South Sudan learnt and/or could benefit from each other under the KCM project. For inst ance, a policy such as Resolution 1325 - whilst used and implemented differently in the various country contexts - is an example of global policies or instruments that can be endorsed to encourage women's skilling, participation and leadership across the b orders. Institutions such as the African Union Commission are well placed to fulfill such a role. Therefore, as far as raising awareness and exchange of ideas around policy and legislation, KCM remains a useful tool towards getting these conversations goin g. In Nigeria , the Gender and Equal Opportunities Act that was passed by the Plateau State House of Assembly in 2015, however it is yet to be in the gazette and the implementation guideline is also yet to be designed. This needs to be remedied so that the law can begin to take effect. In South Sudan, the Maputo Protocol has not yet been ratified. CSOs continue to convene and to lobby the government to endorse this specific legislation. It was highlighted that the importance or the addition of the Maputo pro tocol to the country's list of policy and legislative documents will expand the gender debate; as it is policy that endorses and brings issues of 'abortion' into the discussion. CSOs foresaw this topic as the next necessary issue to address and raise aware ness to - as a continu tion of their SGBV advocacy. Result Area 3 recorded the least results; in future it will be necessary to undertake a stakeholder and terrain mapping that assists implementing partners to identify the range and appropriate types of pol icy actors and issues to engage on the nature of research. The absence of a final research report notwithstanding, an area of contention between SOAWR and Oxfam was the inability of SOAWR/ Equality Now to forge ahead with certain advocacy activities. A sta keholder and terrain/context mapping could have enabled this . 43 5.2 Administrative issues Under Result Area 2 in the context of South Sudan, regarding the continental nature of the KCM project, it was suggested that better collaborations ought to have been en couraged between the various Oxfam offices. This reflects on the fact that Oxfam is run by several offices found at local, national, regional and international level. This created communication challenges, with impact on the implementation of the programme s. Under Result Area 3 experienced the greatest effect of administrative challenges. As outlined in the findings and analysis section, several areas would need to be attended to in the future. These include but are not limited to: (i) Establishing clear and c onsistent communication channels between implementing partners; (ii) Setting up a conflict mitigation mechanism/ process that can be activated in the event of partners struggling to find consensus; (iii) Facilitating pathways for negotiating changes and ad justments to project activities ; (iv) Clearly defining and outlining roles and responsibili ties, and in the case of both Oxfam and SOAWR/ Equality Now, specifying their capacity within the project - given the issues relating to membership and representation of SOAWR; (v) Ensu ring inclusion of prospective project partners from project design and proposal stage; (vi) Providing space and time for all project implementers to meet and build synergies from the inception of the project; (vii) Facilitate a system or process for all partners to g ive feedback . 5.3 Project Continuity Difficulties The significantly delayed completion of the research component of the project, Result Area 1 had an impact on the delivery of Result Area 3. Going forward Oxfam must consider adopting one of two approaches, n amely: (i) Design a separate, stand -alone research project that will then inform an implementation project with the advocacy components; or (ii) Design a project that stretches over a longer period in order to allow sufficient time to recalibrate and revise time l ines. For Result Area 2 , it is important to assert that, among many factors, South Sudan continues to experience insecurity and instability . Such security challenges negatively affect developmental and human rights work and it will take some time for any SGBV project to take root. Another challenge to the K cM project identified at the continental, regional, national as well as at the community level is that the project has seemingly changed hands as a result of staff turnovers. These staff turnovers pose a challenge in the life of the K cM project (or any project) in terms of communicating and following through with unison of goal and vision. The continuity of the project is compromised as the people that brought it to its completion, are not necessarily the same people who started it. Several sentiments, stated anonymously, noted that while the K cM inception programme involving Nigeria was a noble feat, it seemed out of context with South Sudan. Issues raised drew attention to possible inaccessibility; incom parability and the difficulties to establish rapport in tandem with the South Sudanese social, economic and political experiences. In the context of Nigeria , the change of national and provincial governments, especially to a different political party was a concern as most of the project stakeholders driving the politically will are no longer in office, starting from the State House of Assembly members, to the Commissioner of Gender and Women Affairs. This change in political leadership is gradually waning d own the political drive of the project. Furthermore, at the local level, there 44 have also been changes with the core members of the programme gradually moving on to other engagement and new members seem not to have a good grasp of the project and expectatio ns. Furthermore, drug abuse was deemed a problem as it is on the rise especially among youth in the Plateau, this may have an indirect influence on SGBV. Unfortunately, the project did not cover that. Therefore, all stakeholders should begin to consider addressing the issue. 5.4 The Concept of Rape Where there are a myriad of social ills that can fall under the SGBV bracket, sadly the understanding of GBV and SGBV amongst the communities represented here has been whittled down to rape (i.e. forced sexual encoun ters). Whilst rape is a serious and an important issue - unworthy of prominence, it is not the only form of SGBV violation. Thus, an emphasis on rape, to the neglect of other SGBV related issues, such as women's health and reproductive rights may contribut e to a narrow view of SGBV issues. It was stated by participants that security personnel tend to be the majority offenders of rape in the communities, but that it is hard to report security personnel because one can become a target themselves, and be kille d. 45 6.1 Baselines are important A baseline study should be carried out. It will enable OXFAM to revisit and strengthen its theory of change, its project implementation methodologies, communication, advocacy strategy, partnership model and fina ncing architecture. Using the baseline study, OXFAM should develop a revised project with more streamlined focus and appropriately linked outputs and outcomes. OXFAM should prioritize conducting baselines and end lines in order to be able to demonstrate im pact; prior to approving a project, theory of change and results chain must be clarified; depth and breadth of proposal must be analyzed, especially if its single donor support. 6.2 Stakeholder Mapping In future it will be necessary to undertake a stakeholder mapping that assists implementing partners to identify the range and appropriate types of policy actors to engage on the nature of research. 6.3 Provide Economic Opportunities as a Means of Reducing Vulnerability Although a great deal has been achieved by the project, one area that appears to not have been adequately addressed is the issue of providing entrepreneurship skills or support to victims of SGBV. For some of the stakeholders, it is an important part of the project that has been missing. The K cM projec t should assist victims of SGBV who have no means of livelihood with some entrepreneurship training and financial support to enable them to start up. This will go a long way in reducing their vulnerability. 6.4 Prosecution of People in the Security Cluster In both Nigeria and South Sudan, the next phase of the project should ensure that mechanisms are in place for security personnel to documentviolations particularly perpetrated by security personnel . 6.5 Support for Capacity Building There is a consistent need f or capacity building in the field of SGBV and conflict. However these responses require a holistic approach that is inclusive of multiple stakeholders. The KCM project was beneficial to CSOs but the SGBV discourse needs collaboration across a wider pool of social service providers, so that there is unison in understanding and response - going forward. 6.6 Need for a Coordinated Work Approach There are currently many actors or stakeholders with a vested interest in SGBV in both Sudan and Nigeria - at local, natio nal and international levels. There is therefore need for a coordinated approach from organizations working in the same localities. A coordinated approach has the benefit of reducing costs and time, and eliminates duplication. 6.7 Support for Psycho -social Co unselling Consider further development, support and provision of mechanism s and processes that provide sustainable psychosocial counseling for victims of SGBV. Provision of psychosocial counseling should be considered as priority and part of the Ministry of Gender and Women Affairs core outputs. 6.8 Need for a K cM Programme Extension The K cM project needs to be expand ed beyond its current scope and geographical areas in both Nigeria and South Sudan. In Nigeria, there is need to clarify the identification of co nflict as opposed to non -conflict areas and 46 be clear about the definition of SGBV in conflict and the use of the term Conflict related Sexual Violence (CRSV). This would assist to select geogrpahical areas for project focus and implementation. In South Sud an, the KCM project should be rolled out in as many parts of Juba as possible , before expanding to the rest of the country , paying particular attention to developing strategies for reaching the often inaccessible areas . As a way forward, a motivation for t he continuance of such a project would be so that it can be rolled out in other geographical locations. 47 Through the ensuring accountability for SGBV and increased participation of women in Africa project , Oxfam endeavored to address the conseq uences of sexual and gender based violence on women arising out of conflict. It also sought t o maximize impact and leverage on existing structures of peace and security at the African Union level. The evaluation team concludes that this is a noble objectiv e and that the critical lessons learnt from implementation over the last three (3) years should be used to shape a more focused project with fewer priorities and a more manageable ambition. The KcM project intended to establish clear linkages and synergie s between UNSCR 1325 , 1888, 1889 and 1820 and existing African Union normative frameworks such as the AU -Protocol on African Women's Rights 2003, the Maputo Protocol . These instruments call on governments to take practical measures to promote and protect t he human rights of women and girls in - amongst others - their constitutions, laws, electoral systems , development programmes, public policies and the judiciary . These normative frameworks seek to strengthen the direct agency and effective participation of women and girls in all aspects of governance and development in society. The UNSCRs recognize the importance of leadership commitment and will as well as gender -sensitive and responsive policies and institutions especially in post conflict reconstruction . They underscore the important role of women in peace building and gender dimensions of peace processes , conflict prevention, conflict resolution and post conflict reconstruction and development . The agenda of the UN SCRs and the Maputo protocol is very br oad. A project such as the KcM project inevitably has to isolate and tackle small pieces in order to score SMART victories. Through its partnership with the SOAWR women's rights coalition , Oxfam country offices and local partners in Nigeria and South Sudan , Oxfam's Pan Africa Programme sought to implement interventions designed to increas e state accountability for conflict related sexual and gender based violence. It specifically wanted this process to be guided by empirical evidence of the social, economic and political cost of SGBV against women and girls in conflict and poct -conflict situations. This evaluation has soug ht to determine whether planned , sub -intended and unintended results were achieved at the different levels of the KcM project implementat ion as well as across the different result areas of the project. The evaluation team conducted field visits to Nigeria and South Sudan. The evaluation looked at the project achievements/impacts in terms of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and its susta inability. This also included the identification of best practices that emerged as the project was being implemented, and project challenges . These constituted the lessons learnt and also a critical part of the recommendations . As intimated in the introdu ction to this report , though evaluative standards required us to use the project objectives and expected results as guideline s, we made accomodations where the results observed or achieved generally contributed to addressing SGBV . Using a mix of focus grou p discussions, desk research and in -depth interview methods, the evaluation used the OECD framework approach to determine the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability of the KcM project . We con cluded that the numerous design , manage ment and implementation challenges notwithstanding, the KcM project is relevant and potentially sustainable. We have in the preceding sections of this report made specific recommendations intended to ensure that the project is more effective , efficient and impactful. The overall finding is that, in the South Sudan case for example, by supporting women to participate in decision making on conflict prevention, resolution and management, the project resulted in the development of policy 48 guidelines at national and local levels that to some extent ensured that women contribute to all future decisions on conflict. In Nigeria, several cases of SGBV were managed/resolved at community level by traditional rulers and other stakeholders with women in participation . The evaluation noted that on average between 4 to 5 cases (minor cases) are handled at the community level per month. As a result of the intervention of th e KcM project, relevant structures ha ve been established in the various communities (women peace sister s, men and women mentors ha ve been trained to mentor younger girls on prevention and reporting SGBV cases). There has also been active participation in and growing ownership of the project by community and religious leaders in the project communities. We noted that going forward , the KcM project may need to invest further in and strengthen the collaboration between alternative justice systems ( e.g. traditional and faith based systems) and the formal justice system which is more atuned to the structures and processes of UNSCRs. We also noted that there is need for programmes specifically targeting traditional and faith leaders to train them as para -legals or effective community interlocutors who have the full understanding of implications and import of UNSCR 1325 and the Maputo Protocol. Documentation and systematization of emerging best practices on making change happen would also be a key area that a new KcM project may need to focus on. Overall the results at the country level are significant and they may offer lessons on how best to structure the regional level work as well as develop a platform for shared learning within the KcM project framework. The commendable achievements at the country level notwit hstanding , the KcM project encountered a myriad of challenges and gaps that need to be addressed going forward. There are also conceptual issues that need to be settled, including the concept of rape. Some respondents argued that an emphasis on rape, to the neglect of other SGBV related issues, such as wome n's health and reproductive rights may contribute to a narrow view of SGBV issues. I n both South Sudan and Nigeria, respondents indicated that security personnel tend to be the majority offenders in most rape cases reported at the communit y level. Given th e information and power asymmetries between poor women and girls and security personnel, many cases go unreported for fear that complainants risk becom ing targets of fresh attacks by colluding security forces, and at times they may even be killed. Empowerm ent of women in communities to report SGBV and also demand justice comes with real risks and these need to be factored into the next phase project design. The project did not have a comprehensive policy for protecting targeting project beneficiaries and im plementors or activists. Ideally this should be a priority in the next phase of the KcM project. In addition, the lack of a pre- project inception baseline was detrimental for a number of reasons : first because the existence of robust work on SGBV and con flict at the AU level was not sufficiently capture d and the critical linkage with the office of the AU chairperson which had established a UN funded gender project and also was in the process of appointing a Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security in 20 14 was not adequately followed through despite the strong positioning of KcM through its country -level work ; second, the Heads of State level processes relating to UNSCR 1325 were not sufficiently structured into the project design. For instance, Nigeria already had a National Action Plan and significant p rogrammes on UNSCR 1325. Although the project achieved a lot at the country level; its regional potential was hampered both by design -related issues as well as communication, relationship/partnership mana gement and communication ; third , there was no project management committee to address conflict or misunderstanding between Oxfam and the other KCM project partners . Though conceptual ized as a partnership of equals , in practice the project seemed to have manifested some sporadic negative actual or perceived power dynamics . In conclusion , therefore , although a number of planned results were not achieved, partly because the ambition of the K cM project was too broad for a three -year programme and also the prac tical challenges that arose relating to the research, the project did lay th e ground for more pointed SGBV -conflict linked interventions. The country 49 experiences provide a significant amount of baseline material for conceptualizing regional work . The proje ct implementation monitoring and evaluation proce ss and system has a lot to learn from the practical challenges encountered in this first phase of the KcM project, not least the state responses and the internal vulnerabilities of different Oxfam country pr ogrammes. The relationship and conflict management mechanisms within the KcM project need to be strengthened to allow for impartial mediation either by senior Oxfam staff or mutually acceptable neutral third parties. Creating relevant knowledge management and communication platforms for the KcM project is key to broadening its recognition and ownership beyond specific communities. Online presence of both cases and knowledge products would be an effective process of mobilizing interest and support. Equally so, the creation of databases of experts that are regularly updated and based on both geography, theme and sub -themes would be important. Oxfam may wish to refer to existing expert ro sters that organizations working on SGBV -Conflict nexus already have. Although a draft data base was developed , this could potentally be enriched and strengthened by a more in-depth partnership with organizations and universities already working in this field. The KcM project has created spaces where GBV and SGBV policies are a set of tools which when domesticated, and used in the right context can change 'bad cultures' and dominant ways of thinking. Patriarchy, inequitable distribution of power, resources and opportunities as well as p revailing cultural norms and attitudes , particularly outside urban areas , have negated women's inclusion in decision making, their political participation and leadership generally. Common SGBV issues highlighted by respondents in both Nigeria and South Sudan included: domestic violence incidents b etween spouses (largely emanating from economic pressures); rape; early child or slave marriages; health challenges and a lack of access to health related services, as well as theft or pickpocketing, which all unfortunately make women and children the most vulnerable populations. The spectrum of SGBV is wide ranging from petty to heinous violations. It is noted that the sheer existence of policies and even an awareness of them alone - does not mean that the policies will necessarily bring about the require d change. This is because policies are often in the written text, and are not always meaningfully domesticated, applied or accessible to citizenry. However, Civil Society Organization's (CSOs) reasserted that the agenda for now is more concentrated on seei ng these policies being ratified. Their existence will enable CSOs and other stakeholders to hold the state to account on matters related to SGBV. On an output level , policies are a n indicator or success. However , at the outcome level and considering that in Nigeria we are dealing with violent extremists ( Boko Haram) and in South Sudan (armed insurgents and government soldiers) , the application of normal rules and regulations seems rather utopian given contexts in the two countries. This should not diminis h the importance of having effective policies, institutional mechanisms and an effective coalition to combat SGBV pre, during and post conflict. 50 1.
