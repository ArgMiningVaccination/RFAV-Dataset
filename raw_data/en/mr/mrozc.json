Integrative medicine is supported by evidence and aims to heal the whole person, including all aspects of one's lifestyle. Therapies offered by integrative medicine often empower patients and families, allowing for a sense of control. This review addresses the merging of integrative medicine philosophy and modalities with the care given to children with life-limiting illness. We review an introduction to integrative medicine, trends in its incorporation in the healthcare setting, application to patients receiving palliative care and the management of specific symptoms. A case study is offered to illustrate these principles.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-06-13", "cleaned_text": "current definitions of integrative medicine center around a goal of healing, the patient's lifestyle, environment, history, and a patient-provider partnership which considers lifestyle, allopathic diagnosis and treatment, environmental factors, emotional/spiritual factors and the role of other healing systems when caring for the patient. The University of Arizona's Center for Integrative Medicine, USA, a leader in training and research around integrative medicine for several decades, defines integrative medicine as: \"healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person, including all aspects of lifestyle. It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship between practitioner and patient, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapies\" [ [2](#B2-children-05-00075)]. 2. Integrative Medicine Trends in US Healthcare [1](#B1-children-05-00075)]. This model has come at a great cost financially, and, in many cases, led to disempowerment of patients, a fragmented healthcare system, and patient dependence on healthcare providers for treatment and management of disease. Chronic diseases, due to their multi-organ pathophysiology and high correlation with lifestyle, are often not adequately addressed using a reductionist model. Additionally, the locus of control in an allopathic model is frequently external to the patient, being the healthcare provider and their prescribed treatment. A study examining the health locus of control for youths with chronic illnesses found that those with an external locus of control had poorer health outcomes than those with an internal locus of control [ [3](#B3-children-05-00075)]. Integrative medicine seeks to leverage a combination between the internal and external, which in turn shifts the locus of control to include a patient's own capacity to influence their health or disease in addition to the provider. [4](#B4-children-05-00075)]; additionally, a myriad of conferences in integrative medicine [ [5](#B5-children-05-00075)], restorative medicine [ [6](#B6-children-05-00075)], lifestyle medicine [ [7](#B7-children-05-00075)], mind-body medicine [ [8](#B8-children-05-00075)] and nutrition [ [9](#B9-children-05-00075)] are offering continuing medical education for clinicians. The internet and social media are making consumers/patients more aware of options in addition to medications and surgeries often offered by traditional allopathic healthcare delivery systems. [10](#B10-children-05-00075)]. [11](#B11-children-05-00075)]. Out of almost 6000 hospitals receiving the 42-question survey, 714 responded (12%), and 299 of respondents (42%) offered one or more complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. There was significant regional variation, with the largest number of respondents offering CAM being in the East-North-Central region (23%; Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin) and the fewest being in the East-South-Central region (3%; Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee). Almost half of the respondent institutions offering CAM were academic medical centers, or teaching hospitals, and 72% were urban. The most commonly offered inpatient CAM therapies included pet therapy, massage therapy, music therapy, guided imagery and relaxation training, and Reiki or therapeutic touch. Outpatient modalities were most commonly massage therapy, acupuncture, guided imagery, meditation, relaxation and biofeedback [ [12](#B12-children-05-00075)]. [13](#B13-children-05-00075), [14](#B14-children-05-00075)]. Medical education at all levels remains limited in training physicians with integrative medicine tools and non-pharmacologic alternatives to symptom management or disease treatment and modification. There are, however, increasing efforts among some medical schools to incorporate lifestyle medicine curricula [ [15](#B15-children-05-00075)], an integrative medicine elective, or some exposure to CAM therapies in their curriculum. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, 43% of medical schools offered CAM in their curricula as of 2010. In addition, a survey of University of California medical students' perceptions about CAM, 75% felt that \"western medicine would benefit from incorporation of CAM therapies and ideas\" [ [11](#B11-children-05-00075)]. At the Graduate Medical Education level, programs such as Integrative Medicine in Residency (IMR), an online curriculum, is now utilized in 63 residency programs nationally and internationally at the time of this writing [ [16](#B16-children-05-00075)]. In 2014 the American Board of Physician Specialties began offering a national integrative medicine board exam, for physicians who have completed a two-year fellowship in integrative medicine [ [17](#B17-children-05-00075)], adding further recognition and standardization to the field of integrative medicine. [18](#B18-children-05-00075)], with females (38%) being affected more than males (26%). Although this does not separate adolescents with comorbidities, it is well known that this population group often suffers from anxiety at higher rates [ [19](#B19-children-05-00075), [20](#B20-children-05-00075)]. [21](#B21-children-05-00075)], depression [ [22](#B22-children-05-00075), [23](#B23-children-05-00075)], pain, obesity, diabetes [ [24](#B24-children-05-00075)], autoimmune diseases, and the list goes on. Additionally, a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as trauma, neglect or abuse predisposes one to an increased risk of developing anxiety over their lifetime [ [25](#B25-children-05-00075)]. Social media use, sleep deprivation and social isolation have all been associated with higher rates of anxiety [ [26](#B26-children-05-00075)]. Genetics, diet [ [27](#B27-children-05-00075), [28](#B28-children-05-00075)], family history and environmental exposures also have significant bearing on an individual's mental health. Given the numerous etiological influences, and individual variation in life experiences and exposures, it is not reasonable to expect that a single drug or treatment would be adequate for such a multidimensional condition. [29](#B29-children-05-00075)]; hypnosis and [32](#B32-children-05-00075)], yoga [ [33](#B33-children-05-00075)]. Despite the evidence-supported efficacy and cost-savings, providers are not routinely trained in these treatments over a pharmaceutical approach. Integrative medicine interventions carry a low risk of harm, making them an attractive adjunct or when appropriate, alternative to pharmaceuticals, which are not without adverse risks. An additional benefit of integrative therapies is the active participation required by the patient in the regulation of their own nervous system or mind when addressing problems, allowing the patient to feel in control. These approaches are highly empowering and without significant cost once the technique has been adequately taught to the patient and family to employ when desired. Integrative medicine combines all appropriate therapies using an evidence-based approach with consideration to safety, tolerability and efficacy. Studies have shown that combining mind-body techniques with pharmacologic interventions can reduce distress. For example, pediatric leukemia patients undergoing painful procedures in a study comparing a combined intervention (CI) with pharmacologic only (PO) demonstrated significant reduction in distress associated with the procedure in the CI arm, compared to the PO group [ [34](#B34-children-05-00075)]. 3. Overview of Integrative Medicine Modalities 3.1. Acupuncture/Acupressure [35](#B35-children-05-00075), [36](#B36-children-05-00075)]. Acupressure uses firm, steady pressure at these same points. Depending on the location of the acupressure points, and the indications, patients are sometimes able to perform this on themselves. Shonishin is another needleless acupuncture technique that uses pressure and massage along the meridians to influence the flow of energy. 3.2. Relaxation Techniques and Stress-Physiology Regulation [37](#B37-children-05-00075), [38](#B38-children-05-00075), [39](#B39-children-05-00075), [40](#B40-children-05-00075)]. The activation of the parasympathetic nervous system in what has been termed the \"relaxation response\", as described above, counters the often overactive sympathetic nervous system stress response, triggered by numerous stimuli that occurs during illness, pain and threatening circumstances. The ability for a person to regulate the stress response and elicit the relaxation response is empowering, and often shifts the locus of control for patients during illness, anxiety, pain and especially at the end-of-life. The use of these physiologic principles in healthcare settings includes modalities such as breathing practices, guided imagery, self-hypnosis and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). All of these practices have the potential to elicit the relaxation response and can be tailored to individual preferences, functional limitations, age, experiences and culture [ [41](#B41-children-05-00075)]. 3.3. Essential Oils [42](#B42-children-05-00075)]. 3.4. Botanicals and Supplements 3.5. Reiki 4. Integrative Medicine for Distressing Symptoms in Critical Illness and Palliative Care 4.1. Nausea and Vomiting [43](#B43-children-05-00075), [44](#B44-children-05-00075), [45](#B45-children-05-00075)]. In a systematic review of randomized control trials studying the efficacy of ginger for post-operative nausea and vomiting, Ernst et al. concluded that ginger was superior to placebo and demonstrated equal effectiveness compared to metoclopramide [ [46](#B46-children-05-00075)]. There are few trials related to chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, a common problem plaguing many pediatric palliative care patients with cancer. Although the availability of literature yields mixed results, some studies have shown statistically significant benefit. One of the largest randomized control trials to date involved 576 patients undergoing chemotherapy cycles demonstrated a significant decrease in nausea when using ginger compared with placebo [ [47](#B47-children-05-00075)]. [48](#B48-children-05-00075)]. Studies have demonstrated many significant benefits for a myriad of systems, with the strongest evidence demonstrated in the post-operative period. For example, a 2015 systematic review of randomized trials utilizing wrist acupuncture for postoperative nausea and vomiting in both children and adults found a significant reduction in symptoms and need for rescue antiemetics compared to sham treatment [ [49](#B49-children-05-00075)]. Studies involving exclusively pediatric patients remain limited, although a meta-analysis of clinical studies investigating acupuncture for postoperative nausea/vomiting in children following tonsillectomy further supported these findings [ [50](#B50-children-05-00075)]. Of note, acupuncture has proven to be well tolerated and safe in the pediatric population. One systematic review involving over 140 randomized clinical trials and 12,000 pediatric patients found acupuncture to be safe for when performed by trained practitioners, with over 90% of adverse events being mild [ [51](#B51-children-05-00075)]. [52](#B52-children-05-00075)]. Other products, such as ginger oil, have also been utilized in aromatherapy application, with the most updated Cochrane review concluding that participants who received aromatherapy may require less antiemetic medications, although the strength of this evidence was lacking [ [52](#B52-children-05-00075)]. It is important to state that direct application of peppermint oil, specifically products diluted with methanol, to the nares or chest of infants is not recommended due to the documented risk of apnea, laryngeal and bronchial spasms, and acute respiratory distress [ [53](#B53-children-05-00075), [54](#B54-children-05-00075)]. 4.2. Pain [55](#B55-children-05-00075)]. Integrative modalities can be an effective adjunct to traditional pharmacologic approaches to pain. [56](#B56-children-05-00075)]. Studies involving pediatric patients remain limited, but the same principles can be extended to this population with adjustments for age and developmental capabilities. [57](#B57-children-05-00075)]. A majority of research specific to the field of hospice and palliative medicine focuses on cancer patients, with many positive results shown with the use of acupuncture not only in pain relief, but also decreased use of traditional analgesics [ [58](#B58-children-05-00075), [59](#B59-children-05-00075), [60](#B60-children-05-00075)]. For example, one case series of 29 cancer patients at the end-of-life with severe pain demonstrated significant relief and discontinuation of injection analgesics (i.e., morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl) in 62% of patients, and decreased use in an additional 27% [ [61](#B61-children-05-00075)]. [62](#B62-children-05-00075)]. Specific to the pediatric population, one study demonstrated a 40% reduction of acetaminophen usage in children recovering from tonsillectomy who were treated with lavender aromatherapy [ [63](#B63-children-05-00075)]. Although there are no known studies in the pediatric palliative population, given proven benefits in other population groups, further research of the use of aromatherapy should be pursued. 4.3. Neuropathic Pain [64](#B64-children-05-00075)]. Several studies have demonstrated symptom relief in comparison to placebo with the use of topical capsaicin, including Mason et al.'s review of randomized, controlled trials examining the use of capsaicin for chronic neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain in adults [ [65](#B65-children-05-00075)]. In addition, a recent Cochrane review examined the use of high concentration capsaicin (8% capsaicin patch) for treatment of neuropathic pain, finding moderate to substantial pain relief in patients with several types of neuropathic pain. Additional improvements in sleep, fatigue, depression, and quality of life were also demonstrated. The most common adverse effect to be noted is initial burning at the application site, which decreases with continued use [ [66](#B66-children-05-00075)]. 4.4. Stress Response Regulation, Depression, Anxiety and Insomnia [67](#B67-children-05-00075)]. Furthermore, mindfulness meditation has been demonstrated to provide significant improvements in overall mood and well-being, including stress-reduction, anxiety reduction, alleviating depression, and improved sleep cycles [ [68](#B68-children-05-00075)]. Specific to pediatrics, one study of 13 adolescents suffering from cancer underwent eight weekly meditation sessions (8 of the 13 enrolled). After completion of the course, investigators analyzed differences in overall mood, depression, sleep, and quality-of-life compared to pre-trial participant responses via questionnaire. Those in the treatment group compared to the control group showed a significant improvement in all areas [ [69](#B69-children-05-00075)]. [70](#B70-children-05-00075)]. 4.5. Dyspnea [73](#B73-children-05-00075)]. Complementary methods and therapies can provide significant relief as an adjunct therapy. For example, Acupuncture and acupressure have proven beneficial in the chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma patient populations. Jobst et al. conducted a single-blind randomized control trial of 24 COPD patients with disabling shortness of breath who underwent 13 sessions of acupuncture over a three-week period compared to sham acupuncture. Patients in the treatment group reported less subjective breathlessness [ [74](#B74-children-05-00075)]. Although studies remain limited, and more research is needed in the pediatric population, these benefits could be extended to the palliative care population in pediatrics as well. 5.
