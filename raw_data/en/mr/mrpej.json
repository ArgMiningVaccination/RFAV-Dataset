There is growing recognition that solving the obesity epidemic and its downstream health consequences depends on preventative efforts at the individual, community, and public health level. Physicians are part of the frontline of advising patients on nutrition; however, health care professionals report feeling ill-prepared to counsel patients on nutrition, and patients often lack the basic skills and confidence in making changes to their and their families' diet. Significant gaps in nutrition content exist across the medical education continuum, from new learners to practicing physicians. An emerging approach to enhance mastery of practical nutrition content is that of culinary medicine provided in the context of a teaching kitchen. Preliminary research suggests culinary medicine is an innovative active learning approach that may be an effective pedagogical option that is gaining traction in academic health institutions. At this month's Integrative Medicine Grand Rounds, Dr. Melinda Ring, Executive Director of the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Northwestern University, discussed her experience with culinary medicine education for health professionals.
