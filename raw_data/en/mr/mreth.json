Traditional Chiropractic A conventional chiropractor's goal is to increase range of motion, reduce muscular spasm and relieve or reduce pain. The majority of chiropractors take the traditional approach and do a great job at it. However, this type of care falls under symptom management, otherwise known as \"band-aid\" care. At Foundation Chiropractic, we utilize state-of-the-art equipment to determine the presence of a Foundational Shift of the spine, which is typically the underlying cause of a variety of secondary conditions (symptoms) that you may be experiencing. What Is A Foundational Shift? The objective measurements used at Foundation Chiropractic establish whether or not your spine is within the normal range. What Are Secondary Conditions? When a Foundational Shift is present, it can create secondary conditions, which means they result from the primary condition. What Are My Other Treatment Options? There are a wide variety of treatment options offered by medical and alternative medicine practitioners.
