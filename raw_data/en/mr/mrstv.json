But it's such an important beginning!. It's time to get back to yourself. The Holina Spiritual Healing Treatment is our signature program. Whilst we're well recognised for our work serving people afflicted with addiction or depression, and we've been ground-breaking in our efforts to help people with emotional or behavioural challenges, we are perhaps best known in the field of spiritual healing. Because of our 2 Founders' backgrounds, we've merged two deep and spiritual worlds into one holistic healing environment that serves our residents spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and physically. Our Primary Founder is the Island of Koh Phangan's leading Monk Prow Olam, which means \"Smiling/laughing Monk\" in Thai. His profound Buddhist influence on our centre and all its residents goes a great distance towards creating the space for spiritual rebirth, learning, and understanding, alongside compassion and laughter. Meanwhile, Yossi Zubari is a long-time member of 12 Step Fellowships who has an understanding of Spirituality from a humanistic point of view bringing an even more practical modality for spirituality. In practical terms, this means we've merged the ancient Buddhist philosophies, with the modern-day Spirituality of the 20th and 21st centuries to bring about sincere change in those who seek our Spiritual healing programs. By utilising the best in mindfulness, wellness and spiritual practices that we've had the privilege to appreciate for ourselves and merging them all into a coherent and purpose-led direction over 3 weeks, we lead our residents down a path towards contentment, servitude, personal discovery and sinner soul searching. Incorporating Monk Prow Olam's Inner-Walk Mediation, daily yoga, breathwork, mindfulness meditations, and other wellness-focused activities, we deliver some of the best Thailand offers. Then, but adding Yossi's 12 Step principles and his lessons in spirituality that he's discovered for himself over his lifetime, including an attitude of gratitude, humility and humbleness, service to others and in turn to ourselves, we've created a Spiritual healing program that makes a real difference in your own life, and the lives of those around you too. Our resort has the space for everyone to come and explore their destiny and spiritual needs. By using the landscaped area of our private and discreet resort, on its peninsula against the Gulf of Thailand, with the activities we've designed for you, and a great environment for everyone to co-exist, we have a spiritual healing that serves you, your family, your community, and our global population. Our private beach, swimming pools, gym, sauna, and massage sala, permit us to give you the perfect time and space to return to yourself. We have a wide selection of accommodation options available when you stay at Holina Rehab, Koh Phangan. We believe your environment and the people around you can make a big difference in your treatment and your overall well-being. Please enquire about the pricing structure of 24/7 medically managed detox, supervised by Doctors and nurses, licensed as an inpatient hospital on the contact form below. If the substances you consume, or your behaviour or attitude is getting you into trouble or having a negative impact on your life, The River Rehab may be an important option for you to consider. Not only will we provide you with the tools that you need, but we will also give you access to customized levels of treatment that will enable you to literally reinvent your life. We treat the disease of addiction, which incorporates all substance dependencies, including alcohol, cocaine, crack, morphine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, psychedelics, ecstasy, solvents, and legal (prescribed) medication addictions, as well as other process and behavior addictions such as sex, love, gaming, gambling, internet or technologies, shopping, food, exercise and co-dependency. We believe that addiction is a disease of the mind, from which we can recover, one day at a time. We are a residential rehab experience, with a minimum of one month commitment. People are not permitted to come by and visit or look around unless an appointment has been made. This is to protect the privacy and the space for our residents and to keep them safe. We are not a day care facility or outpatient service. We only serve those people looking for a fully immersive experience. Our minimum commitment is 4 weeks. Even considering that it's possible to overcome an addiction with any long-lasting effect for any shorter period is simply unrealistic, and likely unethical. Whilst our minimum commitment is 4 weeks, many, probably most of our residents stay 6 to 8 weeks and some up to 12 weeks (the full program length). We will discourage this until after week 9. Whilst it may be nice to think that your family are supportive and want to encourage you, it's a huge distraction from treatment for the individual, and our collective observations (in other facilities) are that in over 66% of these visits it leads to disruption, early self-discharge, and often relapse. That said, please know we're a treatment centre driven by your success and we do know that your success is significantly improved when family members are engaged in their loved one's recovery. So if you would like to organise either a zoom call with your family and your primary therapist, or an actual family visit on site, we would encourage this towards the end of your treatment experience. We appreciate that you will be away from your loved ones for fairly long periods of time, and that connection to them is important. Sometimes work or business calls are important to you. We will always find ways to help you facilitate these relationships. We have decided that in today's modern age of technology that it is important that you recover with your smart devices, and not in spite of them. So it is our policy that you keep all your digital devices unless a Digital detox is specifically part of your treatment or your addiction is related to the internet or gaming, or other smart devices. This policy is reviewed on a case by case basis if a resident is observed to be spending too much of their attention on their device rather than the other residents. We are also mindful of people with sex addiction who may be navigating the internet to act out. Meanwhile We have super-fast internet across the resort, and all the bedrooms have Smart TVs running You Tube and Netflix etc. Yes you may. Whilst we'd love to encourage you to quit whilst youre with us, we acknowledge that many people still smoke So you may smoke on the balcony of your room, or in the dedicated smoking sala in the lounge area. Koh Phangan is a warm climate all year round. It is typically in the low to mid 30s*c / low 90s*f during the day, and at night it rarely goes under 23*c / mid 70s*f Sometimes it rains, usually for up to 30 minutes, which serves at cooling down the air. Occasionally it may rain for longer periods (typically in October or November), though this doesn't interfere with treatment particularly. Pack as if you were coming on holiday to a tropical paradise island in Thailand - which, of course you are. Summer style clothing is recommended (light shirts, T-shirts, shorts, comfortable shoes, sneakers, flip flops / sandals, etc, light, breathable clothing and swimwear for the pool and the beaches. Most of us wear underwear, shorts, T-shirts / Tank Tops / Vests, sneakers, sandals & tongs / flip flops. Active wear for workouts and other fitness activities including swimming, sports shoes, and light wear for yoga. We do physical activities almost every day, so bring a few pairs to allow for laundry times. There is no need to dress formal or smart. Everything is relaxed, comfort focused and easy going. We have a safe to keep your valuables in, but expensive jewellery and other luxury items are unnecessary. Toiletries: Please bring your own toiletries and hygiene products, such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, shaving materials, basic makeup, hairbrush, etc. Anything you forget we can purchase from local shops. Medications: You are allowed to continue using your doctor-prescribed medications while in rehab, but please do bring proof of your prescription. Please keep all your pills in the original packaging so that they are not to be unauthorized narcotics. Kindly do not bring the following: Alcohol or drugs: It might seem self-explanatory, but some clients may try to sneak in a last-minute hit, fix, pill, can, bottle, etc. Your bags and belongings will be searched when you arrive at Holina. Alcohol or drug paraphernalia: This includes anything that advertises or glorifies the use of alcohol or drugs. This should also include items that display support for criminal acts including terrorism, sex, gambling, or other negatively perceived notions that could upset other residents. Weapons: There is absolutely no need to bring any knives or weapons with you to Thailand or to treatment. They will be confiscated and destroyed. Toiletries that contain alcohol: Leave any alcohol-based products at home, such as certain mouthwashes, nail polish remover, perfumes, and aerosols. We have 2 main Chef's (supported by 2 other Thai chefs) - a Meat focused one and a Vegan Chef. You can advise us of any of your specific dietary needs and we can manage them. We're used to having people with all types of needs. Nothing unusual there. Our prices are all inclusive and dependent upon the style of room you choose - shared, single occupancy or private plunge pool villa. You can [view our prices here](https://holinarehab.com/rehab-prices/) We don't have any hidden costs, though there are some costs that should be aware of. We pay for any psychiatric assessments and other mental health professional visits. We ask you to pay for anything non detox or mental health related, including your medications. We also ask that you have travel or medical insurance in place before you come to us. This is really for any non-detox or psychiatric related problems, like if you fall over and break your arm, or some other uncalculated trip to accident and emergency. We don't pay for your flights to and from Koh Samui Airport (USM), but we do cover the cost of getting you from the airport to Holina and we will pay for your return to the airport unless you check out against clinical advice. Typically, our clients spend between US$50 and $75 per month on personal items, such as snacks, sodas, cigarettes, some toiletries, etc, but it's not necessary to spend any more. Even gift buying on this island is relatively cheap compared to the rest of the world. At this time, residents of most countries around the world are able to come into Thailand and achieve a visa upon entry. We will advise you on this process. It's very straight forwards. If you extend your treatment and need a longer visa then we will take care of this for you, and in most instances we will pay for all your visa extensions too. Currently, there are no requirements for any vaccines to come into Thailand. This includes COVID vaccines or any other historical vaccines previously required. So please don't worry about this, unless you specifically want to be extra vaccinated. "}
