To describe measures that prevent and manage occupational hazards. To list three ways a Child Care Health Advocate (CCHA) can assist ECE programs in developing and imple- menting sta health and safety policies. To identify sta health and safety resources to assist and support ECE providers and families. RATIONALE CCHAs are responsible for putting policies and procedures into place in ECE programs to promote the health and safety of children and ECE sta . Sta health is an important part of providing a quality experience for chil- dren. ECE sta who are healthy and not stressed are able to provide responsive care to children. Even though many health and safety policies in ECE programs protect children and adults, some health and safety issues speci c to adult sta are often neglected. 2nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesWHY ECE STAFF ARE AT RISK ECE sta face a number of health and safety risks. Th e four common risks covered in this module are infec-tious disease, injuries, environmental risks and stress. For example, the health of ECE sta is at risk due to illnesses common in group settings, such as colds, coughs and diarrhea. ECE providers are also exposed to germs because they change diapers and help young children use the toilet. Th ey have job-speci c injury risks from using furniture intended for children, from lifting and carrying children all day and from using toxic art and cleaning materials. ECE sta experience a great deal of stress and stress-related illnesses. Th ese risks are outlined in Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards: Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs, Second Edition (CFOC) (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], American Public Health Association & National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care, 2002) Appendix B (see Handout: Major Occupational Health Hazards ). Like many others in the helping professions, ECE providers often put their own needs second to those of the people they care for. A natural part of the CCHA's role is to make sure that the adult sta in the ECE program are healthy and safe. WHAT A CCHA NEEDS TO KNOW While many health and safety policies and procedures are required by the various agencies regulating ECE programs, the CCHA must know that the health and safety of the sta is equally important. In the ECE eld, funding is often tight and resources scarce. Often, resources are used on the children and the program rst. Facilities and sta may often be neglected. Many ECE providers are unaware of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations (Cal/OSHA in California) that they must follow as employers, or are struggling to follow the regulations when there are not enough funds. See Handout: Cal/ OSHA: Safety and Health Protection on the Job .Infectious Disease Risks ECE providers get sick more often than adults who have less contact with children (Holmes, Morrow & Pickering, 1996; Reves & Pickering, 1992). Th e increased risk is due to the higher rate of disease in the group they work with (young children) and to the children's greater tendency for sharing germs. Young children often sneeze or cough without covering their mouth and noses. Th ey often wipe their noses with their hands and then touch toys and food, thus spread-ing germs. Most of the diseases of greatest concern in ECE programs are spread through respiratory routes (e.g., breathing, sneezing, coughing, sharing food and drinks). Diseases spread this way include measles, mumps, chicken pox (varicella), fth disease (slapped cheek disease caused by parvovirus B19), impetigo, pinkeye, whooping cough (pertussis), hepatitis A and cytomegalovirus (CMV). When a new sta member joins the ECE program, he or she is more likely to get sick since the new sta person has now come across a new group of germs that the body has not developed protection against. Not all diseases have the same symptoms for children and adults. In some cases, such as hepatitis A, children may be infected but show no symptoms, while ECE sta get very sick. Other diseases, such as Haemophi- lus infl uenzae type B (Hib), may produce no visible symptoms in sta , but more severe symptoms in chil- dren. Some diseases, such as CMV, may produce mild or no symptoms in both children and sta . However, CMV seriously a ects the fetal development in previ- ously uninfected pregnant sta (Adler, 1989). If ECE providers come to work when they are ill, they may spread their germs to children and coworkers. Th us, it is important for the CCHA to make sure the ECE program has a clearly de ned exclusion policy. An exclusion policy outlines when a person should stay home due to illness and when the person can come back to work once the illness is over. Ill ECE sta members are more likely to get other infections that they cannot ght o , as their immune system may be weakened by the original illness. It is impor-tant for sta who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant to let their health care provider know that they are working with young children, because expo-sure to some childhood illnesses (bacterial or viral) during pregnancy can a ect the fetus.Staff Health nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n3State health departments have developed a list that includes infectious diseases that have recommended exclusion periods (i.e., how long the person needs to stay home), what to do when a person has been diagnosed with a particular disease and what diseases must be reported to the local health district. Parents and ECE sta need to be noti ed when cer- tain diseases have been going around in the ECE program. ECE providers should give out current dis-ease fact sheets to families and sta during disease outbreaks or exposure. California Childcare Health Program (CCHP) Disease Fact Sheets provide basic information on diseases, how to prevent the spread, when to seek medical attention and whether the disease a ects pregnancy (see Web site http://www. ucsfchildcarehealth.org). Injury Risks Lifting, carrying and reaching are essential activities when caring for young children. Th e health and safety of sta are a ected not only by how much they lift or carry, but by how, and how many times a day, they lift and carry. ECE providers often have only child-sized furniture to sit and work on. Th ey may need to do some of their work sitting on the fl oor without proper back support. Th ese activities can cause back, neck and other injuries. In 1993, OSHA reported that in the general work- place, three out of four back injuries involved lifting. In a survey of injuries to ECE workers, Brown and Gerberich (1993) found that injuries involving the back accounted for the greatest percentage of total injuries (34.1%). Of that percentage, 49% involved lifting a child. In addition, ECE sta may be at higher risk for falls when reaching for supplies stored in hard-to-reach places or when tripping over toys left on the fl oor. Th ese falls may result in serious injuries. Brown and Gerber-ich (1993) found that falls were the second most commonly reported injury for ECE sta , accounting for 21% of all injuries. Nurturing, responsive care requires that ECE sta communicate with children at the child's eye level. To speak with toddlers, the ECE provider will need to bend and kneel. In addition, an ECE program's family-style meal policy may require ECE providers to sit at a child-sized table with the children. Using child-sized furniture causes adults to sit in awkward positions, which can put stress on the joints of the ankles, knees and hips and may lead to strains and sprains. Lifting children out of cribs may cause back strain if the ECE provider is not taught proper body mechanics (how to use your body correctly). Th e fre- quent lifting required in ECE programs can cause repeat injuries for ECE providers. CCHAs need to be aware of these potential injuries and work to pre-vent them. Environmental Risks: Being Exposed to Toxic Materials ECE providers may be exposed to a variety of toxic materials while at work, including cleaning products, art materials, mold, mildew, lead, asbestos and latex. Cleaning products In ECE programs, ECE sta are required to clean surfaces thoroughly to prevent the spread of germs (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 3.030): \"...countertops, tabletops, fl oors, door knobs, cabinet handles, food preparation and service areas, phone receivers, hand washing sinks and surrounding counters, faucets, soap dispensers, toilet seats, toilet handles, cubicle handles, toilet bowls, mops and cleaning rags, and any surfaces contaminated with body fl uids [should] be sanitized daily and whenever soiled. Utensils, surfaces, and toys that go into the mouth or have been in contact with saliva or other body fl uids, changing tables, and potty chairs should be sanitized after each child's use.\" Sta are exposed to disinfectants and sanitizers when they clean surfaces and toys. Th e cleaning solution recommended for ECE programs consists of chlorine bleach (a pesticide) diluted with water. Since the clean-ing products used are typically common household cleansers, ECE sta tend to overlook their toxicity. Kitchen and laundry disinfectants and sanitizers, and products that kill mold and mildew are technically referred to as pesticides. CCHAs need to be aware of this common exposure to toxic materials and to edu-cate themselves and other ECE providers about how to safely use cleaning products. Chlorine bleach, for example, is irritating to the skin and can cause serious 4nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health Advocatesdamage to the eyes. Other common cleaning products, such as furniture cleaners and polishes, fl oor cleaners, and carpet shampoos and disinfectants, contain very toxic ingredients. When inhaled, these toxins may irritate the ear, nose and throat, and cause headaches. With repeated exposure, loss of balance, nausea and damage to the liver, kidneys and central nervous sys-tem may result. When possible, less toxic materials should be used in place of the more toxic products. In addition, proper ventilation (circulation of air) is required when using these cleaning materials. Art materials ECE sta are more likely to be exposed to toxic arts and crafts materials than the children in their care. Sta may use more toxic art materials (such as glues, rubber cement, inks and paints) to create posters or art work for room display. Other toxic art materials commonly used by ECE providers, such as spray-on enamels and spray xatives, contain organic chemicals that can cause dizziness and sleepiness in the short term. If an ECE provider is exposed to a small amount of toxic art materials for a long period of time (e.g., everyday for several years), he or she may be more likely to experience the following health problems: allergies, asthma, central and peripheral nerve dam-age, psychological and behavioral changes, respiratory damage, skin damage and cancer (AAP , 2003). Th ere are now art materials that are nontoxic, which should be used instead of the toxic materials. Mold, mildew, lead and asbestos ECE programs, especially those in big cities, are often housed in older buildings, probably because such buildings are plentiful and have lower rents. However, if the building was built before 1978, the paint likely contains lead. In most cases, the older the building, the higher the percentage of lead in the paint. Lead paint wears away over time due to moisture, normal use and disturbance during renovation projects. Th e paint fl akes and breaks down into dust that may be so ne it cannot be seen, but it can be inhaled or swal- lowed. Older buildings also usually contain asbestos (a re-resistant material) in ceilings, fl oor tiles, or pipe or furnace insulation, or on other surfaces. Over time, asbestos can also fl ake and break down into ne dust, which can be inhaled or swallowed. Finally, older buildings have a greater risk of mold and mil-dew because moisture builds up from leaks in the roof or basement, drafty windows and doorways, and inef- cient ventilation or air conditioning systems. All of these characteristics of older buildings create a risk for ECE sta , as well as the children they care for. For example: Even at low concentrations, lead can a ect the central nervous system and is linked with lower IQ scores and nerve damage (AAP , 2003). Exposure to asbestos has a strong link with lung cancer (AAP , 2003). Mold and mildew are linked with asthma and respiratory symptoms (AAP , 2003). Latex Since ECE providers sometimes wear latex gloves to protect themselves against infections, they are at risk for latex allergies. Latex is a milky liquid produced by rubber trees. It is used to make a variety of com-mon household products, such as protective gloves. Latex allergy or sensitivity is a reaction of the body's immune system to proteins found in natural rubber latex. Symptoms can include skin redness, hives, itch-ing, itchy eyes, sneezing or coughing. See Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Latex Allergy and Sensitivity in the Child Care Setting for more information. Stress in the ECE Workplace Th e ECE setting can be very stressful. Some of the causes of stress, such as low pay and working condi-tions, may not be easily xed. Stress may be related to tension between families and ECE providers, child-adult ratios, noise, the demands and immediacy of the needs of children, and inadequate bene ts. ECE sta commonly do not receive bene ts such as medi- cal insurance. Th e combination of low pay, di cult physical work, lack of breaks and support all add to feelings of stress. Workplace stress in ECE programs may well play a key role in causing physical illness among sta (Aron- son, 2001). Some of the symptoms or early warning signs of job stress include the following: tense muscles; sore neck, shoulders and back upset stomach headachesStaff Health nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n5 sleep disturbances, insomnia fatigue, even when getting enough hours of sleep boredom, listlessness and low morale self-medicating with alcohol, ca eine and other drugs loss of appetite irritability di culty in concentrating CCHAs should be aware of the stress present in the ECE sta and should educate coworkers about ways to prevent and manage stress. WHAT A CCHA NEEDS TO DO Prevention of Illness To prevent illness in sta , several things need to be done. First, CCHAs should consider policies that encourage sta to have health assessments before they are hired, as well as annual physicals to help sta identify any possible weaknesses or vulnerabilities to speci c job-related risks. Second, CCHAs should make sure that ECE programs have policies for adult immunization requirements. If ECE providers are immunized, they are less likely to get sick. Th irdly, CCHAs should make sure that there are illness exclu-sion policies in place. CCHAs should also make sure that ECE providers are aware of the need to prevent illness in pregnant sta members. Lastly, CCHAs should educate ECE providers about standard precau- tions (rules for preventing the spread of disease) and the importance of sanitation. Staff health assessment All ECE sta should have a health assessment con- ducted by a health care professional before their rst day of work at the ECE program (AAP et al., 2002; Aron-son, 2002; State of California, 2002). Th e examination should include a health history, physical examination, dental examination, vision and hearing screening, TB screening, review of immune status to vaccine-pre-ventable diseases, review of job-related health concerns and an assessment of risk from exposure to common childhood infections such as parvovirus, CMV and chickenpox. Th ese requirements are well described in CFOC (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 1.045). Appen-dix E provides a model health assessment form (see Handout: Child Care Sta Health Assessment ). If ECE sta have a positive TB test, have tested positively for TB in the past or have had TB in the past, they must have a signed document from their doctor that states that they do not have active TB (State of California, 2002). Staff immunization CCHAs can encourage ECE sta to get immunized and have yearly fl u shots. CFOC recommends the following: \"ECE providers shall be current for all immunizations routinely recommended for adults by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention (CDC). All child care providers shall have: a) completed a primary series for tetanus and diph-theria, and shall receive boosters every 10 years; b) been immunized or certi ed immune by a care provider against measles, mumps, rubella, poliomyeli-tis, varicella (chickenpox), and hepatitis B following of the ACIP\" (AAP et al., 2002, Stan-dard 3.007). CDC (2003) reports that the childhood immunization program has greatly reduced the rate of vaccine-preventable disease among children, but vac-cine-preventable diseases such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, infl uenza and pneumococcal infections continue to occur among adults. In 2002, ACIP approved a rou-tine vaccination schedule during 2003 to 2004 for persons aged 19 and older. Th e most current adult immunization schedule can be found at http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ps/dcdc/izgroup. (Also see Handout: Rec- ommended Adult Immunization Schedule by Vaccine and Age Group .) In addition, ECE providers are encour- aged to receive yearly fl u shots to protect themselves and to reduce the spread of the fl u to young children and families (see Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Infl uenza and You\u2014What You Need to Know and Handout: Fact Sheets for Families: Vaccines Aren't Just for Children ). Exclusion policies CCHAs should develop and put into practice exclu- sion policies that encourage sta to stay at home until they have completely recovered from any infectious 6nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health Advocatesillness. CCHAs should communicate the exclusion policy to parents, making sure they understand the importance the ECE program puts on having sta members, as well as children, stay home when they are ill. Th e CFOC standards (AAP et al., 2002) list 18 conditions that require the temporary exclusion of a sta member to prevent the spread of illness (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 3.069). In a survey of ECE sta , Gratz and Cla ey (1996) found that 87% of sta reported working when ill. See Handout: Sta Illness and Exclusion Policy for more information. Pregnant staff ECE sta who are pregnant are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases (Gratz, 1994; Gratz & Boulton, 1994). Sta who are pregnant or sta who are con- sidering pregnancy should consult with their health care providers for advice about immunizations and other measures to promote a healthy pregnancy while working in ECE programs. CCHAs can tell all sta members about the risks pregnant ECE providers face. Standard precautions To reduce the spread of infectious diseases in ECE programs, sta must wash their hands, wear gloves if needed, and clean and sanitize the room, tables, kitchen area and toys. CCHAs should teach sta about standard precautions as a way to reduce illness in the ECE program. Standard precautions are a set of rules designed to prevent the spread of diseases via blood or body fl uids. Any body fl uid may carry conta- gious germs. When ECE providers come into contact with blood or body fl uids, they may be exposed to unknown diseases. See Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Standard and Universal Precautions in the Child Care Setting . Here are some other examples of things a CCHA can do to encourage sta wellness: Maintain lists of health care providers for pre- employment physicals, immunizations, illness or injury, and workers' compensation evaluation. Create a bulletin board in the sta lounge to announce classes, social events, and wellness and stress relief messages, such as stretching, yoga, exercises, plenty of jokes, humor and a sta sug- gestion box. Develop a list of substitute teachers to provide relief when sta are ill or stressed. Stock a rst aid kit which includes items such as Tylenol, ice compresses and ace bandages. Prevention of Injuries To help prevent on-the-job injuries, CCHAs can provide information about proper body mechanics to sta when they work at low tables and on child-sized chairs, and when they lift and carry children. CCHAs can encourage ECE providers to buy furniture that promotes children's safety and helps providers use proper body mechanics. Sta should follow these guidelines to safely lift chil- dren (American Academy of Family Physicians, 2001; NAEYC, 1997; Gratz & Cla ey, 1997; Wortman, 2001): Prepare rst. Plan ahead and do not rush. For example, lower crib sides before lifting a child from the bed. Be prepared to pick the child up and carry him or her to another place before putting the child down again. Make sure there is enough room to lift safely. Give yourself a rm base of support. Stand close to the child with your feet about shoulder-width apart, with one foot alongside the child and the other slightly back. If you reach out to lift and carry a child or object, you may hurt your back. Squat down, bending at the knees, not the waist. Tighten your stomach muscles to help your back stay in balance while you lift. Try to keep your chin parallel to the fl oor and your back as straight as possible. Never lift a child by keeping your legs sti , while bending over the child. Have a rm grasp of the child before beginning to lift. Begin slowly lifting with your legs. Never twist the body during this step. Twisting stresses the muscles, ligaments and joints of the spine. If you must turn while carrying a child, turn using your feet, not your torso. Use slow and smooth movements. Hurried, jerky movements can strain the muscles in the back. To put the child down again, follow the same steps in reverse order. Have a rm grasp on the child and place your feet shoulder-width apart, Staff Health nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n7one foot slightly in front of the other. Remem- ber to keep your back as vertical as possible and bend at the knees to lower the child. Extend arms straight down and do not rotate the trunk. (See Handout: Cal/OSHA: Work Smarter, Not Just Harder: Th ink Ergonomics .) Prevention of Exposure to Toxic Materials To decrease this job-related risk, the CCHA should check the ingredients of the cleaning and art supplies to make sure they are not toxic. Th e CCHA can make sure that the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) on all supplies requiring them are available and that sta have access to the sheets and the information on them (see Handout: Material Safety Data Sheet [Clorox Company] ). Th e CCHA can advise sta to use gloves when working with irritating substances and to check with poison control or the manufacturer if they have additional questions about the materials they are using for sanitation and cleaning. Th e CCHA should make sure to have nonlatex gloves available for those sta members who have latex allergies (see Handout: Health and Safety Notes: Latex Allergy and Sensitivity in the Child Care Setting ). All cleaning products should be used only for their intended purpose and according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For example, when the instruc-tions say, \"use with adequate ventilation,\" the product should preferably be used outside the building. If used inside, windows should be open so that air can fl ow; exhaust fans can be used as well (AAP et al., 2002, Standard 5.100). Some other tips include the following: ECE sta should limit or avoid using highly toxic liquid cleaners when cleaning carpets. Cleaning products should be stored only in their original containers so that safety information is not lost. Th ese products should be kept safely out of reach of children (AAP et al., 2002, Standards 5.011, 5.100). By law (OSHA Hazard Communication Stan- dard 1910.1200), the workplace must provide employee training programs on the risks of any chemicals in the workplace and on ways to pro-tect oneself from the chemicals. If there is a choice between products that have the same cleaning results, the ECE program should choose the least toxic one. Product labels or MSDSs contain a rating of 0 to 4 under the heading Health Hazard Rating . Th e lower the number, the less toxic the product. Sta should carefully review all art supplies used in the ECE program and, whenever possible, replace them with less toxic products (AAP et al., 2002, Standards 5.073, 5.100-5.111). For example, water-based paints can replace paints containing lead. Nontoxic markers can replace permanent markers, which may contain toxic solvents. Wet clay can be used instead of pow-dered clay, and new, less toxic brush cleaners are now available to replace those with organic sol- vents (Smith, 2002). All arts and crafts materials used in ECE programs should have two labels: ASTM D-4236. All arts and crafts materi- als imported or sold in the United States are required to meet the American Standards for Testing Materials (ASTM) D-4236 regulations for acute and chronic health hazards. A state-ment containing this information must appear on the product label. Th is statement does not mean that the product is safe, but that the prod-uct provides information for safe use. ACMI. Th e seal of the Art and Creative Mate- rials Institute (ACMI) certi es that an art material can be used without risk of acute or chronic health hazards by anyone, including children and impaired adults (AAP , 2003). Prevention of Stress Th ere are two ways to help prevent stress in the ECE workplace. One is to change the workplace to make it less stressful, and the other is to teach ECE sta how to manage and cope with stress. CFOC (AAP et al., 2002, Standards 1.049, 3.058) recommends making workplace changes in the form of written personnel policies for such things as break times away from children to prevent potentially stress-ful situations for ECE providers. Other suggested workplace changes for reducing sta stress include the following (AAP et al., 2002; Aronson, 2001; Pre-vent Child Abuse North Carolina, 2000):8nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health Advocates written job descriptions and personnel policies to insure sta understand their responsibilities regular sta meetings so that members can share feelings and concerns, and feel supported by coworkers involvement of sta in program decisions so that they feel control over their work environment regularly scheduled, trained volunteers to assist during the busiest times of the day so sta can take breaks or provide individual attention to children. the presence of an on-call person so sta mem- bers who feel overwhelmed by the demands of the job can take a break from the children a pleasant, comfortable place with adult-sized furniture for sta to use on breaks so that their time away from the children is relaxing regularly scheduled exercise breaks for sta , such as a 10-minute walk twice a day Instead of changing the things that create stress in the workplace, stress management programs teach ECE providers to change how they react to stressful events. Stress management programs teach work-ers about the nature and sources of stress, the e ects of stress on health and ways to reduce stress, such as time management or relaxation exercises. CCHAs can work with sta to nd out what they nd stress- ful in their day and how to make a plan to deal with the stress. CCHAs can provide training on the signs and symptoms of stress, as well as changes that may decrease stress. To date, stress management training in ECE programs has focused on providing tips for building personal skills to manage stress (Aronson, 2001; Mayer, 2002). Some of the stress management tips include the following: Prioritize. Identify those tasks that are most important and take care of those rst. Set limits. Do not take on other people's prob- lems. Use appropriate resources. ECE providers can only go so far in meeting children's needs. Rec-ommend community resources to parents when they need more help than you can o er. Maximize job satisfaction. Structure the day to include as many bene ts and enjoyable tasks as possible. Even 5 minutes of an enjoyable activity can improve health. Get support. Identify other ECE sta to talk about work issues with. Share concerns and ideas. Laugh. Laughter is good for you. Find time to laugh and have fun with whatever you are doing. Exercise. Physical activity is relaxing and can help release stress and tension. Stretching exer-cises and exercises to strengthen the back are important for stress management. Assess the ECE Program's Existing Staff Health Policies Th e CCHA should nd out if sta health policies exist. If so, the CCHA should review the existing policies to make sure they are accurate and up-to-date. Th ere should be statements on topics such as exclusion and inclusion for illness, mandatory breaks and safe lift-ing. Th e CCHA should assess if sta have proper equipment for protection against exposure to disease (e.g., gloves, disinfectants). Th e CCHA can help the ECE provider nd out if the plan can be designed, when needed, for a particular sta person's special needs. Th e CCHA should nd out who is responsible for the policies and how the policies are monitored. If there are weaknesses in some areas of the plan for sta safety and health, the CCHA can o er realistic recommendations for improving the existing policies or for developing policies if none are available. Assist with Finding Solutions to Staff Health Issues That Arise Th e CCHA can help ECE providers de ne problems and resolve confl ict using the following techniques: Have a brainstorming session with sta to explore preventive health needs. Provide the current immunization schedule for adults. Change the existing policy or create a new one as needed. Help develop a plan for training in bloodborne pathogens (diseases carried by blood or other body fl uids), standard precautions, body mechan- ics and other topics.Staff Health nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n9Link ECE Programs with Health Departments and Other Resources Th e CCHA should assist programs in linking with the local health department, the local OSHA o ce and other relevant health agencies. Th e CCHA can help ECE programs and sta access low-income health and dental insurance. Th e CCHA can explore resources for substitute teachers that will allow the ECE provider to maintain child-adult ratios so they may take needed breaks or a day o . Model Safe and Healthy Behavior at All Times Th e CCHA should do the following: Wash hands upon entering the ECE program or classroom. Remove shoes when entering infant/toddler areas. Choose healthy snacks like fruit or nuts when bringing snacks for the sta . Model proper body mechanics when lifting, sit- ting or reaching. Cultural Implications Various cultures may have di erent ideas about how to treat illness. It is very important to consider these cultural, ethnic and language di erences when talk- ing to parents and sta . Having clearly de ned rules about when and why sta and children should not come to the ECE program due to illness will help families. Having a sta person who can speak in the families' language may also help prevent problems. Implications for Children and Families If sta are encouraged to stay home or seek medical attention when they are too ill to work, children in the ECE program will be exposed to fewer illnesses and may miss fewer days. Children and families will learn about appropriate health and safety behaviors when they are practiced by the ECE sta . Sta will have more patience and less stress when working with the children and families, and therefore, the quality of the care may improve.Implications for ECE Providers ECE sta will be more comfortable doing their jobs if they are aware of good body mechanics, are aware of stress-reducing interventions and take better care of themselves. ECE sta will be more aware of risk factors in ECE programs and more aware of methods for preventing risks to themselves.10nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesACTIVITY 1: LARGE GROUP BRAINSTORM Brainstorm ways CCHAs can assist ECE programs in helping ECE sta feel healthy and less stressed. Make a list of ideas. Talk about how physical tness and nutrition may play a role. Staff Health nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n11ACTIVITY 2: STAFF HEALTH STORIES Please read each story and answer the questions. Talk about the stories in small groups. Story #1: Th e director at your center, Ben Stanley, wants your help as a CCHA. He is very concerned about something he heard from the mother of one of the children. When you arrive, Mr. Stanley tells you that Vera Lloyd-Drake, the mother of a child at the center, came into his o ce this morning and was very angry and upset. She told him that Adrienne, one of the sta in the center, has hepatitis B. Ms. Lloyd-Drake said she works in the Community Hospital as a housekeeper and saw Adrienne in the hepatitis clinic. Ms. Lloyd-Drake has threatened to pull her child out of the center if Adrienne is allowed to stay. What are the main issues in this situation that need to be talked about? Why is the mother upset? Why is Mr. Stanley upset?How would you respond to Mr. Stanley?How can you help the situation? Story #2: While you are talking with Mr. Stanley, he also addresses another issue. He tells you he is concerned about one of the center's caregivers, Victoria Lowell. Mr. Stanley describes Ms. Lowell as an incredibly loving caregiver. She has some health problems, however, because she is very overweight. She has back problems and is unable to lift any of the children. She also has a hard time getting in and out of chairs, and it is di cult for her to be involved with the children on the playground. Mr. Stanley values Ms. Lowell as an employee, but is concerned for her health and the children's safety. What are the main issues in this situation that need to be talked about? How would you respond to Mr. Stanley? What advice would you give him?12nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesStory #3: DeeDee Stanford is the Director of the Cedar Street Child Care Center. It is a large facility with an enrollment of 57 preschoolers and 12 infant toddlers. Th e sta are worried about the safety of using bleach as a disinfectant. Some sta prefer to use Simple Green Cleaner as a disinfectant. Ms. Stanford wants to know what to do. What are the main issues in this situation that need to be talked about? How would you respond to Ms. Stanford? Story # 4: As the CCHA of a program, you have been asked by the director to make rounds of the rooms and to help identify health risks that need attention. In the toddler room, you notice a sta person lifting a heavy toddler o the diaper table using improper lifting technique (knees straight, twisting while lifting). She also uses the same poor technique when taking heavy diaper bags to the garbage. You also observe the large amount of time ECE sta spend on the fl oor with the infants and toddlers for bottle feeding and interactions with the babies. One sta member commented that working with babies \"kills your back.\" When you shared this information with the director, she was surprised. What would you recommend the director do to improve working conditions in the program?

There are many vaccines for adults as well and some of them are even more im- portant for adults than for children. How do vaccines protect us? When you are exposed to germs, your body makes pro-teins called antibodies to fight them like soldiers, evenin the future. Vaccines are made from germs that cause illnesses, but they are either weaker, dead forms or just pieces of germs which cannot cause illness but can stillstimulate your body to produce antibodies.Which vaccines are recommended? More than 40,000 adults die each year from three majorvaccine-preventable diseases: influenza (flu), pneumo-coccal infections and hepatitis B. Measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, tetanus, diphtheria and hepatitis A also cause a considerable number of illnesses and somedeaths among adults. Many adults need to receive vac- cines against these illnesses. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are among the most effective and safest medi- cines. Even so, like other medicines, vaccines may causeside effects such as temporary pain at the injection site or low fever. Side effects are rarely serious. Where can adults get vaccines? Immunizations are given in doctors' offices, managed care organizations (HMOs), public health clinics, nurs-ing homes, assisted care facilities, pharmacies and other sites such as health fairs and senior centers. For informa- tion on vaccines, ask your health care provider or call theCDC Immunization Hotline at (800) 232-2522 (English), (800) 232-0233 (Espa\u00f1ol) or visit www.cdc.gov/nip.22nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesStaff Health nCalifornia Training Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n23Influenza and You\u2014 What You Need to KnowHealth & Safety Notes California Childcare Health Program Is it a cold or the flu? Colds usually start two to three days after exposure to the virus and last two to seven days. Symptoms may include a scratchy, sore throat, sneezing, runny nose, and a mild cough. Fever is generally mild in older chil-dren and adults. Infants and young children may run higher fevers. The flu causes a sudden headache, dry cough, muscle ache, extreme fatigue, and high fever.Most people feel better in a few days, but the fatigue and cough can last for up to two weeks or more. How can I prevent the flu from spreading? Practice good hand washing. Teach children to cough into their elbow and away from people. Wipe noses with clean disposable tissues, dispose of them properly and wash your hands. Don't share food, bottles, toothbrushes or toys that can be put in the mouth. Play outdoors often. Let fresh air into your pro- gram daily. What should I do for a flu victim? Provide lots of fluids and rest. Medicine for muscleaches and cough may be purchased over the counter.If someone is in a high-risk group, continues to have high fever for more than a few days, or thinks they are getting pneumonia (worsening cough, pain inchest, continued fever, shortness of breath) then they should contact their health care provider immediately. The flu vaccine The flu vaccine provides slightly different protection every year because the flu virus mutates or changes frequently. Vaccination against the flu is recom- mended from October through early November. Afterreceiving the vaccine it takes a couple of weeks to develop protective immunity from the flu virus. Thisprotection lasts for about three to four months or through the worst part of the flu season, which is No- vember through March or April, with peak occurrencein February. It's unusual to get the flu more than once a year. Who needs the flu vaccine? You do. The influenza vaccination is recommended for all adults who care for children 0 to 23 months old. By protecting yourself you are also protecting those around you. Any child six months of age orolder can be vaccinated against the flu as well. People at high risk of severe illness are especially en- couraged to get the flu vaccine. Influenza vaccination is recommended for all of the following: children 6 to 23 months old (this group has the highest rate of hospitalization with the flu); household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children 0 to 23 months old; adults and children with chronic health conditions like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, kidney dis- ease, cancer and HIV/AIDS; women who are more than three months pregnant during the flu season (typically November through March); and adults 65 or older (even if they're in good health). Where can I get the flu vaccine? From your health care provider or the Public Health Department. For more information about immuniza-tion, or for links to local resources, call the Healthline at (800) 333-3212.24nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health Advocates\"The flu is just like a bad cold.\" False. The flu is far more serious than a bad cold. It's a disease of the lungs, and it can lead to pneumonia. Each year about 114,000 people in the U.S. are hospitalized and about 20,000 people (mostly over 65) die as a result of having the flu. Children under two years of age are as likely as those over 65 to have to go to the hospitalbecause of the flu. \"The flu shot can give you the flu.\" False. Flu vaccines are made from killed flu viruses. These cannot give you the flu. \"Even if I get the flu shot, I can still get the flu.\" Only partly true. This can happen, but the flu shot protects most people from the flu. The flu shot will not protect you from other viruses that can cause illnesses that sometimes feel like the flu. \"The vaccine isn't 100 percent effective, so I'm better off getting the flu.\" False . No vaccine is 100 percent effective. But if you get a flu shot and still get the flu, you are likely to be far less sick than if you had not received the flu shot. \"The side effects of the flu shot are worse than the flu.\" False . The worst side effect you're likely to get is a sore arm. The risk of a rare allergic reaction is far less than the risk of severe complications from influenza. \"Not everyone can get a flu shot.\" True . If you are allergic to eggs (which are used in making the vaccine), are ill with a high fever, or have had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine in the past, you might not be able to get the vaccine. \"Only the very old and the very sick need a flu shot.\" False . Adults and children who are in good health need a flu shot to stay healthy and avoid exposing someone who is more at risk because of their age (very young or very old), a medical condition, pregnancy, or weakened immune system. \"December is too late to get a flu shot.\" False . The flu shot can be given before or during the flu season. The optimal time to get a flu shot is October or November, but a flu shot in December or later will still protect you against flu outbreaks.

California Childcare Health Program 1333 Broadway, Suite 1010 Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n25With more child care providers and health profession- als following universal precautions to protectthemselves from infections such as viral hepatitis and HIV , we are seeing an increase in latex allergies and sen- sitivities. Universal precautions require that child careproviders wear protective gloves for any procedures that put them into contact with blood. The most effective, inexpensive and comfortable protective gloves are madefrom latex. What is latex? Latex is a milky liquid produced by rubber trees. It isused to make a wide variety of common household products such as protective gloves, balloons, disposable diapers, bandage tapes, pacifiers, rubber bands, bottlenipples, tires, toys and elastic in clothing, to name a few. What is latex allergy? Latex allergy or hypersensitivity is a reaction of thebody's immune system to proteins found in natural rub- ber latex. Some people also react to chemicals in the gloves besides the latex itself. Sensitivity to latex canrange from a mild skin irritation to a severe allergic re- action. Reactions can occur from direct contact with products containing latex or from breathing latex particles in theair. Most latex gloves are treated with cornstarch pow- der to make them easier to put on and take off, and this powder binds with the latex proteins. When gloves areremoved or snapped, they release the powder\u2014along with the latex proteins\u2014into the air. What are the symptoms? If someone becomes sensitive to latex, symptoms usu-ally begin within minutes of exposure, but they can occur hours later and be quite varied. Mild reactions may cause skin redness, hives or itching. More severe reactions may cause respiratory symp- toms such as itchy eyes, sneezing, coughing and asthma. Rarely, life-threatening shock may occur (but this seldom occurs as the first episode). Who is at risk? Anyone can develop a latex allergy, but the followinggroups of people are at increased risk: people who wear latex gloves regularly, such as child care providers and health care workers children with spina bifida (a birth defect involving the spinal cord or backbone) people with other allergies or asthma people who have had multiple surgical procedures people who have allergies to certain foods, especially avocado, potato, banana, tomato, chestnuts, kiwi and papaya. Latex allergy should be suspected in anyone who devel- ops symptoms after exposure, and he or she should be evaluated by a medical provider to determine if the re- action was caused by exposure to latex. What should I do if I am allergic? If diagnosed with a latex allergy by a medical provider,you should: Tell your employer, clients and all health care pro- viders that you are allergic. Do not rely on doctors, nurses or dentists to know this from your chart. Wear a medical alert bracelet and carry non-latex gloves for convenience. Know which products might contain latex and avoid them. If you have staff or children in your program who are allergic, post a list of products containing latexand try to replace as many of them as possible with safer alternatives.Latex Allergy and Sensitivity in the Child Care SettingHealth & Safety Notes California Childcare Health Program 26nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesAny disposable glove is acceptable for food prepara- tion or routine diapering as long as you practice effectivehandwashing. The most important point to consider is that not all dis- posable gloves will protect you from viruses likehepatitis B or C, or HIV. Be sure you are using a medi-cal exam glove that meets EPA guidelines. Talk to amedical supply store or your pharmacist if you're notsure. If you are searching for non-latex gloves, keep in mind that the term \"hypoallergenic\" is not regulated, and doesnot mean latex-free\u2014it usually means there are fewerchemicals used to make them. Read the label or ask yourpharmacist. Also remember that gloves deteriorate over time, so no matter what kind of gloves you purhase, be sure to check the expiration date on the box and store extra boxes in a cool, dry, dark place.

DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 97-135 (July 1998) By A. Rahman Zamani, MPH and Lyn Dailey, PHN (3/8/01) Consult your child care health consultant or health provider regarding preparation for and responding to emergencies (e.g., having auto-injectable epineph- rine such as EpiPen and EpiPen Jr.) ready andknowing how to use it. How can you avoid latex allergy? Reduce your exposure to latex by only using latex gloves when you really need to. Protective glovesof any kind are only one part of universal precau- tions, and handwashing with soap is the most important infection control practice. Wear vinylgloves instead of latex for routine diaper changes, food preparation and procedures that do not expose you to blood (such as applying cream to a rash orcleaning up vomit). Remember that vinyl gloves are a less effective barrier after about 15 minutes of wear. Medical-grade vinyl gloves are also available forprocedures involving blood. Use latex gloves without powder. This will reduce the amount of airborne latex. Do not use oil-based hand lotions because they can break down and release the latex in gloves. Always wash your hands after removing gloves. When you use latex gloves, try a larger size than you would normally wear so that you perspire less and trap less moisture under the glove. Choosing Gloves There are several kinds of gloves for you to choose from,and each has advantages and disadvantages. You willneed to choose the right glove for the right situation. Latex gloves provide the most protection at the low- est cost and are the most comfortable for the majority of people. Single-use vinyl and polyvinyl chloride gloves do not contain latex and are appropriate for use in the child care setting when blood is not involved. Medical grade non-latex gloves provide maximum protection but are are generally more expensive. Consider a bulk purchasing arrangement through your Family Child Care Association. California Childcare Health Program 1333 Broadway, Suite 1010 Oakland, CA Institute nCalifornia Childcare Health Program n27Standard and Universal Precautions in the Child Care SettingHealth & Safety Notes What are standard and universal precautions? Universal precautions is the term used for the guidelines that were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 1980s to re-duce the spread of infection to health care providers and patients in health care settings. Standard precautions is the new term used for an expansion of universal precautions, recognizing that any body \u00c1 uid may hold contagious germs. They are still primarily designed to prevent the spread of bloodborne disease (disease carried by blood or other body \u00c1 uids), but are also excellent measures to prevent the spread of infectious disease in group care settings such as child care facilities. Why are standard precautions needed? Standard precautions are designed to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease from both rec-ognized and unrecognized sources of infections. Germs that are spread through blood and body \u00c1 u- ids can come at any time from any person. You may not know if someone is infected with a virus such as hepatitis B or HIV , and the infected person may not even know. This is why you must behave as if every individual might be infected with any germ in all situations that place you in contact with blood or body \u00c1 uids. What do standard precautions consist of? Standard precautions include the following: Hand washing after diapering or toileting children after handling body \u00c1 uids of any kind before and after giving \u00c0 rst aid (such as clean-ing cuts and scratches or bloody noses) after cleaning up spills or objects contaminated with body \u00c1 uids after taking off your disposable gloves remember that wearing gloves does not mean that you don't have to wash your hands! Latex gloves should be worn during contact with blood or body \u00c1 uids which contain blood (such as vomit or fe ces which con-tain blood you can see) when individuals have cuts, scratches or rashes which cause breaks in the skin of their hands Environmental sanitizing should be done regularly and as needed. In the child care setting this means cleaning toys, surfaces and diapering areas with a bleach solution (1 table spoon of bleach per quart of water made fresh daily). Blood spills or objects with blood on them need a stronger solution of 1/4 cup bleach to 2 1/2 cups water. (Donowitz, 1999). Wear gloves when handling blood. Proper disposal of materials that are soaked in or caked with blood requires double bagging in plastic bags that are securely tied. Send these items home with the child, or if you wash them, wash them sep-arately from other items. Items used for procedures on children with special needs (such as lancets for \u00c0 nger sticks, or sy ringes for injections given by par- ents) require a special container for safe disposal. Parents can provide what is called a \"sharps con-tainer\" which safely stores the lan cets or needles until the parent can take them home for disposal. Standard precautions in child care settings vs. hospitals and clinics Child care facilities follow the standard precautions in clinic and hospital settings with the following exceptions:28nStaff Health nA Curriculum for Child Care Health AdvocatesCalifornia Childcare Health Program 1333 Broadway, Suite 1010 Telephone 510-839-1195 Fax 510-839-0339 Healthline 1-800-333-3212 www.ucsfchildcarehealth.org Use of nonporous gloves is optional except when blood or blood-containing body \u00c1 uids may be involved. Gowns and masks are not required. Appropriate barriers include materials such as disposable diaper table paper, disposable tow-els and surfaces that can be sanitized in group care settings. What else am I required to do? The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also requires that all child care programs with staff (even family child care homes with assis-tants or volunteers) have an Exposure Control Plan for Bloodborne Pathogens . This plan must be in writing and include: Exposure determination . This is a list of the job titles or duties which might put an indi vidual in contact with blood or blood-containing \u00c1 uids (such as \u00c0 rst aid, nose blowing, diaper ing, etc.) Methods of compliance. These are the ways you will assure your plan will work and which include written standard precautions and cleaning plans, training of staff in their use, and the avail ability of gloves. Hepatitis B vaccination. This must be offered by the employer at no cost to staff. The vaccine se ries can begin either within 10 days of employment, or within 24 hours after a potential blood ex posure (accidental contact with blood while administer-ing\u00c0 rst aid, diapering an infant with a bloody stool, etc.) Note: Hepatitis B is a series of three shots which must be given on a spe ci \u00c0 c schedule. Now that all children are required to have the series before en tering care, child care providers should be at a reduced risk of getting hepati tis B in a child care setting. Exposure reporting procedures. These are required and will tell staff what to do if some thing happens which puts an employee in contact with blood on their broken skin (cuts, scratches, open rashes or chapped skin) or on their mucous membranes (in the eye, mouth or nose).

In other words, as an employer, you must follow state laws governing job safety and health. Failure to do so can result in a threat to the life or health of workers, andsubstantial monetary penalties. You must display this poster so everyone on the job can be aware of basic rights and responsibilities. You must have a written and effective injury and illness prevention program for your employees to follow. You must be aware of hazards your employees face on the job and keep records showing that each employee has been trained in the hazards unique to each job assignment. You must correct any hazardous condition that you know may result in serious injury to employees. Failure to do so could result in criminal charges, monetary penalties, and even incarceration. You must notify the nearest Cal/OSHA office of any serious injury or fatality occurring on the job. Be sure to do this immediately after calling for emergency helpto assist the injured employee. Failure to report a serious injury or fatality within 8 hours can result in a minimum civil penalty of $5,000. WHAT AN EMPLOYER MUST NEVER DO: Never permit an employee to do work that violates Cal/OSHA law. Never permit an employee to be exposed to harmful substances without providing adequate protection. Never allow an untrained employee to perform hazardous work. EMPLOYEES HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS IN WORKPLACE SAFETY & HEALTH: As an employee, you (or someone acting for you) have the right to file a complaint and request an inspection of your workplace if conditions there are unsafe or unhealthful. This is done by contacting the local district office of the Division ofOccupational Safety and Health (see list of offices). Your name is not revealed byCal/OSHA, unless you request otherwise. You also have the right to bring unsafe or unhealthful conditions to the attention of the Cal/OSHA investigator making an inspection of your workplace. Upon request,Cal/OSHA will withhold the names of employees who submit or make statements during an inspection or investigation. Any employee has the right to refuse to perform work that would violate a Cal/ OSHA or any occupational safety or health standard or order where such violationwould create a real and apparent hazard to the employee or other employees. You may not be fired or punished in any way for filing a complaint about unsafe or unhealthful working conditions, or using any other right given to you by Cal/OSHA law. If you feel that you have been fired or punished for exercising your rights, youmay file a complaint about this type of discrimination by contacting the nearest office of the Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (State Labor Commissioner) or the San Francisco office of the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. (Employees of state or local government agencies may only file these complaints with the State Labor Commis-sioner.) Consult your local telephone directory for the office nearest you. EMPLOYEES ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES: To keep the workplace and your coworkers safe, you should tell your employer about any hazard that could result in an injury or illness to people on the job. While working, you must always obey state job safety and health laws.SPECIAL RULES APPLY IN WORK AROUND HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES: Employers who use any substance listed as a hazardous substance in Section 339 of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations, or subject to the Federal Hazard Communications Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200), must provide employees withinformation on the contents on Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), or equivalentinformation about the substance that trains employees to use the substance safely. Employers shall make available on a timely and reasonable basis a Material Safety Data Sheet on each hazardous substance in the workplace upon request of an employee,an employee collective bargaining representative, or an employee \u00b7s physician. Employees have the right to see and copy their medical records and records of exposure to potentially toxic materials or harmful physical agents. Employers must allow access by employees or their representatives to accurate records of employee exposures to potentially toxic materials or harmful physical agents, and notify employees of any exposures in concentration or levels exceeding the exposure limits allowed by Cal/OSHA standards. Any employee has the right to observe monitoring or measuring of employee exposure to hazards conducted pursuant to Cal/OSHA regulations. WHEN CAL/OSHA COMES TO THE WORKPLACE: A trained Cal/OSHA safety engineer or industrial hygienist may periodically visit the workplace to make sure your company is obeying job safety and health laws. An inspection will also be conducted when a legitimate complaint is filed by an employee with the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. Cal/OSHA also goes to the workplace to investigate a serious injury or fatality. When an inspection begins, the Cal/OSHA investigator will show official identification from the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The employer, or someone the employer chooses, will be given an opportunity to accompany the investigator during the inspection. A representative of the employees will be given the same opportunity. Where there is no authorized employee representative, the investigator will talk to a reasonable number of employees about safety and health conditions at the workplace. VIOLATIONS, CITATIONS & PENALTIES: If the investigation shows that the employer has violated a safety and health standard or order, then the Division of Occupational Safety and Health issues a citation. Each citation specifies a date by which the violation must be abated. Anotice, which carries no monetary penalty, may be issued in lieu of a citation forcertain non-serious violations. Citations carry penalties of up to $7,000 for each regulatory or general violation and up to $25,000 for each serious violation. Additional penalties of up to $7,000 per day for regulatory or general violations and up to $15,000 per day for serious violations may be proposed for each failure to correct a violation by the abatement date shown on the citation. A penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $70,000 may be assessed an employer who willfully violates any occupational safety and health standard or order. The maximum civil penalty that can be assessed for each repeat violation is $70,000. A willful violation that causes death or permanent impairment of the body of any employee results, upon conviction, in a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisonment up to three years, or both and if the employer is acorporation or limited liability company the fine may not exceed $1.5 million. The law provides that employers may appeal citations within 15 working days of receipt to the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board. An employer who receives a citation, Order to Take Special Action, or Special Order must post it prominently at or near the place of the violation for three working days, or until the unsafe condition is corrected, whichever is longer, to warn employees of danger that may exist there. Any employee may protest the time allowed for correction of the violation to the Division of Occupational Safety and Health or the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board. District OfficesSAFETY AND HEALTH PROTECTION ONTHEJOBState of California Department of Industrial Relations California law provides job safety and health protection for workers under the Cal/OSHA program. This poster explains the basicrequirements and pro cedures for compliance with the state \u00b7s job safety and health laws and regulations. The law requires that this poster be displayed. (Failure to do so could result in a penalty of up to $7,000.) Enforcement of Cal/OSHA job safety and health standards is carried out by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, under the California Depart ment of Industrial Relations, which has primary responsibility for administering the Cal/OSHA program. Safety and health standards are promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Standard s Board. Anyone desiring to register a complaint alleging inadequacy in the administration of the California Occupational Safety and Health Plan may do so by contacting the San Francisco Regional Of fice of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), U.S. Department of Labor (Tel: 415-975-4310).
