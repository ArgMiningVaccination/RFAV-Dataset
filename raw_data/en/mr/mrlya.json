A. Centrality to Institutional Mission Statement and Planning Priorities 1. Program description and alignment with mission The mission of Maryland University of Integrative Health (MUIH) is: A distinctive community of scholars, researchers, practitioners, and advocates, Maryland University of Integrative Health promotes whole person, relationship -centered healthcare. Through discovery and exploration, we deliver progressive educational programs, advance innovative clinical models, build mutually beneficial partnerships, and provide opportunities for fulfilling careers. Our vision is: Serving as a leader in the glob al transformation of health and wellness, we integrate healing traditions and contemporary science, acknowledge the wisdom of the body and nature as a teacher, and focus on the interconnection of mind, body, and spirit. Our work enables people to thrive through the cycles of life. MUIH is the pre -eminent institution in the U.S. for the study of health and wellness. Its programs integrate healing traditions and contemporary science and acknowledge the wisdom of the body and nature as a teacher to educate diverse and erudite health -care professionals for today and tomorrow. In keeping with its mission and vision, MUIH currently offers graduate programs in areas related to natural medicine such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, health and wellness coaching, nutrition, yoga therapy , and naturopathic medicine . MUIH has been a pioneer and driving force in the national movement toward wellness, disease prevention, and relationship -centered healthcare . MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 3 As an anchoring academic institution for the emerging wellness system in America, MUIH has trained over 2647 wellness professionals and has a current, annual unduplicated headcount enrollment of 1754 graduate students. Graduates not only help frame the he althcare options in the U.S. and abroad, but also are instrumental in encouraging people to switch to more natural lifestyle choices that improve their overall health and wellness. Ayurveda, which means \"science of life\", is one of the oldest systems of self-care in the world and predates written records. Ayurveda focusons on an individual's relationship with their own body, mind, and spirit, and with the natural world. Its aim is to integrate and balance the se aspects to help prevent illness and promote well-being. This proactive and relationship -centered approach is designed to re -establish harmony and balance by cleansing the body of substances that can cause sickness, and integrate and balance the body, mind and spirit. Ayurveda blends well with modern medicine and other integrative health fields, both philosophically and practically, owing to its inclusivity of multiple perspectives. MUIH's program in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices is designed to provide students an in -depth working knowledge of the wel lness therapies used in traditional Ayurveda. The program prepares graduates to enhance their professional health care practices wit h ayurvedic wellness approaches and to apply the ayurvedic healing framework when considering disease prevention and managem ent. The program enables students to create general approaches to promote, build, and maintain functional levels of health and vitality in daily life, present basic Ayurvedic lifestyle and wellness education to the public, and apply the principles of Ayurv eda to enhance their current professional practice with a unique set of assessment and health promotion skills. The principles of Ayurveda are congruent with those of health and wellness that are the cornerstone of MUIH's philosophy and at the heart of its continuing success in health care education. As with all MUIH pr ograms, the emphasis on establishing rapport with the client and developing a \"healing presence\" will be integrated into this program. In keeping with the philosop hy and mission of MUIH, this program stresses the concept of self-care - that health and education must first be applied to oneself before it can be applied to others - at the same time as it supports organizational structures and benefits that encourage such self-care. Consistent with MUIH's mission to deliver innovative solutions for healthier living and career -oriented opportunities for students , the proposed certificate will continue to advance MUIH's leadership in the emerging wellness system. 2. Priority and support of institutional strategic goals The development of the online delivery modality for the Post -Bccalaureate Certificate in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices supports MUIH's strategic go als, values and institutional principles. Since its founding, MUIH has positioned itself as a pioneer and advocate for a more natural and relationship -oriented approach to health and well -being. It is helping to lead the transformation of our healthcare delivery system through behavioral changes i n consumer self -care, teaching MUIH graduates to become partners in health by educating, facilitating and coaching. MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 4 The creation of this program supports goals and objectives in the University's strategic plan and 2017 -2018 strategic action plan: Strategic Plan G1.O1: Increase awarenes s, reputation and visibility of the University's academic programs, research initiatives, and clinical offerings . Strategic Plan G1.O4: Leverage and adapt current academic program offerings to reach new audiences . Strategic Plan G4.O4: Create alternative revenue streams . 2017-2018 Strategic Priority 2G: Launch new and revised academic programs for 2018-2020. The proposed program supports MUIH's strategic goal of becoming the preeminent academic institution serving the health and wellness field by taking a position at the forefront of a growing field in the healthcare industry. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 159 million Americans currently spend over one -third of their day at work, at least five days a week. Many employers are increasing their wellness offerings a nd commitment to supporting the health of their employees in order to reduce costs and improve employee productivit y, resilience, and sa tisfaction .1 This provides an opportunity and need for competent , well-trained professionals to play a vital role in the national transformation from disease -focused health care to a wellness -based model focused on prevention and education. MUIH has created this progr am in keeping with its existing strategies around e vidence-based approaches to integrative health care, with a distinctive relationship-centered philosophy. The Ayurvedic Wellness Practices program provide s additional educational and career opportunities for professionals in a variety of integrative and conventional fields, including yoga therapy; health and wellness coaching; herbal medicine; nutrition; chiropracty; midwifery; personal training, athletic training, and fitness; and health education. It also provides MUIH students and alumni with the opportunity to cross -train in multipl e integrative health fields. The program model, as with all of the disciplines at MUIH, is prevention - and education - oriented, nature -based, community -focused and relationship -centered. The program expands and complements MUIH's curricular content and diversifies career options for graduates. It will help to en hance existing programs by offering opportunities for adding to other degrees , for students, alumni, and o ther integrative and conventional health care professionals. B. Adequacy of Curriculum Design a nd Delivery to Related Learning Outcomes The educational objectives of the program are designed to give students an in -depth, working knowledge of the wellness therapies used in traditional Ayurveda.

Specialized accreditation or graduate certification requirements Not applicable. 5. Contractual agreement with other institutions MUIH utilizes a t hree-pronged approach to identifying and establishing contractual agreements with other institutions . First, the Provost's office, academic program leadership, Office of Academic Partnerships, and Office of Admissions work collaboratively to develop and maintain articulation agreements and memoranda of unders tanding with other institutions, organizations, and employers to facilitate pathways to enrollment. Second, t he Director of Academic Partnerships functions on a global level to actively identify and pursue partnerships that could lead to multiple academic placements as well as opportunities for partnership in research and curriculum . Third, using a more focused approach, each academic department actively fields external solicitations for partnership and works in collaboration with the Office of Academic Partnerships to ensure a streamlined process for formalizing placements . Once placements have been identified and vetted through MUIH's administrative and academic leadership, the placements are properly established via contractual agreements that outline the specifics of the placements. Staffing that supports these p artnerships includes: Christina Sax, Provost and Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs James Snow, Dean of Academic Affairs Alexandra York, Director of Academic Partnerships Diane Finl ayson, Pro gram Director for Yoga Therapy and Ayurveda Wellness Programs Robert Brooks, Coordinator, Career Services A sample agreement that serves as a template for partnering with other institutions can be found in Appendix B. C. Critical and Compelling Regional or Statewide Need as Identified in the State Plan 1. Demand and need for the program Health Care Health care costs, and expenditures for health care, are on the rise. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has projected that health care spending will rise from $2.9 trillion in 2013 to over $5 trillion in 2022 .8 In percentage terms, the total expenditures on 8 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , \"National Hea lth Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 9 health care are projected to rise from 17.8% of GDP in 2015 to 19.9% of GDP in 2025.9 Expenditures for preventive care, a key component of integrative health, are also increasing . The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco observed that \"spending for preventive treatment increased at an extremely rapid rate over the [2003 to 2007] period. Growth in the perc entage of enrollees getting preventive treatment ... drove half this increase. That indicates people are seeking preventive care at an increasing rate.\"10 Integrative Health A key component of a successful preventive health program is the use of complementar y and integrative therapies. Integrative and complementary health approaches include an array of modalities and products with a history of use or origins outside of conventional Western medicine. A 2013 McKinsey and Company report called the wellness indus try \"a demographic sweet spot of enormous potential\" and calculated this market as close to $16.5 billion per annum .11 Individuals often use integrative health approaches to improve health and wellbeing12 or to relieve symptoms associated with chronic disea ses or the side effects of conventional medicine .13 In the U.S., most persons who use complementary health approaches do so to complement conventional care, rather than as a replacement .14 The 2012 National Health Interview Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics demonstrated significant use and spending on integrative health care approaches.15 One-third of U.S. adults and nearly 12% 9 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \"NHE Fact Sheet ,\" Driving Medical -Care Spending Growth? \" Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 2013 . 11 P.

An estimated 59 million persons aged four years and over had at least one expenditure for some type of complementary health approach, resulting in total out -of-pocket expenditures of $30.2 billion per year. Out -of-pocket spending for complementary health approaches represented 9.2% of all out -of-pocket spending on health care . Moreover, spending on integrative medicine is expected to increase to $115 billion by the year 2015 .16 Traditional health care organization s, employers, and regulators are responding to increased consumer demand for integrative health therapies .17 In 1999, only 7.7% of hospitals offered integrative therapies. By 2004 that number had increased to 18.3%, and by 2005 25% of hospitals were offerin g services in a complementary or integrative fashion. In fact, allopathic health care providers are personally using integrative therapies at an increased rate .18 A 2010 study conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the American Association of Retired Persons indicated that 50% of Americans age 50 and older reported using complementary and alternative medicine.19 The 2007 National Home and Hospice Care Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention' s National Center for Health Statistics found that nearly 42% of hospice care providers offered complementary and alternative therapies, had a provider on staff or under contract, or both.20 The increase in integrative health approaches h as been driven in part by changes in incentive structures for health care providers under the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as the ACA or Obamacare), the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), an d the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. Briefly, these changes have resulted in awards to health care providers for reducing acute care consumption and impose penalties for inefficient, low -quality care. Integrative and allied health professions play a key r ole in delivering patient outcomes and support the shift in emphasis from acute to preventive care. Integrative health has been shown to be cost effective and yield savings in more than two dozen studies ,21 and in an analysis of research from medical litera ture, data from corporate wellness programs, and pilot projects at insurance companies .22 Indeed, to succeed in the future , health care organizations will need to shift their workforce from one that prioritize s hiring for in -patient acute care toward new value-based models.23 Professionals in those models will focus on preventive practices, the 16 Report Linker , Alternative Medicine Industry: Market Research Reports, Statistics an d Analysis. https://www.reportlinker.com/ . 17 B.

Collectively, these represent some of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S.24 MUIH's programs, including the PBC in Ayurveda Wellness Practices, prepare individuals to provide such integrative health care. Ayurveda Ayurveda serves as the basis of the oldest recorded medical system, with seminal texts dating to the height of the Vedic civilization (circa 2000BC). Ayurveda continues to be formally taught around the world through today. Ayurveda originated in India, and it is recognized as primary care today in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand where nearly 80% of the population uses it exclusively or combined with conventional (Western) medicine. The prevalence of Ayurveda in its country of origin has permeated the United States an d has caused a rise in demand, popularity, research, and professional hallmarks such as regulation and definition of the scope of practice, educational standards, dedicated journals and publications, research, state approval and the certifi cation of schools, professional associations, and advocacy efforts25. The 2002, 2007, and 2012 National Health Interview Survey26 indicate a s ubstantial and consistent use of Ayurveda by U.S. adults. 154,000 adults reported using Ayurveda in 2002, 214,000 reported as such in 2007, and 241,000 reported usage in the 2012. As one of the original holistic medical systems, Ayurveda is practiced in a very individualized manner. The system, like Traditional Chinese Medicine and Tibetan Medicine, is based on the th eory that there are several archetypal metabolic and energetic body types requiring different healthcare approaches. Treatments are prescribed according to each individual or combined type, and include a combination of diet, exercise (yoga), meditation, he rbs, massage, exposure to sun, and breathing exercises. The 2002, 2007, and 2012 National Health Interview Survey also indicated a significant and consistent use of individual such approaches that are at the heart of Ayurveda. Four such approaches were con sistently in the top five used approaches in all three years. The use of natural product supplements was consistently the most commonly used complementary approach (roughly 18% of respondents) and deep breathing exercises were consistently the second most commonly used approach (roughly 12% of respondents) in all three years. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga increased substantially, from 5.1% in 2002 to 6.1% in 2007 and 9.5% in 2012. 24 \"Health Professions: Capitalizing on Creative Disruption, \" COE Forum Industry Futures Series, Education Advisory Board, 2017 . 25 Status & Development of Ayurveda in the United States, http://www.ayurvedacollege.com/articles/drhalpern/Status_Development_Ayurveda_USA 26 National Center for Health Statistics, \"Use of Complementary Health Approaches in the US: 2012 National Health Interview Survey,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/NHIS/2012; also T.C.

MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 12 Increasing interest and use of Ayurveda is also demonstrated b y the level of commitment and rigor that modern research is adding to this ancient system through U.S. federal funding. National Institutes of Health funding has grown steadily for clinical trials to study the use of Ayurvedic herbs for a variety of clinic al disorders. Twelve trials were funded in the last five years (2013 -2017), six trials in the previous four years (2008 -2012), and just three trials in the prior ten years (1998 -2007)27. In addition, the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and Environmental Protection Agency provided more than $17 million in funding since 2005 for 61 research grants involving so me aspect of Ayurveda since28. The growth of the field is also indicated by growing engagement in the National Ayurvedic Medical Association (NAMA)29. The number of training schools registered with NAMA increased from 21 U.S. -based educational providers in 2012 to 54 in 2018 (January). In addition, the Nation al Ayurvedic Medical Association Certification Board was established in 2017 to provide training certification in three areas, reflecting the multiple professional applications of the field: Ayurvedic Health Counselor, Ayurvedic Practitioner, and Ayurvedic Doctor30. 2. Consistency with the Maryland State Plan for Post -Secondary Education The proposed program will serve the needs of the State of Maryland , consistent with the goals of the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education (Maryland Ready: The 2013- 2017 Maryland State Plan for Posts econdary Education ).31 Quality and Effectiveness Goal 1 of the 2013 -2017 Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education is to \"enhance Maryland's array of postsecondary institutions and programs, which are recognized nationally and internationally for academic excellence, and more effectively fulfill the evolving educational needs of its students, the State, and the nation.\" By offering the Ayurveda Wellness Practices program, MUIH will add to its portfolio of progra ms that position Maryland as a national leader in the healthcare industry , build on its existing expertise in a variety of integrative health fields, and further the State's goal of helping citizens expand their knowledge and supporting their personal, pro fessional, and intellectual advancement in this emerging field.

MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 13 Goal 5 of the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education is to \"stimulate economic growth, innovation, and vitality by supporting a knowledge -based economy, especially through increasing education and training and promoting the advancement and commercialization of research.\" As the State Plan observes, \" An educated workforce that can adapt to changes in the global market is a vital resource in creating and attracting new businesses and in supporting a healthy, knowledge -based economy.\" The proposed program addresses this goal by educating professionals, providing substantive, research - based curricula and an academic credential that is useful to a variety of professional positions . The proposed program is also aligned with the health and economic growth and vitality mission of Howard County, MD, in which MUIH is situated. In Howard County, \"Healthy Howard,\"32 a nonprofit organization based in Columbia, is an example of public interest and involvement in Maryland and of the varied sources of support such programs invite . Healthy Howard focuses on improved access to health care, promotion of healthy lifestyles, and care coordination including strong community partnerships. It includes a \"Healthiest Maryland Businesses\" program encouraging wellness programs and policies and providing toolkits for program implementation . Partners include the Howard County Health Department, Howard County Department of Citizen Services, Maryland Department o f Health and Mental Hygiene, Maryland Health Benefit Exchange/Maryland Health Connection, and the Horizon Foundation. MUIH regularly partners with non- profit, community , and health care related organizations in Howard County, including among others the Com munity Foundation of Howard County, Community Action Council of Howard County, Howard County Local Health Improvement Coalition, Howard County Community College, Howard County General Hospital, and the Green Farmacy. D. Quantifiable and Reliable Evidence and Documentation of Market Supply & Demand in the Region and State 1. Market Demand It is now well established that our nation's health is a social, economic, financial, and behavioral issue of enormous proportions, offering significant opportunities for economic growth and employment . The U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Bureau of L abor Statistics (BLS) see the health care and social assistance sector as leading job growth , largely due to an aging population and increased access to healthcare . BLS employment statistics for the p eriod 2004 -2014 show exceptionally strong growth in employment in the health care sector , and that sector \"is projected to grow 18 percent from 2016 to 2026 , much faster than the average for all occupations, a dding about 2.3 million new jobs ... more jobs than any other group of occupations.\"33 Maryland's Department of Labor also predicts exceptional job growth in this area, exceeding 27 percent for the decade 2014-2024.34 While this includes growth in direct medical service s such as hospital care, it is also an 32 http://www.healthyhowardmd.org/ . 33 BLS, \"Occupational Outlook Handbook,\" updated October 24, 2017, https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home.htm . 34 Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, \"Maryland Long Term Industr y Projections - 2014 - 2024 - Workforce Information and Performance,\" https://www.dllr.state.md.us/lmi/iandoproj/industry.shtml .

The growing costs associated with health care and demands on insurance and treatment systems make early intervention even more important for employers. The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics projects growth in the Ayurvedic field (as of January 2018). Its O -NET OnLine Education Crosswalk aligns the Ayurvedic Medicine/Ayurveda education program (CIP 51.3305) with the occupation Health Diagnosing and Treating Practitioners, All Other (SOC 29 -1199.00). O -NET classifies this cluster as a Bright Outlook occupation with a faster than average growth rate of 10% to 1 4% for 2016 -2026, and 3,600 projected job openings for the same time period35. Many Ayurvedic professionals are also licensed healthcare providers in other fields and Ayurvedic principles complement their primary practice36. O-NET cites the use of Ayurvedic medicine as a core task for naturopathic physicians37. O-NET classifies each of these as a Bright Outlook occupation and projects growth potential in these fields during the period 2016 -2026 (as of January, 2018): Growth Rate: Much faster than average, 15 % or higher Occupation Projected Job Openings Massage Therapist (SOC 31 -9011.00)38 21,900 Physical Therapist (SOC 29 -1123.00)39 16,800 Nurse Practitioner (SOC 29 -1171.00)40 14,400 Health Educator, Health and Wellness Coach (SOC 21 -1091.00)41 8,700 Family and General Practitioners (SOC 29 -1062.00)42 6,000 Growth Rate: Faster than average, 10% to 14% Occupation Projected Job Openings 35 https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/29 -1199.00 36 Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care, Clinicans' and Educators' Desk Reference on the Licensed Complementary and Alternative Health Professions, 2nd edition, 2013. 37 https://www.onetonline.org/link/details/29 -1199.04 PBC Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 15 Yoga Therapist, Fitness Trainer/Instructor (SOC 39 -9031.00)43 54,800 Nutritionist (SOC 29 -1031.00)44 5,300 Naturopathic Physician (SOC 29 -1199.04)45 3,600 Acupuncturist (SOC 29 -1199.01)46 3,600 Midwife (SOC 29 -9099.01)47 2,600 Chiropractor (SOC 29 -1011.00)48 1,700 The growth of Ayurveda is also indicated by growing engagement in the National Ayurvedic Medical Association ( NAMA)49. NAMA professional membership grew from 500 members in 2012 -2013 to 900 in 2016 -2017. Ayurvedic medicine emphasizes self -responsibility and attention to health and wellness. It is a truly holistic approach that promotes physical health along with the pursuit of a purposeful, meaningful life, in individualized ways. Accordingly, a number of career op portunities are available to graduates and they will be well positioned to serve as practitioners, guides, coaches, and educators in settings such as: Wellness, spa, yoga, fitness, and athletic professions. Ayurvedic herbal, food and beauty product lines. General education classes and workshops in fundamental Ayurvedic concepts in wellness programs and human resource offices. Individual and community health and wellness consulting and planning. Healthcare professional practice enhancement through a new and unique set of assessment and health promotion skills. The increasing interest in natural and holistic health, the rapid growth expected in the health care industry as a whole, and significant employer interest in workplace programs all clearly show market deman d for well-trained specialists in natural and holistic health. The cost-saving, health-improving impact that these pro fessionals can have will be increasingly important in the changing world of work and healthcare. The proposed program is being 43 https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/39 -9031.00 44 49 http://www.ayurvedanama.org; AND Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care, Clinicans' and Educators' Desk Reference on the Licensed Complementary and Alternative Healt h Professions, 2nd edition, 2013. MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 16 created at an advantageous time. It offers an opportunity not only for new entrants but for existing workers in health care and related fields to acquire an additional area of expertise. The online format means that the program can reach those workers thro ughout Maryland and the nation. 2. Educational and training needs, expected vacancies Four regionally accredited colleges and universities offer credit bearing programs in Ayurveda; none are located in Maryland. Bastyr University (WA) began offering a M.S. Ayurvedic Sciences degree in a hybrid delivery format starting in fall 2017. National University of Natural Medicine (OR) offers a M.S. Ayurveda in the face -to-face format. Maharishi University of Management (IA) offe rs a B.S. in Ayurveda Wellness degree in the face-to-face format and an M.S. in Maharishi Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine degree online. Southern California University of Health Sciences (CA) offers two undergraduate certificates, Ayurvedic Wellness Educ ator and Ayurvedic Praactitioner, on campus. There are more than 50 schools, colleges and universities, and organizations that provide non-credit Ayurveda training across the United States50. Educational standards for these non-credit training programs have been outline d and established by the World Health Organization's Benchmarks for Ayurveda51, National Ayurvedic Medical Association52, Council for Ayurveda Credentialing53, and International Association of Yoga Therapists54. In addition, the National Ayurv edic Medical Association Certification Board was established in 2017 to provide training certification in three areas, reflecting the multiple professional applications of the field: Ayurvedic Health Counselor, Ayurvedic Health Practitioner, and Ayurvedic Doctor55. While MUIH's graduate Post -Baccalaureat e Certificate is not a training program and not appropriate for such external governing at this time, the program design adheres to the general principles of these various standards. In sum , the need for graduate level study in Ayurveda is not well served in Maryland, the Mid-Atlantic region, or across the U.S. The availabilit y of a graduate credential in Ayurveda provides graduates with an additional level of professionalism, credentialing , and credibili ty that can ease the path to work in conventional medical settings, which are growing their adoption of intergrative health practices56. Students enrolling in the proposed MUIH program also have the advantage of drawing on MUIH's solid reputation in the are a of both online learning and health education. 50 http://ayurvedanama.org 51 http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/trm_benchmarks/en/ 52 http://www.ayurvedanama.org 53 http://www.cayurvedac.com/Guidelines.html 54 http://www.iayt.org 56 Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 17 3. Prospective graduates This MUIH program has differentiating factors that will support its competitiveness in this growing market: its grounding in MUIH's solid reputation and philosophy ; cost; distinctive features of the program experience such as the MUIH's hallmark focus on integrative medicine, holistic approach and healing presence ; fully online delivery format ; the understanding of Ayurveda in the context of ancient traditions and contemporary science; and the opportunity to concurrently or sequentially cross -enroll and learn in other integrative health fields . Given the upward trends in Ayurveda Wellness and in alternative and integrated healthcare in general, and enrollment history for similarly structured programs at MUIH, the following enrollment projections (based on expected completion of the program in one year call for solid growth over the first five years. PROJECTED ENROLLMENTS FOR PROGRAM* Year Trimester New Students Continuing Students Total Students Year 1 Fall 2018 5 5 Spring 2019 5 4 9 Summer 2019 8 8 Year 2 Fall 2019 10 4 14 Spring 2020 10 8 18 Summer 2020 16 16 Year 3 Fall 2020 15 8 23 Spring 2021 15 12 27 Summer 2021 24 24 Year 4 Fall 2021 15 12 27 Spring 2022 15 12 27 Summer 2022 24 24 Year 5 Fall 2022 15 12 27 Spring 2023 15 12 27 Summer 2023 24 24 MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 18 *Enrollment Assumptions: New students are admitted into the program during the fall and spring trimesters, but not during the summer trimester. Continuing students have an overall average retention rate of 80%, consistent with that of MUIH's existing programs . E. Reasonableness of Program Duplication There are no other Ayurveda or related undergraduate or graduate programs in Maryland . MUIH would be the only higher education institution in Maryland and one of only four nationally to offer credit -bearing programs in Ayurveda. Three universities located on the west coast offer graduate and undergraduate programs; one located in the mid -west offers a graduate degree. F. Relevance to Historically Black Institutions (HBIs) There are no Ayurveda programs in Maryland HBIs . The proposed program will have no potential impact on high -demand programs at the HBIs or on the uniqueness and institutional identities and missions of the HBIs . G. Evidence of Principles of Good Practice if online The proposed program will be offered online. MUIH has successfully offered fully online courses and programs since 2013, as approved by both the Maryland Higher Education Commission and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education . Thus, MUIH is well versed in supporting teaching and learning via online a nd digitally enhanced modalities , and its principles and practices align with MHEC's Principles of Good Practice for Distance Education . At MUIH, online courses are considered to be those in which 100 percent of the teaching and learning process is conduct ed at a distance, while blended courses are those in which a significant portion of face - to-face instruction is replaced by online or other means of digitally enhanced teaching and learning . Appendix C provides a full description of how this program and others at MUIH comply with the Principles of Good Practice for Distance Education. H. Adequacy of Faculty Resources Potential faculty for this proposed program have already been teaching in various MUIH degree and certificate programs , which have been developed with a highly qualified core team of program instructors. All courses are taught by faculty with a master's degree or higher with significant experience teaching similar coursework. Guest lecturers and adjunct faculty are subject to the same high standards of education and experience. As with many health professions programs where the curriculum calls for expertise across a broad spectrum of theory and practice, and consistent with the model through which MUIH delivers all its programs, the Ayurveda program will rely on a combination of core salaried faculty and the use of part -time adjunct faculty . Salaried full-time faculty will be strategically MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 19 placed to anchor the program and provide stability and continuity for students. It is vital tha t faculty have practical, general experience, as well as specialization in discrete ar eas that will allow for expert instruction, supervision, and guidance . Before beginning their first online or blended course development or teaching assignment, MUIH req uires faculty to complete the Best Practices in Online/Blended training focused on online pedagogy/andragogy, the Canvas Learning Management System ( LMS) training, Big Blue Button web conferencing training, and one -on-one consultation tailored to their individualized needs, all provided by the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL). These faculty are also provided the Quality Matters Rubric as a guiding re source and access to 24/7 support through the Canvas Help Desk. Faculty developing and teaching online and blended classes also have ongoing opportunities for professional development through various face -to-face and online webinars, workshops, trainings, and confere nces. The current MUIH budget already accounts for the needed faculty , including a mix of salaried and adjunct faculty . Criteria for faculty recruitment include : Ph.D., M.P.H., or M.S. degree in public health, health communication, human development, health psychology, or yoga therapy, Qualified to teach graduate courses, and to advise and mentor students . Faculty experience in higher education . Experience developing and teaching courses related to the field. Demonstrated commitment to continuing education and professional development. Desire to engage in activities for a new program with a strong wellnes s philosophy at its foundation. Research publication and scholarship are preferred but not required . Appendix D contains a list of re presentative faculty for the program : one third are current academic administrators with additional teaching respon sibilities, and the remaining two thirds will serve as adjunct faculty (based on enrollment -driven needs). I. Adequacy of Library Resources The University provides online support for faculty and students with an enhanced integrated and online library system, and the Library continues to expand to support all modalities of teaching and learning as well as enrollm ent growth . The Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH has a total collection of over 18,000 titles in health and wellness (13,000 physical holdings and 5,000 electronic) . Electronic resources augment the number of health and wellness materials available. The Library's computerized systems and licensing agreements with vendors permit access to open -access journals and other free Internet resources, as well as selected journal articles from individual subscriptions and from the Library's EBSCO host databases . The Library uses the National Library of Medicine's Docline service for document delivery. When the Library does not own an article, it can be obtained in a timely manner for faculty and students through the Library's use of Docline. MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 20 In 2016, the Universit y opened a Quiet Study Room associated with Sherman Cohn Library that addressed onsite students' expressed need for a place to work in silence. The Library is located in a single room and fosters an information commons environment. The Library conducts th e MUIH550 Academic Research and Scholarship non -credit course that is required of all students during their first trimester at MUIH; this course is available online to all students. The Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH has and will continue to expand to supp ort all modalities of teaching and learning, as well as mo derate enrollment growth. In FY 2014, the University added online support for faculty and students with a newly purchased and significantly enhanced integrated library system . All online courses con tain a direct link to the Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH , prominently positioned in the Canvas online classrooms. J. Adequacy of Facilities, Infrastructure, and Equipment MUIH's 12 -acre campus contains a 32,500 square -foot, two -story building, herbal medicine teaching garden, parking for all students, and ample space for additional buildings to be built in order to accommodate growth. Over 300 people can be accommodated in the current building's large event space, which totals 2,750 square feet. The current building serves as the primary home for all of MUIH's programs, and includes: Eight classrooms and a ninth, multipurpose space ; An herbal dispensary; A library; A quiet study room; A Career Center 22 clinical treatment rooms , assigned to the Student Teaching Clinic ; Space for faculty offices ; A faculty kitchen; A student lounge with an adjacent kitchen ; A bookstore/caf\u00e9 that includes seating All classrooms have access to voice and data communications and WiFi is available throughout the building. Two large, dividable classrooms are equipped with ceiling - mounted data projectors and screens, as well as an integrated sound system. A portable sound system, TV, laptops, and overhead and LCD projectors are available for use in classrooms as needed. Other space is leased in Howard County as needed, and offices for general administration of the university and faculty will continue to be located at the current campus locations . Since the program will be fully online, this physical space will not be affected except inasmuch as students may wish to use the Library, Career Center, and student spaces, and concurrently enroll in other programs offered on campus. MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 21 Those enrolled in the program will be served by the current infrastructure including admissions, financial aid, registrar, advising, student success services, disabilities suppo rt services, and career services. Students enrolled in online and blended courses have online and other remote access to these services, as well as the University -wide Orientation, Library and Program Community Sites. The Student Success Office provides individualized academic and non -academic success support to students who are either self -directed or referred by faculty. Such services include writing and scientific tutoring, study skills, academic success strategies and planning , and disabilities suppor t services. An online University Wide Orientation provides an introduction to academic resources. Each department maintains a Community Site in the Canvas LMS for all students enrolled in its programs. These sites contain learning resources that cut across the program, access to selected online course learning modules, and resources that assist students in their study and practice for national licensing exams. K. Adequacy of Financial Resources Table 1: Resources Reallocated funds During the start -up phase of the program, the university will reallocate funds from general operation to support this new program . This reallocation of funds will not have an adverse impact on existing programs since the university operates with a net surplus sufficient to reallocate the necessary funds to the new program. Additionally, the impact of this reallocation is minimal since four of the six courses in the program are existing courses. Tuition and Fee Revenue The intake assumptions for years 1 through 5 are 10, 20, 3 0, 30, and 30 new students respectively . The projected intake is conservative to reflect the lau nch of a new program and a ramp-up in the later years . The projected intake is consistent with the enrollment history for a similarly stackable certificate and Master's program in health and wellness coaching. The model also accounts for a modest level of attrition of students prior to completion of their program (overall average retention rate of 80% for all students , consistent with that of MUIH's existing programs ). Table 2: Expenditures New and/or renovated space Not applicable. Other Expenses Other expenses include faculty development, office supplies, data processing and communications, maintenance, marketing, course development costs, and building operating costs not already included in the health promotion program.

Adequacy of provisions for evaluation of program Since its establishment , MUIH has nurtured a culture of assessment and feedback . Expected student learning outcomes are clearly stated at the course and programmatic levels , and these outcomes are well designed to align with the University's m ission . For this program student learning outcomes and assessment are aligned with wide ly accepted and recognized standards in higher education, and are generally aligned with training standards outlined and established by the World Health Organization's B enchmarks for Ayurveda57, National Ayurvedic Medical Association58, MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 24 International Association of Yoga Therapists60, and National Ayurvedic Medical Association Certification Board61. While MUIH's graduate credit -bearing Post -Baccalaureate Certificate is not a training program and not appropriate for such external governing at this time, the program design nonetheless adheres to the general principles of these various standards. Learning outcomes assessment is multilevel and predominantly utilizes a 360 -degree design. Course outcome s and me asures are consistent with the specific subject matter , and the achievement of outcomes is documented from both the faculty and student perspectives. The academic departments, programs, and curriculum committees, subject matter experts (SME s), and faculty responsible for designing, delivering, and assessing learning outcomes receive support from a 360 -degree team . This team is led by the Learning Outcomes Assessment Team (LOAT), which serves as an umbrella committee to guide and facilitate academic assessment initiatives . Additional support is provided by the Assistant Provost for Academic Assessment and Accreditation, University Curriculum Committee, Insitutional Assessment Committee, Student Affairs , Alumni Affairs, Natural Care Center c linic administration, and the Provost in gathering and interpreting assessment results . The involvement of all of these groups in assessment practices demonstrates that MUIH invests necessary institutional res ources and is committed to outcomes assessment. In 2011, MUIH piloted and then adopted the IDEA Student Rating of Instruction tool as the system students would use to evaluate course s and faculty . IDEA is a nonprofit organization whose mission has been to provide assessment and feedback systems to improve learning in higher education . The IDEA tool meets the needed and desired criteria for a sustainable course evaluation system that was previously identified by the LOAT Committee . Further, the IDEA syste m is based on 26 years of research and allows the institution to compare faculty performance within similar disciplines and among over 400 other universities . In 2016, MUIH shifted its use of the IDEA tool to the Campus Labs online platfo rm, allowing for u se of this tool by students in face -to-face, blended, and online classes alike. Outcomes assessment is ongoing and based on the academic performance of students , as well as communication, collaboration, and leadership qualities and behaviors assessed in other settings . Online and blended courses are included in the university's overarching academic assessment plan. Expected student learning outcomes are clearly stated centrally and in syllabi at the course and programmatic levels, and are the same for eac h course regardless of the delivery format of each section of the course. With MUIH's master course philosophy, consistent delivery of certain content and utilization of common key assessment tools allows more precise learning outcomes assessment across va rious occurrences or sections of the online course. As part of the standard online and blended course design process at MUIH, course assessments are required to be aligned with the stated course learning outcomes, as specified by Standard 2 (Learning Objec tives/Competencies) and Standard 3 (Assessment and Measurement) of the Quality Matters Rubric . Further details on assessment and evaluation in online courses are provided in Appendix C. 60 http://ww w.iayt.org 61 https://www.namacb.org MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 25 M. Consistency with the State's minority student achievement goals MUIH seeks qualified applicants who have the maturity, commitment, and preparation necessary to take full advantage of the specialized studies offered in each of its programs of study. MUIH is committed to being, communicating, and educating in ways that recognize and honor the full range of human diversity . Each student, faculty, staff, and board member strives to use language and manifest behavior that promotes inclusiveness and cultivates a positive learning community . Further, each student and faculty, staff, and board member is responsible for creating an atmosphere that supports all in growth and movement toward inclusiveness and the appreciation of diversity. MUIH is committed to broadening the diversity of student body, staff, administration, and bo ard members. MUIH is an equal opportunity institution. Applicants for admission, employment, and financial aid are considered based on individual merit. No person is excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subject to discrimination in any program or activity of MUIH on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, age, religion, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law. MUIH does not specifically recruit or advertise to any race, color, national or ethnic origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, age, religion, or disability group ; however, we find that the nature of our programs draws students from all races and backg rounds and countries. N. Relationship to low productivity progra ms identified by the Commission Not applicable.

MUIH faculty have Master's, doctoral, or professional degrees and academic, clinical, or practical expertise in the c ontent areas of the courses they are assigned to teach . Online and blended programs are established and overseen through a collaborative process that includes such qualified faculty . Each program is led by an Academic Director or Program Director, who is also a faculty member . Larger programs include faculty positions such as Director of Academic Development and Division Chair, who lead particular academic aspects of their program s. Curriculum committees composed of faculty members exist in each academic d epartment to oversee courses and programs, including those that involve online and blended delivery methods . A comprehensive program review of each program in the University is conducted every five years, involving program faculty and using internal and external experts. The University Curriculum Committee, which includes representation from the Faculty Senate, provides integrated and institutional oversight of courses and programs, including online or blended offerings . (ii) A program's curriculum shal l be coherent, cohesive, and comparable in academic rigor to programs offered in traditional instructional formats . MUIH's curricula, regardless of delivery format, are designed in consultation with experts in the field, MUIH's qualified faculty, and ext ernal environmental scanning and workforce needs analyses to ensure coherence, cohesiveness, and academic rigor. The curriculum, learning outcomes, and academic expectations of faculty and students of a program, regardless of the delivery format, are the s ame and are overseen and approved by the same program faculty and curriculum committees . They are also overseen by the same University bodies including the University Curriculum Committee, Faculty Senate, Executive Management Committee, and the Board of Tr ustees . (iii) A program shall result in learning outcomes appropriate to the rigor and breadth of the program . Program learning outcomes are developed based on input from MUIH's qualified faculty and academic leaders, consultation with expert professionals in the field, and external environmental scanning and workforce needs analyses. The academic rigor and expectations of programs, regardless of their delivery format, are aligned with the nationally recognized standards specified by the Counci l of Graduate Schools and the Lumina Foundation's Degree Qualification Profile (DQP). The content, learning outcomes, rigor, depth, and breadth of programs, regardless of their delivery format , are also aligned with external program -specific accrediting an d curriculum -guiding bodies, where available. These include the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), Council of Chief Academic MHEC Proposal 2018 MUIH PBC in Ayurvedic Wellness Practices Online 39 and Clinical Officers of the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC), Accreditation Commissi on for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM), Accreditation Council for Nutrition Professional Education (ACNPE), Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists (BCNS), International Coach Federation (ICF), National Consortium for Credentialing Healt h and Wellness Coaches (NCCHWC), Certified Health Education Specialist (CHES) examination of the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing (NCHEC), and International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT).
