I see some people endlessly searching for their place in life and I feel very lucky that most days I am excited and stoked to start the day! Well, to be honest, I do not like bookkeeping or (on the rare occasion) letting people go, but other than that, I love my work! My greatest joy is to help raise the level of your knowledge so that you can help your dogs be healthier and have longer lives. In addition, knowledge is the ammunition that protects your dog from unnecessary vaccines, procedures and drugs. The other day, I saw an ad in a local newspaper where a veterinary clinic advertised the need for three sets of vaccines for puppies - THREE SETS! The ad also contained serious fear-mongering that there are many serious diseases that could be transferred from dogs to people, which is not true. The most common diseases (such as parvovirus, distemper, and kennel cough) are specific to canines, and others like Lyme disease and leptospirosis are not directly transmissible from dogs to people. I guess [rabies](https://peterdobias.com/blogs/blog/11015033-rabies-vaccine-holistic-approach) could be a threat; however, there were only [23 cases reported in the US from 2008 and 2017](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/human_rabies.html) and most of the exposures occurred outside of the US and Canada. Seeing this ad prompted me to repost the article on a [holistic approach to vaccination of adult dogs and puppies](https://peterdobias.com/blogs/blog/safer-vaccination-in-adult-dogs-and-puppies). To date, this protocol has not failed. Moreover, it dramatically reduces exposure to unnecessary vaccines and [heavy metals](https://peterdobias.com/blogs/blog/does-your-dog-s-food-contain-mercury-and-arsenic). Most people are still unaware that vaccines that are administered too early (between eight to twelve weeks) are a serious problem for the following reasons: - They do not trigger the production of antibodies because the immune system is too immature. - They destroy the maternal antibodies (protection) thus leaving your dog less protected! - Boosters have proven to be unnecessary, as most dogs remain protected after only one vaccination. I dare to say that heavy, booster vaccination schemes are either caused by an ignorance of basic immunology or financial motivation rather than a concern for your dog's needs! For more information on the topic of vaccination check out our Facebook Live linked below! As you can see I feel strongly about unnecessary vaccines and I am also disturbed by drug companies pushing anti-parasitic drugs. Another topic that particularly worries me is that a large majority of dog lovers still feed kibble even though they love their dogs very much. Recently, we have done an analysis of submissions and requests from our [Healthy Dog Tool](https://peterdobias.com/pages/healthydogtool) and the interesting part was that a large majority of dogs with health issues ate kibble. If you have still not tried [The Healthy Dog Tool](https://peterdobias.com/pages/healthydogtool), you can do so here: Looking at the challenges dog lovers reported in the [Healthy Dog Tool](https://peterdobias.com/pages/healthydogtool), I realized that we need to focus on providing more info on feeding natural food. In twenty plus years of recommending real food for dogs, my clients' vet care bills have dropped dramatically thus freeing up money that could be used on holidays or fun instead! Spending a little more on food will lead to a healthier, happier and (in most dogs) longer lives but only if you know how to make such food balanced! If you are still on the fence whether to feed a natural, [raw or cooked diet](https://peterdobias.com/pages/course-rawdiet) or you think you are too busy to prepare it, keep in mind that it takes only 10 extra minutes to prepare a meal of raw or cooked food. You can keep it in the fridge for two extra days, plus most dogs do just fine with one meal a day. In fact, dogs benefit from a 24-hour mini-fast as their bodies get a chance to cleanse. Here is our course on raw and cooked diet feeding. "}
