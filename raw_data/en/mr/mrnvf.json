Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS , and Donald J. Trump, as President of the United States appeared through their counsel, Ethan Davis , Eric Soskin , and Kuntal Cholera . Additionally, papers submitted b y numerous amici curiae were before the court. Prior to the hearing, the court granted motions to file amicus briefs on behalf of the following non-parties, all of which the court considered in its analysis: American Public Health Association, et al.; As ian Americans Advancing Justice, et al.; City of Los Angeles, et al.; Justice in Aging, et al.; and Members of Congress. A number of other reque sts to file amici briefs were denied due to the court's insufficient time to consider them on this particular m otion, given the already -voluminous filings from the parties, the briefing schedule, and the time -sensitive nature of plaintiffs' request for pre liminary relief.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 1883, Emma Lazarus penned the now-famous sonnet, The New Colossus. Later affixed to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, the poem has been incorporated into the national consciousness as a representation of the country's promise to would-be immigrants: Not like the brazen gi ant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea -washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon -hand Glows world -wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air -bridged harbor that twin cities frame. \"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" cries she With silent li ps. \"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your t eeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest -tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\" But whether one would prefer to see America 's borders opened wide and welcoming , or closed because the nation is full, laws\u2014not poetry \u2014govern who may enter . And the year before Lazarus wrote The New Colossus, Congress had enacted its first comprehensive immigration law, barring entry to \" any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge ,\" among others. An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376 \u00a7 2. ( 1882). Although various iterations of similar laws have since come and gone (the operative statute no longer refers to \"lunatics\" or \"idiots\"), since the very first immigration la w in 1882, this country has consistently excluded those who are likely to be come a \"public charge .\" 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 4 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California Although Congress has never authored an explicit definition of the term, courts and the executive branch have been considering its meaning as used in the statute for over one hundred and twenty years . As interpretations from th ose two branches accreted toward a consistent understanding, Congress repeatedly enacted statutes adopting the identical phrase . In 1999, the executive branch reviewed its historical a pplication of the term and issued formal guidance to executive employees , explaining that the public charge determination has historically, and should continue to , focus on whether an individual is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence . In 2018, DHS published a new rule (scheduled to take effect October 15, 2019) that proposed to dramatically expand the definition of \"public charge .\" Rather than include only those who primarily depend on the government for subsistence, DHS now proposes for the first time to categorize as a public charge e very person who receives 12 months of public benefits (including many in -kind benefits, like Medicaid and SNAP/Food Stamps) over any 36 -month period, regardless of how valuable those benefits are, or how muc h they cost the government to provide (receiving two types of benefits in one month would count as receiving benefits for two months). Today, the court is presented with a challenge to DHS's new definition . The plaintiffs seek to prevent defendants from implementing it before this court can consider this case on the merits . The plaintiffs argue that the new definition will lead to widespread disenrollment1 from public benefits by those who fear being labeled a p ublic charge (and by those confused that t hey may be swept up in the rule) , which will cause plaintiffs to lose a substantial amount funding ( for example, the federal government heavily subsidizes state expenses for those enrolled in Medicaid). The court f inds that the plaintiffs are likely to pre vail on the merits , for numerous 1 When plaintiffs refer to ha rms caused by those who will disenroll from public ben efits in addition to those who will forego enrollment.

DH S's new definition of \"public charge\" is likely to be outside the bounds of a reasonable interpretation of the statute. Moreover, plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their entirely independent arguments that defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously during the legally-required process to implement the changes they propose. Because plaintiffs are likely to prevail and will be irreparably harmed if defendants are permitted to implement the rule as planned on October 15, this court will enjoin implementation of the rule in the plaintiff states until this case is resolved on the merits, as discussed in more detail below. BACKGROUND In each of the actions before the court, the plaintiffs challenge and seek to preliminarily enjoin implementation of a proposed rule entitled \"Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, \" proposed by DHS and published in the Federal Register on August 14, 2019. See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (August 14, 2019) (\"the Rule\") . The Rule is scheduled to take effect nationwide on October 15, 2019. A. The Three Actions In City and County of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Case No. 19-cv- 04717 -PJH, San Francisco and Santa Clara (toget her, the \"Counties\") filed a complaint naming as defendants USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS. The complaint asserts two causes of action under the Administrative Procedure Act (\" APA\"): (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)\u2014Not in Accordance with Law; and (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)\u2014Arbitrary, Capricious, and Abuse of Discretion. The Counties filed the present motion for preliminary injunction on August 28, 2019. In State of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Case No. 19-cv- 04975-PJH, the States filed a complaint naming the same defendants as the Counties: USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS. The complaint asserts six causes of action: (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\u2014Contrary to Law, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Illegal Immigration 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 6 of 93 Reform a nd Immigrant Responsibility Act; (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\u2014Contrary to Law, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (the \"Rehabilitation Act\"); (3) Violation of U.S.C. \u00a7 706\u2014Contrary to Law, State Healthcare Discretion; (4) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\u2014 Arbitrary and Capricious; (5) Violation of the Fi fth Amendment's Due Process clause requiring Equal Protection based on race; (6) Violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process clause, based on a violation of Equal Protection principles based on unconstitutional animus. The States filed the present motion for preliminary injunction on August 26, 2019. On August 27, 2019, this court ordered the action brought by the States related to the action brought by the Counties. In La Clinica De La Raza v. Trump, Case No. 19-cv- 04980-PJH, the Organizations filed a complaint naming the same defendants as the Counties, and also added Donald J. Trump: USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS; and Donald J. Trump, as President of the United States. The complaint asserts four causes of action: (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\u2014Contrary to the Statutory Scheme; (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\u2014Arbitrary, Capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (3) Violation of the Fifth Amendment based on Equal Protection for discriminating against non-white immigrants; (4) under the Declaratory Judgment Act, seeking a determination that the Rule is invalid because it was issued by an unlawfully-appointed agency director. On August 30, 2019, this court ordered the action brought by the Organizations related to the action brought by the Counties. The Organizations filed the present motion for preliminary injunction on September 4, 2019. B. The Dispute The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101, et seq. (\"INA \"), requires that all noncitizens seeking to be lawfully admitted into the United States or to become lawful permanent residents (\" LPRs\") prove they are not inadmissible. deemed inadmissible on any number of grounds, 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 7 of 93 including that they are \" likely at any time to become a public charge .\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4)(A). The specific INA provision relating to whether an alien is likely to become a \"public charge\" at issue in this litigation provid es, in relevant part: Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, aliens who are inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States: . . . . (4) Public charge (A) In gener al Any alien wh o, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible. (B) Factors to be taken into account (i) In determining whether an alien is inadmissible under this paragraph, the consular officer or the Attorney General shall at a minimum consider the alien's \u2014 (I) age; (II) health; (III) family status; (IV) assets, res ources , and financial status; and (V) education and skills. (ii) In addition to the factors under clause (i), the consular officer or the Attorney General may also consider any affidavit of support under section 1183a[2] of this title for purposes of excl usion under this paragraph. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4). directs a \"consular officer\" or \"the Attorney General\" to form an opinion as to whether the applicant \"is likely at any time to become a public charge.\" Id. In 2 Section 1183a is titled \" Requirements for sponsor's affida vit of support \" and sets forth the requirements of an \"affidavit of support . . . to establish that an alien is not exc ludable as a public charge under section 1182(a)(4) of this title [.]\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1183a(a)(1). 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 8 of 93 forming that o pinion, immigrat ion of ficers must consider \"at a minimum\" five statutorily - defined factors: (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) assets, resources, and financial status; (5) education and skills. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). An officer may addit ionally consider an af fidavit of support, which is a legally - enforceable contract between the sponsor of the applicant and the Federal Government. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1183a(a). The sponsor pledges to accept financial responsibili ty for the appli cant a nd to maintain the applicant at an income of \"not less than 125 percent of the Federal poverty line during the period in which the affidavit is enforceable [.]\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1183a(a)(1)(A). Certain groups as asylu m seekers and refu gees, are not subject to exclusion based on an assessment that they are likely to become a public charge . See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157 (refugee) U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c) (refugee) An alien found to be inadmissible as a publi c charge may \"be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General . . . upon the giving of a suitable and proper bond or undertaking approved by the Attorney General, in such amount and containing such conditions as he may prescribe . . . holding the Uni ted States and al l States . . . harmless against such alien becoming a public charge.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1183. The public charge ground may arise when , inter alia, an alien seeks LPR status , or when noncitizens for \u00a7 1182(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 55(a). Aliens \" to whom a permit to enter the United States has been issued to enter the Un ited States \" are also subject to an inadmissibility determination by DHS at ports of entry when they enter and re -enter the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185(d). Immigrants with LPR status may also be subject to the public charge analysis. For example, an LPR is considered to be \"seeking admission\" under various circumstances, for example when returning to the United States after being \"absent from the United States for a continuous period in excess of 180 days\" or after engaging in any \"illegal activity a fter having departed the United States [.]\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)( C)(ii)-(iii). 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 9 of 93 LPRs can also be denied citizenship and/or placed in removal proceedings if DHS determines retrospectively that they were inadmissible as a public charge at the time of their adjustment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A); 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,328 & n.176 (discussing possible impact on naturalizations) . Under a separate provision in the INA , an alien can be deported upon a determination that he has in fact become a public charge since his admission, from causes \"not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry[.]\" 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(5).3 On October 10, 2018, DHS began the rule -making process to create a new framework for the public charge assessment by publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51 ,114 (Oct. 10, 2018) (the notice of proposed rulemaking is the \"NPRM\"). The NPRM provided a 60- day public comment period, during which 266,077 comments were collected. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297. On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Rule in the Federal Register. Id. at 41,292. It is set to become effective on October 15, 2019. On October 2, 2019 \u2014the morning of the hearing on the pending motions for preliminary injunction \u2014 DHS pu blished a 25-page list of \" correction s\" to the proposed final rule.4 See Case No. 19-cv-04717 -PJH, Dkt. 106 , Ex. A . DHS stated that its October 2 amendment s to the rule would not delay its planned implementation on October 15. The Rule sets out what the parties have referred to as the \"12/36 standard.\" That is, the Rule \"redefines the term 'public charge' to mean an alien who receives one or more designated public ben efits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36 - 3 Confusingly, DHS's Rule would use comple tely distinct definitions for the term \"public charge\" when assessing whether an alien \" has become a public charge \" (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(5) ) and whether an alien \" is likely at any time to become a public charge \" (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(A). 4 Although defendants described the changes as fixes to \" technical and typog raphical errors \" (Case No. 19-cv-04717 -PJH, Dkt. 106, Ex. A at 2) , the States argued at the hearing that upon their limited review of the corrections (a review that was necessarily limited given the ele venth -hour disclosure of DHS's changes to the rule), t he amendments mooted at least one issue underlying the States' mo tion, regarding treatment of military families. 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 10 of 93 month period (such that, fo r instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months). This Rule defines the term 'public benefit' to include cash benefits for income main tenance, SN AP, most forms of Medicaid, Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Vouche r (HCV) Program, Section 8 Project -Based Rental Assistance, and certain other forms of subsidized housing.\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295. Because the INS directs immigration officers to opine as to whether an alien \" is likely at any time to become a public char ge,\" the Rule's new definition requires immigration officers to opine as to whether an alien is likely to receive certain public benefits for more th an 12 months in the aggregate within any future 36 -month period to determine whether he is likely to become a public charge. The rule sets out a number of positive, negative, heavily -weighted, and normally -weighted factors to assist in making that determi nation, and those f actors are considered as part of a \"totality of the circumstances\" assess ment of whether an alien is likely to use more than 12 months' worth of benefits in any future 36 -month period . DISCUSSION A. Legal Standard Federal Rule of Civil P rocedure 65 provide s federal courts with the authority to issue preliminary injunctions . Fed. R. Civ. P. 6 5(a). Generally, the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo and the rights of the parties until a final judgment on the m erits can be render ed. See U.S. Philips Corp. v. KBC Bank N.V. , 590 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010) . An in junction is a matter of equitable discretion and is \"an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is enti tled to such relief .\" Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008); see Munaf v. Geren , 553 U.S. 674, 689 -90 (2008). A preliminary injunction \"should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of per suasion.\" Mazurek v. Armstrong , 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam). \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that [1] he is likely to 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 11 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California succeed on the merits, that [2] he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of prelimi nary relief, that [ 3] the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that [4] an injunction is in the publi c interest.\" Winter , 555 U.S. at 20. Alternatively, \"'serious questions going to the merits' and a hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other two elements of the Winter test are also m et.\" All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cot trell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th Cir. 2011). \"That is, 'serious questions going to the merits' and a balance of hardships that tip s sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, so lon g as the plaintiff also shows that the re is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.\" Id. at 1135; see also Disney Enterpr ises, Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc. , 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017). If a plaintiff satisfie s its burden to demonstrate that a pre liminary injunction should issue, \"injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide compl ete relief to the plaintiffs.\" Califano v. Yamasaki , 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979). Separate ly, the APA permits this court to \"postpone the effective date of action . . . pending judicial review. \" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705 ; Bakersfield City Sch. Dist. of Kern Cty. v. Boyer, 610 F.2d 621, 624 (9th Cir. 1979) (\"The agency or the court may postpone or stay agency action pending such judicial rev iew.\") (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705 ). Any such postponement must be made \"[o] n such conditions as may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury [.]\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705 . The factors considered when issuing such a stay substantially overlap with the Winter factors for a preliminary injunction. See, e.g. , Bauer v. DeVos , 325 F. Supp. 3d 74, 104 -07 (D.D.C. 2018). B. Analysis In considering plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction, the court consid ers the Winter factors (and the alternative All. for the Wild Rockies ) factors in turn. First, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims , or alternatively whether they have demonstrat ed ser ious questions 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 12 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California going to the merits. Because a plaintiff must be within a statute's \"zone of interest\" to succeed on an APA challenge based on the underlying statute, the court considers whether each plaintiff is within the relevant statute's zone of interests when assessing its likelihood of success on the merits. Second, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief. Because plaintiffs' alleged irreparable harms are also their alleged bases for standing, the court considers whether each plaintiff has standing to bring a ripe claim when assessing its irreparable harms. Third, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated that the balance of equities tip in their favor, and whether the balance of hardships tip sharply in their favor. Fourth, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated that an injunction is in the public interest. Fifth, the court addresses the scope of injunctive relief necessary and capable of providing complete relief to the harms plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to suffer prior to a determination on the merits, absent such relief. 1. The State and County Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits and Have Raised Serious Questions Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed on three of their causes of action, each alleging a violation of the APA: (1) that the Rule violates the APA because it is not in accordance with the term \"public charge\" a s used in the INA; (2) that the Rule violates the APA because it is not in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 504; and (3) that the Rule violates the APA because it is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. 5 Under the APA, \"the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or 5 Although some of the arguments supporting these claims are likely to overlap with other claims plaintiffs assert, plaintiffs have made clear that they are not moving for a preliminarily injunction based on any other claim, including, inter alia, the claim that the Rule violates the APA because it is contrary to laws giving the States discret ion with respect to the provision of healthcare, the c laim under the declaratory judgment act that Cuccinelli was unlawfully appointed, or any of the asserted Constitutional claims. 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 13 of 93 applicability of the terms of an agenc y action.

' If so, 'that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.

(drawing a distinction between delegation of authority to carry out the act generally, and authority to execute the functio ns assigned to the agency). First, the court assesses whether plaintiffs are likely to s ucceed on their claims under the APA that the Rule is not in accordance with law, as provided in 8 U.S. C. \u00a71182(a)(4). Second , the court assesses whether plaintiffs a re likely to succeed on their claims under the APA that the Rule is not in accordance with law, as provided in the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 504. Third , the court assess whether plaintiffs are likel y to succeed on their claims under the APA, that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious. Fourth, the court assesses whether each plaintiff is within the relevant zone of interests, which is required to succeed on an APA claim . a. Not in Accordance with Law \u20148 U.S. Code \u00a71182 (a)(4) Plaintiffs argue that the Rule is not in accordance with the definitio n of \"public charge\" as used in 8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1182(a)(4) for three reasons: (1) DHS's interpretation should not be accorded any deference, and the Rule's defini tion is inconsistent with the statute; (2) even if the term is accorded deference, the term pla inly and unambiguously means \"primarily dependent on the government for subsistence ,\" and the Rule conflicts with that definition; and (3) the Rule's definition of \"public charge\" is not reasonable or based on a permissible construction of the statute. The court did not understand p laintiffs to have raise d the first argument in their moving papers , although the Counties may have raised it obliquely in their reply . But the court and defendants were surprised to learn at the hearing that plaintif fs were advancing an argument that DHS 's promulgation of the Rule was wholly outside of Congressionally - delegated authority .

Counties' Reply at 8 -9 (\"Counties do not co ntest DHS's authority to issue rational regulations governing the case -by-case appl ication of the 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 15 of 93 statutory standard, so long as they do not misconstrue the term 'public charge. '\"); States' Reply at 9 -10 (\"the States have never disputed the commonsense poi nt that Congress in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4)(A) assigned responsibility to Defendants to make individual public charge determinations \"); Organizations' Reply at 9 (\" even if Defendants were correct, Congress could delegate to DHS the power only to adopt reason able interpretations of the statute \"). Nevertheless, plaintiffs have not sufficiently supported , or even explained, their argument to satisfy their burden to show likelihood of success on the merits based on it. 6 Accordingly , the court analyzes the Rule pursuant to the framework set out by Chevron . The second and third argume nts concern a challenge under Chevron 's framework to the meaning of \"public charge\" as used in \u00a71182(a)(4) . Plaintiffs' second argument requires the court to determine whether the Rule contravenes the statute's unambiguous meaning, and their t hird argument requires the court to determine whether defendants' chosen definition is reasonable and based on a permissible construction of the statute. Both questions require a discussion of the long usage of the term by Congress, as well as the expansiv e evaluation of the term by courts and executive agencies. As preface to that discussion, a brief outline helps set the stage. The phrase \"public charge\" was used in this count ry's first-ever general immigration statute in 1882. The immigration statute s have been interpreted and modified many time since then , and although many other excluded categories of persons came and went, with each modification through today the phrase \"public charge\" remained intact . As a result, the meaning that the persistent term had when first used is relevant to understanding the meaning Congress ascribed to it with each subsequent statut ory revision , including the now-operative statute , which most recently saw changes to the relevant provisions in 1990 and 1996. 6 However, the court notes that whether DHS's promulgation of the Rule fal ls within the rulemaking authority delegated to it by Congress may benefit from more attention in the parties' future briefing on the merits. See generally 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a) . 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 16 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California Ultimatel y, this dispute concerns the meaning of a statutory term passed in 1990 \u2014 with clarifying language passed in 1996. As such, the court considers the meaning ascribed to the term by Congress at that time, but in doing so it must afford due consideration to Congress's understanding of the term given the long historical context it was operating within, which the court presently endeavors to describe. See Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239-40 (2009) (\"Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re- enacts a statute without change.\") ( quoting Lorillard v.

See An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 Stat. 214 (1882) (the \"1882 Act\"). That statute provided, in part: 16 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 17 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California That the Secretary of the Treasury . . . shall have power to . . . provide for the support and relief of such immigrants therein landing as may fall into distress or need public aid . . . and it shall be the duty of such State . . . to examine into the condition of passengers arriving at the ports . . . and if on such examination there shall be found among such passengers any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge . . . s uch persons shall not be permitted to land. 22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376 \u00a7 2. Legislative debate on the 1882 Act shows that at least one member of Congress sought to prevent foreign nations from \"'send[ing] to this countr y blind, crippled, lunatic, and other infirm paupers, who ultimately become life-long dependents on our public charities.'\" 13 Cong. Rec. 5108 -10 (June 19, 1882) (statement of Rep. Van Voorhis). The 1882 Act also imposed on each noncitizen who entered the United States a 50-cent head tax for the purpose of creating an \"immigrant fund\": That there shall be levied, collected, and paid a duty of fifty cents for each and every passenger not a citizen of the United States who shall come by steam or sail vessel from a foreign port to any port within the United States. . . . The money thus collected shall . . . constitute a fund to be called the immigrant fund, and shall be used . . . to defray the expense of regulating immigration under this act, and for the car e of immigrants arriving in the United States, for the relief of such as ar e in distress[.] 22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376, \u00a7 1 ; see also Edye v. Robertson , 112 U.S. 580, 590 -91 (1884) (\"This act of congress is similar, in its essential features, to many statutes enacted by states of the Union for the protection of their own citizens, and for the good of the immigrants who land at sea -ports within their borders. That the purpose of these statutes is humane, is highly benefi cial to the poor and helpless immigrant, and is essential to the protection of the people in whose midst they are deposited by the steam -ships, is beyond dispute.\"). Nineteenth -century dictionaries defined \"charge\" as \"That which is enjoined, committed, en trusted or delivered to another, implying care, custody, oversight, or duty to be performed by the person entrusted\" and \"The person or thing committed to anothers 17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 18 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California [sic] custody, care or management; a trust. Thus the people of a parish are called the ministers charge.\" Charge, Webster's Dictionary (1828 Online Edition), or thing committed or intrusted [sic] to the care, custody, or management of another; a trust; as, to abandon a charge \").7 Another contemporary source defines charge \"In its general sense, a charge is an obligation or liability. Th us we speak of . . . a pauper being chargeable to the town.\" Stewart; Lawrence Rapalje, Robert L., Dictiona ry of American and English La w, with Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws (1888), at 196. Prior to the 1882 Act's enactment, states had played a larger role in immigration than they do today, and state governments had used and i nterpreted the term \"public charge ,\" although of course not in relation to any Congressional act. For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court, when interpreting a statute concerning the procedures to remove an individual from a township in New Jersey, consider ed whether a pauper was \"eith er chargeable, or likely to become chargeable, to the township of Princeton.\" Overseers of Princeton Twp. v. Overseers of S. Brunswick Twp. , 23 N.J.L. 169, 170 (Sup. Ct. 1851). Although the case does not make clear what preci se relief is necessary to qua lify as a public charge, it contemplate d that one became a public charge upon seeking such relief from \"the church wardens or overseers of the poor[.]\" Id. at 17 3. The concurrence clarifie d that an \"application for relief\" is distinct from being \"chargea ble,\" although \"[t]he probability of his becoming chargeable is sufficiently shown by his application for relief.\" Id. at 179 (Carpenter, J. concurring). Th e case does 7 Defendants cite Frederic Jesup Stim son, Glossary of Technical Terms, Phrases, and Maxims of the Common Law (1881), but that source does not provide a relevant definition. The first -listed definition is the most plausibly -relevant: \"A burden, incumbrance, or lien; as when land is charged w ith a debt.\" Id. at 56. But that definit ion concerns how the word charge relates to real prope rty, which makes sense because at the time, \"[m]ore frequently, however, charge is applied to property\" as \"a general term[.]\" Stewart ; Lawrence Rapalje, Rober t L., Dictionary of American and English L aw, with Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Can on and Civil Laws (1888), at 196. 18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 19 of 93 not explain the type or quantum of relief necessary to co nstitute one's status as a \"charge.\" Another state court opinion, People ex rel. Durfee v. Commissioners of Emigration , 27 Barb. WL 7084 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1858) , addressed a statute which contemplated bonds being paid on behalf of immigrants, and re quired the commission ers of immigration who held those bonds to \"indemnify so far as may be the several cities, towns and counties of the state, for any expense or charge which may be incurred for the maintenance and support of the\" immigrants. 27 Barb. at 570 . The court held that the statute required indemnification of all expenses made on behalf of the immigrants \u2014 whether temporary or permanent \u2014so long as the expenses were lawfully made. Id. However, the case did not draw a clean line holding that any expense spe nt on an individual makes him a public charge . Rather, an equally -plausible reading of the opinion is that the statute requires immunity of all expenses paid to support immigrants for whom bonds have been paid, regardless of whether they are fo rmally cons idered public charges.8 City of Bos. v. Capen , 61 Mass. 116, 121 (1851) concerned a statute which required a bond for someone likely to be come a public charge. The court explained that the statute describe d various categories of people identifi ed as being at risk of becoming a public charge, and for whom bond may be required. However, what assistance or payment qualified one as a \"public charge\" was not addressed.9 As a whole, t he statutory language and authority underlying the 1882 Act provi de 8 The latter reading would be in accordance with the current interpretation of \"public charge\" as used elsewhere in the INA, w hich requires an alien to be presented wit h a bill and prove unable or unwilling to pay it to be deemed a public charge. E.g., Matter of B -, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323 ( A.G. 1948) ; Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999) ; 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295. 9 The opinion also suggested that thos e who were \"paupers in a foreign land\" mu st have been \"a public charge in another country,\" and then stated without explanation that \"the word 'paupers' being used in this connection in its legal, technical sense.\" Capen , 61 Mass. at 121. Even looking pa st the confusion, the court might be inte rpreted as finding that all paupers have been public ch arges, but from that the conclusion cannot be drawn that all public charges must have been paupers. 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 20 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California some clear guidance as to the definition of public charge. For example, the 1882 Act contemplated that admitted aliens (not excluded on public charge grounds) would receive some assistance from the state. That is made clear by the same statute's estab lishment of a fund \"for the care of immigrants arriving in the United States, for the relief of such as are in distress[.]\" 22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376, \u00a7 1 . Although the quantum of state support necessary to rende r one a public charge is less clear, t he 1882 Act did not consider an alien a public charge for simply receiving some assistance from the state. Also, it appears that contemporary uses of the term would deem one a public charge after taking on a particula r, chargeable debt from the state and failing to repay it . 2. 1891 In 1891, Congress amended the 1882 Act. That amended statute provided, in part: That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States . . . : All i diots , insane persons, paupers or persons likely to become a public charge, persons suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease, persons who have been convicted of a felony or other infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, polyg amists, and . . . . An Act in Amendment to the Various Acts Relative to Immigration and the Importation of Aliens Under Contract or Agre ement to Perform Labor , 26 Stat. 1084, Chap. 551 (\"1891 Act\") \u00a7 1 (1891). The 1891 amendment also provided that \"an y alien who becomes a public charge within one year after his arrival in the United States from causes existing prior to his landing therein shall be deemed to have come in violation of law and shall be returned\" pursuant to the procedures outline in the s tatute regarding aliens entering unlawfully. 1891 Act \u00a7 11. So, the 1891 Act set out the now -familiar practice of subjecting aliens to two \"public charge \" assessments \u2014one in which the government is called on to make a forward -looking prediction, and anot her in which the government is called on to make a backward -looking assessment. The first asks at the time of entry whether the alien is likely to become a public charge. The second asks whether, after some period of time, 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 21 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California the alien has in fact become a publi c charge due to causes existing before he arrived. Although the relevant time periods of the assessments have grown, this scheme generally remains in place today. The 1891 Act made a notable change to the law by adding the category \"pauper,\" and including the term pauper with \"persons likely to become a public charge\" to form a single entry in an expanded list of excluded categories of people. An early case interpre ting th e act considered whether \"the act of 1891 confers upon the inspection officer power to detain a nd send back an alien immigrant as being a person liable to become a public charge, in the absence of any evidence whatever tending to establish that fact.\" In re Feinknopf , 47 F. 447, 448 (E.D.N.Y. 1891). Although it did not define the term \" public char ge\" in the abstract , the court provided an explanation given the facts before it that essentially laid out a totality -of-the-circumstances test . It held that \"[o ]f course\" the following facts, \"if believed, would not warrant the conclusion that the petiti oner was a person likely to become a public charge,\" and that the case is \"devoid of any evidence whatever of any fact upon which to base a determination that the petitioner is likely to become a public charge\": the petitioner is 40 years old; that he is a native of Austria; that he is a cabinet -maker by trade, and has exercised that trade for 25 years; that he has no family; that he has baggage with him, worth $2 0, and 50 cents in cash; that he is a man who can find employment in his trade, and is willing to exercise the same. . . . [I]n addition, that the immigrant has not been an inmate of an almshouse, and has not received public aid or support, and has not be en convicted of crime . Id. at 447-48. A fair reading suggests that each of the enumerated fa cts could be relevant to predicting whether someone is likely to become a public charge. A subsequent court provided even more guidance. In United States v. Lipk is, 56 F. 427 (S.D.N.Y. 1893), a man had arrived in America before his wife and child. The wi fe and child were required to pay a bond because the superintendent of immigration deemed them \"likely to become a public charge\" based on \"the poverty and charac ter of the husband,\" whose residence gave the appearance of \"extreme poverty.\" Id. at 427. 21 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 22 of 93 However, that poverty alone did not mean he or the family was a public charge \u2014rather, it meant the family was likely to become a public charge. \"About six months after the arrival of the mother she became insane, and was sent to the public insane asylum of the city under the direction of the commissioners of charities and correction, where only poor persons unable to pay for treatment are received, and she was ther e attended to for a considerable period at the expense of the municipality.\" Id. at 428. Thu s, the mother became a public charge only when she was committed to the public insane asylum with \"no effort to provide for her at his [the husband's] own expense [.]\" Id. But the court did not require commitment to an institution to make on e a public charge. It reasoned in dicta that the family's financial condition generally subjected the family to the risk of becoming \"a public charge under the ordinary liabilities to sickness, or as soon as any other additional charges arose beyond the barest needs o f existence. . . . The liability of his family to become a public charge through any of the ordinary contingencies of life existed when the bond was taken, because of his poverty and inefficiency.\" Id. So, a number of different financial shocks could have rendere d the family a public charge. The court's analysis drew a distinct ion between being a public charge (in this case, someone committed to an insane asylum with no effort to cover the expense ), and someone likely to become a public charge (in this case , someo ne who can pay for \"the barest needs of existence,\" yet whom an ex treme illness could ruin). The parties cite to state court decisions published during this time using the term public charge, which are informative of what the term generally meant at the ti me. Those opinions address the duration of benefits that render o ne a public charge rather than the quantum , and they tend to suggest that temporary relief did not make one a public charge as the term was understood at the time . However, they do not addr ess whether long er- term receipt of a small amount of public benefi ts qualifies one as a public charge (as the Rule would do) . See Yeatman v. King , 2 N.D. 421 (1892) (state loaning seed grain to farmer using the general tax fund, with obligation of repaymen t, is designed to prevent 22 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 23 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California farmers \"from becoming a public charge by affording them temporary relief\"); Cicero v. Falconberry , 14 Ind. App. 237 (1895) ( \"The mere fact that a person may occasionally obtain assistance from the county does not necessar ily make such person a pauper or a public charge.\").10 Following the 1891 Act, two points are relatively clear. First, reaffirming the best interpretation of t he 188 2 Act, the term was not used at the time to include short -term or temporary relief from the state , as the case law continued to demonstrate. Second , Lipkis could be read to support either of two non -controversial points: either state -funded institu tionalization constitutes becoming a public charge, or state -funded institutionalization with \"no effort \" to pay the expense after being billed does so. Simply being able to pay for the barest needs of existence an d nothing more does not render one a publ ic charge (although it may make one likely to become a public charge). A third point begins to m aterialize in the case law, which is that absent some particularly - identified negative factor, an employ able individual is not a public charge. E.g., In re Feinknopf , 47 F. at 447-48 (40-year-old man willing to exercise his trade); Lipkis , 56 F. at 428 (notwithstanding poverty, working man's family is not a public charge until financial calamity strikes); Yeatman , 2 N.D. at 421 (public aid to working farmer). 3. 1903 In 1903, Congress passed a revised version of the act. That amended statute provided, i n part: That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: All idiots, insane persons, epileptics, and persons who have been insane within five years previous; persons who have had two or more attacks of insanit y at any time previously; paupers; persons likely to become a public charge; professional beggars; persons afflicted with a loathsome or with a dangerous contagious disease; persons who have been convicted of a felony or other crime or 10 The parties also cite Edenburg Borough Poor Dist. v.

The new statute provided, i n part: 11 The only notable change is the intr oduction of an exclusion for individuals not otherwise captured by the categories who cannot earn a living based on mental or physic al defect.

Nothing relevant to the present action appears to have been changed by this revision . In 1915, the Supreme Court addressed the 1910 act in Gegiow v. Uhl , 239 U.S. 3 (1915). \"The single question\" in that case was \"whether an alien can be declared likely to become a public charge on the ground that the labor market in the city of his immediate destination is overstocked.\" Id. at 9-10. The immigration commissioners in that action determined that the i mmigrants were \"bound for P ortland, Oregon, where the reports of industrial conditions show that it would be impossible for these aliens to obtain employment[.]\" Id. at 8. The court held that \"[t]he statute deals with admissio n to the United States, not to Portland . . . . It woul d be an amazing claim of power if commissioners decided not to admit aliens because the labor market of the United States was o verstocked.\" Id. at 10. Because the immigrat ion authorities could not consider labor conditions in a single location to determi ne whether immigrants would be able to obtain employment, the factual findings that the immigrants c ould not find work in Portland was insufficient to support a determinatio n that they were likely to become public charges. The court also reasoned that, bec ause the \"public charge\" ground for exclusion was \"mentioned between paupers and professional beggar s, and along with idiots, persons dangerously diseased, persons certified by the examining surgeon to have a 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 26 of 93 mental or physical defect of a nature to affect their ability to earn a living,\" the term should be construed as similar with the rest. Id. Under that construction, the court held that those likely to become public charges \"are to be excluded on the ground of permanent personal objections accompanyin g them irrespective of local conditions[.]\" Id.12 That is, the court focused on an alien 's general ability and willingness to work and earn a living, rather than the particular wages or labor conditions that existed in the alien's destination. A court in 1916 considered \"whether the fact that petitioner entered the United States as a gambler, and as one having no other permanent means of support, actual or contemplated , makes him a person 'likely to become a public charge ' within the meaning of the Immigration Act.\" Lam Fung Yen v. Frick , 233 F. 393, 396 (6th Cir. 1916): It seems cle ar that the term 'persons likely to become a public charge' is not limited to paupers or those liable to become such; 'paupers' are mentioned as in a separate class . In United States v. Williams (D.C.) 175 Fed. 274, 275, the term 'persons likely to become a public charge' is construed as including, ' not only those persons who through misfo rtune cannot be self-supporting, but also those who will not undertake honest pursuits, and who are likely to become periodically the inmates of prisons .' We think this a reasonable construction. . . . Inmates of jails and prisons are for the time being public charges, and we think it open to conclusion by reasonable minds that th ose who will not work for a living, but rely for that purpose upon gambling, are more likely than citizens following the ordinary pursuits of industry to become, at least intermi ttently, public charges. Id. at 396-97 (emphasis added). The court reasoned that because the alien was a gambler and gamblin g is regarded \"within the domain of police supervision and public security,\" the petit ioner is reasonably likely to become periodically an inmate of a prison. Id. at 397. Under the court's reasoning, someon e in a prison is a public charge, akin to someone in an almsh ouse or insane asylum. Id.; see also United States v. Williams , 175 F. 274, 275 12 The Gegiow opinion was subject to some skepticism following a later amendment to the statute, but the Ninth Circuit subsequently held that its rea soning remained controlling. See Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi , 277 F. 9 13 (9th Cir. 1922); see also Ex parte Mitchell , 256 F. 229 (N.D.N.Y. 1919). 26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 27 of 93 (S.D.N.Y. 1910) (\"They are surely public charges, at least during the term of their incarceration.\"). In 1917, t he Second Circuit relied on Gegiow 's statutory analysis when deciding a case under the 1910 statute. Howe v. United States , 247 F. 292 (2d Cir. 1917). In Howe , a Canadian who had allegedly \"drawn a check . . . which proved bad,\" among other things, enter ed the United States, and an immigration inspector \"believed him guilty of dishonest pr actice in Canada.\" Id. at 293-94. Because the plaintiff had not admitted to or been convicted of a felony, the provision excluding criminals did not apply to him. The court reasoned that (1) the term \"public charg e\" needed to be read in context of its position in the statute's list, and (2) it cannot be interpreted to overlap with other items in the list (e.g., idiots, imbeciles, insane persons, criminals). As such, \" [i]f the words covered jails, hospitals, and in sane asylums, several of the oth er categories of exclusion would seem to be unnecessary.\" Id. at 294. Instead, \"Congress meant the act to exclude persons who were likely to become occupants of almshouses for want of means with which to support themselves in the future.\" Id. The Howe court provided a very specific, restrictive, and clear definition of the term. This also demonstrates an early split in the case law as to whether prison inmates are considered public charges. By 1917, the Suprem e Court, the Second Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit had all published opinions construing the term as used in the 1910 act. These are precisely the sorts of constructions Congress is presumed knowledgeable of when reenac ting statutory language . See Forest Grove , 557 U.S. at 239-40. The Supreme Court held that predicting whether someone will become a public charge requires consideration of \"permanent personal objections accompanying them irrespective of local conditions [.]\" Gegiow , 239 U.S. at 10. The two Circuit decisions are more difficult to reconcile. First, they directly contradicted one another with respect to whether jail inmates were public charges. Second, Howe broke with the weight of prior authori ty in hold ing that the ter m was limited to those occupying almshouses for want of a means of support. 6. 1917 27 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 28 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California In 1917, Congress amended the Act. That amended statute provided, in part: That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: All idiots, imbeciles, feeble - minded persons, epileptics, insane persons; persons who have had one or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; persons of constitutional psychopathic inferiority; persons paup ers; pr ofessional beggars; vagrants; persons afflicted with tuberculosis in any form or with a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease; persons not comprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes who are . . . mentally or physically d efective, such ph ysical defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of such alien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . . . . ; become a public charge . . . .\" An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens to, and the Residence of Aliens in, the United States, 39 Stat. 874, Chap. 29 \u00a7 3 (1917). The statute also provide d for the deportability of \"any alien w ho within five years after entry becomes a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen subsequent to landing[.]\" Id. \u00a7 19. The \"public charge\" language remains unchanged, although moved within the list. The Congressio nal Record suggests that Congress intentionally moved the category of \"persons likely to become a public charge\" later in the list in response to Gegiow . See 70 Cong. Rec. 3560 (1929) (\"persons likely to become a public charge (thi s clause exc luding aliens on the ground likely to become a public charge has been shifted from its position in section 2 of the immigration act of 1907 to its present position in section 3 of this act in order to indicate the intention of Congress that ali ens shall be excluded upon said ground for economic as well as other reasons and with a view to overcoming the decision of the Supreme Court in Gegiow v. Uhl , 239 U. S. 3 \"); see also 80 Cong. Rec. 5829 (1936) (same). A district cou rt in 1919 reasoned that although the exact same phrase was shifted within the list, \"I am unable to see that this change of location of these words in the act changes the meaning that is to be given them. A 'person likely to become a public charge' is on e who for some cause or reason appears to be about to become a charge 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 29 of 93 on the public, one who is to be supported at public expense, by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, idiocy and poverty, or, it might be, b y reason of having com mitted a crime which, on conviction, would be followed by imprisonment.\" Ex parte Mitchell , 256 F. 229, 230 (N.D.N.Y. 1919). In that case, there was \"no evidence whatever that the alien at any time has relied in any degree on the ch arity of oth ers,\" but rather the alien \"is able to earn her own living and always has done so[.]\" Id. The court then stated that mere speculation about the possibility of becoming a public charge does not make one likely to become a public charge: \"The alien may become sick; she may lose her house by fire; she may lose her personal property by bad investments. All this is possible, but not probable. There is no claim that this alien is suffering, or that she has suf fered at any time, from any mental or physical defect. It is not claimed this alien has been convicted, or even charged with the commission, of any crime, or that she came to the United States, or is in the United States, for any immoral or improper purpo se.\" Id. at 231. The Ninth Circuit agreed in 1922, holding that the 1917 Amendment's movement of the \"public charge\" exclusion \"does not change the meaning that should be given\" the exclusion. Ex parte Hosaye Sakag uchi, 277 F. 913, 916 (9th Cir. 1922). The court recognized the legislative change and that Gegiow 's reliance on the phrase's relative position in the statute was compromised, yet it held: Although in the act of February 5, 1917, under which the present case is to be determined, the location of the words 'persons likely to become a public charge' is c hanged, we agree with Judge Ray in Ex parte Mitchell (D.C.) 256 Fed. 229, that this change of location of the words does not change the meaning that should b e given them, and that it is still to be held that a person 'likely to become a public charge ' is one who, by reason of poverty, insanity, or disease or disab ility, will probably become a charge on the public. Id. (emphasis added).13 13 In 1923 a district court in Washington state did not cite these precedents and held instead that Co ngress's shift was an effective modification in response to Gegiow . Ex parte H orn, 292 F. 455 (W.D. Wash. 1923). Inte rpreting the phrase anew based on its plain meaning, the court reasoned that \"a public charge\" is \"a person committed to the 29 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 30 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California A 1921 Second Circuit opinion relying on Howe and Ex parte Mitchell held that \"A person likely to become a public charge i s one whom it may be necessary to support at public expense by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty , disease and poverty, idiocy and poverty. We think that the finding by the administrative authorities, showing a physical defect of a nature that may af fect the ability of the relator and appellee to earn a living, is sufficient ground for exclusion. Hi s physical condition, together with his financial condition, having but $100 with him, justified the conclusion of the administrative authorities in findi ng that he and his children were aliens likely to become public charges.\" Wallis v. U.S. ex rel. Mann ara, 273 F. 509, 511 (2d Cir. 1921) (citation omitted). A number of courts around this time also held that imprisonment was one way to become a public cha rge. E.g., Ex parte Fragoso , 11 F.2d 988, 989 (S.D. Cal. 1926) (\"The fact is this petitioner did beco me a public charge. He was confined in a jail for a period of nine months.\"); U.S. ex rel. Lehtola v. Magie , 47 F.2d 768, 770 (D. Minn. 1931) (noting a ci rcuit split as to whether \"dependency rather than imprisonment\" is grounds for finding a public charge ); Ex parte Horn , 292 F. 455, 458 (W.D. Wash. 1923). In 1933, the third edition of Black's Law Dictionary was the first to define \"public charge.\" The definition relied upon many of the above -cited cases, so for that reason it is derivative of and less pr obative than those cases themselves . Nevertheless, the definition is instructive . It defined the term as: \"A person whom it is necessary to support at public expense by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, or idiocy and poverty. . . . As used in [the 1917 Act], one who produces a money charge on, or an expense to, the public for support and care.\" See Black's Law Dictionary 311 (3d Ed. 1933). The term includes paupers as well as those who will not undertake honest pursuits or who are likely to go to prison. In 1948, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") issued an order, which the custody of a department of the government by due course of law,\" and that committing someon e to prison makes him a public charge. Id. at 457 . 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 31 of 93 acting Attorney General thereafter issued an order approving. The order set out a very explicit test for the term \"public charge\" as used elsewher e in the act, which concerned deportation proceedings of aliens who are later determined to have actually become a public charge during their time in the coun try. Matter of B -, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323 (A.G. 1948). When interpreting the term as used in t he deportation context , the BIA set out a 3 - part test requiring (1) an individualized bill for charges incurred, that is (2) presented to the alien (or a family member) by the government , and (3) which the alien (or family member) fails to pay. the foll owing test must be app lied to determine whether an alien has become a public charge within the reach of the 1917 act: (1) The State or other governing body must , by appropriate law, impose a charge for the services rendered to the alien. In other words, the State must have a cause of action in contract against either the person taking advantage of the State services or other designated relatives or friends. If t here is no charge made, and if the State does not have a cause of action, the alien cannot be s aid to be a public cha rge. (2) The authorities must make demand for payment of the charges upon those persons made liable under State law. And (3) there must b e a failure to pay for the charges. If there is a failure to pay either because of lack of dema nd or because the Stat e authorities do not perform their duty to collect the charges, the alien cannot be said to have become a public charge. Id. at 326 (footno te omitted). The BIA also reasoned that the same definition would apply t o the identical term used earlier in the statute with respect to predicting whether an alien is likely to become a public charge \u2014i.e., the provision at issue in the present action: First, we wish to make the following preliminary observation for the purpo se of clarifying the i ssue. The acceptance by an alien of services provided by a State or by a subdivision of a State to its residents, services for which no specific charge is made, does not in and of itself make the alien a public charge within the mean ing of the 1917 act. To illustrate, an alien who participates, without cost to him, in an adult education program sponsored by the State does not become a public charge. Similiarly [sic] with respect to an alien child who attends public school, or alien child who takes advant age of the free -lunch program offered by schools. We could go on ad infinitum setting forth the countless municipal and State services which are provided to all residents, alien and citizen 31 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 32 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California alike, without specific charge of the munic ipality or the State, and which are paid out of the general tax fund. The fact that the State or the municipality pays for the services accepted by the alien is not, then, by itself, the test of whether the alien has become a public charge. . . . [I]f it were to be held that all aliens became public charges by accepting such services, such a holding would necessarily result in making aliens seeking admission to the United States excl udable under that clause of section 3 of the act of February 5, 1917, whi ch bars aliens likely to become public charges from entering the United States, provided it were shown the alien would accept the free municipal and State services. Id. at 324-25 & n. 1. District courts had independentl y adopted the same meaning under the 1917 Act . E.g., Ex parte Orzechowska , 23 F. Supp. 428, 429 (D. Or. 1938) (individual not a public charge so long as they will \"pay the full amount of the cost of keeping the girl at t he Oregon State Hospital\") ; Ex part e Kichmiri antz, 283 F. 697, 698 (N.D. Cal. 1922) (same). This three -part test is still used for determining whether to deport those who in fact become public charges currently, and DHS proposes to continue doing is in the Rule. Prior to the 1952 Act's p assage, at least one principle had seemingly coalesced in the case law . The reasoning in Gegiow was reaffirmed, and multiple circuits ( also recognized by Black's La w Dictionary) agreed that someone likely to become a pub lic charge is one whom it may be ne cessary to support at public expense by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, or idiocy and poverty . Although that oft-used definition (or a close derivative) is not particularly descriptive as to what quantum of support qualifies as \"necessary to support\" some one at public expense , it reaffirms the principle expressed in Gegiow and prior cases that the inquiry is focused on the individual 's inherent ability to support himself . This definition als o accords with prior interpretation s generally finding that, absent some particularly -identified negative factor, those who appear generally capable and willing to work are not likely to become public charges. And unlike the Howe case, it allows reading t he definition of public charge in light of the surrounding categories of excluded persons, such that someone who is excluded due to his disease alone may also be excluded because his disease , in combination with another factor like poverty , is likely to re nder him a public charge. This 32 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 33 of 93 remains in line with other historically -supporte d, consistent principles described above , namely that temporary assistance does not render one a public charge and that actual incursion of debt to the state and refusal to pay could render one a public charge . The Attorney General's order in 1948 for the first time offered a single , clear definition of the term \"public charge\" to be applied consistently throughout t he Act. And it also specifically ruled that acceptance of publicly-funded services \"for which no specific charge is made\" does not make one a public charge. The three -part test requiring presentation of a bill and inability or refusal to pay was certainl y in accordance with a line of precedential caselaw, but it wa s by no means the only or even domi nant line at that time. Nevertheless, this Attorney -General -issued order was controlling as administrative law between its issuance in 1948 and at least Congr ess's next codification of the immigration statutes in 1952. 7. 1952 In 1952, Congress again revised the laws relating to immigration. That revised statute provided, in part: Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the following classes of aliens shall be ineligible to receive visas and shall be excluded from adm ission into the United States: (1) Aliens who are feeble -minded; (2) Aliens who are insane; (3) Aliens who have had one or more attacks of insanity; . . . (7) Aliens no t of the foregoing classes . . . having a physical defect, disea se, or disability . . . to be of su ch a nature that it may affect the ability of the alien to earn a living, unless the alien affirmatively establishes that he will not have to earn a livin g; (8) Aliens who are paupers, professional beggars, or vagrants; . . . (15) Aliens who, in the opini on of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission, are likely at any time to become public charges\" An Act to Revise the Laws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality; and for Other Purposes, 66 Stat. 163, 183, Title 2, Chap. 2 (\"1952 Act\") \u00a7 212 (1952). The 1952 Act also provided for deportat ion of any alien who, \"in the opinion of the 33 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 34 of 93 Attorney General, has within five years after entry becom e a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen after entry[.]\" Id., Chap. 5 \u00a7 241(a)(8) . The change s appear to be relatively minor for the purposes of this dispute. Notably, Congress added the phrase \" at any time\" to specif y the scope of time the public charge determination is meant to consider. But no alteration to the phrase \"public charge\" appears i n the statute. The 1951 edition of Black's Law Dictionary, like the 3rd edition in 1933, assembled its definition based on precedent discussed above: A person whom it is necessary to support at public expense by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty, or idiocy and poverty. As used in [the 1917 Act] . . ., one who prod uces a money charge on, or an expen se to, the public for support and care. As so us ed, the term is not limited to paupers or those liable to become such, but includes those who will not undertake honest pursuits, or who are likely to become periodically t he inmates of prison. Charge, Pu blic Charge, Black's Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) (citations omitted). BIA dispositions following the passage of the 1952 Act addressed the term. One such disposition surveyed caselaw interpreting the term and held \"the statute requires more than a showi ng of a possibility that the alien will requi re public support . Some specific circumstance, such as mental or physical disability, advanced age, or other fact reasonably tending to show that the burden of supporting the alien is likely to be cast on the p ublic, must be present. A healthy person in the prime of life cannot ordinarily be considered likely to become a public charge, especially where he has friends or relatives in the United States who have indicated their a bility and willingness to come to h is assistance in case of emergency .\" Matter of Martinez -Lopez , 10 I. & N. Dec. 409, 421 -22 (BIA 1962) (emphasis added) (collecting cases). In that case, the agency held that the individual at issue was not likely to beco me a public charge given his charac teristics, which essential ly showed he was ab le to perform honest work: When respondent applied for a visa he was 22 years of age. 34 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 35 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California He was sound of body and had about ten years of farming experience. He had no specialized training, but had five years of sc hooling and apparently planned to seek work f or which he was qualified. He spoke no English, but this was no handicap for he would work among people who spoke Spanish. He had about $50 in assets. He had a brother gainfull y employed in the United States and he had other close relations who were intere sted in his welfare and who worked to bring him to the United States. The brother was making $85 a week in permanent employment; he was unmarried; he had been sending money to his family in Mexico, and he was in terested in helping his brother. Respondent h ad previous experience in the United States, having spent about three months here as a contract worker. At that time he worked both in the fields and in a cannery. His services appear to have been satisfactory f or he was retained here until his contract wa s completed. Respondent had no criminal record. Id. at 411. A 1974 BIA decision emphasized that the public charge determination must consider the totality of t he circumstances , and that prior welfare use alone cannot be determinative. Matter of Perez , 15 I. & N. Dec. 136, 137 (BIA 1974) (\"The respondent's reliance on welfare for support is a condition which she herself can remedy.\"). Another 1974 BIA decision c onfused matters. Matter of Harutunian , 14 I. & N. Dec. 583, 584 (BIA 1974 ). The decision outlined \"[t]he stages in decisional interpretations of the deportation sta tute, culminating in Matter of B -\": 1. The words \"public charge\" had their ordinary meaning, that is to s ay, a money char ge upon or an expense to the public for support and care, the alien being destitute. 2. The alien had not yet become a public charge , even though he personally was destitute and his care and support were being paid for by public funds, if there existed cl ose relatives, ready, willing and able to pay the bill, but the appropriate government agency had failed to submit any bill. 3. The alien had not become a public charge where the alien's mother had offered to make reimbursement, but under state law paymen t could not be accepted for maintenance and treatment of the institutionalized alien. 4. The alien had not become a public charge wh ere the circumstances were like those described in 3, above, except that no one had offered reimbursement. Id. at 586 (citations omitted). 35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 36 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California However, i t reasoned that the Attorney General 's opinion in Matter of B -\"is not necessarily controlling in relation to the provisions for exclusion. \" Id. at 585. The BIA reason ed that \"[w]hile it may normally be assumed that identical words used in different parts of the same statute are inten ded to have an identical meaning, this assumption readily yields when the legislative intent requires variant meanings in different contexts .\" Id. at 586. The BIA then discussed legislative history in search of congressi onal intent . Id. The decision notes that the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed that courts had given different definitions to the term, and ultimately it decided not to define the term, \"but rather [decided] to establish the specific qualification that the determination of whether an alien falls into that category rests within the discretion of the consular officers or the Com missioner.\" Id. at 588 (citing S. Rep. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., April 20, 1950, p. 349). The BIA stated that the phrase \"public charge\" must be \"strictly construed\" in the deportation context, but not in t he exclusion context. Id. It then reasoned that the old - age benefits at issue in the case were \"individualized public support to the needy, as distinguished from essentially supplementary benefits, directed to the general welfare of the public as a whole.\" Id. at 589. Even though the state would never ask for repayment of those old -age benefits \u2014and therefore they could not constitute assistance quali fying one as a public charge under the Matter of B -test\u2014the court reasoned that it would not consider \"the eleme nt of reimbursement\" when determining whether someone is likely to become a public charge. Id. So, the BIA rejected the Matter of B-test and constructed alternate definition s for the same term depending o n whether the executive is predicting whether someone is likely to become a public charge or deciding whether someone ha s already become a public charge. \"Therefore, in our opi nion any alien who is incapable of earning a livelihood, who does not h ave sufficient funds in the United States for his support, and has no person in the United States willing and able to assure that he will not need public support is excludable as likely to become a public charge whether or not the public 36 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 37 of 93 support which will be available to him is reimbursable to the state.\" Id. at 589 -90. These BIA decisions are useful to understand the administrative practices and interp retations operating when Congress reenacted the same lang uage. Although this period saw confusion within the agency about the proper way to interpret the phrase as used in different contexts, each of the discussed decisions support the now -consistent them e that a healthy person in the pr ime of life who can work cannot be considered likely to become a public charge, absent some particularly -identified circumstance evaluated under a totality of the circumstances . E.g., Matter of Martinez -Lopez , 10 I. & N. D ec. at 422 (collecting cases) ; Matter of Harutunian , 14 I. & N. Dec. at 589 (\"alien who is incapable of earning a livelihood \"); Matter of Perez , 15 I. & N. Dec. at 137 (totality of circumstances). 8. 1987 In 198 7, the INS issued a final rule, effective May 1, 1987, following notice and comment. See Adjustment of Status for Certain Aliens, 52 F ed. Reg. 16,205 (May 1, 1987). The rule implemented section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act as amended by se ction 201 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 . Id. at 16,205. So, the 1987 rule concerned the term \"public charge\" as used elsewhere in the INA, specifically for aliens adjusting their status to that of aliens lawfully admitt ed for temporary residence. The \"key issues\" subject to comments \"were the public charge and special rule for determination of public charge[.]\" 52 Fed. Reg. at 16,206. That rule provided: \"An applicant . . . is subject to the provisions of section 212(a)(1 5) of the Act relating to excludability of aliens likely to become public charges unles s the applicant demonstrates a history of employment in the United States evidencing self -support without receipt of public cash assistance. . . . If the alien's period (s) of residence in the United States include significant gaps in employment or if there is reason to believe that the alien may have received public assistance while employed, the alien may be required to provide proof that he or she has not receive d public cash assistance.\" 52 Fed. Reg. at 16,211. 37 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 38 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California Essentially, this provision exempt ed aliens who ha d been working domestically from the normal public charge analysis, so long as they could prove a work history and that they ha d not relied on public cash assistance. The rule defined cash assistance to exclude in -kind benefits. 52 Fed. Reg. at 16,209 (\"'Public cash assistance' means income or needs -based monetary assistance, to include but not limited to supplemental security in come, received by the alien or his or her immediate family members through federal, state, or local programs designed to meet subsistence levels. It does not include assistance in kind, such as food stamps, public housing, or other non -cash benefits, nor does it include work -related c ompensation or certain types of medical assistance (Medicare, Medicaid, emergency treat ment, services to pregnant women or children under 18 years of age, or treatment in the interest of public health).\"). This use of the term is somewhat of an aberration given that it essentially concerned an exception to the statute at issue here \u2014and it di d not define the term . However, it did reinforce the long -standing principle underlying the construction of the term that, when considerin g whether someone should be ad mitted to the country, the concept of \"public charge\" concerns primarily the prospect o f gainful employment or some other private source of support . 9. 1990 In 1990, Congress revised the laws relating to immigration. That rev ised statute provided, in part : Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the following describes classes of excluda ble aliens who are ineligible to receive visas and who shall be excluded from admission into the United States: (1) Health -Related Grounds . . . (2) Criminal and Relate d Grounds . . (3) Security and Related Grounds . . . (4) Public Charge. \u2014Any alien w ho, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or a djustment of status, is likely at any time to 38 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 39 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California become a public charge is excludable. Immigration Act of 1990, 104 Stat . 4978, Title 6 \u00a7 601 (1990). This version of the bill removed language referring to the feeble -minded , paupers, professional beggars, and vagrants . There is a suggestion in the Congressional Record that the removed terms wer e meant to be consolidated within the public charge category : The bill removes some of the antiquated and unused exclusions that have been in our law since the early 19 00's, such as the exclusions based on illiteracy, and the exclusions for aliens who are \"paupers, professional beggars, or vagrants.\" These relics h ave been replaced by one generic standard which exclude aliens who are \"likely to become a public charge.\" 136 Cong. Rec. 36797, 36844 (1990). In \"public ch arge\" as \"an indigent. A person whom it is necessary to supp ort at public expense by reason of poverty alone or illness and poverty.\" Charge, Public Charge, Black's La w Dictionary (6th ed. 1990). Although a statutory term is not define d by reference to o ne preferred interpretation memorialized in the Congressional Record, that interpretation is consistent with the courts ' and executive's general treatment of the term si nce Gegiow . That is, following Gegiow and later cases applying it to the 1917 Act , cou rts had read the term public charge in context of those surro unding terms rather than in exclusion of them , and focused on the alien's ability to work or otherwise provi de for himself , which each of the omitted surrounding terms also ultimately spoke to . But see Howe , 247 F. at 294. 10. 1996 In 1996, Congress again revised the laws relating to immigration. That revised statute provided, in part: (4) PUBLIC CHARGE. \u2014 (A) IN GENERAL. \u2014Any alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of appl ication for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public charge is excludable. 39 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 40 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California (B) FACTORS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. \u2014 (i) In determining wheth er an alien is excludable under this paragraph, the consular officer or the Attorney General shall at a minimum consider the alien's \u2014 (I) age; (II) health; (III) family status; (IV) assets, resources, and financial status; and (V) education and skills. (ii) In addition to the factors under clause (i), the consular officer or the Attorney General may also consider any affidavit of suppor t under section 213A for purposes of exclusion under this paragraph. Omnibus C onsolidated Appropriations Act , 110 Stat . 3009, Title 5 \u00a7 531 (1996 ). This act is often referred to as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"). Elsewhere, the Act provided that \" Any alien who, within five years after the date of entry, has become a public charge from causes not affirma tively shown to have arisen since entry is deportable. \" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 (a)(5) (effective April 24, 1996 ). The r evised law used the same relevant language as all previous versions \u2014public charge . However, the statute then listed five factors that Congress instructed must be considered when determining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge, and it identified another factor that \"may also\" be considered. Contemporaneously, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (\"PR WORA\"), Pub. L. 104 -193, restricted most aliens from accessing many public support programs for a period of time . During legislative efforts that ultimately resulted in the IIRIRA, a group of legislators proposed to define \"public ch arge\" with particularit y in the statute to include \"any alien who receives benefits described in subparagraph (D) for an aggregate peri od of at least 12 months\" (or 36 months in the case of a battered spouse or child). 142 Cong. Rec. 24313, 24425 (1996). The benefits listed in subparagraph D (that would qualify an alien as a public charge) include d \"means -tested public benefits,\" but it 's not 40 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 41 of 93 entirely clear what specific benefits that section refers to.14 That definition was not enacted into law. 11. 1999 The INS attempted in 1 999 to engage in rulemaking to guide immigration officers, aliens, and the public in understanding the public ch arge determinations. No final rule was ever issue d. Instead, the agency published Field Guidance addressing the issue. See Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999) (the \"1999 Field Guidance\") . The notice was published prior to final rulemaking because it was deemed \"necessary to help alleviate public confusion over the meaning of the term 'public charge' in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt of Federal, State, and l ocal public benefits.\" 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689. \"The Department decided to publish a proposed rule defining 'public char ge' in order to reduce the negative public health consequences generated by the existing confusion and to provide aliens with better gu idance as to the types of public benefits that will and will not be considered in public charge determinations.\" Id. The not ice \"both summarizes longstanding law with respect to public charge and provides new guidance on public charge determinations in l ight of the recent changes in law,\" notably the \"Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIR IRA) and welfare reform laws.\" Id. The notice proposed \"that 'public charge' means an alien who has become (for deportation purposes) or who is likely to become (for admission/adjustment purposes) 'primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demo nstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term car e at government expense. ' Institutionalization for short periods of rehabilitation does not constitute such primary depe ndenc e.\" Id. 14 The record refers to Section 213A(e)(1), which appears to have been codified at 8 U.S.C \u00a71183a(e), but that does not describe means -tested benefits. The currently - operative version of 8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1183a(a)(1)(B) als o appears to errantly refer to subsection (e) for a list of means -tested benefits, so this error is not unique . 41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 42 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California Following the implementation of that interpretation, \"officers should not place any weight on the receipt of non -cash pub lic benefits (other than institutionalization) or the receipt of cash benefits for purposes other than for income mainten ance with respect to determinations of admissibility or eligibility for adjustment on public charge grounds.\" Id. Summarizing current agency practice, the memo explained: The standard for adjudicating inadmissibility under section 212(a)(4) has been deve loped in several Service, BIA, and Attorney General decisions and has been codified in the Service regulations implementing the legaliz ation provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. These decisions and regulations, and section 212( a)(4) itself, create a \"totality of the circumstances\" test. In determining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge, Service officers should assess the financial responsibility of the alien by examining the \"totality of the alien's circumstan ces at the time of his or her application * * * The existence or absence of a particular factor should never be the sole criterion for dete rmining if an alien is likely to become a public charge. The determination of financial responsibility should be a pr ospe ctive evaluation based on the alien's age, health, family status, assets, resources and financial status, education, and skills, among other factors. An alien may be considered likely to become a public charge even if there is no legal obligation to r eimb urse the benefit -granting agency for the benefits or services received, in contrast to the standards for deportation, discussed below. Id. at 28,690 (footnotes omitted). The 1999 Field Guidance then explained that the three -part test for paying back public debt continues to apply, but only as an additional test on top of the totality of the circumstances test for deportation decisions: Repayment is relevant to the public charge inadmissibility determination only in very limited circumstances. If at t he time of application for admission or adjustment of status the alien is deportable on public charge grounds under section 237(a)(5) of the INA due to an outstanding public debt for a cash benefit or the costs of institutionalization, then the alien is in admi ssible. Only a debt that satisfies the three -part [ Matter of B -] test under section 237(a)(5), described below, will render an alien deportable as a public charge and therefore ineligible for admission or adjustment. If the debt is paid, then the alie n will no longer be inadmissible based on the debt, and the usual totality of the circumstances test would apply. 42 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 43 of 93 Id. T he Feld Guidance explained that a compelling reason to limit the public charge definition to those receiving cash is that \"certain federal, state, and local benefits are increasingly being made available to families with incomes far above the poverty level, reflecting broad public policy decisions about improving general public health and nutrition, promoting education, and assisting working-poor families in the process of becoming self-sufficient. Thus, participation in such non-cash programs is not evidence of poverty or d ependence.\" Id. at 28,692 12. 2013 In 2013, the Senate voted down two amendments to a never-passed bill regarding immigration . The first amendment proposed \"expanding the criteria for 'public charge,' such that applicants would have to show they were not likely to qualify even for non-cash employment supports such as Medicaid, the SNAP program, or the Children's Health Insuranc e Program (CHIP). . . . [T]he amendment was rejected by voice vote.\" S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 42 (2013). The second amendment \"would have expanded the definition of 'public charge' such that people who received non-cash health benefits could not become legal permanent residents. This amendment would also have denied entry to individuals whom the Department of Homeland Security determines are likely to receive these types of benefits in the future. The amendment was not agreed to by a voice vote.\" S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 63 (2013). 13. 2019 \u2014The Rule On October 10, 2018, DHS publish ed a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register. See 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114. The NPRM provided a 60-day public comment period, during which 266,077 comments were collected. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297. On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Rule in the Federal Register. The Rule supersedes the 1999 Field Guidance 's definition of \"public charge,\" establishing a new definition based on a minimum time threshold for the receipt of public 43 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 44 of 93 benefits. Under the newly -proposed \"12/36 standard,\" a public charge is defined as an individual who receives desi gnated public benef its for more than 12 months in the aggregate within a 36 -month period , although a single month where m ultiple types of benefits are received is counted as multiple months of receiving aid . 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295. The \"public benefits\" included are extend ed by the Rule to include many non - cash benefits , for example Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Progra m (\"SNAP\"), Section 8 Housing Programs, Medicaid, and Public Housing. Id. at 41 ,501. Receipt of two categories of benefits in the sam e months counts as two months of receipt for benefits, so some will qualify as public charges without receiving benefits for 12 months. Moreover, the rule is agnostic to the value (or cost to the government) of the benefits. To take a plausible example , someone receiving $ 182 over 36 months \u2014or an average of less than 17 cents a day \u2014in SNAP benefit s is a public charge under the Rule. See Shing Decl. \u00b6 17. The Rule does not change the definition of public charge in the context of deportability , described elsewhere in the INA. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295 (\" This rule does not interpret or change DHS's implementation of the public charge ground of deportability. \"). Rather, DHS will continue to enforce the 1999 Field Guidance in the deportation context . Id. at 41,304 (\"DHS currently makes public charge determinations in accordance with the 1999 Interim Field Guidance . . . . This g uidance explains how the agency determines . . . whether a person has become a public charge within five years of entry \"). The 1999 Fi eld Guidance, which will continue to govern, provided that \" the definition of public charge is the same for both admissio n/adjustment and deportation, \" although \" the standards applied to public charge adjudications in each context are significantly differe nt\" because one is forward -looking and one is backward -looking. 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689. As such , following the implemen tation of the Rule, \"public charge\" will continue to be defined in the deportation context as \" an alien who has become . . . 'primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash assistance for inc ome maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for 44 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 45 of 93 long-term care at government expense. '\" Id. To assess whether an alien qualifies under that definition in the deportability context, t he 1999 Field Guidance prescribes the 3 -part test established in Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323 . So, the Rule proposes to simultaneously apply multip le definitions for the term public charge . First, its new definition will be used to predict whether an alien is likely at any time to become a public charge. Second, the 199 9 Field Guidance's \"primary dependence\" definition is left una ltered in the deportation cont ext, and it is evaluated pursuant to the well-known 3 -part Matter of B -test. Each step in the Chevron analysis requires the court to consider the terms of the statute in context. T he court first looks to the statutory text, i n light of prior agency and judicial interpretation \u2014as explained at length above , although the court notes that judicial and agency interpretation following the most -recent 1996 revision is not particularly relevant to understanding the meaning of the text as enacted in 1996. Cf. Sec'y of the Interior v. California , 464 U.S. 312, 375 n.36 (1984) (the \"view of a subsequent Congress . . . is not without persuasive value \"). The analysis is also in formed to some degree by what Congress decided not to pass , in addition to what it specifical ly rejected. \"Congress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language.\" Cardoza -Fonseca , 480 U .S. at Co. , 422 U.S. at 414 n.8 (rejecting construction of statute th at would implement provision Conference Committee rejected); Bob Jones Univ. , 461 U.S. at 600-01 (interpretation of statute informed by the fact that Congress had a \"prolonged and acute awareness\" of an established agency interpre tation of a statute , considered the precise issue, and rejected bills to overturn the prevailing interpretation ); see also Merrill Lynch , 456 U.S. at 381-82 (interpretation of statute informed by the fact that Congress amended large portions of statute, bu t not provision at issue ). Of particular relevance here, parts of Congress have explicitly and repeatedly rejected efforts to defin e \"public charge\" to include those who receive certai n in-kind 45 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 46 of 93 benefits for a period of 12 months \u2014efforts that are strikingly similar to the definition now adopted for the first time by the executive in the Rule . E.g., 142 Cong. Rec. 24313, 24425 (1996); S. Rep. No. 113 -40, at 42 (2013) ; S. Rep. No. 113 -40, at 63 (2013). Congress's rejection in 1996 is particularly instructive . As described above, Congress at that time considered a scheme similar to the Rule, wherein use of means -tested benefits for 12 months would qualify one as a public charge. On Septe mber 24, 1996 , the conference committee recommended passage of a version of the bill with that definition. See 142 Cong. Rec. 24389 (conference committee recommendation), 24425 (public charge definition). President Clinton had previously praised the legi slation generally , but specifically criticized that bill's disincentive to obtain public benefits. He called for revision of the statute. He said \"it still goes too far in denying legal immigrants access to vital safety net programs which could jeopardize pub lic health and safety. Some work still needs to be done. I urge t he Congress to move quickly to finalize and send me this key legislation .\" Statement on Senate Action on the \"Immigration Con trol and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996\", President Willi am J. Clinton, Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents Volume 32, Issue 18 (May 6, 1996) at p. 783. On September 30, 1996 , the bill was signed into law , following the removal of the defin ition of public charge that includ ed use of means -tested public benefits . This exchange, which deals with the precise issue prese nted by this litigation, is particularly instructive not because of the president's words but because of Congress's response t o those words \u2014it intentionally considered and rejected a defini tion similar to what the Rule now proposes. Afterall it is Congres s, not the President, who is responsible for writing legislation . Given the term's long -standing focus on the individual's abi lity and willingness to work or otherwise support himself , and its longstanding allow ance for short -term aid, and the legislative history of the 1996 revision, it is likely that the Rule's interpretation defining anyone who receives any quantity of benefits for 12 months (or fewer ) out of a floating 36-month window as a public charge is not a permissible or reasonable construction of the statute . For example, d efendants do not contest that someone receiving less than 50 46 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 47 of 93 cents per day \u2014which is a standard SNAP benefit amount for recipients at the higher end of income el igibility, Shing Decl. \u00b6 17 \u2014would be deemed a public charge under t he Rule . That could also be calculated as $18 2 over 36 months \u2014or an average of less than 17 cents a day. At no point over the long history described above could that have qualified one as a public charge, unless the bill for those charges was presented t o the recipient and he refused to pay. Moreover, the Rule's double -counting of month s where multiple benefits are rece ived raises serious questions with respect to whether the Rule impermi ssibly considers temporary or short -term relief, receipt of which h as never been sufficient to qualify someone as a public charge (absent repayment, following presentation of an invoice) . Deciding otherwise would put this court at odds with persuasive Supr eme Court and Ninth Circuit precedent . The Supreme Court has defin ed the term to allow exclusion only \"on the ground of permanent personal objections accompanying them [the excluded aliens] irrespective of local conditions[.]\" Gegiow , 239 U.S. at 10 . In that case, \"the aliens came from a remote province of Ru ssia. They knew no trade. They knew no language but their own. Only one could read or write in his own language. They h ad sums aggregating slightly more than $25 each. They were not employed, and had no promise of employment. They were ticketed through to Portland, Or., where, owing to depressed labor conditions, the prospect of their obtaining work 'was most unfavorable.' \" Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi , 277 F. at 916 (citing Gegiow , 239 U.S. at 10). St ill, they were not likely to become public charges within the meaning of the statute. The Ninth Circuit reaffirmed that definition following reorganization of the statute. Id. (\"change of location of the words does not change the meaning that should be g iven them\"). Since Gegiow and Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi , Congress has not altered the term \"public charge,\" which the Ninth Circuit has defined standing al one, irrespective of its placement or context within the list of excluded persons in the statute . The court therefore sees no good reason to depart from those precedential opinions, which suggest t hat an able- bodied, working -age individual who is willing to engage in honest work is not excludable 47 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 48 of 93 based on a prediction that he will become a public ch arge unless a particular reason can be articulated to exclude him. This reasoning does not allow for exclusion based on the increasing generosity of society' s public assistance to provide for more than the barest requirements of subsistence. Gegiow , in fac t, explicitly preclude s consideration of local labor conditions. The likely unreasonableness of the rule is further demonstrated by just how expansive the defi nition is. The history of the term , evidenced by its repeated verbatim reenactment, exclude d those who were likely to become public charges based on poverty, or idiocy and poverty, or disease and poverty , etc. But plaintiffs demonstrate that in a single year, roughly a quarter U.S. -born citizens receive one or more benefits used to define who is a public charge under the Rule . And plaintiffs demonstrate that , over the course of their lifetimes , about 40% of U.S. -born citizens are expected to receive one or more of those benefits . Although these figures do not indicate what percent of U.S.-born ci tizens would actually be deemed public charges under the Rule (that would require determining how many individual s receive multiple benefits per month, in additi on to how many months benefits are received over any 3 -year period) , it suggests that the Rule is substantially outside the bounds of a reasonable interpretation of the statute. With regard to plaintiffs' claim that the Rule is not in accordance with law, for the foregoing reasons, and g iven the above discussion of the term's long -standing use and evolution in the immigration statutes, this court finds that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits with respect to their claim that the Rule's definition of public charge is unreasonable and not based on a permissible construction of the statute , under the second prong of the Chevron analysis.15 Alternatively , plaintiffs have raised at least serious questions with respect to whether \" the statute, read in c ontext, unambiguously forecloses \" the precise question at issue, namely DHS's expansive interpr etation of the term to include individuals willing and able work productively in the national economy , 15 For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on this question, they have undoubtedly raised serious questions wi th respect to it. 48 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 49 of 93 under the f irst prong of the Chevron analysis.

Trucking Associatio ns, 531 U.S. 457, 471 (2001) (finding a particular construction \"unambiguously bar [red]\" when \" interpreted in its statutory and historical context \"). b. Not in Accordance with Law \u2014Rehabilitation Act The Rehabilitation Act prohibits \"any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance\" or \"any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency,\" from excluding, denying benefits to, or discriminating against persons with disabilities. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). \"To establish a violation of \u00a7 504 of the RA [Rehabilitation Act], a plaintiff must show that (1) she is handicapped within the meaning of the RA; (2) she is otherwise qualified for the benefit or services sought; (3) she was denied the benefit or services solely by reason of her handicap; and (4) the program providing the benefit or services receives federal financial assistance.\" Lovell v. Chandler, 303 a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be . . . subjected to discrimination under . . . any program or activity conducted by any Executiv e agency\"). The States argue that the Rule will exclude some individuals solely based on disability because a disability will predictably be responsible for a number of negative factors in some individuals: (1) a negative health factor because the Rule adopts a definition of \"health\" that strongly overlaps with disability; (2) a negative factor if the applicant lacks private insurance; and (3) a negative factor if the applicant has received Medicaid for 12 of the last 36 months, even though use of Medicaid is common for the disabled because it covers services that no other insurer provides. Defendants first argue that the Rule's multi -factor test means the Rehabilitation Act is not violated because disability cannot be the \"sole\" determinative factor . Second, they argue that even if the statutes are in conflict, a specific, later statutory command \u2014 such as the INA's requirement that the agency consider health \u2014supersedes section 49 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 50 of 93 504's general proscription. First, the Rehabilitation Act requires that a plainti ff show that a disabled person was denied services \"solely\" by reason of h er disability. The Rule does not deny any alien admission i nto the United States, or adjustment of status, \"solely by reason of\" disability. All covered aliens, disabled or not, ar e subject to the same inquiry: whether they are likely to use one or more covered federal benefits for the specified period of time. Even though a disability is likely to be an underlying cause of some individuals qualifying for additional negative facto rs, it will not be the sole cause . As such, d isability is one non -disposi tive factor.16 Second, the INA explicitly lists \"health\" as factor that an officer \"shall . . . consider\" in making U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). \" Health\" includes an alien's disability and whatever impact the disability may have on the alien's expenses and ability to work. Congr ess, not the Rule, requires DHS to take this factor into account, and the caselaw has long considered this factor. See, e .g., Knutzen not \"revoke or repeal . . . a much more specific . . . absent express language by Congress\") . As such, plaintiffs have not demonstrated even seriou s questions going the merits with respect to this claim. c. Arbitrary and Capricious Section 4 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, prescribes a three -step procedure for so -called \"notice -and-comment rulemaking.\" First, the agency must issue a \"[g]eneral notice of proposed rule making,\" ordinarily by publication in the Federal Register . \u00a7 553(b). Second, if \"notice [is] required,\" the agency must \"give interested persons an opportunity to participate in 16 Plaintiffs' citation to Lovell is unavailing. They claim the cas e found a multi -factor test violated the Act, \"notwithstanding other factors\" unrelated to disability. But in Lovell , defendants asked the court to look at a multifactore d system, but the court declined and instead looked at treatment of the disabled unde r a single program . It was \"undisputed that disabled people who, but for their disability, were eligible for healthcare benefits from the State under\" that single program \"were denied coverage because of the categorical exclusion of the disabled from\" tha t program.

Agency action is invalid if the agency fail s to give adequate reasons for its decisions, fails to examine the relevant data, or offers no \"rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\" Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

A rule is arbitrary a nd capricious if the agency has \"entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agenc y expertise.\" Id.

C itizen, Inc. v. FAA , 988 F.2d 186, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Rule chan ges face a higher burden when departing from prior policy: Agencies are free to change their existing policies as l ong as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change. When an agenc y changes its existing position, it need not always provide a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate. But the agency must at le ast display awareness that it is changing position and show that there ar e good reasons for the new policy. In explaining its changed posi tion, an agency must also be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account. In such cases it is not that further justif ication is demanded by the mere fact of policy change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy. It follows that an unexplained inconsistency in agency policy i s a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and ca pricious change from agency practice. An arbitrary and capricious regulation of this sort is itself unlawful and rec eives no Chevron deference. Encino Motorcars , 136 S. Ct. 2125 quotation marks and citations omitted); accord F.C.C. v.

Plaintiffs raise numerous procedural challenges t o the Rule. The court addresses 52 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 53 of 93 them in two general categories. First, the court considers plaintiffs arguments that DHS failed to adequately consider and address the Rule's costs a nd benefits. Second, the court considers plaintiffs' remaining procedura l challenges. i. DHS Failed to Adequately Consider Costs and Ben efits Plaintiffs argue that DHS failed to consider costs and benefits in three ways. First, DHS failed to adequately c onsider significant costs to local and state governments raised in commen ts, as well as the related issue of DHS 's failure to consider evidence when estimating disenrollment figures. Second , DHS failed to consider concerns about health effects like diseas e outbreaks. Third , DHS acted impermissibly with respect to the burden t he I-944 form would impose. Based on plaintiffs' first and second arguments, discussed presently, this court finds that they are likely to succeed on the merits with respect to their claim that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious . 17 A. Local and State Go vernment Costs and Disenrollment Rates Plaintiffs argue that c ommenters documented the dangers to individuals and public health generally that stem from disenrollment in public benefi ts, and explained that local and state governments will face higher costs because of th is disenrollment. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,310 -12 (explaining that \"[m]any commenters particularly emphasized that disenrollment or for egoing enrollment would be detrimen tal to the financial stability and economy of communities , States, loca l organizations, hospitals, safety net providers, foundations, and healthcare centers\"); id. at 41,469 -70; Case No. 19-cv-04717 in res ponse to NPRM ). Numerous comments included specific cost calculations. See, e.g. , 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,475 (citing s pecific cost estimates from comments) ; Cho Decl. , Ex. C at 22 -23 (estimat ing losses to California at $1.76 billion in revenue from federal government and 17,700 jobs ), Ex. J at 11 17 For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on this claim, they have undoubtedly raised serious qu estions with respe ct to it. 53 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 54 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California (estimating that the Rule would cost hospitals more than $17 billion in uncompensated care), Ex. K at 5-7 (detailing expected costs to hospitals) . Plaintiffs relatedly argue that DHS under -estimated disenrollment figures and the accompan ying effects , including the effects on state and local governments .18 For example , despite i ts concession that the Rule will cause members of mixed -status households (i.e., those including U.S. citizens ) to disenroll from benefits, 84 Fed. Re g. at 41,300, DHS refused to consider the costs associated with such disenrollment, stating: \"DHS believe s that it would be unwarranted for U.S. citizens and aliens exempt from public charge inadmissibility to disenroll from a public benefit program or fo rego enrollmen t in response to this rule when such individuals are not subject to this rule. DHS will not alter this rule to account for such unwarranted choices.\" Id. at 41,313. Defendants correctly argue that they are not required to quantify every po tential cost and benefit and precisely weigh them out. They respon d to these challenges both in the Rule and before the court with three essential points. First, DHS read the comme nts, but the forward -looking economic impact to states, cities, hospitals, and others was too difficult to assess . Second, with respect to the disenrollment of those who will not be subject to a public charge assessment in the future, the Rule's effect wa s too difficult to assess. Third , even if DHS had assess ed those costs, t hey would be outweighed by the benefit s of excluding aliens who would rely on public assistance , and of promoting self - sufficiency of aliens already in the United States . Those bene fits are in line with Congressional statements of policy. DHS was required to a certain extent to grapple with estimates and credible data 18 DHS argues that it's 2.5% figure is not part of the re gulatory analysis and cannot be challenged because it was calculated pursuant to an executive order. The court disagrees. See Council of Parent Attorneys & Advocates, Inc. v. DeVos , 365 F. Supp. 3d 28, (\"The government contended . . . that because its regulatory impact analysis was conducted pursuant to Executive Orders, it is not subject to judicial review. . . . These arguments are contrary to D.C. Circuit pre cedent . Because the government relied on its cost -benefit analysi s . . . a flaw in that analysis can render the regulation arbitrary and capricious. \"). 54 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 55 of 93 explained in the comments, and in turn explain why DHS chose not to credit them. See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Zinke , 900 F.3d 1053, 1068 -69 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding agency action arb itrary and capricious where the agency did not explain why it did not credit available data that did not s upport its action). Defendants are correct that DHS was not requ ired to parse costs and benefits precisely. But t o the extent the exact harms are un known or difficult to predict, that does not justify \"disregarding the effect entirely.\" Pub. Citizen v. F ed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin. , 374 F.3d 1209, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 2 004). Here, e ven under the deferential APA analysis, DHS appears to have wholly faile d to engage with this entire category of comments. DHS failed to grapple with the Rule's predictable effects on local governments, and instead concluded that the harms \u2014 whatever they may be \u2014are an acceptable price to pay. At minimum, t he APA requires more than r eading public comments and responding with a general statement that , however correct the comments m ay be, the agency declines to consider the issues and costs ident ified because doing so would contravene the government's favored policy. For example, under the heading \"Increased Costs to Health Care Providers, States, and Localities,\" the government summ arized the comments it was responding to: Many commenters part icularly emphasized that disenrollment or foregoing enrollment would be detrimental t o the financial stability and economy of communities, States, local organizations, hospitals, safety net p roviders, foundations, and healthcare centers. Commenters offerin g estimates on the number of people who would disenroll from Medicaid under the propo sed rule warned that the costs associated with the resultant rise in uncompensated care would be borne by health systems, hospitals, and insured patients. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,312. The government's response, in part, was: Response: With respect to the rul e's potential \"chilling effects\" or disenrollment impacts, DHS notes (1) the rule's overriding consid eration, i.e., the Government's interest as set forth in PRWORA, is a sufficient basis to move forward; (2) it is difficult to predict the rule's dise nrollment impacts with respect to the regulated population, although DHS has attempted to do so in the acc ompanying Final Regulatory Impact Analysis; and (3) it is also difficult to predict the rule's disenrollment impacts with respect to people who are no t regulated by this rule, 55 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 56 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California although, again, DHS has attempted to do so in the accompanying Final Regulatory Impact Analysis. First, as discussed above, this rule is rationally related to the Government's interest, as set fo rth in PRWORA, to: (1) Minimize t he incentive of aliens who attempt to immigrate to, or adjust status in the United States due to the avail ability of public benefits; and (2) Promote the self -sufficiency of aliens within the United States. DHS has defined public benefits by focusing on cash assistance programs for income maintenance, and an exhaustive list of non -cash food, housing, and heal thcare, designed to meet basic living needs. This definition does not include benefits related exclusively to emergen cy response, immunization, educat ion, or social services, nor does it include exclusively state and local non -cash aid programs. DHS acknow ledges that individuals subject to this rule may decline to enroll in, or may choose to disenroll from, public benefi ts for which they may be eligible under PRWORA, in order to avoid negative consequences as a result of this final rule. However, DHS has a uthority to take past, current, and likely future receipt of public benefits into account, even where it may ultimate ly result in discouraging aliens from receiving public benefits. Although individuals may reconsider their receipt of public benefits as d efined by this rule in light of future immigration consequences, this rule does not prohibit an alien from obtaining a public benefit for which he or she is eligible. DHS expects that aliens seeking lawful permanent resident status or nonimmigrant status i n the United States will make purposeful and well -informed decisions commensurate with the immigration status they ar e seeking. But regardless, DHS declines to limit the effect of the rulemaking to avoid the possibility that individuals subject to this rul e may disenroll or choose not to enroll, as self -sufficiency is the rule's ultimate aim. Second, DHS finds it difficult to predict how this rule will affect aliens subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility, because data limitations provide ne ither a precise count nor reasonable estimate of the number of aliens who are both subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and are eligible for public benefits in the United States. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that most applic ants subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and therefore this rule are ge nerally unlikely to suffer negative consequences resulting f rom past receipt of public benefits because they will have been residing outside of the United States and therefore, ineligible to have ever received public benefits. . . . . Third, DHS finds i t difficult to predict the rule's disenrollment impacts with respect to people who are not regulated by this rule, such as people who erroneously believe themselves t o be affected. . . . This rule does not prohibit or otherwise discourage individuals who a re not subject to the public charge 56 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 57 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California inadmissibility from rec eiving any public benefits for which they are eligible. . . . . Because DHS will not consider the recei pt of public benefits by U.S. citizens and aliens not subject to public charge inadmissibi lity, the receipt of public benefits by these individuals wi ll not be counted against or made attributable to immigrant family members who are subject to this rule. Accordingly, DHS believes that it would be unwarranted for U.S. citizens and aliens exempt from public charge inadmissibility to disenroll from a publi c benefit program or forego enrollment in response to this rule when such individuals are not subject to t his rule. DHS will not alter this rule to account for such unwarranted choices. DHS appre ciates the potential effects of confusion regarding the rule 's scope and effect, as well as the potential nexus between public benefit enrollment reduction and food insecurity, housing scarcity, public health and vaccinations, education health -based servic es, reimbursement to health providers, and increased costs t o states and localities. In response to comments, DHS will also issue clear guidance that identifies the g roups of individuals who are not subject to this rule, including, but not limited to, U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad who are not considered applicants for admission, and refugees. . . . . In sum, DHS does not beli eve that it is sound policy to ignore the longstanding self -sufficiency goals set forth by Congress or to admit or grant adjustment of status applicat ions of aliens who are likely to receive public benefits designated in this rule to meet their basic livin g needs in an [sic] the hope that doing so might alleviate food and housing insecurity, im prove public health, decrease costs to states and localities , or better guarantee health care provider reimbursements. . . . DHS believes that it will ultimately str engthen public safety, health, and nutrition through this rule by denying admission or adjustment of status to aliens who are not likely to be self - sufficient. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,312-14 (footnotes omitted). That answer entirely fails to discuss costs bein g borne by the states, hospitals, or others , other than to say DHS will issue guidance in an effort to mitigate confusion . The answer discusses disen rollment rates being difficult to measure, but flatly refuses to account for certain types of disenrollmen t (for example those who \"erroneously believe themselves to be affected\" and make \"unwarranted choices\" ). DHS's response 57 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 58 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California constitutes a thinly -veiled abdication of the responsibility to consider the issue. Rather than engage, the response simply elides th e issue that the APA requires consideration of . Ending the analysis with the conclusion that \"DHS believes that it will ultimately strengthen public s afety, health, and nutrition through this rule\" fails to show that DHS \"exam ine[d] the relevant data and a rticulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\" Encino Motorcars , 136 755 F.3d 702, 708 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (\" Though an agency 's predictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule are enti tled to deference, deference to such judgments must be based on some logic and evidence, not sheer speculation.\") (internal q uotation marks and citations omitted) . DHS fails to explain how those benefits will come about with any evidentiary support. In fact, a mple e vidence cited in the comments sho ws exactly the opposite \u2014that use of public benefits improves public health and w elfare. DHS's bare assertion to the contrary simply is not enough to satisfy its obligations . Even ignoring the fact that the conclusion lacks a reasoned explanation of how i t was reached, DHS also fails to address why the supposed benefits will outweigh the likely costs (DHS had at this point already declined to discuss what the likely costs are in fa ct are) . Plaintiffs have shown it is likely that, with respect to consideration of costs imposed on states and localities by the Rule, DHS offers no \"path [that] may reason ably be its reasoning. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n , 463 U.S. at 43. Moreover, DHS may not discount an undis puted impact of the Rule simply because DHS believes it is \"unwarranted .\" See Michigan , 135 S. Ct. at 2707 (\"reasonabl e regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to t he advantages and the disadvantages of agency decisions \"). DHS flatly refused to c onsider the costs associated with predicted, likely disenrollment of those not subject to the public charge determinati on by stating : \"DHS believes that it would be unwarra nted for U.S. citizens and aliens exempt from public charge inadmissibility to dise nroll from a public benefit program or 58 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 59 of 93 forgo enrollment in response to this rule when such individuals are not subject to this rule. DHS will not alter this rule to account for such unwarranted choices.\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,313. But DHS's disagreement with the so urce of a cost does not make it go away, and it does not discharge DHS 's obligation to consider it. DHS must consider t he costs of widespread disenrollment that it anticipates \u2014it cannot ignore costs by calling their cause s \"unwarranted.\" Plaintiffs have shown it is likely that DHS understood that individuals would disenroll even though they are not subject to th e public char ge determination, yet DHS refus ed to consider that cost entirely. Doing so would have been arbitrary and capricious. Michigan , 135 S.

Health Effects Plaintiffs argue that DHS ignored commen ts describing how loss of benefits would trigger negative health consequences, including the spread of disease and aggravation of chronic illness. DHS received ample commentary regarding thi s issue. See, e.g. , 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,384 (summarizing certain comments); Cho Decl. , Ex. M at 4 (Kaiser Permanente comment linking the rule's impacts on prescription adh erence with increased chance of outbreaks of co mmunicable disease) , Ex. N at 9 (Pub. Health Inst. Comment: \"We cannot achieve universally agreed upon public healt h goals, such as reducing 59 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 60 of 93 chronic diseases throughout the U.S., when we directly or indirectly d eny large segments of our population the very b uilding blocks they need for good health\") , Ex. O at 4 (Nat'l Assoc. Ped. Nurse Practitioners comment discussing \"worse health outcomes\") , P at 7 (Children's HealthWatch ing of \"increased prevalence of communicable diseases\") . Defendants offer the same general defenses in response. First, DHS read the comments, but the forward -looking impact to health was too difficult to assess . Second, even if DHS had assessed those costs, they would be outweighed by the benefit s of excluding aliens who would rely on public benefits and promoting self -sufficiency of aliens already in the United States . Those benefits are in line with Congressional statements of policy. Relevantly here, similar negative heal th outcomes were a key rationale for prior agency action. When issuing the 1999 guidance, INS described its primary motivation \"to reduce th e negative public health consequences generated by the existing confusion.\" 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689; see als o id. at 28,692 (adopting regu lation on an interim basis because \"confusion . . has deterred eligible [immigrants] and their families, incl uding U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits,\" and that \"reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact not just on the potential recipients, but on public health and the general welfare\"). In reversing the 1999 g uidance, defendants must \" 'display awareness that it is changing position ' and 'show that there are good reasons fo r the new policy. '\" Encino Mo torcars , 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (quoting FCC v. Fox, 556 U.S. at 515). Moreover, where the prior policy engendered reliance, \" a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy .\" Id. Under the heading \"Vaccinations,\" the gove rnment summarized the c omments it was responding to: Commenters indicated that the public charge rule would make immigrant families afraid to seek health -care, including vaccinations against communicable diseas es, and therefore, 60 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 61 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California endanger the U.S. popula tion. . . . . The comm enter indicated that engaging with the public health system was critical to ensuring robust immunization to protect the population overall; if a subset of the community were fearful to acces s government healthcare services, regardles s of whether a specific type of service qualified for a narrow exception, it would have a significant impact on the country's ability to protect and promote the public health. Another commenter indicated that its health department anticipated that promulg ation of the rule, as w ritten in the NPRM, will result in decreased utilization of children's healthcare, including vaccinations, which will increase the risk for vaccine preventable diseases . . . increasing the likelihood of an outbreak. Some commente rs stated that since ma ny immigrants live in communities alongside people of the same national origin, reduced vaccinations could result in unvaccinated or under - vaccinated clusters of individuals. Commenters war ned that research shows that uninsured indi viduals are much less l ikely to be vaccinated. One commenter stated that a recent study found that even a five percent reduction in vaccine coverage could trigger a significant measles outbreak. . . . Another commenter stated that the rule would increase the incidence of childhood diseases like chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella and deter parents from vaccinating their children. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,384. The government's response was: With this rulemaking, DH S does not intend to restrict the access of vaccines for children or adults or intend to discourage individuals from obtaining the necessary vaccines to prevent vaccine -preventable diseases. The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure that those seeking a dmission to the United States are self -sufficient and rely on them selves or family and friends for support instead of relying on the government for subsistence. As noted above, this final rule does not consider receipt of Medicaid by a child under age 21, or during a person's pregnancy, to constit ute receipt of public b enefits. This should address a substantial portion, though not all, of the vaccinations issue. Vaccinations obtained through public benefits programs are not considered public benefits und er 8 CFR 212.21(b), although if an alien en rolls in Medicaid for t he purpose of obtaining vaccines, the Medicaid itself qualifies as a public benefit. DHS also notes that free or low cost vaccines are available to children who are not insured or underinsu red through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. In addition, local health centers and state health departments provide preventive services that include vaccines that may be offered on a sliding scale fee based on income. Therefore, DHS believes that vaccines would still be available for chil dren and adults even if they disenroll from Medicaid. 61 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 62 of 93 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,384-85 (footnotes omitted) . DHS's response to the comments was essentially that it understood that fewer people would get vaccines following the Rule , which would present a risk , but there are ways to get vaccines without Medicaid . As a result, DHS acknowledge d that fewer people will get vaccines, but it failed engage at all in the consequences of that fact. Plaintiffs have demonstrated a l ikelihood of success based upon this argume nt. This change d eparts from a longstanding prior policy , as explained in the 1999 Field Guid ance , that is likely to have engendered reliance . That guide explained that certain rules were needed because uncertai nty had \"deterred eligible aliens and their families, including U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits[, which] . . . has an adverse impact not just on the potential recipients , but on public health and the general welf are.\" 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692 (emphasis added). Given that the 1999 Field Guid ance was both longstanding precedent and specifically concerned benefits supporting general public health ( not simple health of the aliens \u2014e.g., vaccines), DHS must provide \" a reasoned explanation . . . for dis regarding facts and circ umstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy .\" FCC v. Fox , 556 U.S. at 515-16; accord Encino sistency in agency policy is a reas on for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice \") (internal quotation marks omitted) . Although DHS acknowledged departure from the 1999 Field Guidance as a general matter ( e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,307-08), DHS simply declined to engage with certain, identified public -health consequences of the Rule. It made no attempt, whatsoever, to investigate the type or magnitude of harm that would flow from the reality which it admittedl y recognized would result \u2014fewer peo ple would be vaccinated. Instead, and just as with its refusal to consider \" unwarranted \" choices to disenroll from Medicaid discussed above, DHS responded only that it \"believes that vaccines would still be available\" th rough some other ch annels. The res ponse is devoid of rational e, but additionally it fails entirely to provide a reasoned explanation for disregarding the facts 62 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 63 of 93 and circumstances underlying the prior policy . C. Form I-944 Plaintiffs argue that defendants' estimate of the time and cost burde n that the new Form I -944, entitled Declaration of Self Sufficiency , will have on applicants is implausible. They argue that the Rule provides too -low of an estimate for the time required to fill out the form , based on i ts estimate about the time it takes to fill out another related form. They argue that DHS did not adequately consider the differences between the forms when arriving at their estimate. Yet DHS considered and responded to comments regarding th e time commi tment required by Form I -944. In r esponse DHS modified the form, removed some duplicative questions, and explained that it is important to be filed separately because it is filed by the immigrant himself . 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,484. Plaintiffs have not demo nstrated a likelihood of success or serious questions with respect to this argument. ii. Other Challenges Plaintiffs raise a number of other procedural challenges under the APA. The court finds that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihoo d of success on the merits or serious questions with respect to any, and it will address some of them brief ly. Plaintiffs argue that the Rule stops treating sponsors' affidavits of support as sufficient assurance that immigrant applicants will not become overly depend ent on public benefits , yet Congres s specified in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii) that the executive simply \"may also\" consider such affidavits . Although plaintiffs argue that in practice USCIS has accepted affidavits of support as conclusive , the controlling sta tute and 1999 Field Guidance m ake clear that this is not a change in policy . See 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,690 ( \"Where such an AOS has been filed on an alien's behalf, it should be considered along with the statutory factors in the public charge determination. \"). Plaint iffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because DHS included an exemption for individuals under the age of 21 who receive Medicaid benefits, but did not include a similar exemption for individuals under the age of 21 who receive SNAP benefi ts. DHS 63 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 64 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California considered this issue and provide d a reason ed explanation for providing Medicaid to children, including that it can provide funding for \"in -school health services and serve as an important way to ensure that children receive the vaccines needed to protect public health and welfare.\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,380. Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because the statute requires consideration of \"education and skills \" and \"health,\" but the Rule requires a much more searching inquiry into health tha n education and skil ls. For example, t he Rule considers details about an individual's health insurance, benefits receipt, and financial status of household members, but inconsistently fails to take into account admission or attendance in a college or trade school. But the R ule in fact allows for consideration of admission or attendance in a college or trade school , and DHS adequately addressed these issues in response to comments. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,436 (\"the exact nature of the education (or lac k thereof) and employmen t would have to be con sidered \"). Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because it consider s past immigration - related fee waivers , which may be submitted before a noncitizen is legally eligible to work and as a result punish that individual for applying to work legally . DHS adequately responded, noting that \"[s]ince fee waivers are based on an inability to pay, seeking or obtaining a fee waiver for an immigration benefit suggests an inability to be self - sufficient.\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,424-25. Plaintiff s argue the Rule is in consistent because Medicaid use by pregnant women or children (who are not penalized for using Medicaid under the rule) is counted against them, because Medicaid is not counted as an asset that could offset the negative factor of thei r illness that Medicai d is paying to treat. Plaintiffs argue that is not consistent, because private insurance is considered an asset. Defendants argue that the Rule does not count a severe medical condition as a heavily weighed n egative factor if the al ien has \"the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to such medical condition,\" and such \"financial resources\" can include Medicaid benefits for those pregnant or under 21. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,504 (\"resources . . . to pay for reasonably 64 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 65 of 93 foreseeable medical costs\" includes \"health insurance not designated as a public benefit under 8 CFR 212.21(b)\"). Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because an income of 125% of the federal poverty guideline rate counts as a posi tive factor, yet individuals whose incomes exceed that qualify for non -cash benefits considered under the Rule. But not all factors in a multifactor test are required to align in outcome to be rational . Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because while it considers large f amily size as a negative factor in a public charge assessment, DHS's own data indicates that non -cash benefit is higher among families of three than families of four, and that noncitizens' use of cash benefits decreases as family size grows. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,395. The parties appear to disagree about which studies are \"good studies\" here, but DHS's response explained its interpretation of the studies and concluded that \"the data properly reflect s that receipt of noncash benefits gen erally increases with an increase in family size.\" Id. Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because it considers the mere application for benefits in the public charge determination. Plaintiffs argue that an appli cation for benefits does not indicate a noncitizen is actual ly financially and otherwise eligible for the benefit or will decide to use the benefit. DHS reasonably explained that an \"application for a public benefit is not the same as receipt but is indic ative of an alien's intent to receive such a benefit.\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422. Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because it is ultimately a vague and entirely unpredictable framework for weighing the statutorily -authorized and newly -added factors , which results in limitless discretion . The precise nature of the procedural challenge is unclear here, but the underlying statute requires consideration of \"at minimum\" five factors, and then specifically mentions another factor that \"may\" be con sidered. Moreover, the statu te specifically targets those who are l ikely to be a public charge \"in the opinion of the Attorney General ,\" who as DHS recognized has long been given discretion to make such determinations under the statute. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,398 (\"DHS notes that officer discretion is n ot a new concept in US CIS immigration benefits adjudications.\"). 65 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 66 of 93 Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because some factors are actually determinative, and impossible to overcome because t he factors significa ntly overlap. As a result, t he Rule funnels o fficials' decision -making towards favoring high -income individuals at the expense of the poor and other marginalized groups. To the extent plaintiffs challenge the Rule favoring admission of the wealthy over t he poor , the plaintiffs' appropriate target is the underlying statut e rather than the Rule implementing it. The statute itself calls for consideration of a number of factors, ultimately aimed at excluding from the country a group comprise d of those who ar e more likely to be poor than rich. d. Zone of Interests In order to succeed on the merits, plaintiffs must be within the zone of interests of the statute that forms the basis of their challenge. The zone of interests analysis asks \"whether Congress creat ed a private cause of action in legislation \" (Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep't of Agric. , 795 F.3d 956, 964 (9th Cir. 2015) ), such that \" this particular class of persons has a right to sue under this substantive statute \" (Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. , 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014) ). It is \" not a question of Article III standing \" (Organized Vill. of Kake , 795 F.3d at 964), but rather is more appropriately assessed with plaintiffs' lik elihood of success. 19 \"[A] person suing under the APA must satisfy not only Article III's standing requirements, bu t an additional test: The interest he asserts must be 'arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute' t hat he says was violated.\" Match -E-Be-Nash -She-Wish B and of Pottawatomi Indians v. , 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012 ) (quoting Ass'n of Data Processing Serv.

In cases wher e the plaintiff is not itself the subject of the conte sted regulatory action, the test denies a right of review if the plai ntiff's interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit. The test is not meant to be especially demanding; in particular, there need be no indication of congressional purpose to benefit the would -be plaintiff.\" Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass'n , 479 U.S. 388, 399 -400 (1987) (footnote omitted); see also Pottawatomi Indians , 567 U.S. at 225-26 (2012). \"Whether a plaintiff comes within th e 'zone of interests' is an issue that requires us to determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff 's claim.\" Lexmark , 572 U.S. at 127. \"In answering t his question, w e recognize that 'the breadth of the [applicable] zone of interests va ries according to the provisions of law at issue.'\" Sierra Club v. Trump , 929 F.3d 670, 700 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Lexmark , 572 U.S. at 130). \"When the [Supreme] Court has applied the zone of interests test in APA actions, however, it has analyze d the zone of interests of the statute the agency is alleged to have violated, not any zone of interests of the APA itself. \" Id. at 702; accord Mendoza v.

For example, t hat statute allows the Attorney General to consider an affidavit of support under 8 U.S. Code \u00a71183a when determining whether to exclude an alien as a lik ely public charge. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(4)( B)(ii). Although distinct, Section 1183a is specifically referred to and incorporated into the public charge analysis set out in the ch allenged statute. As a result, \u00a71183a has an integral relationship with \u00a7 1182(a)(4) , such that it should be considered when determining whether plaintiffs are within the zone of interest s of the challenged statute. Section 1183a explains that someone ca n sponsor an alien by guaranteeing to financially support him, and thereb y alleviate the concern that he may become a public charge. That statute also provides that any such sponsorship can only be considered in the public charge analysis if it is support ed by an affidavit that is \"l egally enforceable against the sponsor by . . . any State (or any political subdivision of such State), or by any other entity that provides any means -tested public benefit [.]\" \u00a7 1183a (a)(1)(B); see also \u00a7 1183a (b)(1)(A) (\" Upon notification that a sponsored alien has received any means - 69 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 70 of 93 tested publi c benefit, the . . . appropriate entity of the Federal Government, a State, or any political subdivision of a State shall request rei mbursement by the sponsor in an amount which is equal to the unreimbursed costs of such benefit. \"). Moreover, the sponsor must agree to submit to jurisdiction in state courts for actions to compel reimbursement of benefits those states paid to the alien. \u00a7\u00a71183a (a)(1)(C), (e)(2). By recognizing that states (and political subdivisions of states) would be paying means -tested public benefits to those subject to a public charge analysis, requiring that states and their subdivisions have legally -enforceable righ ts to recover those expenses when an alien is admitted based on consideration of an affidavit of support, and guarantee ing state -court jurisdiction for such enforcement actions, Congress clearly intended to protect states and their political subdivisions w ith the challenged statute. Moreover, given the attention paid to states' rights to recover payment of \"any means -tested public benefit\" from affiants in \u00a71183a , it is also more than arguable that Congress intended to protect states and their political subdivisions' coffers when providing for the exclusion of any alien \" likely at any time to become a public charge \" in the first place. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)( 4)(A). So, the State and County plaintiffs ' financial interest s are also at least arguably protected by the statute for this inde pendent reason. Therefore , the States' and Counties' interests are more than arguably related to the challenge d statute's purp ose, and they satisfy the zone -of-interests requirement . ii. The Organizations The Organizations move for an injunction based on one claim that the Rule violates the APA because it is substantively contrary to the term \"public charge\" as used in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4 ), and a related procedural APA claim based on the same underlying statute . As such, the Organizations must be within th at statute's zone of interest. Their papers argue that they are within the statute's zone of interest s for three reasons . First, the Rule itself count s health care providers and nonprofit organizations among those who will be affected by it. Second, plaintiffs' interests in serving low - 70 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 71 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California income, immigrant communities by providing medical or legal services and advice are related to and consistent with the statute's purpose to provide procedures and policies for immigration relief . Third, and relatedly, the Ninth Circuit has recently held that similar plaintiffs are within the INA's zone of interests . First, the Organizations argue the Rule itself contempla tes that organizations like them will be adversely affected by it. But being negatively affected by a rule implementing a statute is not sufficient to establish that the statute conferred a cause of action encompass ing that plaintiff's claim. The Organizations' argument that they will be hurt by the Rule speaks to t heir standing to challenge it, rather than whether they are within the statute's zone of interest. See Air Courier Conference , 498 U.S. at 524 (\"injury in fact do es not necessarily mean one is within the zone of interests to be protected by a given statute \"); see also Lujan , 497 U.S. at 883 (\"for example, the failure of an agency to comply with a statutory provision requiring 'on th e record ' hearings would assuredly have an adverse effect upon the company that has the contract to record and transcribe the agency's proceedings; but since the pro vision was obviously enacted to protect the interests of the parties to the proceedings and not those of the reporters, that c ompany would not be 'adversely affected within the meaning ' of the statute \"). Second , the Organizations argue that their interests align with the statute. Yet their briefing failed to identify or explain what statutory provisions support their argument . That failure is fatal given the Supreme Court's direction that the zone of interests analysis \"requires us to determine, using tra ditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred ca use of action encompasses a particular plainti ff's claim.\" Lexmark , 572 U.S. at 127. When asked at the hearing what sp ecific statutory provisions they are relying upon, the Organizations for the fir st time identified 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611. That section outlines the federal public benefits for which alien s are eligible. But the Organizations do not assert a challenge based on a violation of \u00a7 1611, and it is not at all clear that \u00a7 1611 has \"any integral relationship with\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4) such that it is proper for the court to consider it in the zo ne of interests inquiry. See Air Courier 71 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 72 of 93 Conference , 498 U.S. at 529 (without a particular reason to suggest otherwise, sections within the same act are not sufficiently related); cf. Clarke , 479 U.S. at 401 (considering related statutory section to which challenged statute was an exception). Even if the court were to consider \u00a7 1611, the Organizations leave the court to guess at what connection those statutory provisions share, much less how 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4 ) is related to the Organizations' purpose s in light of \u00a7 1611. Finally, the Organizations do not even explain how their interests are more than marginally related to \u00a7 1611 itself\u2014which does not even \" give institutions like the Organizations a role [.]\" E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 769. At this stage of litigation, the Organizations have not met their burden to demonstrate that there are serious questions concerning whether they are within the challenged statut e's zone of interest, and certainly they have failed to demonstrate a likelihood t hat they are able to bring the APA actions underlying their present motion. Taking a step back, the Organizations simply fail to explain how their interests relate to \u00a7 1182(a )(4)'s purpose of excluding immigrants likely to become public charges. This may be because the Organizations identify , without explanation, the statute's purpose as provid ing \"procedures and policies for immigration relief .\" That may be based on an argu ment about the INA's overall statutory purpose, untethered to the statutory challenge underlying this motion . In support of that argument, the Organ izations rely on E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 771. But the statute at issue in that action concerned asylum seekers, and the very statute underlyi ng that challenge contained a provision requiring the Attorney General to refer asylum seekers to pro bono legal aid organizations , such as t he plaintiff entities in that action . The court identified specific references to the role of pro bono legal organ izations within the challenged statute itself, and it found that was sufficient . That is very different from the facts presented here. See E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 768 (\"Within the asylum statute [underlying the preliminary injunction, 8 U.S.C . \u00a7 1158(a)(1) ], Congress took steps to ensure that pro bono legal services of the type that the Organizations provide are available to asylum 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 73 of 93 seekers. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(4)(A) -(B)\").20 2. Plaintiffs are Likely to Suffer Irreparable Harm The three distin ct issues of ( i) standing, ( ii) ripeness, and ( iii) irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction are su pported by the same factual analysis for each plaintiff . Although each of the three requirements is independent for plaintiffs to succee d on this motion, a finding that plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction here is sufficient to establish standing and ripeness . For the Organizations, the court assesses only standing and ripeness. The court first addresses the legal standards, and then assesses each plaintiff's demonstrated harms. a. Legal Standards i. Standing Federal courts may adjudicate only actual cases or controversies, see U.S. Const. Art. III, \u00a7 2, and may not render advisory opinions as to what the la w ought to be or affecting a dispute that has not yet arisen. Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 240 (1937). Article III's \"standing\" requirements limit the court's subject matter jurisdiction. Cmty. v. Bush , 386 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 2004). The burden of establishing standing rests on the party asserting the c laim. Renne v. Geary , 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991). The \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elemen ts. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact \u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Second, there must be a causal connection bet ween the injury and the c onduct complained of \u2014the injury has to be fairly traceable to the 20 To the extent the Organizations argue that E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 771 allows this court to look to unrelated provisions in the INA for a section justifying their interest in the action, the co urt is at a loss as how to how reconcile that interpret ation with Bennett , 520 U.S. at 175-76, Air Courier Conference , 498 U.S. at 529, and Pit River Tribe , 793 F.3d at 1157 . Absent clarity from an en banc determination of this issue , the court hews to Supreme Court and prior panel authority on the question. 73 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 74 of 93 challenged action of the defendant, and n ot the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court. Third, it must be likely, as opposed to m erely speculative, that t he injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 -61 (19 92) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Spokeo Inc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). \"At lea st one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested, and that party bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive s tages of the litigation .\" E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 763-64 (internal quotation marks and cita tions omitted) . At this preliminary stage, plaintiffs \"may rely on the allegations in their Complaint and whatever other evidence they submitted in support of their\" motion to meet their burden. Id. at 764. They \"need on ly establish a risk or threat of injury to satisfy the actual injury requirem ent.\" Id. Organization s can establish standing two different ways. First, \"Organizations can demonst rate organizational standing by showing that the challenged 'practices have pe rceptibly impaired [their] ability diversion -of-resources inju ry is sufficient to establish organizational standing for purposes of Article III if the organization shows that, independen t of the litigation, the challenged policy frustrates the organization's goals and requires the organization to expend resources in representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (citing inter alia , Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Bea ch, 657 F.3d 936, 943 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (advocacy groups had organizational standing to challenge an anti -solicitati on ordinance that targeted day laborers based on the resources spent by the groups in assisting day laborers during their arrests a nd meetings with workers about the status of the ordinance ); Nat'l Council of La Raza v.

Whiting , 732 F.3 d 1006 , 1018 (9th Cir. 2013) (finding organizational standing where the plaintiffs \"had to divert resources to educational programs to add ress its members ' and volunteers ' concerns about the [challenged] law's effect\") ). In E. Bay Sanctuary I, the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs established organizational standing by declaring that enforcement of a regulation \"frustrated their mission of providing legal aid\" to asylum applicants by \"significantly discourage[ing] a large number of those individuals from seeking asylum given their ineligibility.\" 932 F.3d at 766. That regulation would require plaintiffs \"to partially convert their affirmative asylum practice into a removal defense program, an overhau l that would require 'developing new training materials ' and 'significant training of existing staff. '\" Id. \"Finally, the [plaintiff] Organizations have each undertaken, and will continue to undertake, education and outreach initiatives regarding the new rule, efforts that require the diversion of resources a way from othe r efforts to provide legal services to their local immigrant communities.\" Id. Second, \"Organizations can demonstrate organizational standing by showing that the Rule will cause them to lose a substantial amount of funding. For standing purp oses, a loss of even a small amount of money is ordinarily an 'injury.' We have held that an organization that suffers a decreased amount of business and lost revenues due to a government policy easily satisfies the 'injury in fact' standing requirement.\" Id. at 766-67 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 75 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 76 of 93 In E. Bay Sanctuary I, the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs establ ished organizational standing by declaring that they received a large portion of their funding based on the number of asyl um applications they pursue, and that if their prospective clients \"became categorically ineligible for asylum, East Bay would lose a significant amount of business and suffer a concomitant loss of funding.\" Id. at 767. ii. Ripeness \"Ripeness is an Artic le III doctrine designed to ensure that courts adjudicate live cases or con troversies and do not 'issue advisory opinions [or] declare rights in hypothetical cases.' A proper ripeness inquiry contains a constitutional and a prudential component.\" Bishop Paiute Tribe v. Inyo Cty. , 1153 (9th Cir. 2017) (citations omitted). \"For a case to be ripe, it must present issues that are definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract. Constitutional ripeness is often treated under the rubric of standin g because ripeness coincides squarely with standing's injury in fact prong.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm'n , 220 F.3d 1134, 11 38-39 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"Sorting out where standing ends an d ripeness begins is not an easy task. . . . . [I]n 'measuring whether the litigant has asserted an injury that is real and concrete rather than speculative and hypothetical, the ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with standing.'\" ). Allegations t hat a \"threat\" to a \"concrete interest is actual and imminent\" are sufficient to allege \"an injury in fact that meets the requirements of constitutional ripeness.\" Bishop Paiute Tribe , 863 F.3d at 1154 . Therefore, if plaintiffs satisfy the Article III standing requirements under Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , addressed above, the action here is r ipe. In this case, the analysis for both requirements is the same. See, e.g. , Thomas , 220 F.3d at 1139 (\"Whether the question is viewed as one of standing or ripen ess, the Constitution mandates that prior to our exercise of jurisdiction there exist a constitutional 'case or controversy,' that the issues presented are 'definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.' . . .

Nat'l Park Hosp. Ass'n v. Dep't of Interior , 538 U.S. 803, 812 (2003). However, an issue may not be ripe for review if \"further factual development would 'significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issues presented.'\" Id. iii. Irreparable Harm \"A plaintiff seeki ng preliminary relief must 'demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.'\" California v. Azar , 911 F.3d 558, 581 ( 9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Winter , 555 U.S. at 22) ; Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp. , 822 F.3d 1011, 1023 (9th C ir. 2016) (\"A threat of irreparable harm is sufficiently immediate to warrant preliminary injunctive relief if the plaintiff 'is likely to suffer irre parable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered.'\") (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22)). \"There must be a 'sufficient causal connection' between the alleged irreparable harm and the activity to be enjoined, and showing that 'the requested inju nction would forestall' the irreparable harm qualifies as such a connection.\" Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v.

Azar, 911 F.3d at 581 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 ). b. The Plaintiffs' Harms First, the court assess es the Counties' and States' standing, the ripeness of their claims, and whether they have demonstrated irreparable harm in absence of an injunction. Second, the court assesses the Organizations' standin g and the ripeness of their claims. i. The States and Counties The States and Counties argue that they will suffer five categories of irreparable harm: (A) loss of federal funds, mostly in Medicaid reimbursement; (B) increased operational costs; (C) incre ased costs to their own healthcare operations (D) p ublic health problems and resulting increased costs ; and (E) reduced economic activity due to a decrease in federal funds in the community . A. Loss of Federal Funds The Counties argue that they will lose millions of dollars in federal Medicaid reimbursemen t funds. Each provide s a broad array of health services to low -income residents, many of which are at least partially reimbursed with federal Medicaid dollars. DHS itself estimates that 2.5% of individu als in households with a noncitizen will disenroll from Medicaid, which would translate to a roughly $7.5 million loss in Medicaid reimbursement funds. The States similarly argue that DHS itself estimates that the Ru le will cause a reduction in payments from the federal government due to disenrollment or foregone enrollment by eligible individuals to be over $1.5 billion , nationwide . 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,26 7-69. Defendants argue the harm is too speculative, caused only by third -party actions , and not immin ent because the merits can be resolved quickly on su mmary judgment . Defendants argue that even assuming a 2.5% rate of disenrollment, plaintiffs fail to show that the States and Counties will be harmed, rather than individual s residing within their 78 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 79 of 93 bounda ries. Defendants argue that harm individual citizen s will suffer cannot support the States and Counties claims of irreparable harm . Finally, d efendants argue that any financial harms the States and Counties identify are not sufficiently large to establis h irreparable harm . First, regarding the speculati ve nature of the harm, defendants themselves predict a 2.5% disenrollment rate when assessing the Rule , subject to the procedural requirements of the APA . 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463. The Rule itself also es timated that it will cause a reduction in payments f rom the federal government due to disenrollment or foregone enrollment by eligible individuals of over $1.5 billion. 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,26 7- 69; see also Cisne ros Decl. A at 98 -99, Table 18 (annual estima tes of $1.46 billion to $4.37 billion in reduced pay ments). Those figures, which underl ie DHS's analysis in support of the Rule pursuant to the APA's requirements , are not speculative conjectures as to what might possibly occur . They are meant to be seri ous efforts by an agency to assess the impact of a p roposed rule , and it is difficult to fathom how defendants can argue otherwise . And plaintiffs offer sufficient evidence to demonstrate that disenrollment or non-enrollments will reach at least that leve l. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463 25. This type of predictable result from a broad policy, although not precise to the level of the individual actor, is sufficiently -specific to allege irreparable harm. See Dep't of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565 (2019) . Moreover, plaintiffs offer evidence showing that disenrollment due t o the public charge rulemaking has already 18 -22. Plaintiffs offer strong evidence that disenrollment is likely to continue b etween now and the resolution of this issue on the m erits, absent an injunction. Plaintiffs also adequately demonstrate that the loss of Medicaid reimbursement is sure to be immediate, once individuals disenroll. That is apparent from the very 79 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 80 of 93 mechanics of the harm. Today, the States and Counties are pa rtially reimbursed by the federal government for care provided to Medicaid enrollees. As individuals disenro ll, the plaintiffs will no longer be reimbursed for treating them . This will have obvious adve rse budgetary consequences. For one, there will ind isputably be fewer individuals covered by Medicaid seek ing treatment . So, the States and Counties will not be reimbursed for treating those disenrolled individuals (whether they treat them or not). T he States and Counties would experience this terminated revenue stream even if they turned away patients without medical insuranc e (which they will not) . Put differently, there will be fewer people on Medicaid to treat and get reimbursed for. To the extent defendants argue that the mechanics will work out as a budgetary boon to plaintiffs, the argument is not plausible in the cont ext of this preliminary injunction motion. Although it could potentially work out as a total budgetary savings for the plaintiff entities if they reconfigured their operations, redu ced staff, reduced provision of services, and undertook other cost -savings measures , such savings could not plausibly be realized prior to the determination of this action's merits. See, e.g. , Lorenz Dec l. \u00b6\u00b6 19-22. Instead, the plaintiffs will be contin uing to operate with most of the costs and expectations associated with the status quo, with one change \u2014no reimbursement s. Second, the States and Counties' argument regarding loss of Medicaid funding does not rely on harms to their citizens. Rather, the a rguments concern the plaintiffs' own loss of funds. Third, plaintif fs must demonstrate that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm, but they need not establish a particular quantum of harm to satisfy the requirement. Azar, 911 F.3d at 581 (irreparable harm \"analysis focuses on irreparability, 'irrespective of the magnitude of the injury'\" ). Nor do defendants explain why San Francisco's likely loss of $7.5 million in Medicaid re imbursements (based on a 2.5% disenrollment rate) is not sufficiently large even under their theory of the requirement. See Wagner Decl. \u00b6 5 . Santa Clara similarly est imates $4.6 million in foregone Medicaid fund s due to more conservative 1.9% decline in enrollment.

The States similarly demonstrate the harms they are likely to suffer from the loss of Medicaid reimbursements . See Cantwell Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 14 (2.5 million nonciti zen Medicaid beneficiaries in California); Ferrer Decl. \u00b6 19 (predicted disenrollment figures in L.A. County); Lucia Decl. \u00b6 23 (estimates of $957 million in lost funding in California, assuming 15% disenrollment rate) ; Buhrig I Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8, 10, 27 (330,00 0 Pennsylvania Medicaid beneficiaries are part of a household with a noncitizen ); Allen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 18, 36-40 (63,000 noncitizens participate in the Oregon Health Plan system, a federal/state partnership program ; other participants are citizen children part of a household with a noncitizen ); Byrd Decl. \u00b6 \u00b6 18-20 & Ex.

B. Increased Operational Costs The States argue that the Rule will impose burdens on their ongoing operations. Defendants argue that such costs a re self -imposed and not cognizable. Governmental administrative costs caused by changes in federal policy are cognizable injuries. See Cal. v. Trump , 267 F. by a disruption to h ealthcare exchanges they administer were sufficient to demonstrate standing) (collecting cases); see also Azar, 911 F.3d at 573 -74.21 The Counties have submitted evidence of cognizable, irreparable costs.

Johnson , 783 F.3d 244, 253 -54 (5th Cir. 2015) , which addressed individual public employee claims (not claims by the public entity itself) that they might have to change their job practices because of a policy chan ge. 81 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 82 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California continue to be neces sary. E.g., Shing Decl ; M\u00e1rquez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9 -10. San Francisco has submitted evidence of similar measures it has already taken and will continue to take in direct response to the Rule. See Pon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13 -16; Rhore l. \u00b6\u00b6 4 -9. California and Oregon have submitted evidence showing they are likely to imminently suffer similar harms absent an injunction. Ruiz Decl. \u00b6 19 (Calif Salazar Decl. \u00b6 37 (Oregon). Other states submit declarations regarding these issues, but they are too vague or speculative to support issuance of an injunction. E.g., Byrd Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23 (discussing past efforts in D.C. , and stating the Distric t will generally \"need to train staff\" on the issue) ; Probert Decl. \u00b6 16 ( speculation concerning costs Ma ine may face). Additionally, c ertain plaintiff states use Medicaid and SNAP enrollment to automatically certify children into school lunch programs, meaning that those states would face higher administrative costs to certify student eligibility for free lu nch following disenrollment caused by the Rule . To the extent states' administrative costs increase to assess eligibility for free lunch as children d isenroll from the feder al programs (as opposed to merely an increased burden on the applicants) , that adm inistrative cost increase is cognizable harm . California and D.C. submit competent evidence demonstrating that their costs in administering school lun ch program s will increa se. See Palmer Decl. \u00b6 16 (declaring D.C.'s costs would go up to process school lunch applications); Fernandez Decl. \u00b6 30 (declaring California's \"administrative streamlining and efficiency\" will suffer when enrolling students for f ree lunch); see general ly Nevil le- Morgan Decl. \u00b6 22 (in California, \"paperwork is more burdensome for those without an automatic qualification through Medi -Cal or SNAP, and immigrant eligible families are less likely to obtain school lunch benefits in this way\"). These costs tha t the St ates and Counties have identi fied are predictable, likely, and imminent. In fact, DHS specifically contemplated certain of these costs when formulating the Rule. E.g., 83 Fed. Reg. at 51 ,260 (\"The primary sources of the 82 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 83 of 93 consequences and indirect impacts of the proposed rule would be costs to various entities that the rule does not directly regulate, such as hospital systems, state agencies , and other organizations that provide public assistance to aliens and their households . Indirect costs associ ated wit h this rule include familiarization with the rule for those entities that are not directly regulated but still want to understand the changes in federal and state transfer payments due to this rule. \") (emphasis added); see al so 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,389 (\"DHS agrees that some entities, such as State and local governments or other businesses and organizations would incur costs related to the changes commenters identify.\"). Because the States and Counties have each demonstrated suf ficient likely irrepara ble inju ry in the form of loss of federal funds to support a preliminary injunction , and the Counties, California, D.C., and Oregon have demonstrated additional irreparable injury in the form of operational costs , the court need not address the remaining three categories of irreparable harm plaintiffs argue they will imminently suffer . ii. The Organizations \"[C]ourts have an 'independent obligation ' to police their own subject matter jurisdiction, including the parties' standing. Accordingly, we must assur e ourselves that Plaintiffs have alleged an injury in fact, fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct, and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. \" Animal Legal Def. Fund v. United States Dep't of Agric. , 935 F.3d 858, 866 (9th Cir. 201 9) (citations omitted). \"[A] diversion -of-resources injury is sufficient to establish organizational standing for purpose s of Article III if the organization shows that, independent of the litigation, the challenged policy frustrates the organization's goa ls and requires the organization to expend resources in representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways.\" E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 765 (internal quotation marks and citations om itted). Defendants argue that the Organizations fail to i dentify any injury they will suffer if they do not divert resources towards addressing their concerns, apart from harm to the health care they are able to provide to low income communities. For exam ple, i f they 83 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 84 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California failed to divert resources, they would not f ace staff shortages or provide worse health services. In E. Bay Sanctuary I, the court found standing based on an organization partially converting an asylum practice into a removal defense program, a prediction that applications filed on behalf of the org anizations' clients would become more difficult and reduce available funds for other activities, and education and outreach initiatives regarding th e new rule. 932 F.3d at 766; see also, e.g. , El Rescate Legal Services , 959 F.2d at 748 (standing where leg al services groups had expended \"resources in representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways\"); Fair Hous.

These education efforts take away from their ability to serve their core organizational purposes. Moreover, they will have to lay off employee s and change or cancel programs in response to the Rule . Garc\u00eda Decl. \u00b6 18; see also Ku Decl. \u00b6 6 5 (estimating nationwide community health center staffing losses of 3,400 to 6,100 employees). The Legal Organizations' missions are to provide adv ocacy and /or legal services to their clients and members, including obtaining immigration relief and helping to secure public benefits.

Plaintiffs have adequately alleged frustration of their purpose because many of their clients will no longer be eligible for immigration relief , or will choose to not enroll or to disenroll from benefits to remain elig ible for immigration relief. The Rule plainly hinders their clients' ability to obtain immigration relief and/or public benefits. Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged that they will have to divert funding because those who may still be eligible for relief or ch oose to apply for benefits will require additional time and resources from plaintiffs to address the effects of the Rule, and this additional time and rising inel igibility or disenrollment means that plaintiffs will be able to file fewer cases and help few er clients. See Kassa Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36. Some plaintiffs also have increased operational costs as they address the impact of the Rule on their services, such as by hiring additional staff or adding new programs or \u00b6\u00b6 21, 26 -30, 35. Some p laintiffs have had to divert resources from other core ser vices and priorities to staffing, training, education, and public outreach addressing the Rule. Kassa Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, -17; Ker sey Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 26 -29, 35 -36. Defendants would have th is court require more than the Ninth Circui t does for standing. Here, it is enough for plaintiffs to allege that the ir goals of providing healthcare and legal services to low -income immigrants are frustrated , and that the challenged policy has stimulated the organization s into spending money on th ings they would not otherwise have spent money on. Plaintiffs' public education efforts , changes to their programs , increased costs of assisting clients, and other diversions of resources qualify 85 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 86 of 93 under the Ninth Circuit's requirements . 22 3. The Balance o f Equities and Hardships Tip Sharply in Plaintiffs' Favor \"A court must 'balance the interests of all parties and weigh the damage to each' in determining the balanc e of the equities.\" CTIA -The Wireless Ass'n v. City of Berkeley , 928 F.3d 83 2, 852 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky , 586 F.3d 1109, 1138 (9th Cir. 2009)). There is little question that the balance of equities and hardships tip sharply in favor of the States and Counties . Defendants have been operating under a co nsistent definition of \"public charge\" since at least 1999 , when the INS issue d Field Guidance specifying \"that 'public charge' means an alien . . . who is likely t o become (for admission/adjustment purposes) 'primarily dependent on the government for sub sistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of pub lic cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long -term care at government ex pense. '\" 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689. That standard is specific and workable, and defendants h ave been administering it for decades. In fact, defendants conceded that do not argue that they would suffer any hardship in the face of an injunction prohibiting them from replacing those standards with the new Rule until resolution of this case on the m erits. Defendants' only argument with respect to the balance of equities or hardships and the public interest is that Congress has made a policy judgment that aliens should be self -sufficient , and the executive should not be prevented from implementing a rule that advances that policy. On the other hand , implementing the change defendants propose would upend state and local governments ' operations as they support immigrants while determin ing how to adjust to the new Rule and provide services that the feder al government once predictably assisted with . To the extent this factor is merged with the public interest and considers the effects on non -parties, the mo st severely affected individuals are the aliens 22 As the issue was not meaningfully addressed by the parties, the court does not dec ide at this time whether California Primary Care Association satisfies the requirements for associational stand ing. 86 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 87 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California seeking LPR status themselves, who would face uncert ainty regarding their access to healthcare and subsidized nutrition as they learn to adapt to and attempt to navigate the Rule's deterrents . In short, i mple menting the Rule after decades of a consistent policy prior to a determination of this action on the merits \u2014which defendants argue will be accom plished in short order \u2014does little to advance the defendants' interest s, and it would entirely upend the plainti ffs' (and the non-party aliens') interests. 4. An Injunction Is in the Public's Interest \"When the government is a party, the last two factors merge.\" Azar, 911 F.3d at 575. Therefore, the public interest analysis is sub sumed in the balance of equities and hardships, addressed above , and the public interest therefore favors and injunction. Even thoug h the public 's interest generally merges with the balance of equities, it can be \"appropriate to consider the factors separa tely,\" for example when intervenors present distinct interests. League of Wilderness Defs./Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. C onnaught on, 752 F.3d 755, 766 (9th Cir. 2014). In those instances, \"[t]he public interest inquiry primarily addresses impact on non -parties rather than parties.\" Id. Here, the public intere st cuts sharply in favor of an injunction. Specifically , the public interest supports continuing the provision of medical services through Medicaid to those who would predictably disenroll absent an injunction , for numerous reasons . Although the court has not reached the issue as to whether plaintiffs' arguments regar ding the impacts on public health support their argument for imminent harm, the parties and numerous amici have explained that the predictable disenrollment from Medic aid absent an injunction would have adverse health consequences not only to those who dis enroll, but to the entire populations of the pl aintiff states , for example, in the form of decreased vaccination rates. The public certainly has an interest in decrea sing the risk of preventable contagion. As such, t he public interest support s preserving the long -standing status quo pending final, coh erent resolution on the merits. 87 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 88 of 93 United States District Court Northern District of California 5.

Finally, although the scope of the injunction in this action is governed by the controlling Ninth Circuit law explained above, the court notes that the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court have both credited prudential co nsiderations support ing their admonition that nationwi de preliminary injunctions are appropriate only in \"exceptional cases.\" See San Francisco v.

That consideration is relevant here, where a ctions raising similar changes are also currently pending in district courts in New Yo rk, Maryland, and Washington, and perhaps more .

Third, \"[n] ationwide injunctions are also associated with forum shopping, which hinders the equitable administration of laws .\" Id. b. Analysis Here, the Counties and t he States have demonstrated a likelihood of irreparabl e harm based on their loss of Medicaid funding from the federal government and increased 90 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 91 of 93 operational costs they are likel y to carry. 24 Those harms stem directly from disenrollment of individuals seeking medical care in their jurisdictions, residing in thei r jurisdictions, and enrolling in certain other public benefits in their jurisdictions (for example, school lunch program s). Those harms, and the supporting record, are discussed in detail above. In order to preserve the status quo pending resolution on the merits and to prevent certain of these irreparable harms, i t is necessary to enjoin implementation of the Rule with respect to those who reside in the States and Counties any time following the date of this order , until this action is resolved on the m erits. Moreover, defendants must be additionally enjoined from app lying the Rule to any individual who is part of a househol d (as defined in the Rule, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.21(d)) that includes a person who has resided in a plaintiff State or County any time followi ng the date of this order, until this action is resolved on the merits. Defendants may, of course, continue to process ap plications and otherwise operate pursuant to the standards employed prior to October 15, 2019 \u2014that is, pursuant to the status quo. The plaintiffs request a nationwide injunction based primarily on w hat they argue would be the inadministrability of an immig ration policy that is not admi nistered uniformly nationally. But a nationwide injunction is not \" appropriate simply because this case presents a rule that applies nationwide. \" E. Bay Sanctuary II , 934 F.3d at 1029 ; accord San Francisco v. Trump , 897 F.3d at 1244 (record must also be independently \"developed on the nationwide impact \" and the statewide impact ). Plaintiffs also argue that a nationwide injunction is necessary to provide certai nty to the public and quell confusion about the implementation of the Rule. They argue that general, nationwide confusion will cause disenrollment even in the States and Counties , 24 Because the Organizations have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on\u2014or serious questions going to \u2014the merits of their APA causes of action (the only claims underlying their motion for prelim inary injunction), they have not demonstrated that an injun ction should issue to prevent the harms they are likely to suffer, so the court does not consider the ir alleged harms in determining the scope of the injunction. 91 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28United States District Court Northern District of California Case 4:19-cv-04980-PJH Document 131 Filed 10/11/19 Page 92 of 93 caus ing the above -discussed harms. Plaintiffs have certainly demonstrated that confusion about the nation's immigration policies is a cause of disenrollment, even for those who will not be subject to the public charge assessment. However, plaintiffs have not demonstrated the marginal effect a nationwide injunction would have on curing that confusion for their residents over and above an injunction limited to their own borders. Although it is conceivable that a nationwide injunction pending resolution on the merits would lead to less disenrollment due to confusion within Califor nia than this injunction covering all of California (and the other States), it is plaintiffs' obligation to demonstrate the necessity of such relief. This court does not suggest that n o evidence could support such an injunction. Nor does the court sugges t that the record evidence is necessarily insufficient. Rather plaintiffs, by devoting only a few cursory paragraphs in their briefs to the scope the injunction , have failed to suffici ently tie that ev idence to the need for an injunction beyond their bord ers in order to remedy the specific harms alleged and accepted by the court as likely, imminent, and irreparable. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the States and Counties' motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED, as explained above. The Organ izations' motion is DENIED, because they do not fall within the zone of interests of the statute forming the basis of their APA claims.
