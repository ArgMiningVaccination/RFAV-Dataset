Backer, PhD, Human Interaction Research Institute created by Valley Nonprofit Resources funded by Annie E. Casey Foundation 1 OVERVIEW Purpose of the Manual This Manual provides guidance and background information to help clinical staff and family facilitators in mental health agencies impl ement a program for involving Spanish-speaking Latino families in mental health services for adolescents. The Latino MultiFamily Group (Latino MFG) program was adapted from a program firs t created for families of adults with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia. The Manual is not intended to stand alone, but to supplement training materials already available for families of adults, since the adult MFG progr am provides a well-tested \"shell\" or organizing framework that can be adapted to a number of di fferent populations and mental health problems. Recently completed empirical research indicates that the adult MFG program is effective for families of Spanish-speaking adults, and pilot tests also show success with families with Spanish-speaking adolescents. These studies are discussed in the manual. For adolescents struggling with the challenge s of disorders like ADHD or serious emotional disturbances like depression, support from their fam ilies often is essential to success in treatment and recovery. Access to psychological and pr oblem-solving support from these families is desirable, especially since most adolescents live with their parents or other family members. But families need both knowledge and skill to interact effectively with adolescents who have these disorders or disturbances (which for ease of re ference will be called \"disorders\" throughout this Manual). What's in the Manual The Manual provides background and practical res ources for those being trained to implement the Latino MFG. As already mentioned, it is not intended to stand alone, but rather to be a supplement to standard MFG training materials. The Manual has six sections: Section 1 - Using the Manual provides a larger context for the system change that's needed to implement the Latino MFG program effectively. Section 2 - About Latinos in the United States presents a very brief summary of general information about Latinos and about mental illnesses/mental disorders in this population, offering a general context for implementing the Latino MFG program. Section 3 - Cultural and Language Cha llenges in Working with Latino Families summarizes eight main challenges and how to handle them. Section 4 - Challenges of Working with Latino Adolescents presents an overview of the challenges facing providers offering the MFG pr ogram to families of Latino adolescents, and recommendations for how to respond to these challenges. 2 Section 5 - Implementing the Latino MFG Program outlines the steps involved in implementing the Latino MFG program; provi des information on how the program is different from the adult MFG; and provides in formation on costs and co-facilitation of these groups by a family member (sometimes family members may be the only facilitators). Section 6 - Resources for Further Learning includes references cited and additional websites and publications, plus program materials presented both in English and Spanish. For those interested in the scientific backgr ound for the Manual's content, references cited throughout are presented through end-notes (with full reference citations in Section 6). About the MFG Program A proven way to develop family knowledge a nd skill (and to encourage support on an ongoing basis) is the MultiFamily Group (MFG) program, originally developed by Dr. William McFarlane of Maine Medical Center, and empiri cally-tested through years of research. MFG was created for families of adults with such seve re mental illnesses as schizophrenia and is recommended as an evidence-based practice for this population. 1 The MFG program has been used effectively with adolescents and children as well. The program brings groups of families together for education and skill development, as well as mutual support and problem solving. The key elements of the MFG program are: Five to eight families are in a group Two clinicians facilitate the group (som etimes there are also family facilitators) The group meets bi-weekly for 90-minute sessions over six months to one year Refreshments are provided Initial sessions avoid emphasis on clin ical issues but provide education Initial sessions emphasize establishing a working alliance among the families by building group identity and developing a sense of mutual interest and concern, then moving on to group sharing and problem-solving MFG's status as an evidence-based practice is verified by a number of controlled research studies. Research on the MFG approach for family members with schizophrenia shows that there is a remarkable consistency of positive effects on rates of relapse, with minimum reductions of about 50% over the rates of relapse for control groups. In 11 of the most rigorously designed and conducted studies, the average rate of relapse for the groups receiving family psychoeducation was 27%, compared with the rate for control groups of 64%.2 Participation in an MFG program also results in increased employment, improved family relationships and well-being, reduced friction a nd family burden. And it reduces medical illness among family members, according to the research already cited. Family psychoeducation interventions like the MFG program now have been recognized as effective interventions for adults with schz ophrenia by the research collective called the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT). Other interventions recommended are: 3 Standardized pharmacological treatment Illness management skills training Supported employment Assertive community treatment Integrated dual disorders treatment In their 2009 treatment recommendations, the PORT st ates that \"persons with schizophrenia who have ongoing contact with their families, includi ng relatives and significant others, should be offered a family intervention that lasts at least 6-9 months. Interventions that last 6-9 months have been found to significantly reduce rates of relapse and rehospitalization. Though not as consistently observed, research has found other benefits for patients and families, such as increased medication adherence, reduced psychiat ric symptoms and reduced levels of perceived stress for patients. Family members have also been found to have lower levels of burden and distress and improved family relationships.\" 3 Some evidence is available for applications of the MFG program to adolescents and children, 4 and clinical experience suggests that the program can be used successfully regardless of age range. Research bringing together the effectiv eness data about EBPs like the MFG shows that ethnic minorities benefit in trials of EBPs as much as Whites.5 Another large review of research on this subject indicated that cultural adaptations of mental health interventions are generally effective, and a third analysis indicated that interventions adapted for use with minority youth generally are as effective as for the original White population.6 There is some debate about whether cultural adaptations even are necessary, although no question that translation into other languages (such as Spanish) is essen tial for those who do not speak English.7 Positive evidence about the effectiveness of the MFG program with Latinos is presented below. Underuse of the MFG Program Unfortunately, the MFG program is not as widely used as these extraordinary research results suggest it should be. There are many reasons for this. Some mental health workers and their agencies simply don't know that this program exists, or don't know there's sound scientific evidence supporti ng its effectiveness. Others have heard of MFG, but are more inclined to using medicati ons or psychotherapy to improve outcomes. In some cases, mental health workers and families are reluctant to use programs that have been studied and used primarily with White, English- speaking families, when many of their clients and their families are Latino and their primary language is Spanish. Whatever the reasons for its limited use at presen t, there is good evidence that implementation of the MFG program can be increased through system atic efforts to educate and support mental health agencies and their staff. For instance, in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, among the 40 nonprofit agencies receiving County cont ract funding for mental health services, only one was using the MFG approach in 2007 (either for children/adolescents or for adults). Under funding support from UniHealth Foundation, a number of additional agencies learned about and implemented the MFG program for fam ilies of adults with mental illnesses, through the Raising the Bar project. This three-year pr oject was conducted as part of Valley Nonprofit 4 Resources, a management support organization for nonprofits in this region, and served as the model for creation of the Latino MFG program. 8 Throughout the health and human services field, evidence-based practices like MFG have increasingly become the \"gold standard,\" and in fi elds such as mental health, funders are starting to require their use as a condition of funding support. However, for many mental health agencies, identifying appropriate EBPs is diffi cult, and so is high-quality implementation of them. Also, agencies need to address long-term sustainability for these practices once in place. How the Latino MFG Was Developed The Latino MFG program was specifically designe d for use with monolingual Spanish-speaking Latino families, whose family members with mental health problems are adolescents ages 12-16. Although Latino MFG sessions with families are pres ented in Spanish, training for mental health agency personnel is presented in English, as is this Manual, for the practical reason that not everyone involved in the implementation of this program will be bilingual (but all staff being trained as facilitators are bilingual). As with all MFG programs, the objective is to provide the families with education and problem-solving skills in a group environment with other fa milies. The specific aim is to reduce family stress and help the family better support the adol escent who is dealing with the challenges of mental disorders (ADHD, depression, etc.). The Latino MFG program can increase the quality of mental health services for Latino adolescents by reducing symptoms and enhancing overall quality of life for these adolescents. Other specific benefits may be better medica tion compliance, and reduced risk for re- hospitalization if either have been part of the adolescent's treatment history. This program is also intended to improve coping skills and quality of life for family members. This Manual and the work behind it are supported by a multi-year grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The Foundation recently has adopted a major emphasis on getting EBPs more widely used in public systems that serve children and adolescents, especially those serving high-risk populations and disadvantaged communities. EBPs whose use can help reduce congregate or institutional care also are a priority for Casey's work. Some of the core materials used to prepare me ntal health workers for implementing the Latino MFG program (e.g., to describe the basic compone nts of MFG and the research evidence behind it) are NOT contained in this Manual, or in accompanying PowerPoints described later. Rather, as mentioned earlier, those implementing the La tino MFG program are encouraged to use this manual as a \"concordance\" to educational mate rials developed by MFG's pioneer, (Dr. William McFarlane, Maine Medical Center) with so me supplements customized by the primary implementer Dr. Alex Kopelowicz. These materials are described in Section 5. The initial research establishing the efficacy of the MFG approach for Latinos was done by Kopelowicz. 9 The specific purpose of this research was to test the MFG program as an 5 evidence-based intervention to improve medication adherence among adult patients with schizophrenia. While family psychoeducation has demonstrated efficacy in improving overall outcomes in schizophrenia, empirical support for its ability to enhance medication adherence is scarce. The specific objective of the most recent of these studies was to determine whether a culturally-adapted, multifamily group therapy would increase medication adherence and decrease psychiatric hospitalizations for Mexican American adults with schizophrenia. These patients and their families participated in a controlle d study of the MFG appro ach (the MFG program was translated into Spanish and culturally-ada pted, creating the protot ype for the Latino MFG described in this Manual). A version of th e MFG program specifically tailored to improve medication adherence through a focus on the belie fs and attitudes of the target population was found to be particularly effective in reducing re-hospitalization rates. Three approaches to cultural adaptation were interwoven to create the Latino MFG program. The first involves applying research findings to shaping the intervention. For example, a fundamental goal of family psychoeducation is to improve communication and problem-solving skills within the family environment - research has shown that such activities decrease levels of expressed emotion (i.e., criticism and hostility) am ong family members, which in turn reduce relapse rates for people with serious mental illnesses. However, research has demonstrated that in Latino families (particularly Mexican-Americans), high levels of criticism and hostility do not predict relapse as strongly as in the Anglo-American population 10. Instead, the absence of warmth (that is , the expression of pro-social feelings amongst family members) is a better predic tor of relapse. Consequently, family psychoeducation for the Latino MFG focuses more on encouraging engagement and inclusion of the ill relative in family activities rather than attempting to minimize aversive interactions. The second approach involves modifying the in tervention based on clinical experience. For instance, Kopelowicz and colleagues 11 culturally adapted an illness management program for a Mexican-American population in Los Angeles. Th e cultural adaptation of this program included translating the trainer's manual and patient workbook, dubbing a training video into Spanish, modifying the trainers' activities during the sessions, and including family members. Cultural considerations were incorporated into the skills training process by insuring that the skills trainers participating in the study were all Mexican-American and bilingual. Their training style was modified to allow for more spontane ity among participants, and family members were incorporated into the skills training - a particul arly important element since over 80% of Latinos with schizophrenia live with their families. Family members were trained to identify opportunities for what was learned in the training to be generalized to family life. A third approach to adapting interventions is to examine existing interventions from the perspective of cultural competence models. For instance, the model of \"cultural lenses\" encourages providers to work with patients and families from other cultures by integrating their own perspectives into the intervention, moving back and forth between the cultural points of view. In a study by Kopelowicz and colleagues 12 the \"shifting cultural lenses model\" was used 6 to modify the MFG approach for Latinos by integr ating the perspectives of the therapist and the participants. The synthesis of these three appro aches led to the creation of the adult Latino MFG program tested in the Kopelowicz research, and which has been adapted here to create a Latino MFG program for use with adolescent populations. Early Evidence of Success for the Latino MFG Program In its first edition, this Manual was part of a pilot test of the Latino MFG program, which was created based on the Kopelowicz work and the UniHealth Foundation-sponsored study described above. Family sessions were presented in Span ish and culturally adapted at two public mental health agencies in the San Fernando Valley re gion of Los Angeles. The target population for these pilot tests was adolescents with mental health problems such as depression and ADHD. Four pilot test groups were conducted and evaluate d. Three of the four groups used professional staff as facilitators; one used trained family members. All pilot groups were implemented successfully, despite operational challenges, as viewed by clinical staff and family members interviewed in two follow-up evaluation studies. 13 Interviews with family members also revealed specific examples of impact from the groups on adolescent clients (several of these are reported below). Improvements in clinical st atus were noted, although no inferences can be made about how much the MFG program cont ributed, since these were very modest, uncontrolled evaluation studies. Two more pilo t groups were launched in early 2011, and will be evaluated using a more rigorous data-gathering procedure that grew out of a review of the previous two evaluation reports. Six families were part of the first Latino MF G program implemented at San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center, where the facilitators of the group were a bilingual case manager from Children's Systems and a bilingual therapist from the Children's Full Services Partnership. Four families were part of the Sa n Fernando Mental Health Center's Latino MFG program, and its facilitators were a staff licensed clinical social worker and a clinical psychologist. The second set of two pilot groups implemented at these agencies had similar profiles. Results from interviews conducted with family members participating in the pilot groups indicated that they found the groups to be helpfu l in dealing with the adolescent client. Being with other families had particular impact. The groups provided a significa nt source of social support, were superior to individual sessions the interviewees had participated in, and provided an opportunity to express doubts, worries, and opini ons, to learn from each other, and to see how others have overcome problems. Psychoeducation about their relatives' mental illness was particularly valuable to families, especially knowledge about medications. The groups also taught families how to contribute to rehabilitation by promoting treatment adherence and providing the ill relative with social and emotional support. One interviewee emphasized th e importance of knowing what to do in case of an emergency (such as a relapse). The groups helped families improve their communications specific to dealing with the mental disorder, as well as in general. 7 Family members gave specific examples of impact from the groups, such as the following: One family member described violent behavior by the adolescent client towards another family member. Through the MFG sessions, the family lear ned that medication adherence is critical for the family member's treatment. Once the adol escent was stable on medication, the violence stopped. A family reported having extended arguments on various topics, all of which started as a simple disagreement between the adolescent and one or more other family members. Through the group they learned to communicate more effectively, reducing the length and \"emotional heat\" of arguments. Also, their overall stress levels have gone down: \"now we problem solve,\" the family member said. Other family members interviewed said that the communication skills they learned in the groups reduced stress considerably. The group helped them learn about symptoms and to build communication skills. They also said the groups he lped families to remind themselves that they are not \"the only ones\", which has reduced stigma a good deal. Medication adherence as a result of skills learned in the group has led to greater stability of symptoms. Families have also learned that setting clear and constructive rules at home th at are implemented in a consistent manner is very important for their ill relative. Implementation challenges also were reported. Transportation and child care were barriers to participation in the groups, although the two mental health agencies were able to overcome these to a considerable extent (e.g., by providing taxi cab vouchers and allowing other children of the family to be brought to the agency during the sessions). Scheduling of the group sessions during the week also was an issue for some of the participating family members. Next Steps In October 2009, a national convening was held in Ba ltimore at the offices of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, organized by the Foundation and the Huma n Interaction Research Institute. This convening brought together a small group of e xperienced researchers and thought leaders concerned with Latino mental health services. Its purposes were (1) to obtain input from funders, community leaders, practitioners and researchers about the Latino MultiFamily Group program; (2) to explore uses of the Latino MF G program with adolescent populations (including a discussion of the first two pilot implementations); and to (3) discuss issues about its evaluation and dissemination (including the program's sustai nability, inclusion of a family member as group facilitator, and possible further adaptati ons of the Latino MFG program for use with children and with adult Latinos). Input from this convening has been incorporated into the present edition of the Manual, and into ongoing pilot testing. The convening also helped shape a national dissemination plan that has evolved into a partnership with the National Ne twork to Eliminate Disparities in Behavioral Health (NNED) and with the Latino Behavioral Health Institute. A workshop on the Latino MFG program was pres ented at the 2010 Latino Behavioral Health Institute's national conference, and 18 mental health agencies expressed interest in learning more about how to implement the program. These agencies have since been contacted to participate in 8 an NNED Community of Practice (CoP) focused on the Latino MFG, which will be implemented in May 2011. The CoP will include an initial online orientation session, eight one-hour webinars to teach participating mental health agencies about the Latino MFG, learning materials available online, peer-to-peer networking through the NNED website, and technical assistance. Among the ongoing challenges of dissemination for the Latino MFG program are how to: Make this Manual and its supporting materials available for wider use by mental health agencies and other community-based programs to implement with adolescent populations Synthesize evidence about the cost-effectivene ss of the Latino MFG, as derived from the extensive implementation literature on this s ubject (since only four pilot implementations of LMFG have been completed so far, cost data are not yet available for the Latino MFG, though some qualitatively-based estimates can be made) Gather further evidence about the implementa tion and effectiveness of the Latino MFG, to supplement what was compiled in th e 2009 and 2011 evaluation studies already mentioned Another challenge is how to implement th e Latino MFG in the face of increasing budget constraints in the public system for adolescent mental health services. One innovative strategy now being tested is to conduct the MFG progr am with family facilitators, supervised by professional clinical staff (as mentioned, one of the four pilot programs already implemented used family facilitators). Another is to s horten the program from the traditionally-recommended one-year length to six months (the PORT recomme ndation for adult schizophrenics is for six to nine months, so there already is precedent for shortening the duration of MFG). The Larger Context Like the Raising the Bar project mentioned earlie r, the Latino MFG project is part of Valley Nonprofit Resources (VNR), a center which provides capacity-building information and assistance to the more than 4,000 nonprofit organi zations in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles (go to www.valleynonprofitresources.org for more information). One major goal for VNR is to help nonprofit mental health agencies and their staffs in the San Fernando Valley region learn about and implement research-based mental health practices such as the MFG for adults and the Latino MFG for adolescents. 9 SECTION 1 USING THE MANUAL The research and pilot tests reported in this Manual make a strong case for the quality and impact of MFG, and for the promise of the Latino MFG program in work with families of adolescents with mental health problems. Co mbined with the learning materials produced by William McFarlane and colleagues, the Manual a nd three PowerPoint presentations described further in Section 5, the \"raw materials\" are av ailable to implement the Latino MFG in a mental health agency. But just like the truism that \"insight does not n ecessarily lead to behavior change,\" having all these good materials does not guarantee that the Latino MFG will be implemented successfully. As with any other evidence-based practice, th ere are many implementation challenges, and still others associated with long-term sustainability of the program once it has been successfully operated in a given setting. Section 1 addresses some of these challenges in brief. The first step in implementation is learning \"the basics\" about the Latino MFG program, and getting access to the learning materials described in this Manual. What follows may vary from one implementation to another, but the five ma in steps leading to successful adoption of the Latino MFG are likely to be: 1 - Reviewing information about the Latino MFG , ideally supplementing written information by talking with leaders of one or more mental health agencies where this program has been implemented successfully. 2 - Making the decision to implement the Latino MFG in a new setting. Typically that decision involves both program and administrative leader s, since implementation will require use of scarce personnel and financial resources. 3 - Implementing the Latino MFG , following the five steps described further in Section 5: Conducting a needs and readiness assessment Conducting an exploratory presentation to staff Conducting staff training for facilitators Implementing the program Gathering data on process and impact 4 - Reviewing process and impact data , and making adjustments in the program as needed. 5 - Making plans for sustaining the Latino MFG program , assuming results show that this is appropriate - this means planning and conducti ng additional program implementations in the same setting, as well as continuing the first implem entation if desired by the participants (family members sometimes decide to continue a group long after its first six to 12-month running time has been completed, and to do so with their own resources and coordination). 10 The needs and readiness assessment may well reveal that there is a strong need for the Latino MFG and agreement among staff and administrators (and perhaps families in the community as well) about that need, but that there also is resistance to implementing the program. Some may question whether the Latino MFG program will wor k, others will be concerned about the burden implementing it will impose on already over-co mmitted staff, and still others may be uncomfortable about investing resources in work w ith families when they are so scarce for direct services to clients. These resistances will need to be identified and addressed, or they may sabotage the program no matter how badly it is needed. Second, there may be problems in finding the financ ial resources to implement the program. In many regions, mental health services, especially those for poor people and for minority communities, are facing constant budget cutbacks. Part of the readiness assessment is to determine where funding will come from - Sec tion 5 includes some basic information on the costs associated with MFG. If public funding is not an option, resourceful agency personnel may look to local sources (religious institutions , community groups, foundations, businesses) to provide the funding for both implementation and ongoing operation. For poor families and clients, Medicaid funding may be an option, and billing codes for reimbursement of Latino MFG costs are availabl e (see Section 5). Arguments can be made about the cost reductions that have consistently shown to be likely with implementation of the MFG, to counter questions about whether such a program should be implemented at a time of fiscal constraints. Finally, long term sustainability of the Latino MFG program may be an additional challenge, especially in a scarce-resource environment. Families and local policymakers may be encouraged to show their support for this program , and stories of success from families that have participated may usefully be gathered. It is only with this kind of strategic thinki ng that a relatively new and not highly-publicized program like the Latino MFG can have the best chan ces for success. This would be true for any new, research-based practice in any area of inte rvention. Fortunately, mental health professionals (and families of adolescents with mental health pr oblems) have a big step up - they already have experience dealing with resistance and anxiety ar ound change, and may be able to take a more rational view about the work of change as a result. The companion to strategic thinking, already menti oned in this section, is input from those who already have successfully implemented the La tino MFG program. This input should not be restricted to advice about planning and progr am design, as important as that is. It also can be very valuable in providing ways to address con cerns of staff and families about the new program - in particular, by offering dramatic stories of success and practical examples of how problems were overcome. As with all programs for working with clients or families, the information presented here is only advisory in nature and needs to be implemente d with careful regard fo r the circumstances of actual families, clients and the communities they live in. 11 SECTION 2 ABOUT LATINOS IN THE UNITED STATES This brief section is included to provide an overview of Latinos in the U.S. for non-Latinos involved with Latino MFG implementation need ing basic facts and definitions, and as a \"refresher\" for all who will be implementing the Latino MFG, or making decisions about its implementation. Today, Latinos are the larges t minority population group in the country. The millions of Latinos in the U.S represent one of the country's fastest-growing groups. Non-Latinos often think of all Latinos as one people, and in some ways this is true. Still, since their roots are in a number of countries around th e world, they are also diverse in attitudes, customs and behaviors. In this section, both similarities and differences among Latino communities are discussed, to provide context for communicating with Latinos about mental illnesses/disorders. Population of Latinos in the United States The term \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" refers to a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or or igin, regardless of race (for convenience, this Manual will consistently use the term \"Latino\" ). The 2000 Census asked questions to more accurately describe the growing diversity of Latinos in the U.S. This revision is described in a 2001 Census brief concentrated on this population. 14 The 2000 Census (the most recent national data until the 2010 Census results are published) identifies race and Latino origins as two separate and distinct concepts. Respondents had to identify if they were or were not Spanish/Hisp anic/Latino and, in a separate question, respond to race. The race data can be collapsed into one of seven separate categories (White, Black or African American, American I ndian and Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander or some other race) or a comb ination of two or more races. Almost all respondents (98%) reported only one race. At the time of the 2000 Census, a total of 281 million people resided in the United States, and 35 million, or about 13%, were Latino (that figure in 2010 is estimated at about 15%). According to the Surgeon General's supplemental report on me ntal health, culture, race, and ethnicity, 15 it is anticipated that by 2050, the number of Latino U.S. residents will exceed 97 million people, nearly one-fourth of the total U.S. population. Differences within the Latino Communities The two largest Latino subgroups in the U.S. in 2000 were Mexicans, who made up 58% of the Latino population. Puerto Ricans constituted 10%, a nd resided mostly in the Northern Central part of the country. South American Latinos made up about 12%, a nd Cubans about 4%. 16 The ten states with the largest percentage of La tinos in the state's population were New Mexico 12 (42%), California (32%), Texas (32%), Arizona (25%), Nevada (20%), Florida New York (15%), New Jersey (13%), and Illinois (12%).17 Individuals not born a U.S. citizen are consid ered \"foreign-born.\" The foreign-born population of the U.S. is described in a 2003 Census brief. 18 The foreign-born population increased by more than half between 1990 and 2000, from 19.8 milli on to 31.1 million. More than 16 million or 52% of the total foreign-born population was from Latin America. Mexico, representing the largest number, accounts for 9.2 million people. Latino Americans are a largely heterogeneous population with many between-group and within-group differences. 19 For example, some Mexican-born Latinos may call themselves Mexicano , Mexican American, Chicano or Spanish American.20 The diversity manifested in the Latino population has been identified as a major cultural consideration related to mental health issues.21 Although large numbers of Latinos have resided in the U.S. for many years, there are increasing numbers of more recent immigrants, with immigr ation rates exceeding those of any other ethnic group. 22 Although Puerto Ricans are citizens of the U. S., they are less likely to be viewed or acknowledged as such than non-Latino Americans23, and may be more likely than non-Latino Americans to be relegated to marginal status.24 Socioeconomic Factors for Latino Communities According to the 1999 U.S. Census Bureau, 25 the per capita income for Latinos in 1999 was about $11,600, compared to $23,800 for non-Latino White s. Previous research has identified low-income status, combined with lack of health insurance, as the greatest barrier to Latinos' ability to access health care.26 Latinos' relative poverty (23% live below poverty level27) and lack of health insurance (35% lack coverage28) suggest that economic impediments to obtaining care for physical and mental health problems are great for many in this population.29 Research further suggests that \"relative poverty,\" or comparatively low earnings in a high-income society, can also be detrimental to family structure and personal life. 30 Without a proper understanding of the difficulties faced by those liv ing in poverty, clinicians may incorrectly pathologize members of low-income populations. C linicians need to be aware of, and carefully consider, the socioeconomic contexts facing familie s from different cultures, especially if these contexts involve hardship.31 Behaviors resulting directly from poverty, which large percentages of minority populations must face, have the pot ential to mistakenly be designated \"mental illness\" or \"mental disorder.\"32 Research also suggests that mental health professionals need to guard against stereotyping based on socioeconomic and other key demographics.33 Mental Illnesses in the Adult Latino Population While the focus of this Manual is on Latino a dolescents, a brief overview of mental illnesses among Latino adults is presented to provide contex t. Most of the studies conducted to date of mental health problems among Latinos have been re gional in nature or concentrated on just one national group. The National Latino and Asia n American Study (NLASS) was the first 13 nationally representative study of English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos to compare lifetime and past-year prevalence rates of psychiatric diso rders (half of all subjects were interviewed in Spanish). NLASS found lifetime psychiatric di sorder prevalence rates among Latinos of 28.1% for males and 30.2% for females. Of the various sub-groups in the study, Puerto Ricans had the highest overall prevalence rates. Prevalence ra tes were higher among those Latinos who were born in the United States, those who were proficient in English and third-generation Latinos. 34 A second national-sample study, the National Ep idemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) found that Mexican-Ame ricans and foreign-born non-Hispanic Whites were at significantly lower risk of substance us e and mood and anxiety disorders, compared with their U.S.-born counterparts.35 Such findings stimulated interest in understanding more about the impact of acculturation on mental health disorders, for both adolescents and adults. In 2001, Mental Health: Culture, Race and Ethnicity was released as a supplement to the 1999 Surgeon General's report on mental health.36 This supplemental report focused on the role of culture in mental health, and highlighted dispar ities experienced by racial and ethnic minorities. For example, numerous cited studies suggested th at members of minority racial/ethnic groups on average are less likely to seek mental health se rvices; stay with these services for a shorter period of time; and report being less pleased w ith them. Minority group members have lower engagement, retention, and satisfaction rates due to poorer access to care, but also due to lack of trust in providers and the mental health syst em, which they experienced as incapable of responding to cultural considerations that are important to them. The report concluded that \"treatments need to be tailored and delivered appropriately for individuals according to age, gender, race, ethni city and culture.\" More specifically, the report suggested that \"Mental health workers\u2014including clinicians, administrators, program leaders, and public mental health authorities\u2014should therefore become culturally competent in addressing factors that may affect minority r acial and ethnic group members' access to and quality of treatment.\" In the report, cultural competence was defined as \"the delivery of services responsive to the cultural concerns of racial and ethnic minority groups, including their languages, histories, traditions, beliefs, and values.\" Although eviden ce-based practices are those that have been demonstrated over time to be successful with a variety of populations, it is well known that these practices are usually not tested in particular cu ltural groups before they are implemented. Given that significant cultural differences exist that may affect the access to and implementation of evidence-based practices as indicated above, th en programs targeted to ethnic minority groups should adjust these to make them accessible and e ffective for cultural groups that differ from the original study populations. These findings all cont ributed to the development of the Latino MFG program. 14 SECTION 3 ADDRESSING CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE CHALLENGES FOR LATINOS IN FAMILY PSYCHOEDUCATION Eight challenges of language and culture have been identified that apply whenever Latino families are included in family psychoeducati on activities like the Latino MFG. The challenges are summarized below, followed by more detailed suggestions for how to deal with each one. These suggestions are given for educational purposes only; all interactions with family members need to be conducted in keeping with agency and community standards of practice. Challenge 1 - Language barriers For Latino families who do not speak English or for whom it is not their primary language, getti ng involved in their relatives' service programs can be challenging. This is why it's essential to begin by asking questions. What language differences are families experi encing - not only with reading or speaking English but also with understanding Spanis h-speaking Latinos from other countries? What is the best way for families to discuss la nguage barriers, particularly with regard to mental health services? (Language barriers also may exist regarding the \"language of mental health\" in the treatment setting, termi nologies for symptoms and services may be unfamiliar to many.) Challenge 2 - Level of acculturation Immigrants face special challenges if they are new to the U.S., or if they have not adjusted to the new culture in which they live. Also, adolescents acculturate much faster than adults. Some questions to ask related to acculturation: What is the family's heritage? How long have they been in the U.S.? How are they adjusting and adapting to U.S. cultu re? How is the family dealing with their relative's mental disorder, especially if family members are not accustomed to mental health services as delivered in the U.S.? How do families handle stresses associated with the disorder in ways that fit with their culture? Challenge 3 - Beliefs and perceptions about mental disorders Many Latino families have strong beliefs about mental disorders, (who is to blame, the role of faith healers, community and cultural values). Some questions to consider: What is the best way to deal with strong beliefs about mental diso rders? If certain misconceptions can be allayed, is it then possible to remove any sense of verguenza or shame associated with it? What terminology is best used to clearly co mmunicate? What is the best way to handle beliefs in voodoo or brujer\u00eda and working with faith healers? Challenge 4 - Beliefs and views regarding medication Every day there are new reports on which medications are effective and wh ich ones are not - and especially for adolescents, whether medications are even appr opriate for treating certain disorders. For Latinos who may be unfamiliar with current medical knowledge, it's essential to examine how medications are viewed. Questions to consider: How can a family best understand the role of medication in treating ment al disorders? What is the best way to teach proper use of medication so that it is not abused or improperly shared? What 15 misconceptions do family members have about how medications interact with other forms of treatment? Challenge 5 - Attitudes and beliefs about me ntal health practitioners and services It may be difficult to put complete trust in mental health practitioners if there is uncertainty about their practices and prescriptions. Agai n, culture plays a role. For immigrant Latinos living in a new country, speaking a new language, the challenge is even greater. Issues of mistrust and relationship need to be addressed, particularly regarding support for the program. Since trust is a key factor of sharing personal information, what is the best way to earn it? What is the best way to become aware of reasons for insecurities Latinos have in this area? How can traumatic events be discussed in a safe way? Challenge 6 - Family structure and support Within Latino communities, there is a strong sense of support for and from family. Fa mily members, especially those living in a new culture, may not feel comfortable shar ing what has and has not worked for them. Their willingness to talk about family issues relies heavily on trust and open communication with mental health practitioners. What is the best way to discover how families have been let down by previous systems, and how this affects their apprehensions about MFG? Is there simple language that will help families deal with practitioners? What is the best way to discuss support for families, their friends, their culture and expertise? How can practitioners respond to family time constraints? What roles do family hierarchy and the extended family typical in the Latino family play? Challenge 7 - Community points of view Mental health practitioners need to become familiar with the family's community, talk openly with people, help them to be comfortable with discussion; and demonstrat e interest in their culture and understanding of their issues (including adolescent peer groups). What is the best approach to outreach within the Latino community? How can pr actitioners most successfully demonstrate genuine interest in and understanding of Latino community issues? Challenge 8 - Latino families with few economic resources When families do not have a lot of economic resources, they are limited in what events they are able to attend that go beyond immediate, necessary functions . Issues include time, transportation and childcare. Before planning meetings, what is the best way to determine who will come? How much time and money must families expend - and can they afford to do so? Do they have small children who might need child care while they participate in groups? Challenge 1: Language Barriers Language barriers take different forms, and so do th e interventions that can help reduce them. In this sub-section the following specific topics are addressed: Regional and generational differences Varying educational levels and language proficiency How services are provided 16 Language and protocol Telephone behavior Professionalism and personal connection Awareness of family hierarchy Regional and generational differences Within the diverse Latino community there are likely to be regional and generational differences, for instance, among those born in the U.S. and those born in Mexico, Central South Am erica, Spain or other locations. These create language barriers due to differences in use of idioms or other expressions of the common language. Figuring out the language to be used in workshops is not simply a matter of translation; key words are sometimes used differently across subpopulations (e.g., pena means \"sorrow\" in Puerto Rico but \"shame\" in Central America; it can also mean \"pain\" or \"penalty\"). It helps to ask clinicians from the culture in question to help translate. And it is im portant to be aware of linguistic variation among subgroups, as well as such common sayings as: Que sea lo que Di\u00f3s quiere (It is in God's hands), or Esto es una prueba o una causa (There is a reason for this; this is a test I had to go through). Good practices Be aware of these generational, national, a nd individual differences, particularly during group sessions where multiple recipients and/or families meet for support or problem-solving activities Be sensitive to language distinctions, including clarification and validation of regionalisms To ensure respect and understanding, be cautious about using colloquialisms and dialects employed by Latino subgroups Make staffing decisions with awareness that clinicians need to be bilingual, culturally competent, and, if possible, indigenous to the cultu re of the recipients with whom the clinicians will be working 37 Varying educational levels and language proficiency Sometimes Latinos have difficulty understanding written materials for a number of r easons - familiarity with language, cultural distinctions, or lack of formal education. Some acculturated Latinos do not speak Spanish fluently, but many nonetheless function bi-culturally in that they frequently interact with both Spanish and English speakers. Good practices In developing translations of treatment materials, ensure that the materials are both linguistically accurate and culturally relevant for Latinos; allow flexibility for improved adaptation Assess family member language proficiency before beginning treatment, to determine whether they speak English well enough, or therapists speak Spanish well enough, for families and therapists to work together 38 Accommodate the level of language used to th e educational level of the participants (e.g., elementary school-level Spanish may be appropriate in some cases) When running groups, consider a variety of language preferences, both monolingual and bilingual 17 Use simple language and avoid medical jargon (t his applies regardless of which language is being used). Be sensitive to the verbal and reading abilities of participants so that no family member feels ashamed by being unable to understand the discussion or to read; this kind of reaction can easily prevent people from returning (one strategy may be to assume everyone can't read so that all information is presented, or at least summarized, verbally) Be aware that audio versions of handouts can be distributed, but are useless and can produce shame if the family does not have a suitable player for them How services are provided All too often, a situation is not a ssessed to determine whether or not the language spoken is being fully understood. For example, speech difficulties or silence may be related to a lack of understanding English a nd not be related to a mental health problem. 39 Many Latinos have had negative experiences with doctors or other service professionals who do not speak Spanish. If programs do not seem sensitiv e to these language needs, mistrust can be the result. Good practices Assess whether or not an interpreter is require d - Latino adolescents may provide translation services for monolingual parents, which tends to keep the parent isolated from the service system, and also may place strain on the adolescen t; if possible, independent interpreters should be provided Post a bilingual greeter at the door to help new families Make sure staff members are committed to being helpful to families Specify the rules about confidentiality related to families and their adolescent family member Use an \"interception\" strategy; that is, spontan eously greet families as they come into the agency's lobby If a family complains about bad treatment, ta ke the complaint seriously and follow it up to determine what action to take, if any, and then inform the family Language and protocol Most cultures have standards for proper address and language choices related to them. A lack of knowledge of these formalities can cause embarrassment and sometimes mistrust. Good practices Be conscious of the varying levels of familiarity a family may expect based on their cultural background and experiences Remember that in the U.S. speakers tend to be very casual and address people immediately by their first names; in almost every other culture , there are specific forms of address for various family members, and for meeting people for the first time When first introduced, remember that it's always safe to address a family member by using Mr., Mrs., Ms. or Miss ( Se\u00f1or, Se\u00f1ora, Se\u00f1orita ) followed by a person's last name; this formality is best continued until an agreement for more familiarity is mutually established Make an effort to use the formal \"you\" ( usted ) rather than the informal, more familiar \"you\" (tu) at first; and to use surnames until directed otherwise 18 Telephone behavior There is only one chance to make a fi rst impression. The first phone call to or from a family member is important. Gr eater effort may be required to overcome the consequences of mismanaged first contacts, and on occasion relationships have been lost due to improper phone behavior. Good practices Begin a phone call by asking, \"Is this the Rivera family?\", and then ask for a family member If the person contacted is not a key support pers on like a parent, do not reveal any information about the client; ask that the key support person come to the phone If the person who answered the phone wants more information on the reason for the call before summoning the requested family member to the phone, emphasize that this is not a commercial solicitation, that the call is important and politely ask that the requested family member come to the phone When the appropriate family member is on the line, state exactly the reason for the call Some good telephone practices for predominantly Spanish-speaking clinicians: Begin the conversation by using the more formal address \u2014 Se\u00f1or, Se\u00f1ora, Se\u00f1orita Rivera and usted (you) Later on in the conversation, if appropriate, switc h to the more familiar - Don or Do\u00f1a with the first name, e.g., Don Hector or Do\u00f1a Maria, but be cautious about using first names only, and continue to use usted Do not use the first name alone or tu (you) on the phone, since these are both informal: Wait until there is a face-to-face meeting and more fam iliar terms with the family members have been developed And some good telephone practices for predominantly English-speaking clinicians: For clinicians whose first language is Englis h, consider simply using Mr. and Mrs., since families may not be expecting them to use Spanish titles or terms (the exception might be if a predominantly English-speaking clinician is speaki ng in Spanish with an elderly family member whose primary language is Spanish) Since certain Spanish words have different connotations across subgroups, consider offering some type of clarification or example for critical words or phrases A checklist for guiding initial telephone calls, summarizing and extending some of these tips, is presented on the next page. 19 ____________________________________________________________________________ Checklist for Initial Outreach Phone Call 1 - Ask the adolescent client to suggest one family member who can act as a key support person, and telephone that person. 2 - When calling, identify self as a counselor who is helping the adolescent client. 3 - Note to the family member that this call follows a conversation recently conducted with the adolescent client, in which the client indicated that it is okay for the person to be contacted. 4 - Explain the purpose of the call - to discuss the possibility of the family participating in a new family education program. 5 - Mention that the client is interested in this new family psychoeducation program, and has requested family involvement. 6 - Briefly describe the program: It has an edu cational focus, involves learning about the client's disorder, ways the family can help, and how the family's involvement can increase the client's coping ability and chances for recovery. 7 - Specify that many families ha ve found this program to be helpful, and that it is well established, though it has been used more with a dults than with adolescents. This is one of the first programs for Spanish-speaking families. 8 - If a family information night is scheduled, ask if the family would be willing to come to an information night at the mental health agency to learn more about the program and how it might help their loved one. 9 - Ask to speak to any other family members the client has identified as key support people. 10 - Repeat steps 2 through 8 for these additional family members. Note: If an information night event is held, but fa mily members are not interested in attending, schedule an initial session, individually, with only one or more additional family members, to describe the program in greater depth. ______________________________________________________________________________ 20 Professionalism and personal connection The relationship with a family always needs to be professional, but there are opportunities to make the connection more personal. Sometimes a decision may need to be made as to what may be considered over-the-line in terms of a personal relationship. Once a bond is established with the family, a certain degree of \"closeness,\" (both physical and emotional) as well as an informal style, is both the cultural norm and the more effective therapeutic approach. Good practices To help establish personalismo , emphasize the role of the clinician as a helper for the family's loved one rather than as a representativ e of a mental health center or other type of institution. (But be aware that there are certain boundaries and comfort levels that need to be observed) Make sure that the level of closeness achieved (eye contact, hand lightly on the shoulder to show support, etc.) is perceived and understood by families to be helpful, proper and always professional Help families work to convince the adolescent th at their participation in the MFG session is desirable; challenges in this regard are dealt with in the joining session (see below) Awareness of family hierarchy Within many Latino cultures, there is a traditional family hierarchy. Specifically, the father is the head of the family. Sometimes it may be difficult to create a relationship with the family if this hierarchy is not recognized. Good practices Respect the possible patriarchal structure of the family If a male answers, and a female is the part y being contacted, explain the reason for the call (unless there are confidentiality concerns) before even requesting that she come to the phone Talk further with the male if he has questions Challenge 2: Level of Acculturation Level of a family's acculturation has an impact on the MFG process in at least two ways, which are addressed in this sub-section: Understanding of mental disorders and associated stresses Addressing cultural issues Understanding of mental disorders and associated stresses Less acculturated Latinos may have difficulty recognizing symptoms of mental di sorders, such as depression in adolescents, and as a result these adolescents may use mental hea lth services less often. Also, in cases where inpatient treatment has been needed, some may equate a discharge with full recovery. Some of the stresses that may affect some immigrants are adjustment to an unfamiliar environment; lack of understanding of the U.S.; living in an uprooted/weak support system; lack of opportunity to speak Spanish; downward occ upational mobility; changing general roles; and a loss of self-confidence. 21 Good practices Increase knowledge, engage in education and outreach efforts in Latino communities regarding symptoms and services, so that those less accustomed to their current culture can learn Conduct outreach when treatment is completed, so that every Latino family understands that there is a suggested ongoing process to utilize - a nd benefit from - once a loved one has finished receiving services, or has been discharged in the case of inpatient services Explore these stresses individually, helping th e family understand how they fit with their overall family circumstances, and what options they have for addressing them Addressing cultural issues Acculturation is a social process in which people's attitudes, beliefs and behaviors change as a result of moving from one culture (the one they were born in, or that is the culture of their parents or other relatives), to another one in which they now live. Two main theoretical frameworks have been developed to describe what happens to individuals and families during the acculturation process. Assimilation theory holds that individuals tend to lose much of their original cultural identity as they identify with the culture they now live in. Alternation theory says that individuals can be bi-cultural - that is, they can retain their original cultural identity while establishing a positive rela tionship with the culture they now live in. 40 There is tension within the Latino population be tween those of foreign birth who often see themselves as temporary guests in the U.S., and their descendants, who are born in the U.S., are acculturated with the norms of broader U.S. soci ety in public schools, and are not motivated by the same ties that bind the migrant generation. This creates a \"niche\" of descendants of immigrants who are full-fledged U.S. citizens, but who typically do not get access to all the rights and privileges of citizenship. This is bot h because of the strong cultural identity resulting from their upbringing, and the discriminatory r eaction of the majority population against a non- assimilated and easily identified sub-population. This group of people feels a great need to disti nguish itself from both its U.S. environment and its \"mother culture.\" They believe they are a unique set of people, who endure both strong ties and strong discrimination from bot h U.S. and foreign mainstream parent cultures. There are often similar generational divides of Latinos from other countries. Much has been made of the differences among Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other sub-groups within the Latino popul ation, but it is also crucial that recognition be given to intra-subgroup differences, in terms of level of acculturation, socio-economic status, English language proficiency, religious affiliation and spirituality, and rural or urban background. For example, the superficial sim ilarities between a Salvadoran peasant who recently arrived in the US illegally and the mi ddle-class refugee who fl ed Cuba 35 years ago (both ostensibly fleeing political repression) are likely to be far outweighed by differences in level of education, economic opportunities, level of acculturation and political circumstances, to name a few. Similarly, a first generation Mexican immigrant who grew up in a rural village is likely to share little cultural iden tity with a Mexican-American ranc her whose family has been in the US since before the establishment of this country. Family members may also have to deal with accultu ration issues specific to the adolescent client. For example, it can be difficult for teenagers to \"fit in\" under the best of circumstances, and this 22 is made more complicated if they come from an unassimilated family but have friends and classmates who are well-assimilated. As mentioned above, there are competing theories about the impact of living in two cultures simultaneously - at the least, clinicians need to be sensitive to the realities for a particular family and for the adolescent client. This can be even more complicated in the fair ly typical multi-generational Latino family. The adolescent may be well-acculturated and speak mos tly English, his or her parents somewhat less so and mostly Spanish-speaking, and the grandpare nts still unassimilated - with parenting styles that reflect the \"old culture\" as well. Good practices Get basic information about the family's cultural origins Find out whether families come from urban or rural environments, and about the education and occupations of family members Look for signs that some family members are not familiar with the mental health system, and may need information or orientation to the services the adolescent client may receive If needed, take time to explain the basics a bout health insurance, how coverage works for their particular situation, and the best ways to assess what services may be helpful Before moving forward, take time getting to know where the family is culturally Challenge 3: Beliefs and Perceptions about Mental Disorders Every culture has its own set of beliefs and percep tions about the nature of mental disorders and how to treat them. In this sub-section the following specific topics are addressed: Perception about the origins of mental disorders Choice of language used to describe mental disorders Respect for folk and faith healers Practicing ongoing prevention Perception about the orig ins of mental disorders Some Latino families and consumers have been found in research studies on this subject to hold negative and stigmatizing views about mental disorders. These views often are co mplicated by lack of knowledge about mental disorders and their origins. Latino family members often use the term nervios (nerves) to describe a relative's disorder. In fact, nervios is a common way to conceptualize suffering in general. Stress from working, poor diet or excessive studying often are cited as causes of mental disorders by Latino families. Some families believe they should ignore the symptoms until the person \"comes out\" of it; and still others, that their family caused the mental disorder, perhaps by spoiling a child. Some families also define the symptoms of mental disorders in negative terms, for example seeing them as a sign of \"laziness.\" Of course, ma ny of these beliefs are common in the general population as well, as is lack of knowledge about the biological basis of mental disorders like depression. 23 Good practices Emphasize that no one who has a mental disorder deserves personal blame for being ill Also stress that the family is not to blame Explain some basic biological aspects of ment al disorders like depression or conditions like ADHD, carefully using language that is non-stigmatizing (see next section) Before commenting about family members' views, validate their feelings Choice of language used to describe mental disorders Sometimes clinicians may use diagnostic terms that are quite foreign and even threatening to a family upon first contact. This can result in the family leaving the MFG session or leaving the service agency entirely. Good practices Emphasize the role of biological factors in some disorders, such as depression Suggest that there is hope, and that solutions for dealing with the disorder are possible and workable Consider referring to the loved one's \"nerves\" or nervios when doing outreach or first meeting with families Gently disagree if the term locura or \"craziness\" is used to describe the disorder Emphasize that the disorder is an \"emotional problem\" \u2014 problema emocional Within the context of a relationship with provi ders, as well as ongoing education about mental disorders, many families are actually relieved to hear that the problem is something like depression or ADHD, because, at last, they can id entify the problem and hopefully take action to correct it. Respect folk and faith healers Some families believe symptoms are the result of voodoo or brujer\u00eda (evil spirits), although this may be comm on only among poor families. Still, some families seek alternate sources of treatment such as with santeros \u2014 folk or faith healers. Good practices Acknowledge basic respect for everyone's spiritual beliefs Do this in a way that shows an understanding of these beliefs rather than an affirmation of them In a workshop, begin with a brief discussion acknowledging some of these beliefs before moving into a discussion of mental disorders Work with santeros if they are part of th e family's situation, and reassure them that no power will be taken away from them Ask santeros to work together to encourage clients to adhere to treatment that will help the client, along with the practice of their spirituality Say to the santero , \"We understand and respect the culture and the role of the santero . We do not wish to interfere with this, but instead offer a process in which everyone can work hand- in-hand, to help people overcome their problems\" Be sure to discuss spirituality with families if they do not bring it up Strongly consider adding a section to any edu cational workshop for families about alternative remedies, including faith healing 24 Integrate spiritual with biopsychosocial pers pectives - which provides a broader, more encompassing view of the world Practicing ongoing prevention If a client improves, the family may not believe further prevention efforts are necessary. So the facilitator needs to emphasize the importance of prevention, both to maintain current progress and to deal with new stresses and challenges as they come up. Good practices Encourage families to maintain their preventive strategies Ensure that educational materials are provi ded to emphasize the importance of continuing treatment, even when the adolescent is doing well Anticipate the possibility of dropout or discon tinuation when an adolescent is doing well; try to prevent it Teach families to learn how to identify early warning signs of relapse Keep in mind that not all families recognize the symptoms of mental disorders or the likelihood of ongoing treatment to keep the adolescent client stabilized. Anticipate the challenges, and prepare to meet them. Challenge 4: Beliefs and Views Regarding Medications Cultural issues may affect how medications are regarded ( Note: many adolescents with mental disorders do not require medication, but a substantial number do ). In this sub-section the following specific topics are addressed: Discussing ramifications of mental disorders for medication Dealing with use of folk remedies or non-prescribed medications Discussing ramifications of mental disorders for medication Many families believe that a mental disorder is similar to a medical problem, so that it can be quickly treated and/or cured. Also, some families are uncomfortable bringing up the topic of medication compliance. On the other hand, some family members may be quite in terested in hearing about how medications and their side effects may be different for their group (Mexican, Puerto Rican, etc.) than for the population at large. Good practices Teach families that mental disorders often ar e similar to a long-term, persistent medical condition such as diabetes \u2014 one that may not be curable and one that requires extensive and ongoing prevention efforts to keep symptoms under control Ask questions in a respectful fashion about medication compliance - including what if anything the family does to promote compliance fo r the adolescent client, as well as what the client may do for him or herself 25 Become familiar with medications used with adolescents so that if asked any questions, clear, intelligent responses will be easy to provide (referral to a psychiatrist can be made if the question is more complicated - or a note can be written to ask the adolescent's current psychiatrist a question) Consider bringing a psychiatrist to an edu cational workshop to discuss the specifics of medication Offer materials that explain issues surroundi ng medication in a simple and direct way Dealing with use of folk remedies or non-prescribed medications Folk healers may offer consumers herbs, teas or other substances to help treat mental or physical problems. Also, families sometimes take prescribed medicati ons without medical authorization and share medications within their social networks. Good practices Make sure that substances an adolescent recei ves from folk healers will not interact with prescribed medications in negative ways; ask fa milies what medications, if any, the adolescents are taking, to find out everything they are using Help families seek assistance from a psychiatri st if there are questions about how medicines and non-prescription substances can harmfully interact with one another Challenge 5: Attitudes and Beliefs about Mental Health Practitioners Similarly, different cultures have varying beliefs and attitudes regarding mental health services and the people offering them. In this sub-sec tion the following specific topics are addressed: Addressing concerns about use of personal information Accentuating the positive Teaching families how to communicate with clinicians Addressing concerns about us e of personal information Some Latinos have strong concerns about possible misuse of personal information. Th ese concerns may have resulted from being in a country different from their point of origin. They may also result from experiences in their home countries where governments curtailed free e xpression, or traumatic experiences of torture and/or imprisonment. Good practices Be aware that minority status may have created a sense of insecurity among some Latinos Be prepared to spend time and energy earning families' confianza or trust, and respeto or respect, before trying to obtain information from them Be aware that Latino community members esp ecially value clinicians who have knowledge of their personal cultural identity and needs Assess past experiences of traumatic events, especially those that could have been misdiagnosed; make a referral if appropriate 26 Be sure to provide assurance regarding confid entiality, and also to honestly discuss the limits of confidentiality and \"gray areas,\" such as with legal reporting duties that mental health workers have Show sensitivity to larger issues, especially for Latinos who are not fully acculturated to American practices and attitudes about mental health services. It is critical that facilitators show they are aware that their services are offered in a larger context for both the family and the adolescent. Some adolescents or families may dr op out of treatment due to stressful life events that have nothing to do with mental health pr oblems, e.g., a relative (sometimes a principal caretaker for the adolescent) who is deported or voluntarily returns to their country of origin. Economic realities such as the need to work may also limit availability to participate in services Be aware that there generally are higher dropout rates from services for Latinos, and be alert for signs that dropout might happen Be sure to incorporate Latino customs and values into dealing with the issue, if raised by the family or adolescent treatment programs Accentuating the positive A strong cultural norm among Latinos is to respect experts - including being attentive, listening closely, and wa iting for them to start any discussion and ask appropriate questions. This may lead to some reluctance on the part of families to initiate a discussion. But it also means that family member s will be able to hear basic information, and will participate if encouraged to do so in a positive way. Teaching families how to communicate with clinicians On the other hand, some families have had negative experiences with the treatment system - or are new to mental health services and simply don't know how to communicate with the group facilitator or other mental health professionals. For them, a little skill developmen t and gentle encouragement will go a long way towards helping them become effective communicators within the MFG sessions. Good practices Teach family members how to talk to clinicia ns about their loved ones \u2014 what questions to ask and what language to use Families may find this intimidating at first, so begin with a small st ep that will likely be successful for them Initiate discussions with families Ask specific questions Establish a teacher-student-like relationship (but realize that the \"students\" can teach the facilitator a lot about families and their experiences!) Explain things at families' level Ask families for feedback Repeat information in order to solidify the partnership Some Latino families may interpret frequent \"check-ins\" by clinicians as empathic, and not bothersome. Consider periodically calling and checking up on families participating in a group, which may help the bonding process. Also c onsider calling group members the night before each multifamily group to remind them to attend, at least at the beginning, and emphasize that each family member is an important part of the group. 27 Rather than emphasizing the role of the clinicia n as a representative of an institution, emphasize the role of the clinician as a helper for the family's loved one. Let families know if other services such as counseling are available for them at the agency offering the MFG program. Challenge 6: Family Structure and Support Particularly because of the importance of the family in Latino cultures, there are many opportunities for the family to be positively engage d in supporting the adolescent client, and is participating actively in the MFG process. In this sub-section the following specific topics are addressed: Creating a team environment Promoting a safe, respectful environment Encouraging a proper emotional living situation Exploring both family and friends as a support team Dealing with patriarchal structure/machismo Acknowledging family expertise Balancing the personal with the professional Maintaining awareness of family time constraints Clarifying the role of family and the role of staff members Being realistic about the mental health system Creating a team environment Clinicians who run multifamily groups typically have found few tensions among families, even those from diffe rent subpopulations, but some actions may be needed to facilitate healthy teamwork within the group. Good practices Focus on what families have in common - the me ntal disorder of their adolescent family member Point out and help families recognize the commonalities among them Reframe considerations or problems that are being discussed to include everyone in the group Focus on group efforts to solve family problems Promoting a safe, respectful environment There may be differences in cultural and generational orientation among members of a singl e family. Families may not immediately feel comfortable discussing their problems with, or di sclosing personal information to, strangers for a number of reasons. One of them may be that families are concerned about orgullo or pride, and may prefer handling private issues with family or friends before talking with outsiders. Family members may feel uncomfortable about putting th emselves \"ahead\" of the loved one who is in need of help. Good practices In approaching family members about their loved one's disorder, consider differences in acculturation and attitudes about intergenerational respect Create emotional safety for families 28 Give families a place where they feel they can talk freely - establish a climate of acceptance and tolerance Make it clear to families that the program fo cuses primarily on their loved one's goals and needs - and that participation may also help the family Emphasize the many positive outcomes to the adolescent client Add that their loved one will be helped and that they, too, will be helped by the fact that their loved one is being helped Encouraging a proper emotional living situation It is essential to reduce the level of expressed emotion in the family household. For some adoles cents, this may include having a private space in which to withdraw. However, to some extent this reflects a \"middle-class\" assumption. Many poor families live in crowded households or have several generations of people living together, so this may not be materially possible. Good practices Discuss the kind of living environment that the family prefers; explore how privacy is valued Consider creating activities that provide an appropriate emotional environment Keep in mind that Latinos generally experi ence a great degree of \"familism\" \u2014 a strong connection and loyalty to family A high level of family warmth has been found to reduce relapse rates among Latino populations; keep this in mind when focusing on expressed emotion Rather than attempt to show expressed emo tion as criticality or hypersensitivity, focus on enhancing and improving family bonds within the family Exploring both family and friends as a support team Sometimes there are barriers associated with family participation in a loved one's treatment, and friends (particularly from the adolescent's peer group at school or in the neighborhood) can be a desirable alternative or supplement. Good practices Rather than assuming who might be best to join a family group, ask whether a grandmother, or an aunt or even a close family friend should be part of the group? Remember that the people who are most important to the family and to the adolescent client are the best people to invite Acknowledge the role of extended family in Latino communities \u2014 grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, godparents \u2014 and their potential to support treatment; talk about how to integrate these family members into the Latino MFG process If family obligations and responsibilities make it difficult for them to get involved, explore others who are available Dealing with patriarchal structure/machismo Within many Latino families, there is a definite patriarchal structure, wherein the oldest male in the family is the one in charge, the one who represents the rest of the family. 29 Good practices Respect the family hierarchy \u2014 for example, a ddress the father or other adult male in the family first, if he seems to be positioned as the main representative of the family Even when there are more females than males in the group, which is common, take care to show full respect to the men in the group, especially if they are in the minority Acknowledging family expertise Many families believe - with justification! - that they are experts about their loved one's disorder, because they are the ones who live with this person. Clinicians can acknowledge this in a number of ways. Good practices Rather than overemphasize clinician expertise or authority to family members, acknowledge family members' expertise in living with and caring for an adolescent with a mental disorder Express a personal desire to simply help the family handle the treatment of their loved one and help relieve them, as much as possible, of the stress involved Remember that some Latino family members perceive it to be their role to support their loved ones; family involvement is consistent w ith this role, and can be promoted by emphasizing support for a loved one Balancing the personal with the professional A family's role in treatment may be positive or negative \u2014 there is no way to know which it will be until work begins. Close family involvement may influence treatment in a num ber of ways, ranging from being negatively hypercritical or overly sensitive to being positively supportive and loving. Good practices Validate families' suffering or their experience of the burden, if they are the ones to bring these up Feel free to express warmth, genuineness, concern, empathy, and interest in people's personal lives, while behaving in a professional manner Be aware that some Latinos prefer being physi cally close to another person when interacting \u2014 sitting closer and leaning forward to indicate interest in their conversation partners; anyone not accustomed to this may tend to lean backward, aw ay from the person; (it is best to stay close if this person initiates this closeness) Be cautious about appearing to be too pushy or forceful Use the group to deal with a hypercritical or overly sensitive family member Maintaining awareness of family time constraints There are a number of reasons for a family's lack of participation in a program. E xploring these sensitively and helping to deal with them is an important part of engaging the family. Good practices Proceed slowly; and give families time to decide if they want to participate Make follow-up calls Consider offering a home visit to discuss the pr ogram in more depth, and realize that families may understand this as a sign of respect and genuine interest in the family 30 Demonstrate awareness that families have bus y schedules and conflicting priorities, which are respected and appreciated A family's failure to become immediately e ngaged does not necessarily reflect a lack of interest in the program While practical barriers may prevent some people from becoming engaged in the ongoing process, be sure to provide language-appropriate ma terials, to ensure that whatever involvement and time they can afford is more easily attained Clarifying the role of family and the role of staff members Family members often are confused about what they shoul d be doing and what clinicians should be doing as part of the treatment and recovery process. Helping them cl arify appropriate roles on both sides can be very helpful. Good practices Discuss with staff and group members the importa nce of encouraging all family members to speak up, rather than one person in the family speaking on behalf of another (presumably all present in the group will be fluent enough in Spanish that translation will not be necessary) This emphasis on speaking up must be done, especi ally when face-to-face with families, in a respectful way, acknowledging every family's purpose for being there Sometimes the facilitator may ask the adolescen t to speak first, if he or she has seemed hesitant to speak up Being realistic about the mental health system What the MFG program and other services can and can't do for their family member needs to be communicated honestly to the family. If results are overpromised or the program is made to seem responsible for outcomes that are not really likely to occur, the result can be unwillingness to participate. Good practices Emphasize to families, with great care, that this program is not family therapy - it is different from other programs they may have tried and that it seeks to benefit both the adolescent client and the family Emphasize concrete, practical advantages to participation - such as fewer behavioral problems, improved medication adherence and ge nerally improved quality of life at school and home Rather than focusing on recovery and therapeutic aspects of the program, emphasize the educational and problem solving aspects instead Remember that not everyone may see the program as a priority; however, the ability to communicate the program's value may be the primary reason families are persuaded to participate Encourage family members that have already been involved in an MFG program themselves to serve as \"ambassadors\" to introduce the concep t to other families initially. Also encourage adolescents whose families have participated in the MFG program to help recruit other families 31 Challenge 7: Community Points of View Programs like MFG depend upon larger community support to be successful. In this sub-section the following specific topics about community engagement are addressed: Conducting community outreach Demonstrating interest and understanding Getting creative with time Conducting community outreach Before beginning to plan and implement an MFG program in a Latino community, local clinicians should consider conducting outreach efforts first. Good practices Advertise family-oriented events at the mental health agency, such as informal events with refreshments that offer a speaker talking about a mental health-related topic of broad interest Hold a \"Latino Day\" at the agency or in the community Ask for help in these efforts from trusted and respected individuals in the community (these can be identified by Latino staff members who live in the community) Demonstrating interest and understanding Because many Latino cultures have social norms about inducing shame for transgressions, special car e must be taken to avoid confronting Latino families in a way that could induce shame in terms of their role in the larger community. Good practices Demonstrate an inquisitive, concerned, empathic stance Work toward discovering and understanding real problems and working on their resolution Inquire about a missed appointment instead of blaming anyone Train members to phone ahead when they cannot make an appointment Getting creative with time Different cultures often have different interpretations of scheduling. Time, in some cultures, is more fluid than is tr ue for Americans in general. Facilitators running MFG sessions often can deal with the impact of these differences with some fairly simple re- structuring of the group's operation, so that all can be comfortable. Good practices Be somewhat flexible about start times Structure sessions so as to accommodate differences in time sense. For instance, if the plan is to start a meeting at 7:00 pm, knowing that many families may run late, schedule a 6:30 pm social period that precedes the meeting (let fa milies know that soft drinks and snacks will be served during this time) Rather than establishing any formal structures for these gatherings, let them be loose and learn from them what works and what doesn't . Then plan the next gathering accordingly 32 Challenge 8: Latino Families Who Have Few Economic Resources As already stated, Latinos collectively are among the poorest subgroups in the United States population. In this sub-section the following speci fic topics related to dealing with limits in economic resources are addressed: Considering what economic issues prohibit families from attending meetings Inventing ways to overcome such barriers Considering what economic issues proh ibit families from attending meetings Some families have so few economic resources that the price of bus fare may prohibit them from attending a group. Travel may not be safe in their neighborhood or in the areas that they must pass to get to a meeting. There may be no one available to superv ise the client or other children while parents attend a group. Single parents or parents with multiple jobs and several children may be overwhelmed by competing responsibilities. MFG fac ilitators need to be aware that some or all of these challenges may be present among the families in a group. Inventing ways to overcome barriers MFG programs can become more accessible to low- income families by overcoming these barriers - fa milies and MFG facilitators can work together on devising creative strategies. Good practices Provide food at sessions (this may be especially important for evening sessions) Provide transportation (e.g., taxicab voucher or bus fare) Suggest car-pooling Provide childcare if younger children need to be at the session with a parent Invite participants to contribute in money, tim e or food; make sure they understand that no one needs to contribute - only those who wish to do so 33 SECTION 4 CHALLENGES OF WORKING WITH LATINO ADOLESCENTS In any culture, adolescents face problems in livi ng, both in terms of their environment and their psychological functioning. There is evidence that , as a group, Latino children and adolescents may be affected by a greater amount of emotiona l and behavior problems, when compared with some other racial and ethnic groups. Their mental health issues are discussed further in this section. As with all children and adolescents, these probl ems have somewhat different characteristics, both for diagnosis and treatment, than mental hea lth disorders of adults. And even more than adults, many young people with mental health probl ems do not get treatment - less than 20% of those who need it, according to one recent estimate. 41 Whatever can be done through interventions like the Latino MFG to get families more powerfully involved in mental health services for adolescents is of great importance to improving the success of these interventions. Mental Health Problems of Latino Children/Adolescents The Surgeon General's Report 42 concluded that Latino children and adolescents are a high-risk group for poor mental health outcomes. Studies reviewed in the Surgeon's General Report provided evidence that Latino youth are more likely to have difficulties finishing school, manifest more symptoms of depression and anxi ety, and contemplate suicide more often than non-Latino youth. The National Comorbidity Survey43 and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey44 found higher rates of depression among Latinos than for other groups. The Centers for Disease Control's Yout h Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey,45 based on 16,262 high school students of various ethnic groups, show s that, relative to other ethnic groups, Latino male and female adolescents reported higher rate s of suicidal ideation and attempts than both White and Black male and female adolescen ts. A large-scale study, the 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,46 also demonstrated that Latinos are at higher risk than Caucasian, African -American, or Asian-American, for suicide. In this study of thousands of youth, Latinos had a significantly higher risk for suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide attempts, and suicide attempts requiring medical treatment Little is known about the mental health status of immigrant versus United States-born Latino children. Data from the National Long itudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 47 a nationally representative study of adolescents in schools (gra des 7 through 12), point to a similar pattern to the one found for Latino adults. Immigrant adolescents (across several ethnic groups) experience fewer physical health problems, have less experience with sex, are less likely to engage in delinquent and violent behavior, and ar e less likely to use controlled substances than United States-born adolescents. A number of smaller studies have also indicat ed that Latino youth have a higher risk of significant mental health problems. These incl ude depression, anxiety disorders, substance 34 abuse, eating disorders, and disruptive beha vior disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). There are multiple stressors that aggravate a ny biological vulnerability that Latino youth may have to mental health problems. Some come fr om the current environment, as discussed in Section 3. For immigrants, traumas in their home nations prior to immigration (war, terrorism, disasters, poverty, famine) and traumas in the pr ocess of immigration (risky journeys, witnessing death, victimization by smugglers, undocumented st atus, separation from extended family and even parents) all contribute significant stress. For all Latino youth, immigrant or U.S.-born, a dded stressors include poverty, discrimination, and domestic or community violence. Additionally, parents and extended family are often not available to supervise and monitor behaviors as a result of long work hours. Nor are they available to help them with the difficult task of acculturation, resulting in increased risk for disruptive behavioral problems. Acculturation presents special challenges and stre ssors for Latino children/adolescents and their families. Latino youth do learn the language, customs, and values of mainstream American culture faster than their parents, due to their exposure to peer culture and education. However, they often are torn between these new values a nd customs and the more traditional ones of their parents and elders. Parents and elders often f eel left behind and threatened by their children's rapid acculturation and fear losing them to American culture. Such tensions often lead to intergenera tional acculturation conflicts that, according to researchers such as Szapocznik 48, lead to an increased risk for substance abuse and disruptive behavioral disorders. Increased acculturation to mainstream culture also contributes to the loss of natural protective values, whic h include taboos against suicide, familismo (strong orientation towards both the nuclear and extended family as opposed to orientation to individualism), spirituality, and a more traditional body image orie ntation. The loss of these traditional cultural values and beliefs has been associated with incr eased levels of mental health problems such as suicide, substance abuse, disruptive behavioral problems, and eating disorders. More recently, research about acculturation has identified significant advantages of bi-culturalism for Latino adolescents, in which ties to both the old and new culture are encouraged. For instance, findings from a 2010 study showed th at Hispanic teenagers who hold on to their culture and whose parents get more involved in life in the United States have less anxiety and fewer social problems, as well as less chance of alcohol or drug abuse. More specifically, the study found that for every one-point increase in pa rents' involvement in US culture, there was a 15% to 18% decrease in adolescent social and behavior problems. 49 Interventions with Latino Children/Adolescents A number of investigators have carried out resear ch to develop innovative, culturally appropriate treatments for at-risk Latino youth populations and thei r families. These are part of the historical background for the Latino MFG, as adapted here for Latino adolescents. Two types of research-35 based interventions for working with Latino children and adolescents are discussed in this sub- section: Family Effectiveness Training Cuento and Hero/Heroine Modeling Family Effectiveness Training Szapocznik and his colleagues have designed interventions for Latino families in Miami. These authors combine st ructural and strategic family approaches with attention to the ecosystems in which families liv e. The treatments are typically targeted at changing family interactions, with the goal of reducing behavior problems in children/adolescents. Special attention was given to reducing drug use in these interventions. There are three specific components to accomplis h these goals in the program called Family Effectiveness Training (FET): family developm ent, bicultural effectiveness training, and strategic structural family systems therapy. In one study with high-risk 6- to 12-year-olds, children were found to have fewer behavior probl ems and higher self-esteem than children in the minimal contact condition. In addition, improvements in the family structure of families in the FET condition were observed. 50 The approaches used have many similarities to the Latino MFG, including cultural specificity. Cuento and Hero/Heroine Modeling Malgady, Rogler and Constantino developed an intervention for Latino children and adol escents in the New York City area. 51 Their framework draws on social learning theory, where positive mode ls are presented to children and adolescents in addressing problem areas such as anxiety, lo w self-esteem and acting out. One program is called Cuento (storytelling) therapy and uses Puerto Rican folktales. A second, called Hero/Heroine Modeling, uses metaphors ( met\u00e1for a) as a teaching tool. Both treatments have helped in the reduction of depressive symptoms , as well as improving self-esteem and social functioning. The interactional qualities of these pr ograms, through focus on the adolescent rather than the parents, are still similar to the MFG approach in that they focus on specific problems. Other recent research has shown that adjunct interventions incorporating parents into the treatment process for their children are likely to enhance the effects of treatment and strengthen the adolescent's commitment to a treatment pr ogram. Involving parents may help address treatment resistance, enhance treatment effects, alleviate the stigma of being the identified patient, and maintain therapeutic changes within a family that is more sensitive, supportive and knowledgeable. Several studies already have iden tified the need for parental involvement when treating depression in youth. 52 Problems in Service Delivery Adolescents and the providers serving them face a number of challenges in the service delivery process that, if not addressed well, can lead to significantly poorer outcomes. In this sub-section, the following challenges are addressed: 36 Limited training for providers about appropriate developmental stages Diagnostic labeling Limited access to mental health services Limited access to interpreters for Spanish-speaking adolescents and families Limited training for providers about appropriate developmental stages The emphasis in this manual has been on cultural factors specific to Latino communities, families and adolescents, but clinicians also need to have good training about adolescent development and the various stages their clients have been or will be moving through. While most providers will hopefully have been given pre-service training on this subject, mental health agencies often do not have the resources or the time to supplement with additional training that focuses on the particular cultural and life circumstances of their client population. Under these conditions it is easy for clinicians to misunderstand behaviors of their adoles cent clients, and/or reactions of families. At the least, such context needs to be addressed in supervision. Diagnostic labeling Clinicians often are concerned about assigning a diagnostic label to an adolescent client, even though such identificati on may be necessary to make funding available for services. It is common practice to use somewhat less-stigmatizing labels such as \"disruptive disorder\" or \"oppositional-defiant disorder\" wh en in fact a more serious diagnosis (e.g., \"conduct disorder\") may sometimes be appropria te. In assessment and treatment planning, careful decisions need to be made about how to use these labels, and some discussion in MFG family sessions also may be in order. Cultura l differences also should be weighed, since Latino families may have stronger and more negative emo tional reactions to some diagnostic categories than to others. Moreover, care needs to be taken to look at culturally-relevant circumstances that lead to situational problems, such as adjustment disorder s that are rooted in a reality such as a key caregiver (e.g., a grandmother) returning to a count ry of origin - sometimes under very negative circumstances such as deportation. Under such circumstances, emotional reactions may be quite appropriate, and brief interventions effective in resolving the problem. For other adolescents, emotional challenges come from having experienced multiple transitions in culture and country during their developmental years. They may live first with their parents and then with extended family either in the United States or in the family's country of origin. Moving back and forth, especially if some or all in the family are undocumented, can be extremely stressful and produce situationally-based adjustment disorders. Limited access to mental health services A major problem in addressing the mental health needs of Latino youth is their lack of access to mental health services. Studies show that Latino youth are able to use these services about half as much as youth from other ethnic/racial groups. 53 The general shortage of child and adolescent mental health services disproportionately affects Latino youth due to the young age of the La tino population in the U.S. (36% of Latinos are under age 18). Lack of insurance coverage also may be a factor in limiting access as well (problems associated with lack of coverage for MFG services are covered in Section 5). 37 Limited access to interpreters for Spanish-speaking families and adolescents In the pilot projects described in the Manual for the Latino MFG, and in the agencies where they were conducted, fully bilingual clinical staff are readily available. In many other mental health settings, bilingual staff may be in limited supply, ma king necessary interpreters for some clinical staff and their clients or families. But especially in the current tight budgetary times, interpreters also may be in short supply, and this reality needs to be figured in to service planning. 38 SECTION 5 IMPLEMENTING THE LATINO MULTIFAMILY GROUP PROGRAM The Latino MFG program is designed for use with Spanish-speaking Latino families of adolescents, ages 12-16, who have disorders lik e ADHD or serious emotional disturbances like depression, and who are receiving services from a public, or private nonprofit, mental health agency. In most cases, these services are bei ng given on an outpatient basis, although in one of the pilot test settings, about 10% of adolescent clients have required hospitalization as well. Medication may be a part of treatment both for out patient and inpatient services. In this section, information and suggestions are provided for the actual implementation of the program. First, a decision needs to be made to adopt th e program (see Section 1 for more detail, and for the larger context of systems change that a pplies when Latino MFG programs are implemented). Next, the program needs to be implemented, following a five-step process. Five Steps to Implement the Latino MFG Program The following steps need to be taken to implem ent this program, after the initial decision to adopt has been made: 1 - Conduct a needs and readiness assessment to determine whether the resources and motivation necessary for a successful implementati on are present in an agency. If the needs assessment indicates that there are problems likel y to interfere with successful implementation, then a decision can be made to intervene with these problems, delay the implementation until they are resolved, and/or decide not to move forward. Information on costs of the LMFG implementation is given in a separate section below. Before investing financial and human resour ces to implement the Latino MFG program, a readiness assessment for the organization consideri ng adoption also is desirable. This can be done formally using a readiness assessment inst rument, or less formally by a group discussion (perhaps with a written summary done later that all participants can read and agree to) about factors such as: Can fully bilingual staff or family members serve as facilitators for the Latino MFG program? Are there families who may be willing to participate in the program? Are the necessary financial resources availabl e for implementation of the program, including staff training? Are the necessary financial resources available for operating the program? Is the organization's CEO (and if relevant, boa rd of directors) supportive of the program? 39 Is there a champion for the Latino MFG program who will guide the implementation process? Are there resources and structure available to support gathering of data about the process and outcomes of the Latino MFG program once it is implemented? Sometimes the financial factors can be complex. For instance, in some states Medicaid billing codes will only support physicians as the provide rs of an MFG program. In all the pilot implementations discussed here, family participants are from poor families that do not have insurance, so some sort of public payment is n eeded. Training often is the most difficult part of the MFG process to get paid for - in some cases, a local foundation, corporation or other charitable organization might be approached to pay for the training. In some cases, particularly given budget constraints in many public mental health agencies, professional staff may decide to recruit volunteer family facilitators to actually lead the groups, as discussed above. Agency resources still are n eeded for training of the facilitators, mechanical costs of the groups (food, transportation, meeting room, etc.) and for some supervision, but the costs can be reduced significantly in this way. Promotoras (these indigenous health care work ers go by other names in some parts of the country) might be engaged as co-facilitators in so me cases, if they are fa miliar with the family issues surrounding the types of clients whose families will be included in the Latino MFG. Another issue that needs to be settled: will the fam ily co-facilitators be paid for their work or are they volunteers? There is no one right answer, but this question needs to be addressed up front. Implementation also needs to focus on setti ng the goals of the groups depending upon the adolescents whose families are to be included. Goals for adolescents with disorders like ADHD are different than for serious and persistent em otional disturbances like depression. Also, some adolescents may need assistance with medicati on compliance, and regardless, in many cases, it may be valuable for the adolescent client to be part of the MFG. The MFG program is quite flexible - in essence, it forms a \"shell\" of process activities (joining, problem-solving etc.) that can be used to a ddress many different types of populations and problems. In the end, each variation requires inde pendent evaluation to be sure that the program works for that particular purpose. Variations also may be undertaken in some of the process dimensions of the program (how long it lasts, who facilitates, etc.), and again evaluation is needed to learn whether these adaptations appear to be viable. 2 - Conduct an exploratory presentation to staff , to introduce the MFG concept and its adaptation for Spanish-speaking Latino families. If possible, the La tino MFG adopters should identify a local professional who's already implem ented an MFG, and/or or a researcher who's studied families of adolescents with ADHD, depr ession or other disorders, who can serve as facilitator for such a session. On th e Valley Nonprofit Resources website (www.valleynonprofitresources.org, Resources Sec tion) there is a Latino MFG Program PowerPoint which can be used to guide this presentation. 40 At the end of the exploratory presentation, a decision can be made about whether to implement the Latino MFG in the agency setting. Then, decisions need to be made about how to conduct the staff training (step 3) and who the facilitato rs will be. Considerations related to co- facilitation or facilitation by a family advocate are presented below. 3 - Conduct staff training for facilitators, including clinical staff and/or family advocates. This in-service training program typically is given over one day, following a format laid out in a staff training PPT, also available on the VNR website (see above). This PPT first introduces the MFG program and its extensive research background, th en the LMFG and its adaptations of language and cultural context for Spanish-speaking Latino fa milies. The educational workshop for staff is presented in English, but the actual sessions are pr esented in Spanish - so all those who will be actually facilitating groups must be bilingual. The section below on \"Adaptation of the MFG Pr ogram for Latino Families\" helps to provide context for how the MFG program actually will opera te with Latino families. Sections 2 and 3 of this manual should be helpful in that regard as well. The Latino MFG Staff Training PPT provides much of the information needed to develop basic knowledge and skills, along with the material in th is Manual. For those who want more detailed background on MFG, the McFarlane book overviewing this program can be consulted; 54 however, it should be noted that this book is or iented to MFG programs for families of adult schizophrenics, not to Spanish-speaking Latino adolescents. Brief information on MFG and on the larger topic of evidence-based practices is available in three short documents that can be downloaded from www.valleynonprofitresources.org (R esources section, Raising the Bar page): Background on the MFG Program - a brief overview of MFG in a format suitable for sharing with staff training participants Evidence-Based Practices: Frequently-Asked Questions - definition and discussion of the concept of EBPs Implementing and Sustaining EBPs: An Overview - a discussion of the central factors in systems change related to successful im plementation of an EBP like the Latino MFG, and a brief summary of the research lite rature about effective practices for implementation and sustainability Trainers should be clinical staff who are familia r with the Latino MFG program and have run it. In some cases, implementers might contract w ith MFG creator Dr. William McFarlane's training and consulting entity to provide professional tr aining onsite about MFG. Information about possible costs is given in the section on co sts. Dr. McFarlane can be contacted at mcfarw@mmc.org or by telephone at (207) 662-2091. 4 - Implement the LMFG program, beginning with the joining process. When sufficient families are recruited, the one-day family ps ychoeducation session can be conducted, using of the topical PPTs on the VNR website, Resources section, Latino MFG Program page (see above). The topical PPTs, all presen ted in Spanish, cover Depression, ADHD and 41 PTSD/Anxiety. Also, the Family Guidelines for Latinos, Six Important Messages for Latino Families, Problem-Solving Steps and Family Education Workshop for Latinos: Suggested Schedule handouts included as appendices to this Manual can be reproduced for this session. This serves to initiate the MFG program, as described at the beginning of the Manual. 5 - Gather data on process and impact once the LMFG program is fully implemented, and on its way to twelve (or six) months of operation. I ndications about how this evaluation can be done are contained within the two Latino MFG Pilot Evaluation Reports (also available on the VNR website). Adaptation of the MFG Program for Latino Families In this sub-section, the following specific topics are addressed: Changes in engagement Changes in joining Changes in format and content of educational workshop Changes in multifamily group sessions When the MFG approach is used for monolingual Spanish-speaking Latino families, changes need to be made in each of these component s of the original MFG program. The following provides an overview of these changes, which ma y be particularly useful (along with other material in this Manual) for clinicians who have previously been trained in the implementation of MFG with non-Latino populations. Changes in engagement Although in the Latino culture, cari ng for a family member may be seen as the mother's domain, it is critically important to engage fathers and other key male family figures. Special efforts are advisable in reaching out to the male authority figure (including home visits) as his participation often puts an imprimatur of legitimacy on the entire psychoeducational enterprise. One effective method to engage any family member, as mentioned, is to acknowledge that the family has a level of expertise about their ill relative that would be very useful to the treatment process. Thus in the engagement process it is essential to listen carefully to what families have to say about the disorder of their adolescent relative. It is critical to use their language rather than biomedical jargon it. A common mistake made by th erapists is to assume that family members will accept a biomedical model of the disorder. A preferable approach is to incorporate the way family members understand the disorder into the psychoeducational enterprise. Changes in joining The joining process is designed to make the family members feel like a part of the treatment team. As such, it builds on the good will created during the engagement process by continuing to display respect for the family's values, preferences and attitudes. 42 For instance, as the clinician gets to know the family member, he or she must be careful to maintain a nonjudgmental attitude toward the opinions expressed by the family member. The key is to form a bond, rather than criticize family members for beliefs they have (e.g., that the disorder may be the result of brujer\u00eda or witchcraft). Another important part of the joining process is to allow ample time for family members to describe their points of view. The key to joining is to develop a relationship rather than to race through an agenda. It is not unusual for family me mbers to want to discuss issues that may not seem germane to the problems of their loved one. Nevertheless, the therapist is advised to spend as much time as is feasible to ma ke the key relative feel that the clinician will be a long-term ally of the family as a whole. Changes in family education workshop As mentioned, in the Latino MFG program the psychoeducational workshop for families is c onducted in Spanish. The written materials, however, are best made available in both English and Spanish to accommodate all levels of acculturation among the generations. It is also he lpful to have as much material as possible available in pictorial form to counter the high prevalence of illiteracy in either language. The MFG trainers need to allow enough time to get through the formal agenda and to make sure family participants are heard. Family members w ill want to discuss their specific situations and problems during the educational workshop. Time must be allocated for them to adequately address their concerns and needs. Changes in MultiFamily Group sessions Although it is important that families identify the issues that make up the bulk of MFG sessi ons, some problems may not be addressed spontaneously, thereby requiring the therapist to elicit them from family members. The reluctance to bring up certain issues may resu lt from unwillingness to discuss sensitive subjects (e.g., sexuality), but also may stem from a lack of experience with the process of group discussion. In addition, some families may be overly deferential to the therapists, believing that they (the therapists) are there to initiate the discussi on and ask the necessary questions. Latino MFG clinicians need to work to encourage an incr easing willingness to initiate discussion within and between family members. Eventually, clinicia ns can function as fac ilitators of dialogue and skills training for family members. Facilitation by a Family Advocate In many cases it also can be beneficial to iden tify a family advocate to help deliver the Latino MFG program. Family advocates can be identifie d by consultation with local community leaders or through groups such as the National Alliance fo r Mental Illness (NAMI). These need to be Spanish-speaking individuals who are willing to volunteer time to work with a mental health agency clinician in supporting a group, although in some cases they also can be compensated for this work. 43 The MFG process can then be co-facilitated by th e mental health professional and the family advocate. In one of the recent pilot tests of the Latino MFG both co-facilitators are family advocates, with training and supervision provided by agency clinical staff. The family advocate will first need to engage in a training process to become familiar with the MFG intervention, as is the case for agency clin ical staff who serve as facilitators. During the training, the family advocate will receive information about the symptoms and causes of mental disorders, pharmacological and psychosocial treat ments, self-care, communication and problem- solving skills, as well as the importance of long-term engagement in the treatment process. The MFG training ideally involves about 12 hour s of didactic and experiential activities, conducted by a team of mental health professi onals with years of experience teaching these methods. After completion of the training, the fa mily advocate can be paired with a trained mental health professional as an active collabor ator in all aspects of the MFG program, from engagement to ongoing psychoeducational groups (a nd in some cases may work with another advocate as needed). Given the success of both professionally run multi-family groups and family-conducted psycho- educational programs such as Family-to-Family, 55 it is expected that the co-facilitated MFG program can serve as an effective amalgamation of the two models. An additional benefit of this approach is to increase the likelihood that community providers will be able to replicate the co-facilitated MFG progr am because the presence of the family advocate allows the community agency greater flexibility in the allocation of their most precious resource - trained mental health professionals. Furthe r resource conservation may be possible if both facilitators are family advocates - initial results from the recent Latino MFG pilot test of this strategy indicates that it works well, but true research validation has yet to be done. Costs of Implementing the Latino MFG Program The costs associated with an implementation of the Latino MFG program in a mental health agency fall into three categories: Costs for the initial staff training Costs for the program's implementation, including the family psychoeducation workshop Costs for ongoing operation of the program During planning for Latino MFG program implem entation, these costs can be summarized, at least roughly. However, no rigorous data about cost experiences have been accumulated yet, so comparisons are not possible at the present time. If one or more volunteers are identified to facilita te the initial staff training (as described above), the costs for this training session may be mini mal, except for the staff time devoted to the training effort. However, in some cases an outsi de trainer may be brought in to provide special expertise to agency staff for this training process. Costs of outside trainers vary. 44 As for program implementation costs, a recent study by Breitborde and colleagues56 examined the costs of implementing an MFG (this study was not focused either on Latino families or adolescent clients, but rather on adults from all backgrounds with schizophrenia). In this study, the costs of implementing an MFG were extended to include (1) labor costs for three one-hour joining sessions provided by one clinician (assu ming 6 families per group), (2) one eight-hour psychoeducation workshop provided by two clinicians, and (3) two additional hours of clinician time per patient for other activities (e.g., preparatory activities and paperwork). This totals 46 hours, times an estimated $19.44 per hour (the average 2008 salary for a \"health counselor\" in the US), or $894.00 in 2008 dollars. These costs may be modified if only one clinician conducts the workshop, or other adjustments are made. In adapting these cost estimates, it should be not ed that bilingual staff typically have higher salaries (up to $55,000 a year) and so do clinical staff with advanced graduate degrees. Also, there are important regional differences in salary level for these personnel. Results from the study suggest that multifamily group psychoeducation may not only be a cost- effective intervention for first-episode psychosis, but may often be a cost-saving intervention, even under very conservative assumptions of benefit. Costs of ongoing operation continue for one or two facilities (unless they are volunteers) for weekly sessions lasting from six months to one year. There may also be costs for family transportation, child care, food, transportation, etc. 45 SECTION 6 RESOURCES FOR FURTHER LEARNING Professional and Scientific Publications Acosta, F. (1987).

Spanish Language Latino MFG Materials The following four items are presented both in English and Spanish. All are adapted from the New York State Research Foundation in Mental Hygiene report (2008): Family Guidelines for Latinos (specific to depression) Six Important Messages for Latino Families Problem Solving Steps Family Education Workshop Agenda 53 FAMILY GUIDELINES FOR LATINOS Offer support : Let depressed teenagers know that you're there for them, fully and unconditionally. Hold back from asking a lot of question (teenagers don't like to feel patronized or crowded) but make it clear that you're ready and willing to provide whatever support they need. Be gentle but persistent : Don't give up if your adolescent shuts you out at first. Talking about depression can be very tough for teens. Be respectful of your child's comfort level while still emphasizing your concern and willingness to listen. Keep it warm : Family bonds are important. Family members' love and support for one another can be a big help. Validate feelings : Don't try to talk teens out of their depression, even if their feelings or concerns appear silly or irrational to you. Simply acknowledge the pain and sadness they are feeling. If you don't they will feel like you don't take their emotions seriously. Give each other space: Time out is important for everyone. It's okay to reach out, and it's also okay to say no. People need emotional space as well as physical space. Set limits : Everyone needs to know what the rules are. A few rules keep things calmer. Listen without lecturing : Resist any urge to criticize or pass judgment once your teenager begins to talk. The important thing is that your child is communicating. Avoid offering unsolicited advice or ultimatums as well. Keep it simple : Say what is needed - clearly, calmly and positively. Get the most out of medication : Medication needs be taken as prescribed, and never shared. Ask the doctor about side effects and interactions with other medications as well as herbal remedies. Carry on business as usual : Re-establish family routines as quickly as possible. Stay in touch with family and friends. Take care of yourself : Families need to take care of themselves, too. Take care of yourself. Otherwise, it's hard to care for a loved one. No street drugs or alcohol : They make symptoms worse, can cause relapse, and prevent recovery. Pick up on early signs : Note changes. Consult the family member's counselor. Solve problems step by step : Make changes gradually. Work on things one at a time. Lower expectations temporarily : Compare this month with last month, rather than with last year or next year. Comparing other families' progress with one's own isn't helpful or educational. 54 GU\u00cdA PARA sus su jovencito a hablar. Lo es a su estado temporalmente: Compare este mes con el mes anterior, en vez de pensar en el a\u00f1o pasado o el que progresos de otras familias en recuperaci\u00f3n. 55 SIX IMPORTANT MESSAGES FOR LATINO FAMILIES There is hope for the return of health. There are multiple pathways to mental health, including medical, psychiatric, and alternative remedies. Families are not to blame for mental disorders. Multiple family members can work as par tners with clinicians to help their loved ones, since families are experts on living with the disorder. Relatives can help their loved one because they possess great knowledge due to living with the disorder. The disorder can be understood in terms of mind, body and spirit. Families need to let their doctors know about their perceptions and usage of medication. 56 SEIS MENSAJES IMPORTANTES PARA hacer saber a su doctor sus percepci\u00f3nes y uso de la medicaci\u00f3n. 57 PROBLEM-SOLVING STEPS Define the problem. List all possible solutions. Discuss advantages and disadvantages. Choose the solution that best fits. Plan how to carry out the solution.
