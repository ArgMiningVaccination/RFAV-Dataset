Sodium borate is widely used in cleaning products (like borax), cosmetics, and personal care products. It is not safe to consume sodium borate, It differs from the mineral boron, which is thought to support bone health, improve nervous system functioning, reduce inflammation in the body, and balance hormones. This article discusses the differences between sodium borate and boron, as well as potential uses, side effects, and risks. maydays / Moment / Getty Images Sodium Borate vs. Boron Although sodium borate contains the mineral boron, it has very different uses, benefits, and risks. The mineral boron occurs naturally in foods and is sometimes taken as a dietary supplement. What Is Sodium Borate? Sodium borate is a naturally-occurring compound made of boron, oxygen, hydrogen, and sodium. Trace amounts are found in soil, water, plants, and animals, but it is most commonly found in sediments and sedimentary rock formations. Most sodium borate found in the United States comes from the seasonal lakes in the Mojave Desert in California. Sodium Borate vs. Borax vs. Boric Acid These three substances are sometimes mentioned interchangeably, but they are not all the same.Sodium borate is a naturally occurring substance made up of boron, oxygen, hydrogen, and sodium. It is not safe to consume.Borax is a powdery, white mineral, also known as sodium tetraborate, that is taken straight from the ground and is used in cleaning supplies and laundry detergent. It is not safe to consume and can be toxic if ingested.Boric acid is a boron compound but is more refined and processed than borax. Like borax it is not safe to consume and can be toxic if ingested. What is Boron? Researchers have discovered that the mineral boron is essential for plant health and that it may also play a role in human health. This mineral is found naturally in a variety of foods and is normally present in trace amounts in the body. It is also available as a dietary supplement. Although boron deficiency is rare, it has been linked to abnormal bone development and bone strength. Growing evidence suggests that boron could offer health benefits, including: Improved bone growth Maintaining bone mineral density to help prevent osteoporosis Improved joint mobility Reduced joint pain associated with osteoarthritis Balancing the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen 10 of the Highest Boron Foods for Healthy Bones and More What Is Sodium Borate Used For? Sodium borate and borax are naturally occurring compounds that are widely used in household cleaning products and as laundry detergent boosters. They are also added in diluted concentrations to a variety of products, such as: Medicated powdersSkin lotions and moisturizing productsCosmeticsMouthwashToothpaste (sodium borate and hydrogen peroxide)Topical astringentsEyewash solutions In 2020 the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel evaluated the scientific data and concluded that sodium borate and boric acid, are safe as cosmetic ingredients in concentrations less than or equal to 5%. Sodium borate and boric acid are added to personal care products as a preservative, emulsifier, or stabilizer. Borax is also used in making DIY slime that kids like to play with. Although large amounts of borax could be unsafe, the amount used in DIY slime is considered safe. Boric acid is made by combining sodium borate and sulfuric acid. It is mostly used as a pesticide for controlling insects, spiders, mites, algae, molds, fungi, and weeds. Sodium Borate Risks and Side Effects Sodium borate and Borax that are used for cleaning, pesticides, or other household uses can be toxic if ingested, causing: VomitingDiarrheaCardiovascular disordersSeizuresDeath if consumed in large amounts Sodium borate and borax powders can cause respiratory problems (cough or difficulty breathing), eye irritation, and skin rash when exposed to large amounts. Children should avoid licking or eating DIY slime and avoid borax-containing slime if they have cuts, eczema, or other wounds on their hands. If you're concerned, look for slime recipes that use cornstarch or other non-irritating ingredients. Summary Sodium borate is a naturally occurring compound that is used in cleaning products, laundry detergents, cosmetics, and personal care products. It is different from the mineral boron, which is available as a supplement and in a variety of foods and may provide health benefits, such as balancing sex hormones, strengthening bones, and reducing arthritis pain. It is not safe to consume sodium borate, Borax, or boric acid, and exposure to large amounts of these products can cause significant side effects.
