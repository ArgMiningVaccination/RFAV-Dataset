MIKIO SANKEY A quest to learn more about energy healing lead me to study Esoteric Acupuncture from Dr. Mikio Sankey in 2015. With this system of acupuncture, deeper shifts are possible in the energetic field. Rather than balancing energy meridians in the body, Esoteric Acupuncture facilitates a connection between the body and the Quantum field of potential, allowing for healing at the root pattern of energy, higher states of consciousness, and inner peace. Your physical body is responding to and creating health or dis-ease from an energetic blueprint. Everything starts as energy, and then condenses into physical form. Patterns of energy, emotions, thoughts, and beliefs cause stress and symptoms to continue to reoccur until they are transformed and transmuted from the root. To clear energetic blocks, increase awareness and levels of consciousness, and to balance the energy in the chakras, I use Esoteric Acupuncture - in which smaller acupuncture needles are placed in sacred geometry patterns. The goal of this treatment is to align you with your divine blueprint (or True Nature) - your connection to pure, unlimited energy from Source/Spirit/Universe. This is also known as the Quantum field of potential, the Ocean of Awareness, the Loving Light of Consciousness, the Tao, God, Shiva - the pattern of energy that underlies the whole of our manifest Universe. This is the realm where anything is possible, including the healing you desire. Esoteric Acupuncture balances the energy of the subtle body, or the energetic field. Just like the physical body needs cleansing, nourishment, and balancing, the subtle body benefits from practices and therapies to get the energy field \"tuned up\". The cells, molecules, and tissues of our body vibrate at a certain frequency. This frequency is determined by the health of our physical body, the energy of the physical environment that we inhabit, as well as our thoughts, feelings, and experiences. When the energetic field needs tuning, or is out of alignment, you can feel stuck or that life is harder than it needs to be. When your energetic field is in alignment, you are better able to operate in the present moment with power, passion, and purpose - as your best, vibrant, radiant self! Esoteric Acupuncture is a form of energy healing for the subtle body. Benefits include higher consciousness, spiritual awakening, connection to higher self and life purpose, balancing the chakras, and deep meditative relaxation. Emphasis is on aligning and expanding your Heart Center. "}
