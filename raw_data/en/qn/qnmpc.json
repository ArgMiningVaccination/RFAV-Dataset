Similarly, the world's great religions state that all created things originate in the cosmic vibratory energy of Aum or Amen, the Word or Holy Ghost. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made which was made\" (John 1:1, 3). \"These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God\" (Rev. 3:14). Even as sound is produced by the vibration of a running motor, so the omnipresent sound of Aum faithfully testifies to the running of the \"Cosmic Motor,\" which upholds all life and every particle of creation through vibratory energy. By concentration and will power we can consciously increase the body's supply of cosmic energy. That energy can be directed to any body part; or it can be released again into space through the sensitive antenna of the fingertips, to flow as a healing force to those in need \u2014 even if they are thousands of miles away. Through the great Aum vibration, we can directly contact God's omnipresent consciousness \u2014 where the illusory concepts of time and space are absent. Thus there is instant contact between the earnest request of one in need and the concentrated energy sent forth by those who are praying for others with the following method: (Stand while performing) With eyes closed, pray as follows: Conducting a Prayer Service at Home Those who are unable to join a group prayer circle may conduct a private or family prayer service at home, following the format outlined above. This may be made a part of one's regular morning or evening meditation if desired. (If possible, it is helpful to conduct prayer services always in a room, or part of a room, that is habitually used for this purpose, as this will make it easier to focus one's concentration and loving attention on God.) Many families have found that gathering together \u2014 even inviting friends and other members of the community \u2014 to pray for others and for world peace contributes greatly to a spirit of love and harmony in the home and in the larger community. Blessed are those who pray for others, for in so doing, they become aware of the unity of all life. We are not isolated beings, struggling alone against the forces of adversity. Our happiness is linked with the happiness of all; our highest fulfilment lies in the welfare of all. To all of you who realize this truth and give of your time and sympathy in participating in the Worldwide Prayer Circle, we extend our deep appreciation. Through such selfless service to humanity, may you ever be aware of the constant protection and all satisfying love of God. \u2014 Yogoda Satsanga Society of India Request for Prayers Requests for prayers \u2014 whether for oneself or others \u2014 are always welcome, and are given immediate loving attention by the members of the Prayer Council. They may be [submitted online](https://yssofindia.org/prayer), or by phone or letter to [Yogoda Satsanga Society of India](https://yssofindia.org/about/Contact-Us). Those whose names have been submitted are included in special morning and evening healing services for three months. They need not be present at a prayer service to benefit from its healing power. Prayer requests are kept strictly confidential. Requests need not include a description of the problem, unless one wishes to describe it. All that is needed for the work of the Prayer Council and the Worldwide Prayer Circle is the name of the person for whom healing is desired. If details of a problem are known to individuals in a prayer circle, such details should not be discussed. Otherwise, negative mental associations may weaken the force of prayer. Instead, group members should concentrate solely on God's healing power and on a state of perfection to replace any inharmonious condition. "}
