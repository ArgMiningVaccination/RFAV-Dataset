Resilient nations . Each year over 30 million men and women spend time in prisons and other closed settings,* of whom over one third are pretrial detainees. 1 Virtually all of them will return to their communities, many within a few months to a year. Globally, the prevalence of HIV, sexually trans- mitted infections, hepatitis B and C and tubercu-losis in prison populations is 2 to 10 times as high, and in some cases may be up to 50 times as high, as in the general population. 2 HIV rates are particularly high among women in deten-tion. Risks affect prisoners, those working in prisons, their families and the entire community. For these reasons, it is essential to provide HIV interventions in these settings, both for prison-ers and for those employed by prison authorities.** ,3 However, access to HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes is often lacking in prisons and other closed settings. Few countries imple-ment comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes in prisons. Many fail to link their programmes in prisons to the national AIDS, tuberculosis or public health programmes. Many fail to provide adequate occupational health services to staff working in prisons. 4 In addition to HIV risk behaviours, such as unsafe sexual activities and injecting drug use, factors related to the prison infrastructure, prison man-agement and the criminal justice system also contribute to vulnerability to HIV, tuberculosis *In this paper, the term \"prisons and other closed settings\" refers to all places of detention within a country, and the terms \"prisoners\" and \"detainees\" to all those detained in those places, including adults and juveniles, during the investigation of a crime, while awaiting trial, after conviction, before sentencing and after sentencing. **Those employed in prisons and closed settings could include prison officials\u2014including government officials\u2014security officers, prison wardens, guards and drivers, and other employ- ees, such as food services, medical and cleaning staff.and other health risks in prisons. These factors include overcrowding, violence, poor prison conditions, corruption, denial, stigma, lack of protection for vulnerable prisoners, lack of train-ing for prison staff, and poor medical and social services. 5 Finally, addressing HIV in prisons effectively cannot be separated from broader questions of criminal justice and national policy. In particular, reducing the excessive use of pre-trial detention and greatly increasing the use of non-custodial alternatives to imprisonment are essential components of any response to HIV and other health issues in prisons and other closed settings.

Protecting staff from occupational hazardsHIV prevention, treatment and care in prisons and other closed settings page 2 The comprehensive package consists of the 15 interventions that are essential for effective HIV prevention and treatment in closed settings. While each of these interventions alone is useful in addressing HIV in prisons, together they form a package and have the greatest impact when delivered as a whole. Information, education and communication Awareness-raising, information and education about HiV, sexually transmitted infections, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis are needed in all closed settings. Programmes delivered by the authorities or by civil society organizations should be supplemented by peer-education programmes, developed and implemented by trained fellow prisoners. 9 Condom programmes in all closed settings, both for men and for women, condoms and water-based lubricant should be provided free of charge. They should be made easily and discreetly accessible to prisoners at various locations without their having to request them and without their being seen by others. 10 condoms should also be provided for intimate visits. Prevention of sexual violence Policies and strategies for the prevention, detection and elimination of all forms of violence, particularly sexual violence, should be implemented in prisons.11 Vulnerable prisoners, such as people with different sexual orientation, young offenders and women, must always be held separately from adult or male offenders. Appropriate measures should be established to report and address instances of violence. Drug dependence treatment including opioid substitution therapy evidence-based drug dependence treatment with informed consent should be made avail- able in prisons in line with national guidelines. c onsidering that opioid substitution therapy is the most effective drug dependence treatment for people dependent on opiates, where it is available in the community, it should be accessible in prisons.12, 13 Authorities should also provide a range of other evidence-based drug dependence treatment options for prisoners with problematic drug use.1 2 3 4scope and purpose This paper is designed to support countries in mounting an effective response to HIV and AIDS in prisons and other closed settings. It takes into con-sideration principles of international law, including international rules, guidelines, declarations and covenants governing prison health, international standards of medical ethics and international labour standards. 6,7,8In providing guidance to national authorities charged with the management and oversight of prisons and closed settings, it is aimed at supporting decision makers in ministries of justice, authorities responsi-ble for closed settings and ministries of health, as well as authorities responsible for workplace safety and occupational health, in planning and implement-ing a response to HIV in closed settings. The 15 key interventionsHIV prevention, treatment and care in prisons and other closed settings page 3 Needle and syringe programmes Prisoners who inject drugs should have easy and confidential access to sterile drug inject - ing equipment, syringes and paraphernalia, and should receive information about the programmes.14 Prevention of transmission through medical or dental services HiV and hepatitis can be easily spread through the use of contaminated medical or dental equipment. Therefore, prison medical, gynaecological and dental service providers should adhere to strict infection-control and safe-injection protocols, and facilities should be adequately equipped for this purpose. 15, 16 Prevention of transmission through tattooing, piercing and other forms of skin penetration Authorities should implement initiatives aimed at reducing the sharing and reuse of equip- ment used for tattooing, piercing and other forms of skin penetration, and the related infections. 17 Post-exposure prophylaxis Post-exposure prophylaxis should be made accessible to victims of sexual assault and to other prisoners exposed to HiV. c lear guidelines should be developed and communicated to prisoners, health-care staff and other employees. 18, 19 HIV testing and counselling Prisoners should have easy access to voluntary HiV testing and counselling programmes at any time during their detention. Health-care providers should also offer HiV testing and counselling to all detainees during medical examinations, and recommend testing and counselling if someone has signs or symptoms that could indicate HiV infection, and to female prisoners who are pregnant. All forms of coercion must be avoided and testing must always be done with informed consent, pre-test information, post-test counselling, protection of confidentiality and access to services that include appropriate follow-up, antiretroviral therapy and other treatment as needed. 20 HIV treatment, care and support in prisons, HiV treatment, including antiretroviral therapy, care and support, should be at least equivalent to that available to people living with HiV in the community and should be in line with national guidelines and based on international guidelines. 21 Support, including nutritional supplements, should be provided to patients under treatment. Particular efforts should be undertaken to ensure continuity of care at all stages, from arrest to release. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis Given the high risk for transmission of tuberculosis and high rates of HiV-tuberculosis co-morbidity in closed settings, all prisons should intensify active case-finding, provide isoniazid preventive therapy and introduce effective tuberculosis control measures. 22 5 6 7 8 9 10 11HIV prevention, treatment and care in prisons and other closed settings page 4 in particular, people living with HiV should be screened for tuberculosis and people with tuberculosis should be advised to have an HiV test. All people living with HiV without symptoms of active tuberculosis (no current cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats) should be offered isoniazid preventive therapy. Prisons and cells should be well ventilated and have good natural light. Tuberculosis patients should be segregated until they are no longer infectious, and education activities should cover coughing etiquette and respira-tory hygiene. Tuberculosis programmes, including treatment protocols, should be aligned and coordinated with or integrated in national tuberculosis control programmes and work closely with the HiV programme. c ontinuity of treatment is essential to prevent the devel- opment of resistance and must be ensured at all stages of detention. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV The full range of prevention of mother-to-child HiV transmission interventions, including family planning and antiretroviral therapy, should be easily accessible to women living with HiV, to pregnant women and to breastfeeding mothers in prisons, in line with national guidelines and based on international guidelines. 23, 24 children born to mothers living with HiV in prison should be followed up, in accordance with those guidelines. Prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections Sexually transmitted infections, particularly those that cause genital ulcers, increase the risk for transmission and acquisition of HiV. e arly diagnosis and treatment of such infec - tions should therefore be part of HiV prevention programmes in prisons. Vaccination, diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis Prisons should have a comprehensive hepatitis programme, including the provision of free hepatitis b vaccination for all prisoners, free hepatitis A vaccination to those at risk, and other interventions to prevent, diagnose and treat hepatitis b and c equivalent to those available in the community (including condom, needle and syringe programmes and drug dependence treatment as needed). Protecting staff from occupational hazards occupational safety and health procedures on HiV, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis should be established for employees. Prison staff and workers in prisons should receive informa-tion, education and training by labour inspectors and specialists in medicine and public health enabling them to perform their duties in a healthy and safe manner. Prison staff should never be subject to mandatory testing and should have easy access to confidential HiV testing. employees should have free access to hepatitis b vaccination and easy access to protec - tive equipment, such as gloves, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation masks, protective eyewear, soap, and search and inspection mirrors, and to post-exposure prophylaxis in cases of occupational exposure. 25 Workplace mechanisms for inspecting compliance with applica- ble standards and reporting occupational exposures, accidents and diseases should also be established. 2612 13 14 15HIV prevention, treatment and care in prisons and other closed settings page 5 addITIonal InTerVenTIons Some other interventions have not been included in the package of 15 key interventions but nevertheless are important and should not be overlooked. These include the distribution of toothbrushes and shavers in basic hygiene kits, adequate nutrition, intimate-visit programmes, palliative care and compassionate release for terminal cases. guIdIng prInc Iples 1. Prison health is part of public health The vast majority of people in prisons eventually return to their communities. Any diseases contracted in closed settings, or made worse by poor conditions of confinement, become matters of public health. 27, 28 HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis and all other aspects of physical and mental health in prisons should be the concern of health professionals on both sides of the prison walls. It is pivotal to foster and strengthen collaboration, coordination and integration among all stakeholders, including ministries of health and other ministries with responsibilities in prisons, as well as community-based service providers. Equally important is ensuring continuity of care. In order to ensure that the benefits of treatment (such as antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis treatment, viral hepatitis treatment or opioid substitution ther - apy) started before or during imprisonment are not lost, as well as to prevent the development of resist-ance to medications, provision must be made to allow people to continue these treatments without interruption, at all stages of detention: while the per - son is in police and pretrial detention, in prison, dur - ing institutional transfers and after release. 2. Human rights approach and principle of equivalence of health in prisons Prisoners should have access to medical treatment and preventive measures without discrimination on the grounds of their legal situation. Health in prison is a right guaranteed in international law, as well as in international rules, guidelines, declarations and covenants. 29 The right to health includes the right to medical treatment and to preventive measures as well as to standards of health care at least equivalent to those available in the community. 30 Access to health services in prisons should be consistent with medical ethics, national standards, guidelines and control mechanisms. Similarly, prison staff need a safe workplace and have the right to proper protec-tion and adequate occupational health services. Protecting and promoting the health of detainees goes beyond simply diagnosing and treating diseases as they appear in individual detainees. It includes issues of hygiene, nutrition, access to meaningful activity, recreation and sport, contact with family, freedom from violence or abuse by other detainees and freedom from physical abuse, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment at the hands of prison officers. 31 Medical ethics should always guide all health inter - ventions in closed settings, and therefore interven-tions should always be geared towards the best interests of the patient. All treatments should be vol-untary, with the informed consent of the patient, and people living with HIV should not be segregated. 32 These principles recognize that some groups of pris-oners have special needs to be addressed and that incarceration is not a treatment for mentally ill peo-ple or for drug dependent people, for example. The principles also include safeguards against arbitrary arrest and extended pretrial detention, which are inextricably linked to overcrowding and the trans-mission of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis in closed settings. oTHer key recommenda TIons The following good-practice recommendations focus on ensuring an enabling and non-discriminatory environment for the introduction and implementation of the comprehensive package of HIV interventions. In the absence of such conditions, implementation could be challenging and intervention could be less effective.HIV prevention, treatment and care in prisons and other closed settings page 6 1. Ensure that prison settings are included in national HIV, tuberculosis and drug dependence treatment programming A health-in-prisons programme should be an integral part of national efforts to provide access to HIV and tuberculosis services, as well as to evidence-based drug dependence treatment. 33 Prison authori- ties should establish strong linkages with community-based care and involve outside service providers in delivering care in prisons. Whenever adequate care cannot be provided in prisons, detainees should be able to access health services in the community. 2. Adequately fund and reform health care in closed settings Health-care budgets for prisons must reflect the rela- tively greater needs of the prison population, and health care in these settings should be recognized as an integral part of the public health sector. It should not be limited to medical care, but should emphasize early disease detection and treatment, health promo-tion and disease prevention. 34 Qualified health officers must have the autonomy to decide the treatment needed for their patients, including on transfers to public health services. Addressing detainees' health needs will contribute to rehabilitation and successful reintegration into the community. In the longer term, transferring control of health in closed settings to public health authorities will have a positive impact on both prison and public health in general, and specifically on the delivery of the comprehensive package of HIV interventions in closed settings. 3. Ensure the availability of gender-responsive interventions Particular attention should be given to the specific needs and concerns of women. Women should have access to all interventions in the comprehensive package, but these interventions should be tailored to their specific needs and include, for example, attention to women's sexual and reproductive health needs. 35, 36 There is also a need for broader initiatives that acknowledge that the problems encountered by women in prisons often reflect, and are augmented by, their vulnerability, especially to sexual violence, and the abuse many of them have suffered outside or inside the prisons. 37 At the 2005 World Summit1 and at the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS in June 2006,2 governments endorsed the scaling up of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support with the goal of coming as close as possible to universal access by 2010. Achieving this goal requires partici- pation by all stakeholders, including prison systems. Greater access to HIV testing and counselling for prisoners is an essential compo- nent of countries' efforts to reach universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care. HIV programmes have been introduced in prisons in many countries, but most are small in scale and rarely comprehensive in nature. This document promotes a strategy for improv- ing access to HIV testing and counselling in prisons as part of a comprehensive HIV programme. Globally, at any given time, there are over 9 million people in prisons with an annual turnover of 30 million moving from prison to the community and back again. 3 The rates of HIV infection among prisoners in many coun- tries are higher than in the general population and risk behaviours, including consensual and non-consensual sexual activity and injecting drug use, are prevalent. 4, 5 Outbreaks of HIV infection have occurred in prisons in several countries, 4 demonstrating how rapidly HIV can spread in prison unless effective action is taken to prevent transmission. There is a high degree of mobility between prisons and the community and therefore implementation of public health initiatives within the prison will also be beneficial to the public health of communities. 6In May 2007, WHO and UNAIDS released the Guidance on provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling in health facilities. 7 The Guidance and the UNAIDS/WHO Policy statement on HIV testing 8 provide a useful framework and con- tain important principles and recommenda- tions that should guide the approach to expanding access to HIV testing and counselling for prisoners. In particular, they: t Strongly support efforts to scale up testing and counselling services through diverse meth- ods, including client-initiated and provider- initiated testing and counselling; t Acknowledge that the scaling up of testing and counselling must be accompanied by (a) access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services; and (b) a supportive environ- ment for people living with HIV and those most at risk for acquiring HIV infection; t Unequivocally oppose mandatory or com- pulsory testing and counselling; t Emphasize that, regardless of whether HIV testing and counselling is client- or provider- initiated, it should always be voluntary. In this policy statement the term \"prisons\" also refers to other places of detention, including pre-trial detention, and the term \"closed set- tings\" to compulsory treatment and rehabilita- tion centres and settings where migrants may be detained, such as immigration detention or removal centres; the term \"prisoner\" has been used to describe all males and females who are held in such places. The policy statement, however, does not apply to juvenile offenders, regardless of where they are detained, as special considerations apply to them. Policy brief HIV testing and counselling in prisons and other closed settings Background Women and HIV in prison settings Prisons ar e high-risk settings for the tr ansmission of HIV. However, HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes are not adequately developed and implemented to respond to HIV in prisons.1 Moreover, prison settings do not usually address gender-speci c needs. Both drug use and HIV infection are more prevalent among women in prison than among imprisoned men. 2 Women in prison are vulnerable to gender-based sexual violence; they may engage in risky behaviours and practices such as unsafe tattooing, injecting drug use, and, are more susceptible to self-harm. 3 Women in prisons Women prisoners present speci c challenges for correctional authorities despite, or perhaps because of the fact that they constitute a very small proportion of the prison population. The pro le and background of women in prison, and the reasons for which they are imprisoned, are different from those of men in the same situation.4 In particular, injecting drug users and sex workers are overrepresented. Once in prison, women's psychological, social and health care needs will also be different. It follows that all facets of prison facilities, programmes and services must be tailored to meet the particular needs of women offenders. Existing prison facilities, programmes and services for women inmates have all been developed initially for men, who have historically accounted for the largest proportion of the prison population. How many women are imprisoned? Globally, female prisoners represent about 5 per cent of the total prison population, but this proportion is increasing rapidly, particularly in countries where levels of illicit substance use are high. In 2005, worldwide, on any given date more than half a million women and girls were detained in prisons, either awaiting trial or serving sentences. 5 Three times this number (about 1.5 million) will be imprisoned in the course of any given year.addITIonal readIng This policy brief and its recommendations are based on a comprehensive review and analysis of evidence, on existing United Nations guidance and on an exten-sive consultation process regarding HiV in prisons. f or more details and for a complete list of references, see the technical background paper on HiV prevention, treatment and care in prisons and other closed settings: a comprehensive package of interventions (see www.unodc.org/aids).

Address stigma and the needs of particularly vulnerable people Some people are particularly vulnerable to abuse and to HIV and other negative health outcomes in prisons, including people who use drugs, young adults, people with disabilities, people living with HIV, transgen-dered persons and other sexual minorities, indige-nous people, racial and ethnic minorities, and people without legal documents or lacking legal status. Paying particular attention to their protection and to their needs in efforts to address HIV prevention and treatment in closed settings is therefore essential. 5. Undertake broader prison and criminal justice reforms Addressing HIV in prisons cannot be separated from wider questions of human rights and reform. Condi-tions in prisons, the way in which they are managed, criminal justice and national policy: all have an impact on the responses developed to address HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis in prisons. \" Improve conditions. Overcrowding, violence, inadequate natural lighting and ventilation, and lack of protection from extreme climatic condi-tions are common in closed settings in many regions of the world. When these conditions are combined with inadequate means for personal hygiene, inadequate nutrition, poor access to clean drinking water and inadequate health services, the vulnerability of people in prisons to HIV infection and other infectious diseases is increased, as is related morbidity and mortality. For those reasons, efforts to implement the comprehensive package should go hand in hand with reforms aimed at addressing these under - lying living and working conditions. \" Reduce the excessive use of pretrial detention. Pretrial detainees account for over a third of all the people in prisons around the world. Prisoners are frequently held in overcrowded, substandard conditions without medical treatment or any measures for infection control. International standards clearly state that pretrial detention should be an exceptional measure used sparingly. Therefore, programmes providing safe alterna-tives to pretrial detention for persons accused of low-level crimes should be implemented. 38 EVIDENCE FOR ACTION TECHNICAL PAPERS EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS HIV IN PRISONS ISBN 978 92 4 159619 0 A Framework for an Effective National Response Evidence for action on HIV/AIDS and injecting drug use POLICY BRIEF: REDUCTION OF HIV TRANSMIS SION IN PRISONS PREVENTION PROGRAMMES IN PRISONS In 1993 WHO issued guidelines on HIV infection and AIDS in prisons [1]. They included the following para - graphs. \"All prisoners have the right to receive health care, including preventive measures, equivalent to that available in the community without discrimination, in particular with respect to their legal status or nationality. The general principles adopted by national AIDS programmes should apply equally to prisoners and to the community. \"Drug-dependent prisoners should be encouraged to enrol in drug treatment programmes while in prison, with adequate protection of their condentiality. Such programmes should include information on the treatment of drug dependency and on the risks associated with different methods of drug use. Prisoners on methadone maintenance prior to imprisonment should be able to continue this treatment while in prison. In countries in which methadone maintenance is available to opiate- dependent individuals in the community, this treatment should also be available in prisons. \"In countries where bleach is available to injecting drug users in the community, diluted bleach or another effective viricidal agent, together with specic detailed instructions on cleaning injecting equipment, should be made available in prisons housing injecting drug users or where tattooing or skin piercing occurs. In countries where clean syringes and needles are made available to injecting drug users in the community, consideration should be given to providing clean injecting equipment during detention and on release to prisoners who request this.\" Since the early 1990s, various countries have introduced prevention programmes in prisons. Such programmes usually include education on HIV/AIDS, voluntary test - ing and counselling, the distribution of condoms, bleach, needles and syringes, and substitution therapy for inject - ing drug users. In 1991, 16 of 52 criminal justice systems surveyed in Europe had made bleach available, and by 1997 about 50% had done so. Various countries provide clean needles and syringes to inmates and implement sub - stitution treatment. However, many of these programmes are small in scale and restricted to a few prisons. None of the countries where evaluations of such programmes have been carried out have reversed their policies. EVIDENCE Four elements of prevention programmes in prisons have been studied extensively: the provision of bleach BACKGROUND The rates of HIV infection among inmates of prisons and other detention centres in many countries are signicantly higher than those in the general population. Examples include countries in Western and Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia. The available data on HIV infection rates in prisons cover inmates who were infected outside the institutions before imprisonment and persons who were infected inside the institutions through the sharing of contaminated injection equipment or through unprotected sex. Certain populations that are highly vulnerable to HIV infection have a heightened probability of incarceration because of their involvement in behaviours such as drug use and sex work.

A significant percentage of the prison population comprises individuals convicted of offences related to their own drug use, who are drug dependent or live with mental health problems. Many of the problems created by HIV infection, drug use and mental health issues in closed settings may be reduced if (a) non-custodial alternatives to imprisonment are implemented in the com-munity; (b) drug laws are reformed to reduce incarceration for drug use and for possession of drugs for personal use; and (c) evidence-based services, including drug and mental health treatment, are accessible in the community. 39,40 \" End the use of compulsory detention for the purpose of \"drug dependence treatment\" . In a number of countries, people identified as using drugs are detained in closed centres in the name of \"treatment\" or \"rehabilitation\". Such deten-tion usually takes place without due process or clinical assessment. Prisoners are often denied evidence-based drug dependence treatment and HIV-related and other basic health services To protect their health and human rights, prisoners should be released and the centres closed. 41 Until they are closed, providing HIV interven-tions in the centres is required, but without legit-imizing the existence of those centres.adap TIng THe guIdance To na TIonal and local s ITua TIons The comprehensive package and the recommenda-tions in this paper should be implemented in all pris-ons and other closed settings in a country. To this end, a national coordination mechanism should be established and composed of key national stakehold-ers, including the ministries and other authorities responsible for prisons, other relevant ministries such as those for health and labour, national AIDS committees, national tuberculosis programmes and civil society, including organizations of people living with HIV. The comprehensive package and other recommendations should be integrated in national AIDS and tuberculosis-related plans, and resources should be allocated for their implementation. Country-level strategic planning should be directed towards implementing, as soon as possible, all elements of the package and achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and sup-port for people in prisons and other closed settings. In countries with injecting drug use, implementation of drug dependence treatment, in particular opioid substitution therapy, and needle and syringe programmes in prisons should be a priority. At all stages, harmonization with activities in the com-munity is critical for the continuity of prevention, treatment, care and support services.HIV prevention, treatment and care in prisons and other closed settings page 9 noTes 1 Open Society Foundations, \"Improving health in pretrial detention: pilot interventions and the need for evaluation\" (New York, 2011).
