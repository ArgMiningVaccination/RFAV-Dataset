It is possible to develop an addiction to Klonopin in a matter of weeks, even when taking it as prescribed. There are several possible Klonopin dosages which can lead you to wonder what a high dosage of Klonopin may be. The Klonopin dosage for [anxiety](/anxiety-and-addiction/) differs from that of the Klonopin dosage for panic attacks, which can also cause confusion when trying to understand what is seen as a low dose as compared to what a high dosage is. Klonopin is a benzodiazepine approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat anxiety and panic disorders. In addition, providers may use Klonopin for other \"off-label\" uses, such as managing symptoms of essential tremors and tardive dyskinesia. Klonopin works by calming and slowing the activity of the brain and parts of the nervous system that send messages throughout the body. It is often referred to as a tranquilizer or sedative because of its calming effects. Unfortunately, the effects of Klonopin are felt quickly and are typically short-lasting. Therefore, to achieve \"lasting\" results, it is necessary to take Klonopin multiple times a day to maintain effective symptom control. For many, this can lead to tolerance and addiction in a very short time. There are some instances where pre existing medical conditions limit or exclude Klonopin as a treatment option. Currently, those who cannot use Klonopin are people with severe liver disease, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, and those who have had an allergic reaction to Klonopin or similar benzodiazepine drugs like [Xanax](/xanax-addiction-treatment/), Valium, or Ativan in the past. There are also preexisting conditions that preclude usage, such as a history of substance use disorders or other medical conditions where the maximum dosage of clonazepam would be contraindicated. Klonopin is a drug with a high potential for addiction. As a result, the optimum recommended dose is the minimum effective dose to achieve symptom relief and management. The starting dose of Klonopin is usually lower than the recommended dose, requiring a patient to gradually increase how much Klonopin they take until optimum symptom management is achieved. The starting dosage for seizure treatment in adults is 0.5mg three times daily, with a standard dose gradually increasing to 0.5mg-5mg three times daily. In children older than 10, the dosing recommendations mimic those of adults. The starting dosage of Klonopin for panic disorder treatment in adults is 0.25mg twice daily with a standard dose being 0.5mg-2mg three times daily. Klonopin is not recommended for panic disorder treatment in children. The starting dose of Klonopin for essential tremors is 0.5mg generally only once a day, gradually increasing to a maximum dosage of 6mg daily if needed. Klonopin is not recommended for essential tremor treatment in children. The Klonopin starting dose for tardive dyskinesia is 1 mg, gradually increasing to a maximum dosage of 4.5 mg daily. Klonopin is also not recommended for tardive dyskinesia treatment in children. Klonopin is a benzodiazepine, meaning that the other common symptoms of Klonopin overdose mimic those of other medications in the same class. Again, benzodiazepine overdose is not as common as opioid overdose, but it still can and does occur. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show benzodiazepines like Klonopin were involved in 17% of all drug overdose deaths between January 2019 and June 2020. [4](#Resources) Examples of other common signs of Klonopin overdose include extreme fatigue, slurred speech, hypotension (very low blood pressure), drowsiness, and inability to control movement and reflexes. An addiction to benzodiazepines like Klonopin requires comprehensive, supported detox and addiction treatment to overcome. Withdrawing from benzodiazepines without the support of medically assisted detox at an [addiction treatment center](/addiction-treatment/) like Iris Healing\u00ae can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Although a high dose of Klonopin itself may not lead to a medical emergency, the symptoms of Klonopin withdrawal, especially when one takes a high dose, can be far more complex. Successfully overcoming Klonopin addiction requires several treatment types to ensure lasting recovery. The first and often essential step is detox. During medically supervised detox, medical and mental health professionals will help you gradually taper off Klonopin use. Slowly reducing your Klonopin dosage helps to minimize potential detox complications and reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Once detox is complete, achieving lasting recovery from Klonopin addiction often requires getting help from a Klonopin rehab program. An [inpatient program](/residential-treatment/) offers constant supervision and medical support. Inpatient rehab is especially beneficial, as many who have a Klonopin substance abuse disorder also abuse other substances or have co-occurring mental health conditions. Inpatient rehabs are ideally suited to treat polysubstance addiction and co-occurring or dual diagnosis conditions. Where inpatient rehab is often the best fit for someone with a severe Klonopin addiction, an outpatient program may be a better fit for someone with a mild addiction. Outpatient rehab options still offer [ therapy](/therapies/) and medical detox options, but patients can continue to work and live at home. Outpatient rehab is generally recommended as a transitional care option between an intensive treatment program and returning home. Outpatient is typically not considered an appropriate first step in treatment for Klonopin addiction due to the potential for life-threatening withdrawal symptoms. [Ongoing treatment](/our-programs/) for Klonopin addiction generally involves continuous therapy, counseling, and medical support. The most common therapies for Klonopin addiction include experiential therapies, cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), dialectical-behavior therapy (DBT), and alternative therapy options such as art or [yoga therapy](/yoga-therapy/). Participation in 12-step (or similar) support groups as part of a comprehensive aftercare program is a highly recommended component of ongoing relapse prevention. Klonopin addiction is quick to develop, and while the use of the drug itself is not inherently dangerous, overcoming an addiction to it may be. The safest way to detox and achieve lasting sobriety from Klonopin is to seek professional treatment.
