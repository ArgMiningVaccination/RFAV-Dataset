So last week, in response to questions about how to maximize the immune system to fight the coronavirus, and any other immune system challenge, I wrote an article. If you did not see it, click on this [link](https://sheehannaturalhealth.com/what-you-can-do-to-make-yourself-as-healthy-as-possible-to-confront-the-coronavirus/). Basically, there are five steps: - Get enough sleep. - Don't Eat Sugar. - Get enough, but not too much, exercise. - Wash your hands. - Support your immune system naturally. The purpose of this post is to show you how to do step 5 in more detail. The best way to support your immune system naturally is to get checked using Nutrition Response Testing and functional blood chemistry. However, not all people have access to this. For these people, the following protocol is a great background immune system support protocol. All of these supplements can be gotten through Standard Process. If you are a patient of our office, call us and we can set you up with an online account with Standard Process. If you are not a patient, click on the button below to talk to our nutritionist to make sure that this is the right protocol for you. NATURAL IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT PROTOCOL In order of priority: Cataplex D 6/day - helps to regulate healthy production of inflammatory cytokines, normalizing immune function, and decreasing inflammation. Cataplex A-C 9/day - natural immune support for bowel infection and flu. This supplement boosts that part of your immune system that specifically fights viruses. Many patients have staved off the flu using Cataplex A-C. Trace Minerals B12 3/day - Broad spectrum mineral support for immune defenses. Most people are deficient in many minerals, especially trace minerals, which depletes your immune system. It also greatly assists in metal detoxification (metal toxicity will really disable your immune system). Zinc Liver Chelate 1/day - Targeted immune support for immune defense. Zinc helps stop viral replication and is deficient in most people. Calcium Lactate 6/day - Calcium is used to initiate immune system response. In fact, when the body develops a fever, it is actually liberating calcium from the bones to aid in the immune response (that's why giving calcium lactate to a child when they have a fever will quickly reduce a fever: it's giving the body what it wants, what a novel concept!) Honorable mentions: Immuplex - this should be higher on the list but is currently not available. Dose should be 3/day. Natural, broad-spectrum immune support, used to support all the organs in the immune system: the thymus, spleen, bones, liver, and lymphatic system. Andrographis Complex - 3/day - Also not currently available. Several studies show this herb is effective to boost the immune system without a stimulating effect. At the onset of any cold or flu-like symptoms add: Congaplex 3 per hour until you feel better, then 6 per day for 1 week - natural immune support for colds, sinus symptoms, etc. Congaplex is a blend of Cataplex A-C, Calcium Lactate, and Thymex (used to support the center of the immune system, the thymus), for a kick-butt acute immune system support product! Like I said before, functional blood chemistry and Nutrition Response Testing analysis are the best way to identify any nutritional deficiencies and/or imbalances that may be affecting your health. But in a pinch (or while waiting to come into our office) use the above protocol. Contact our office for more information. To your good health!
