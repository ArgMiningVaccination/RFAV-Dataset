Rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre, dry fruits make for a delicious and healthy snack. Health experts recommend eating dry fruits like apricots, walnuts and pistachios to stay healthy. Dietician Priyatama Srivastava and Purba Kalita, co-founder of an online shopping portal, suggest you include the following dry fruits in your diet. Almonds: A healthy substitute for conventional snacking options, generally high in sugar, almonds can be enjoyed anytime. Almonds are rich in anti-oxidants and have zero cholesterol. They are known to provide relief from constipation, respiratory issues and heart disorders, besides being great for hair, skin and teeth. Cashews:These nuts are loaded with health benefits and are a rich source of vitamins E and B6. What's more? They can also be used to bring a rich texture and flavour to various dishes. Raisins:Raisins are made from dehydrated grapes and are used in both sweet and savoury food preparations. They are good for health and have been known to reduce acidity and help in digestion. Walnuts:This shelled nutty delight is extremely nutritious. It is loaded with vital Omega-3 fatty acids, dietary fibres, proteins, anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals. Pistachios:Pistachios are good for the heart as they help in lowering bad cholesterol level. They also help prevent diabetes and boost immunity. Dates: They are used in different types of sweet dishes and can also be consumed on their own. The dry fruit is rich in vitamins, proteins, minerals and natural sugar and is believed to provide relief from constipation, apart from treating anaemia. Apricots: Apricots provide for 47% of your daily vitamin A needs in a single serving and are a good source of potassium, vitamin E and copper. Vitamin E, like all anti-oxidant vitamins (A and C), is vital in protecting the cells from damage caused by free radicals. This is especially important in summer when the sun is at its strongest. Dried apricots are good for the skin, eyes and the immune system. Follow [@htlifeandstyle](https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle) for more. "}
