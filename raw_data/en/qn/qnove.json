Please note that College of Human Medicine Admissions Protocol deadlines may differ from those of other schools. College of Human Medicine follows the AAMC application and acceptance protocols for medical schools. All prospective MD and MD/PhD students are advised to review the AAMC guidelines for applicants as directed on the day of their interview. Questions: Call College of Human Medicine Office of Admissions at 517-353-9620 or via To ensure that information reaches you in a timely manner, please update your AMCAS application with any changes in your mailing address, telephone number, and/or email address. All of our correspondence is sent using the AMCAS system. The College of Human Medicine CANNOT change your email address or mailing address within AMCAS. You are the only one who can edit that information. The Office of Student Affairs and Services (OSAS) will help guide the transition from applicant to student. Please see the [Office of Student Affairs and Services page](osas.html) for more information regarding housing, your Net ID, prematriculation, orientation and more. Confirm your place in the entering class within two weeks of the date of your conditional acceptance and paying your $100 advanced enrollment deposit as instructed in your conditional acceptance email. Your MSU Personal ID Number (PID) and Personal Access Number (PAN) allow you to activate your MSU NetID and MSU email account. Visit [NetID.msu.edu](https://netid.msu.edu/) for instructions on how to activate your account. How to retrieve your PID and PAN: Once your PID and PAN have been assigned by the University, you will receive an email from the central Office of Admissions. If you were assigned a PID and PAN as a previous Michigan State University student, you will have the same PID and PAN. The MSU Admissions Office will admit you to College of Human Medicine with the same PID and PAN. It is very important that you protect your PAN and not share it with others, much as you would not share the PIN of your ATM card. It is recommended that you memorize your PAN or keep a record of it in a safe place, as you will need to refer to it in the future. All College of Human Medicine entering students must provide an institutional action certification form from every college and university attended (those listed on AMCAS with the exception of those attended outside of the US or Canada). You will find the certification form under the Accept Offer tab in the [College of Human Medicine Applicant Portal](https://admissions.chm.msu.edu/). The Committee on Admissions wants to ensure that all incoming students are ready to focus on their medical training. We recognize that for a variety of reasons, some accepted applicants will wish to defer their entry into medical school. Personal concerns, completion of a graduate degree, research project, service or mission commitment, or establishing Michigan residency are just a few examples of requests to defer which have been granted. If you wish to defer your entry into the College of Human Medicine, please submit your request by Should you decide not to attend the College of Human Medicine, your $100 advanced enrollment deposit will be refunded if we receive written notice of withdrawal by email or postal mail no later than the AAMC deadline of April 30th. Deposits will not be refunded to anyone withdrawing from the college after April 30th. Please request official transcripts from all colleges and universities you have attended (excluding Michigan State University). Official transcripts are required by the State of Michigan and used to verify the completion of your premedical course requirements and degree(s). Unfortunately, AMCAS does not forward the transcripts you submitted to them. Registrars should send your transcripts to: College of Human Medicine Office of Admissions Michigan State University Clinical Center 804 Service Road, Room A112 East Lansing, MI 48824-1317 If you have completed all your academic course work, you may have your transcripts sent now.

The College of Human Medicine values your undergraduate experience. Completion of all premedical requirements and a baccalaureate degree is required prior to matriculation. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us by All College of Human Medicine students receive their first two years of education at either the main MSU campus in East Lansing or the Grand Rapids campus.

Preclinical campus placement information will typically be sent out in April. "}
