Each t arget and non- target SK may be tr eated up to 4 times with approximately 60 seconds between each application. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 Version 3: 18 JUN 2018 12 Criteria for evaluation: Primary: Subject satisfaction after treatment with A -101 ( Hydrogen Peroxide ) topical solution, 40% (w/w ) at Day 85 and Day 113. Secondary: Effectiveness of treatment as measured by the PLA at Day 85 and Day 113. Compa rison of the PLA score(s) to treatment satisfaction at Day 85 and Day 113. Statistical methods: Efficacy Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to su mmarize the data . Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the effectiveness for this study. The focus of the analyses will be the evaluation of the relationship between lesion outcomes and subject satisfaction scores from each of the subject satisfaction scales. Because satisfaction is assessed on a subject level and not for each individual lesion, it will be necessary to first summarize multiple lesion outcomes into one score for each subject visit. The analyses will then be implemented at each applicable visit by calculating separate Pearson correlations coefficients between (1) mean change from baseline in per -subject averaged PLA scores across all lesions, and (2) each subject satisfaction scale score at the visit. As a sensitivity analysis, the above statistics will also be calculated using Spearman's rank -order correlation. Exploratory analyses similar to the above will also be conducted between (1) per -subject averaged percent of treated lesions clear (PLA = 0) and (2) each subject satisfaction scale score . A similar exploratory analysis will also be conducted using per -subject averaged percent of lesions clear or near -clear (PLA < 2). Additional multiple regression models may be used across groups of subject satisfaction scales, depending on the pattern of individual subject satisfaction scale outcomes. Safety Analysis: Safety endpoints for adverse events (AEs) include the following: incidences of all treatment - emergent AEs (TEAEs) , and all serious AEs (SAEs); by severity, and discontinuation of subjects from study due to AEs. Safety endpoints for AEs will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). All safety endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics .

INTRODUCTION Summary Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is one of the most common skin tumors in man. These benign epithelial skin tumors are most commonly seen in older individuals, increasing in prevalence with increasing age, and aff ect men and women roughly equally. While the growths may be solitary, they often occur in large numbers and typically present as well demarcated, elevated or \"stuck -on\" appearing papules or plaques that may vary from flesh- colored, to shades of yellow, gray, brown, or black (Haffner C 2008). Though benign, SK lesions are often cosmetically worrisome to patients, must sometimes be distinguished from other benign or malignant skin tumors and may become pruritic, irritated, bleed, and may be painful when traumatized particularly when located in areas prone to friction and trauma, such as belt -lines and brassiere- strap lines. Patients may seek treatment of SK for cosmetic reasons, especially if they are large, pigmented, and/or if multiple lesions are present, or simply because the lesions are commonly associated with \"old age\". Removal may be medically indicated, however, for lesions that become irritated, pruritic, inflamed, or painful, or for lesions that the clinician feels require histologic confirmation of the diagnosis. Numerous treatment options exist and include a plethora of destructive/ablative modalities such as liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, lasers of various wavelengths (ablative and non-ablative), radio -frequency ablation, and su rgical removal by curettage or surgical excision. There is, however, a notable lack of well -controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy, complications and complication rates of these treatments. There is great variability among practitioners in the methods employed using each of these techniques (e.g., variability in contact time and method of freezing the lesions with liquid nitrogen) with great variability of the results. None of these treatments is, in fact, approved by the Food and Drug Adminis tration (FDA) for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis. While these methods can be effective, many require specialized training and/or the use of expensive equipment, they are painful and may require anesthesia and/or analgesia, and they are often compli cated by significant adverse outcomes. Both hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, which may be transient, but are often permanent, are common, as is scarring at the treatment site, and the typical post -surgical risks of bleeding and infection increase t he risk that the result of the treatment of these lesions may be worse than the disease itself (Pierson DBC 2003) (Motley 2002) (McKee PH 2005). Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including chlorine -free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, and disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used i n oral hygiene products and tooth- whitening systems for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to its use as an oral topi cal agent noted above, H 2O2 is widely employed at low concentrations ( e.g., 3% -6%) as a wound irrigant and topical antiseptic/disinfectant, and has been in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by Richardson in 1858. (Schumb WC 1955) (Chan HP 2008) (Richardson, On Peroxide of Hydrogen, or Ozone, or Water as a Remedy: Continued from a Research Commenced in the Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 Version 3: 18 JUN 2018 21 Year 1858 1891) (Richardson, On Peroxide of Hydrogen, or Ozone, or Water, as a Remedy: Continued from Research Commenced in t he Year 1858 1891) (Richardson, On the Introduction of Peroxide of Hydrogen as a Medicine 1866) (Watt BE 2004) (Zonios 2007). H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by the presence of a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin non- enzymatic components including acid, urates and glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other -soluble groups. The local application of supra - physiologic concentrations of H 2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of reactive oxygen species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by the generation of local concentratio ns of O 2 that are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells. Data from a proof of concept study (A -101-SEBK -201) demonstrated that topical treatment of SK lesions with A -101 Solution 40% and 32.5% has the potential to safely and effective ly resolve SK lesions without the need for analgesia and/or anesthesia, and with a minimal risk of hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, or scarring. Further, data from two dose -ranging studies (A -101-SEBK -202 evaluating SK lesions on the trunk and extremit ies; A -101-SEBK -203 evaluating SK lesions on the face) demonstrated that topical treatment with A -101 Solution 40% is superior to both A -101 Solution Vehicle and A - 101 Solution 32.5% for safely and effectively treating seborrheic keratosis lesions in adult subjects and has an acceptable safety profile. Summary of Previous Clinical Trials with A -101 Solution in Seborrheic Keratosis A-101-SEBK- vehicle -controlled, parallel -group study of A 101 and vehicle to investigate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability in subjects with SK target lesions on the trunk, extremities, and face. Subjects randomized to the study were able to receive up to 2 applications of A -101 40% Solution or matching vehicle. A total o f 450 subjects were randomized and 435 (96.7%) completed the study. Among the 15 subjects who discontinued, the reasons were similar between the treatment groups with the most frequent being a protocol violation (2.6% vehicle, 2.2% A -101). Two subjects ( 0.4% vehicle, 0.4% A -101) discontinued due to an AE or SAE. The mean age was 68.7 years (range 42 to 90, 42.0% were at least 71 years old), 41.3% of subjects were male and 58.7% were female, and 97.8% were Caucasian. The most common Fitzpatrick skin type s were 2 (46.9%) and 3 (27.3%). Treatment with A -101 40% showed statistically significant efficacy compared to treatment with vehicle based on the primary analysis (supported by the sensitivity analyses) as well as the secondary and exploratory analyses. For the primary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subjects who achieved clearance (PLA = 0) of all 4 target lesions at Visit 8 (Day 106) was 4.0% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with vehicle (p = 0.0019). For the secondary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subject s who achieved clearance of Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 Version 3: 18 JUN 2018 22 at least 3 of the 4 target lesions at Visit 8 was 13.45% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with vehicle (p < 0.0001). Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were reported for 45 (19.8%) subjects in the vehicle group and 54 (24.2%) subjects in the A 101 group. The most frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (3.1% vehicle, 1.3% A 101), bronchitis (0.4% 1.3% -101), and upper respiratory tract infection (1.3% vehicle, 0.4% A -101). Six (2.6%) subjects in the vehicle group had 7 SAEs and 4 (1.8%) subjects in the A 101 group had 4 SAEs. The SAEs were all considered not related to study medication. Two subjects, 1 in each treatment group, discontinued the study due to an SAE. LSRs were few and predominantly mild. The L SRs of pruritus and stinging reported by subjects and crusting, edema, erythema, hyperpigmentation, scaling, and vesicles reported by the investigator following treatment and retreatment had generally resolved by Visit 8 (Day 106). There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital signs. A-101-SEBK- 302 A-101-SEBK -302 was a randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group study of A 101 and vehicle to investigate the effectiveness, safety, and toler ability in subjects with SK target lesions on the trunk, extremities, and face. Subjects randomized to the study were up able to receive up to 2 applications of A -101 40% Solution or matching vehicle. A total of 487 subjects were randomized and 461 (94.7% ) completed the study. Among the 26 subjects who discontinued, the reasons were similar between the treatment groups with the most frequent being a protocol violation (2.9% vehicle, 4.5% A -101). No subject discontinued due to an AE or SAE. The mean age was 68.7 years (range 45 to 91, 41.5% were at least 71 years old), 41.7% of subjects were male and 58.3% were female, and 97.9% were Caucasian. The most common Fitzpatrick skin types were 2 (46.6%) and 3 (33.1%). Treatment with A -101 showed statistically significant efficacy compared to treatment with vehicle based on the primary analysis (supported by the sensitivity analyses) as well as the secondary and exploratory analyses. For the primary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subjects who achieved clearance (PLA = 0) of all 4 target lesions at Visit 8 (Day 106) was 7.8% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with vehicle (p < 0.0001). For the secondary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subjects who achieved clearance of at least 3 of the 4 target lesions at Visit 8 was 23.0% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with vehicle (p < 0.0001). TEAEs were reported for 43 (17.7%) subjects in the vehicle group and 46 (18.9%) subjects in the A 101 group. The most frequently reported TEAEs were sinusitis (1.6% vehicle, A -101). Four (1.6%) subjects in the vehicle group had 4 SAEs and 6 (2.5%) subjects in the A 101 group had 10 SAEs. The SAEs were all considered not related to study medication. N o subject discontinued the study due to a TEAE or SAE. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 Version 3: 18 JUN 2018 23 LSRs were predominantly mild. The LSRs of pruritus and stinging reported by subjects and edema, erythema, and scaling reported by the investigator following treatment and retreatment had generally res olved by Visit 8 (Day 106). There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital signs. A-101-SEBK- 303 A-101-SEBK -303 was a large open -label safety study in which subjects received up to 4 applications of A -101 40% Solution to SK lesions on their face, trunk or extremities. A total of 147 subjects were enrolled and treated and 139 subjects (94.6%) completed the study. Five subjects withdrew consent and 3 subjects were lost to follow -up. The mean age was 68.4 years (range 35 to 94, 40.1% were at least 71 years old), 32.0% of subjects were male and 68.0% were female, and 93.9% of subjects were Caucasian. The most common Fitzpatrick skin types were 2 (48.3%) and 3 (32.0%). At Visit 12 (Day 148) in the ITT population, 10.9% of subjects had all 4 target lesions judged to be clear on the PLA (PLA = 0), 18.4% had at least 3 of 4 target lesions judged to be clear, and 27.9% had all 4 target lesions judged to be clear or near clear (PLA 1). In the PP population, the PL A average per -subject percent of target lesions judged to be clear at Visit 12 was 28.2%. TEAEs were reported for 25 (17.0%) subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs were cough, seasonal allergy, and sinusitis (2.0% each). No TEAEs were reported as s evere, no SAEs were reported, and no subject discontinued the study due to an AE or SAE. LSRs reported were predominantly mild and most commonly included transient pruritus, stinging, crusting, edema, erythema, and scaling post -treatment that usually resolved by the next visit. Few lesions had LSRs at Visit 12. There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital signs. All three of the phase 3 studies described above demonstrated that treatment with A -101 (hydro gen peroxide) Topical Solution 40% was both effective and well -tolerated for the treatment of subjects with multiple seborrheic keratosis lesions of the trunk, extremities, and face. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 Version 3: 18 JUN 2018 24 5. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The rationale of this study is to understand a subject 's experience and satisfaction after treatment with A -101 40% and how that correlates with a healthcare provider's assessment based on PLA score. Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. recently completed three phase III clinical studies (301, 302, a nd 303) that demonstrated the safe ty and efficacy of A -101 40% in treating S eborrheic K eratos es. 5.1. Objective The objective of this study is to assess subject satisfaction after treatment with A -101 40% on SKs of the face, neck, and d\u00e9colletage. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 Version 3: 18 JUN 2018 25 6. INVESTIGATIO NAL PLAN 6.1. Overall Study Design This study is an open- label study designed to evaluate subject 's satisfaction after treatment of seborrheic keratos es with A-101 40%. The subject's treatment application will be documented via a series of photographs to aid in the assessment of the treated SK and to mimic real- world treatment environment . Dermatologists (investigators) will identify 3 eligible target S Ks on each subject; 2 target SK s must be on the face, and the additional 1 target SK must be on the neck or d\u00e9colletage. Up to 4 additional non- target SKs may be identified on the face, neck or d\u00e9colletage. Each target and non-target SK will be treated during up to 3 separate treatment visits : Visit 2 , Visit 5, and Visit 7. Each SK must be treated by a study trained healthcare provider at the site . Retreatment of identified target and non -target SK s will be determined by the physician using the Physicians Lesion Assessment Scale (PLA). Target and non- target SK s that have been assigned a PLA of 1 will be treated on Day 15 and Day 29. Each treatment visit requires up to 4 applications of A- 101 (Hydrogen Peroxide) Topical Solution, 40% (w/w) to each eligible t arget and non- target SK . Each application will last up to 20 seconds with about 60 seconds bet ween applications. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled. A trained photographer will document each subject's target and non- target SKs at every visit. D uring Visit 2 , subjects will have photographs taken of each SK at specified post treatment timepoints . Subjects will be assessed for adverse e vents related to A -101 40% throughout the conduct of the study. Subjects will be required to complete a total of 11 study visits. The protocol defined study visits are: Visit 1 (Day -13 - 0) Screening Visit 2 (Day 1) Study Medication Treatment Visit 3 (Day 2) Follow -up Visit Day 4 (Day 8) Follow -up Visit Visit 5 (Day 15) Study Medication Treatment (if PLA 1) Visit 6 (Day 22 ) Follow -up Visit Visit 7 (Day 29 ) Study Medication Treatment (if PLA 1) Visit 8 (Day 36 ) Follow -up Visit Visit 9 (Day 57 ) Follow -up Visit Visit 10 (Day 85) Follow -up Visit Visit 11 (Day 113 ) Follow -up Visit; End of Study Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 Version 3: 18 JUN 2018 26 Refer to Table 3: Study Design and Schedule of Assessments for a complete list of protocol required study assessments. 6.2. Number of Subjects A total of 30 subjects will be treated on the study at 3 investigational sites in the US. 6.3. Treatment Assignment This is an open- label study. 6.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria If a subject refuses the initial treatment or retreatment, the investigator must report the visit number, visit date, t arget SK number(s) that the subject refused to allow treatment for and the reason f or the refusal in the subject's CRF. If the subject's refusal is associated with an AE, the investigator must also report the event on the appropriate CRF. The subject must have the Visit 2 initial study medication treatment to all t arget SK s to remain in the study. The subject does not need to be removed from the study based solely on her/his refusal to have a study medication retreatment at Visit 5 or Visit 7.Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 27 Table 3: Study Design and Schedule of A ssessments Visit Visit 1 Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4 Visit 5 Visit 6 Visit 7 Visit 8 Visit 9 Visit 10 Visit 11 Treatment Day Day -13 - 0 Day 1 Day 2 Day 8 Day 15 Day 22 Day 29 Day 36 Day 57 Day 85 Day 113 Visit Window N/A N/A N/A \u00b1 1 day \u00b1 1 day day \u00b1 1 day \u00b1 1 day \u00b1 7 days \u00b1 7 days \u00b1 7 days Informed Consent X Inclusion/ Exclusion1 X X Subject Identifier2 X Dermatological Medical History X Demographics X Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment3 X Vital Signs4 X X X X X X Prior Medications/Therapies5 X Target and Non-Target SK Identification6 X Physician's Lesion Assessment7 X X X X X X X X SK Dimensions8 X X X X X X X X SK Photography9 X X10 X11 X X10 X X10 X X X X Study Medication Application12 X X X Subject Satisfaction Assessment13 X X X X X X Concomitant Therapies14 X X X X X X X X X X X Adverse Events15 X X X X X X X X X X 1Subject inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reassessed prior to enrollment during Visit 2. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 28 2Investigational sites will assign a unique five -digit subject identifier to each subject at Visit 1 , formatted as NN-NNN where the first 2 digits are the site number , and the final 3 digits are the subject number that must be assigned in ascending numerical order (using leading zeroes, as appropriate). This subject identifier will be used in all study documentation for the duration of the study. 3Each subject's skin must be assessed during Visit 1 using the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment. Refer to Table 6 for the scale. 4Vital signs [including temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, height and weight (Visit 1 only)] will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 2 , Visit 5 , Visit 7 Visit 10, and Visit 11 . 5Prior medications/therapies will be collected for a time-period of 13 days prior to Visit 1. Refer to Section 8.4 for a list of permitted and restricted concomitant medications. 6The treating investigator will identify 3 target SKs and up to 4 non-target SKs. Two ( 2) target SKs must be on the face, and the additional 1 target SK must be on the neck or d\u00e9colletage. The 4 non-target SKs may be located on the face, neck, or d\u00e9colletage. 7The investigator will use the Physician's Lesion Assessment (PLA) to assess the severity of each t arget and non-target SKs at Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 7, 10, and 11 . At Visit 2 , Visit 5 and Visit 7, the investigator must assess each target and non- target SK prior to application of the study medication. In order to be eligible for enrollment to the study during Visit 2, the subject must have a PLA grade 2 for each t arget and non-target SK. 8The investigator will measure the dimensions of each t arget and non-target SK at Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 11 . At Visit 2 , Visit 5 and Visit 7 , the investigator must measure each t arget and non- target SK prior to a pplication of the study medication. In order to be eligible for enrollment to the study during Visit s 1 and 2, each target SK must have a diameter that is between 5 and 15 mm (inclusive ) and be raised . In order to be eligible for enrollment to the study during Vis its 1 and 2, each non -target SK must be a raised SK. At Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 the investigator must assess the thickness of each t arget and non-target SK above the surrounding skin. Additional target and non- target SK requirements are outlined in Section 10.1 . 9Each target and non-target SK will be photographed at all study visits using the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. supplied photography equipment . 10During Visit 2 each target and non-target SK will be photographed prior to the application of A -101 40%, 10 minutes post application (+2 minutes) , and 1-hour post application (\u00b1 10 minutes) . During Visit 5 and Visit 7, the target and non-target SKs will be photographed prior to the application of A -101 40% , if applicable. 11During Visit 3 each target and non-target SK will be photographed 24-hours post application during Visit 2 (\u00b1 2 hours). 12 A-101 40% will be applied to each target and non-target SK by a study trained healthcare provider at the site . Each target and non-target SK will be treated with A-101 40% following confirmation of subject eligibility and study enrollment at Visit 2. If a t arget or non-target SK meets the criteria for retreatment as defined in Section 9.5, the SK will be retreated at Visit 5 and Visit 7 . Following application of A-101 40% , subjects must NOT wash/submerge a target and non-target SK for at least 6 hours and they must NOT apply any topical products to any target or non-target SK for at least 6 hours. 13Subjects will be asked to assess how satisfied they are with the treatment experience they r eceived for the target and non- target SKs at the specified visits . On Visit 2 the subject will complete the assessment prior to application of A-101 40% . On Visit 3 the subjects will complete the assessment approximately 24 hours after the treatment. On Visit 6 and Visit 8 the subjects will complete the assessment approximately 1 week after the treatment , only if the subject received treatment on Visit 5 or Visit 7 . The subject will complete the assessment during the Visit 1 0 and Visit 11 . 14All concomitant therapie s including (topical and oral) prescription medications, over the counter medications , natural supplements and non-drug therapies including chiropractic, physical therapy, and energy -based therapy must be documented in the subject CRF. Subjects must not a pply any topical products (e.g. , moisturizers, sunscreen, etc.) to their target and non-target SKs within 12 hours prior to any study visit. 15The reporting period for SAEs begins when the subject signs the informed consent form . Refer to Section 11.6 for instructions on the reporting of SAEs. Non-serious clinical adverse events will be collected following the application of the study medic ation at Visit 2 and continue through Visit 11 . All safety reporting (AEs and SAEs) will conclude at Visit 1 1. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 29 7. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJEC TS 7.1.

The Principal Investigator or physician Sub- Investigator performing the A-101 40% treatments must comply with the A-101 40% storage conditions outlined in Section 8.1. At Visit 2, and Visit 5 and Visit 7 if applicable, each target and non -target SK must be treated by a study trained healthcare provider at the site. At Visit 5 and Visit 7, all identified target and non -target SK s that have a PLA grade of 1 will be re- treated with A -101 40%. If in the investigator's opinion, the lesion is not appropriate for re-treatment (e.g. cutaneous AE) treatment will be withheld. The reason for withholding treatment will documented in the comment section of the subject's CRF and the AE CRF if appropriate. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 34 8.5.1. Preparing the Study Medication for Application To perform a study medication treatment for a t arget or non- target SK a HCP at the site will select the appropriate A -101 40% applicator. The following instructions outline the procedure for application of A-101 40% to the t arget or non -target SK: Prepare for the treatment: Wash your hands prior to, and after completing the A -101 40% treatments Wear nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the treatment; latex gloves are prohibited Select the applicator Visually inspect the applicator for damage: If the applicator appears damaged do not use it for the treatment, contact the study monitor for return/ disposal instructions and select an unused applicator for the treatment If the applicator is intact, proceed with the treatment process as outlined in Figure 1 Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 35 Figure 1 : Diagram Showing the Process for Preparing and Applying A -101 40% 1. Each target and non- target SK should be cleaned using an alcohol wipe prior to application of A -101 40% . 2. Hold the A -101 40% applicator so that the applicator cap is pointing up. 3. Crush the ampule in the applicator by applying pressure to the center of the barrel of the applicator. 4. Remove the sleeve. 5. Tap the barrel of the applicator to ensure the solution is free of the crushed ampule. 6. Gently remove the cap by twisting while pulling away from the applicator. 7. Express a single drop of A-101 40% so that the tip of the applicator becomes wet. 8. Apply the solution to the t arget or non- target SK in a circular motion. 8.5.2. Applying A -101 40% to the Face, Neck or D\u00e9colletage To apply A-101 40% to the target or non -target SK the HCP will follow these treatment instructions: Do not apply A -101 40% to eyes, mouth, mucous membranes, open wounds Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 36 Do not apply A -101 40% to the eyelids or within 5 mm of the orbital r im If, in the investigator's opinion it is needed to ensure no A -101 40% enters the eye: Position the subject in the supine position with the head slightly elevated and angled such that any excess study medication will flow away from the eye. Apply white p etrolatum (100%) United States Pharmacopeia (USP) that is to be applied along the orbital rim and at the medial and lateral canthi; gently stretch the periorbital skin between the thumb and forefinger at the time of petrolatum application riorbital rhytides ( e.g., \"crow's feet\") and ensure full coverage of the skin at the base of the rhytides to decrease the likelihood of tracking of the study medication towards the eye Have the subject hold an absorbent pad in the appropriate area of the e ye to absorb any excess study medication that might track away from the target or non- target SK Instruct the subject to keep both eyes closed during the entire study medication treatment procedure After the subject is properly prepared and positioned, thor oughly cleanse the target or non- target SK by firmly rubbing with a swab/wipe wetted with 70% isopropyl alcohol Using firm pressure, squeezing in the middle of the applicator, apply one drop of study medication onto the target or non -target SK and then move applicator around in a circular motion to fully saturate the SK . Apply the study medication for approximately 20 seconds Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin using a clean absorbent wipe Ensure the t arget or non- target SK is wet with study medication at the end of the approximately 20 second application Allow the t arget or non- target SK to remain undisturbed for approximately 60 seconds After approximately 60 seconds repeat the approximately 20 second application process Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medication has been applied to each target or non-target SK up to 4 times. It is acceptable to treat the target and non -target SKs sequentially to minimize treatment time; such that, after treatment is applied to the 3rd SK, the 60 second wait time between applications would be met. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 37 Record the time the final treatment is completed for the last treated t arget or non- target SK as the Treatment Completion Time. 8.6. Randomization and Blinding 8.6.1. Randomization This is an open- label study and therefore randomization is not applicable . 8.6.2. Blinding This is an open- label study and therefore the clinical drug supplies are not blinded. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 38 9. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS AND MANAGEMENT 9.1. Study Drug The study medication is A-101 ( Hydrogen P eroxide) Topical Solution, 40% (w/w) . The study medication is a clear, colorless solution. 9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling A-101 ( Hydrogen P eroxide) Topical Solution, 40% (w /w) will be provided by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and labeled according to the local law and legislation. The study medication will be packaged in single use applicators. Each single -use applicator consists of a crushable glass ampoule that contains 2.2 milliliters (mL) of study medication that provides for at least 1.3 mL of study medication available for treatment. The ampoule is provided inside a sealed polyethylene tube with a flocked, doe foot applicator on one end. 9.3. Study Drug Storage Investigationa l sites will be supplied with open -label stock of A -101 40%. Investigational study medication supplies are only to be used for subjects properly consented and enrolled to this study. A-101 40% must be stored in a location where there is limited access to the investigational study medication at 59\u00baF to 77\u00baF (15\u00baC to 25\u00baC) excessive heat, open flame and combustibles, in a well-ventilated, dry area. Excursions from these temperature ranges must be reported to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 9.4. Study Drug Preparation Activated applicators are stable for 4 hours at room temperature (59\u00baF to 77\u00baF or 15\u00baC to 25\u00baC) . 9.5. Administration The subject will receive up to 4 applications to each t arget or non -target SK at Visit 2, and if the subject meets retreatment criteria, at Vis it 5 and Visit 7. Apply study medication to each t arget and non -target SK for approximately 20 seconds. Allow each t arget and non -target SK to remain undisturbed for approximately 60 seconds. Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medicatio n has been applied to each t arget and non- target SK up to 4 times. Subjects may receive up to 3 treatments (Visit 2 , Visit 5 and Visit 7) . 9.6. Study Drug Accountability The investigator or designee will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of the study medications as shipped by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee), including the date received and the condition of the study medications. One copy of this receipt will be returned to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee) when the contents of the stud y medication shipment have been verified and one copy maintained in the study file. In addition, an accurate study medication disposition record will be kept, specifying the amount dispensed for each subject and the date of dispensing. This inventory rec ord will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 39 of the study, the original inventory record will be available for review by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. upon request. Final drug accountability will be completed by the study monitor at th e completion of the study and all unused study medication will be returned to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. drug depot for disposal per Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee's) written instructions. 9.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal Nitrile or vinyl examination gloves must be worn during the application process. Latex gloves are prohibited. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 40 10. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY Similar lighting conditions and subject positioning should be used for all evaluations for a given subject. 10.1. Target SK Ident ification At Visit 1, the investigator will identify up to 7 Seborrheic Keratos es on each subject for treatment and evaluation. Three (3) target lesion must be identified, and up to 4 non- target lesions may be identified. Two (2) target SK s must be on the face, and the additional 1 target SK must be on the neck, or d\u00e9colletage. Up to 4 additional non- target lesions may be on the face, neck, or d\u00e9colletage. Face: Vertically from the mandibular ridge vertically up to the hairline (for subjects with a rec eded hairline the hairline is defined by the vertical line drawn coronally from tragus to tragus) Horizontally from tragus to tragus, excluding the eyelids and areas within 5mm of the orbital rim. Neck: Vertically from the mandibular ridge vertically down to the top of the collar bone D\u00e9colletage: From the collar bone down including the shoulders and cleavage area At Visit 1, each t arget SK must: Have a clinically typical appearance Have a PLA of 2 Have a diameter between 5 to 15 mm Be a discrete lesion (no overlapping lesions) Not be covered with hair which, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study medication treatment or the study evaluations (NB: the study medication may bleach hair) Not be in an intertriginous f old Not be on the eyelids Not be within 5mm of the orbital rim Not be pedunculated. At Visit 1, each non- target SK must: Have a clinically typical appearance Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 41 Have a PLA of 2 Be a discrete lesion (no overlapping lesions) Not be covered with hair which, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study medication treatment or the study evaluations (NB: the study medication may bleach hair) Not be in an intertriginous fold Not be on the eyelids Not be within 5mm of the orbital rim Not be pe dunculated. Record the approximate location of each t arget and non- target SK on the body chart in the CRFs. Number the t arget SK starting with 1 and proceeding up to 3 with no number omitted or reused. The target SK s on the face should be numbered 1 and 2, and the additional 1 SK on the neck and/or d\u00e9colletage should be numbered 3. The non -target SKs should be numbered 4- 7 starting with 4 and proceeding up to 7 with no number omitted or reused. Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. will provide the investigational s ite with standard circular templates and colored stickers that are to be used to identify the t arget and non -target SKs. At Visit 1, the investigator and a HCP will identify the t arget and non -target SK s by placing 2 appropriately colored stickers approximately 180 degrees opposite each other with the t arget or non-target SK in the center of the area outlined by the provided circular template (Refer to Figure 2 . Figure not to scale): Figure 2 : Target and Non -Target SK Identification Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 42 Write the t arget or non- target SK number on one of the identification (ID) stickers. The ID stickers must be visible in the study photographs. The t arget and non- target SK #/ID sticker color relationships are: Target SK on face#1/white ID stickers Target SK on face #2/yellow ID stickers Target SK on neck or d\u00e9colletage #3/green ID stickers Non-Target SK on the face, neck or d\u00e9colletage #4/pink ID stickers Non-Target SK on the face, neck or d\u00e9colletage #5/ grey ID stickers Non-Target SK on the face, neck or d\u00e9collet age #6/purple ID stickers Non-Target SK on the face, neck or d\u00e9colletage #7/ orange ID stickers At each study visit a HCP from the investigational staff will confirm the location of each t arget and non- target SK using an appropriate combination of the Visit 2 hard -copy reference pri nts and the body charts. The staff member will identify the t arget and non- target SK s by placing 2 appropriately colored ID stickers, with the target or non- target SK number written on one sticker, approximately 180 degrees opposite each other with the t arget or non- target SK in the center of area outlined by the provided circular template. 10.1.1. Standardized Photography At each study visit a qualified investigational center staff member will take standardized color photographs of each t arget and non- target SK . The photographs are to document the location of the t arget and non -target SK and to assist with relocating the t arget and non- target SK and the t arget and non- target SK ID stickers must be visible in the photographs. The subject's identity will not be reve aled in the study photographs. These photographs will also be used to document the treatment effects of A-101 40% over time. At Visit 2, the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication application, 10 minutes post application, and 1- hour post application of A -101 40%. At Visit 5 and Visit 7, the photographs will be taken prior to study medication application, if applicable. At Visit 3 photographs must be taken 24 hours post application of A -101 40% on Visit 2 . Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning relative to the camera and camera settings are used for each photograph. Sites will be provided with photography equipment and supplies necessary for obtaining the target and non- target SK photographs. Detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs will be documented in the study specific Photography Manual and provided to the site at the study initiation visit. 10.1.2. Physician's Lesion Assessment (PLA) The PLA is the investigator's assessment of the severity of the t arget and non- target SK at a particular time point. The investigator may refer to other evaluations ( e.g., prior photographs) to assist with these assessments. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 43 At Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 11 the investigator will assess the t arget and non- target SK using the scale below and report the one integer that best describes the severity of the t arget or non- target SK. At Visit 2 and if applicable at Visit 5 and Visit 7, the investigator must complete the PLA prior to the study medication treatment. Table 5: Physician's Lesion Assessment Definitions Grade Descriptor 0 Clear: no a visible seborrheic keratosis lesion with a surface appearance different from the surrounding skin (not elevated) 2 Thin: a visible seborrheic keratosis lesion (thickness > 1mm) All investigational site staff will receive training on the PLA Assessment Scale and be provided with a PLA Assessment Manual ( refer to Appendix 2) that will be used as a reference tool during the conduct of the study. In order for a subject to be eligible for screening and enrollment to the study, each t arget and non- target SK must have a PLA grade of 2. 10.1.3. SK Dimensions At Visit 1 and Visit 2 prior to study enrollment, the investigator will measure the diameter and thickness of each t arget and non- target SK using the ruler provided. The investigator must measure the diameter of the longest axis of each t arget and non- target SK in millimeters (mm) as follows: Diameter (i.e., the length of the longest axis) Thickness (height above the surrounding skin) The PLA (the thickness ) of the ta rget and non- target SKs will be measured by the investigator at Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 11. When the visit coincides with treatment (Visits 2, 5 and 7) , the thickness must be measured prior to the application of study medication . 10.2. Subject Instructions An investigational center staff member will dispense a Subject Instruction Sheet to each subject at Visit 1 (Refer to Appendix 1). Throughout the study, the subjects should: Continue their routine cleansing regimen Continue their routine cosmetics and ski n care products Avoid exposing the t arget and non- target SK s to excessive natural or artificial ultraviolet radiation ( e.g., sunlight, tanning beds) and use sunscreen on the t arget and non- target SKs, if excessive exposure cannot be avoided Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 44 Avoid the use of self -tanning lotions and spray tans Bring the subject instruction sheet with them to each visit On study visit days, the subjects should: When appropriate for the t arget and non- target SK location s, wear loose fitting clothing to the visit (Note: clothin g that comes in contact with the study medication may be bleached) Starting with Visit 2, not apply any topical products to the t arget or non- target SK s within 12 hours prior to the visit (Note: routine cleansing products are allowed) After the completion of any study visit where a study medication treatment was performed DO NOT: Wash/submerge the t arget or non- target SK s for at least 6 hours Apply any topical products to the t arget or non- target SK s for at least 6 hours 10.3. Subject Satisfaction Assessment Subjects will be asked to assess their level of satisfaction regarding the study medication treatment experience. The subject survey will be completed at Visits 2, 3, 6 (only if treated at Visit 5) , 8 (only if treated at Visit 7) , 10, and 11. (See Appendi x 3) 10.4. Study Supplies Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide: An appropriate ruler, or other instrument, for measuring the diameter and thickness of the target ad non- target SK s Templates for use when identifying t arget and non -target SK s Equipment, supplies and training for taking standardized photographs Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 45 11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY In addition to reporting adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a designated and appropriately trained HCP will perform the safety assessments according to the schedules noted below. 11.1. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 2 , Visit 5, Visit 7 Visit 10, and Visit 11. The following items will be measured: Body temperature Pulse rate Respiration rate Blood pressure (syst olic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes Height (at Visit 1 only) Weight (at Visit 1 only) Any measure that is, in the opinion of the investigator, abnormal AND clinically significant (CS) must be recorded as history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if found after the first study medication treatment begins (Section 11.6). A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure >90mm Hg is considered abnormal and therefore must be defined as CS or NCS on the CRFs. 11.2. Other Evaluations 11.2.1. Demographic/Medical History At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will collect demographic information including date of birth, sex at birth, race , and ethnicity for each subject. At Visit 1, the inves tigator must determine each subject's Fitzpatrick S kin T ype and document appropriately on the subject's source document and CRF. Table 6: Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scoring System Skin Type Classification Description Type I Always burns, never tans (pale white; blond or red hair; blue eyes; freckles) Type II Usually burns, tans minimally (white; fair; blond or red hair; blue, green, or hazel eyes) Type III Sometimes mild burn, tans uniformly (cream white; fair with any hair or eye color) Type IV Burns minimally, always tans well (moderate brown) Type V Very rarely burns, tans very easily (dark brown) Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 46 Skin Type Classification Description Type VI Never burns, never tans (deeply pigmented dark brown to darkest brown) 11.3. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 11.3.1. Definition of Adverse Events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship t o the study drug. An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under study ( or any concurrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug. Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following: intercurrent illnesses physical injuries events possibly related to concomitant medication significant worsen ing (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other preexisting conditions. drug interactions events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities occurri ng after the start of the study (i.e., after screening and once confirmed by repeat testing) that results in the withdrawal of the subject from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work up, or is considered by the study investigator to be clinically significant. The investigator must, for any t arget or non- target SK related AE, question the subject in detail to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by clothing or activity, sunburn) for any such AE. The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE. The investigator must start reporting non -serious AEs starting with the subject's first study medication treatment continuing through Visit 11. 11.3.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in one or more of the following: Results in death Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 47 It is immediately life -threatening It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity Results in a c ongenital abnormality or birth defect It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subjec t or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The term \"life threatening\" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the hospital on an in- patient bas is, even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospitalization is defined as an additional night stay in the hospital. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Impor tant medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death or hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in t he SAE definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. 11.4. Relationship to Study Drug The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject's relevant medical history, concomitant therapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the st udy medication by selecting one of the following categories: Related - There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. Not Related - There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. The term \"reasonable causal relationship\" means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A). 11.5. Severity The investigator must define the severity of each AE using the following definitions as a guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the severity that is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 48 Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale: Mild - Awareness of sign o r symptom, but easily tolerated Moderate - Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities Severe - Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities 11.6. Reporting Adverse Events At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will question the subject to elicit AEs using a non- directive question such as \"Has there been any change in your health since the previous study visit?\" The investigator or designee will monitor the subject for at least 20 minutes after the Treatment Completion Time at Visit 2 , and if applicable at Visit 5 and Visit 7 to elicit AEs in a similar manner. If appropriate, based on the subject's response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations. Non-serious AEs should be recorded starting with the subject's first study medication tr eatment at Visit 2 and continuing thr ough Visit 11. All SAEs regardless of relationship to study medication must be collected and reported to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. from the time the Informed Consent is signed through Visit 11. Upon becoming aware of a SAE the investigator must: 1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject's safety 2. Immediately inform the Safety Monitor of the SAE: Ken Kostenbader, MD Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 640 Lee Road, Suite 200 Wayne, PA 3. Within 24- hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, laboratory test results) must be fax ed to the SAE Fax line listed above. 4. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the subject's last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the SAE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or witho ut sequelae AND the investigator and Safety Monitor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved. 5. Inform the Safety Monitor of SAE updates by telephone followed by an SAE form update sent by fax or by e mail. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 49 6. Comply with the appropriate regulatory require ments and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC). 11.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event Any subject who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from study drug at any time at the discretion of the investigator. If a subject is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. The subject will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the subject is referred to the care of a local health care professional. The investigator must inform the medical monitor as soon as possible of all subjects who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when requested. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 50 12. STATISTICS Statistical Analysis of Efficacy Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data for this study. The focus of the analyses will be the evaluation of the relationship between lesion outcomes and subject satisfaction scores from each of the subject satisfaction scales. Because s atisfaction is assessed on a subject level and not for each individual lesion, it will be necessary to first summarize multiple lesion outcomes into one score for each subject visit. The analyses will then be implemented at each applicable visit by calcul ating separate Pearson correlations coefficients between (1) mean change from baseline in per -subject averaged PLA scores across all lesions, and (2) each subject satisfaction scale score at the visit. As a sensitivity analysis, the above statistics will also be calculated using Spearman's rank -order correlation. Exploratory analyses similar to the above will also be conducted between (1) per -subject averaged percent of treated lesions clear (PLA = 0) and (2) each subject satisfaction scale score. A simi lar exploratory analysis will also be conducted using per -subject averaged percent of lesions clear or near -clear (PLA < 2). Additional multiple regression models may be used across groups of subject satisfaction scales, depending on the pattern of indivi dual subject satisfaction scale outcomes. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the ITT population. The proportion of subjects with adverse events related to study medication will be tabulated and presented by treatment and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class. Vital signs, and clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be tabulated and presented. No inferential testing will be performe d. Safety summaries will include listings of adverse events incidences within each MedDRA System Organ Class, and changes from pre -application values in vital signs. Adverse event summaries will be presented showing the proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, both overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class. Interim Analysis An interim Analysis will not be conducted for this study. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 51 13. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 13.1. Study Monitoring The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by the Acla ris Therapeutics, Inc. study monitor /CRO to verify adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable SOPs, the protocol, other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. The investigator will allow the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. re presentative, designee and/or any regulatory agency to have direct access to all study records, CRFs, corresponding subject medical records, study medication dispensing records and study medication storage area, and any other documents considered source documentation. The investigator also agrees to assist the representative, if required. 13.2. Audits and Inspections The study is conducted under the sponsorship of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements as well as app licable ICH guidelines, Helsinki Declaration, and in respect of the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and/or sub- contractor SOPs for study conduct and monitoring. Audits may be carried out by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or its representatives and inspections may b e performed by regulatory authorities or IRB/ECs before, during or after the study. The investigator will provide the auditing/inspecting group direct access to all study records ( e.g., CRFs, subject medical records, study medication dispensing records) a nd the investigational center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be available and will assist the auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate. The investigator should contact Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. immediately if contacted by a regul atory agency about an inspection. 13.3. Institutional Review Board (IRB) This protocol and any accompanying material, including information that will be provided to prospective subjects (such as advertisements, subject information sheets, or study descriptions used to induce study participation or obtain informed consent) must be submitted to the IRB for approval. Approval of each such submission must be obtained from the committee before it may be used in the study and must be documented in a written notificat ion to the Investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. In particular, each informed consent document must bear clear evidence (written, stamp, date of app roval, etc.) of IRB approval before it may be presented to prospective (or ongoing, as appropriate) study subjects for signature. Written evidence of the approval must be made available to the Sponsor. Any modifications made to the protocol and of correspondingly modified informed consent documents made after receipt of IRB approval must also be submitted to the committee for approval before implementation unless the modification is made on an emergency basis to protect the welfare of study subjects. In t he latter case, the IRB must be notified promptly, and their written approval must be obtained as soon after the fact as possible. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 52 Appropriate reports on the progress of the study will be made to the IRB and the Sponsor by the Investigator in accordance wi th applicable regulatory regulations and in conformity with policies established by both the IRB and the Sponsor. The shortest time interval between required reports required by either party or by regulations will prevail. The Investigator at each investi gative site, or his/her nominee, will be responsible for reporting any SAEs to the IRB as soon as possible, and in accordance with the guidelines of the IRB. The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all serious, life threatening or fatal adverse study drug events with a causal relationship to the study drug to appropriate regulatory agencies within their required timelines. The Investigator is responsible for obtaining written, informed consent(s) from each prospective subject interested in participating in this study before performing any study -related procedures. Written informed consent must be obtained after adequate, thorough, and clear explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study, as well as any use of the subj ect's genetic information from the study. The Investigator must use the most current Central IRB - approved consent form for documenting written informed consent. Each informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by the subject. The investigati onal site must retain the original signed consent and provide a copy to the subject. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 53 14. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 14.1. Protocol Amendments No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IEC/IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate safety concerns to the subjects or when the change involves only logistics or administration. The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the pr otocol amendment. 14.2. Protocol Deviations, Violations, and Exceptions A protocol deviation is non- adherence to protocol -specific study procedures or schedules that does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/or GCP guidelines. Deviations are considered minor and do not impact the study. A protocol violation is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, subject is administered a prohibited medication during the active protocol treatment period, primary objective variable criteria, and/or GCP guidelines. Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, by study center personnel, on the CRF. As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptions to protocol -specific en try criteria to allow subjects to enter a study. If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular subject, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in ac cordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the subject will be allowed to enter the study. If investigative center personnel learn that a subject who did not meet protocol eligibility criteria was entered in a st udy (a protocol violation), they must immediately inform sponsor/CRO. Such subjects will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and written approval by sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicabl e SOP 14.3. Training For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study subjects. It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinators or other applicable personnel att end this visit. During this visit, participants will be trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs. Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriately trained individual prior to particip ating in any of the procedures and evaluations in this study. Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol and other study specific items. Team organization, communication and operational issues will also be discussed. Aclaris Therapeutics, In c. will provide an investigator site file to each center. Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 54 15. ETHICS 15.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study The Sponsor will use information developed in this clinical study in connection with the development of A -101 40% and, therefore, may disclose it as required to other clinical Investigators participating in other studies and to regulatory agencies. In order to allow the use of the information derived from this clinical study, the Investigator understands that he/she has an obligation to provide all data produced during this study to the Sponsor. The Sponsor considers that clinical data (complete or incomplete) constitute financially sensitive information. Consequently, the Sponsor requires that discussion of results in any form, electronic, verbal, or written before study completion and full reporting should only be undertaken with the Sponsor's prior written consent. Individual subjects' medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered confidential. The Investigator and the study center will adhere to all applicable laws relating to the protection of subject information. To assure that subjects' conf identiality is maintained, subjects' data will be identified by a study -assigned number and date of birth only. All Sponsor personnel will handle subjects' data in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable regulations governing clinical research. Subjects' records will be inspected only in connection with this research project. Information generated as a result of a subject's participation in this study may be disclosed to third parties for research and regulatory purposes in any country as dete rmined by the Sponsor. However, subjects will not be individually identified but will be referred to only by the study assigned number and the subject's date of birth. 15.2. Written Informed Consent The schedule of study activities (including assessments, tests , exams, disease assessments, and study drug administration) beginning with screening and continuing through the end of study are outlined in Table 3. A written, signed informed consent form (ICF) must be obtained from each subject prior to performing any study related procedure ( e.g., vital signs, clinical laboratory sampling, or photog raphy). The Principal Investigator at each center will ensure that the subject is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible r isk and benefit of the study. Subject s must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The subject should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. The subject 's signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study procedures. The Principal Investigator must maintain the original, signed Informed Consent Form. A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject . Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 55 16. DATA H ANDLING RECORDKE EPING 16.1. Inspection of Records Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug inventory , drug accountability records, subject charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 16.2. Data Management Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11. The CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study. Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights. The handling of data, in cluding data quality assurance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions. Data management and control processes specific to this study will be described in a data management plan. At the end of the study, the database will be locked, and the data will be released for reporting and statistical analysis. 16.3. Regulatory Documents The investigator must maintain a study file containing current and complete regulatory documentation in complianc e with the current ICH E6 GCP guideline. This file will be reviewed as part of the routine monitoring for this study. 16.4. Contractual Requirements A contractual agreement will be signed between Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and each investigator. This document w ill contain supplemental information, including financial terms, confidentiality, study schedule, third party responsibility, and publication rights. 16.5. Retention of Records All pertinent data, samples, photographs, correspondence, original or amended protocol, reports and all other material relating to the study will be maintained securely in Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. /CRO/investigator archives for the legally required duration for archiving. The investigator should maintain the essential study documents as specified in ICH GCP, and in compliance with all regulatory requirements. The investigator should ensure these documents are protected from accidental destruction or disposal. If the Investigator needs to re -assign responsibility for maintaining these documents ( e.g., due to retirement) it must be transferred to a person willing to accept this responsibility. The Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 56 investigator must notify Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., in writing, of the name and address of the new individual. If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigative site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these in sealed containers in an off -site storage location so that they can be returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copies will be made for off -site storage. No trial document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to assign the trial records to another party or move them to another location, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 57 17.
