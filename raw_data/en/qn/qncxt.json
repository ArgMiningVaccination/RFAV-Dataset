What about olive oil or oatmeal? Read on for more about these and other natural remedies that may help relieve itchiness, dryness, and irritation. 9 Best Natural Ingredients For Psoriasis The next time you stock up on essential oils at the pharmacy or make a supermarket run, you may come across one or more natural remedies that may ease minor [symptoms of psoriasis](/psoriasis/guide/symptoms/). These DIY therapies can't substitute for [psoriasis treatments](https://www.everydayhealth.com/psoriasis/guide/causes/) prescribed by your physician, but they might help your skin feel less dry, inflamed, and itchy. \"Medications can work separately from natural remedies or as part of a combination or adjunct treatment,\" says [Anna Chacon, MD,](https://www.drannachacon.com/) a dermatologist in South Florida. \"I don't believe it has to be one or the other.\" It's important to check with your doctor before you try any home remedy for [psoriasis](/psoriasis/guide/), since even so-called natural ingredients can interact with medications or irritate sensitive skin. To see if an ingredient or essential oil triggers an [allergic reaction](/allergies/), perform a patch test: Apply a small amount to an area of skin such as the inside of your forearm, then cover with a Band-Aid. \"After a few days, if you don't experience any negative reactions, then it would be safe to apply to larger areas of the body,\" says [Robin Evans, MD](https://www.socodermatology.com/our-team), a physician at Southern Connecticut Dermatology in Stamford. Dr. Evans recommends using small amounts on psoriasis areas to ensure you don't have an allergic reaction before you apply more liberally. She says she would give natural remedies a month or so to see whether they lead to any improvement in psoriasis symptoms. \"If they're working, there should be a decrease in itching and burning,\" she says. If they aren't helping, you can try them a second time in combination with another remedy \u2014 \"as long as there are no untoward effects,\" she advises. The ingredients and essential oils here might be worth a try to help ease your psoriasis symptoms. 1. Tea Tree Oil Derived from a plant native to Australia, [tea tree oil](https://www.everydayhealth.com/smart-skin/tea-tree-oil-health-benefits-uses-potential-side-effects-and-more/) is an anti-inflammatory used to treat conditions ranging from nail fungus and athlete's foot to psoriasis, says [Jennifer Burns, NMD](https://www.burnsintegrativewellnesscenter.com/), a naturopathic doctor and researcher in traditional medicine at the Burns Integrative Wellness Center in Phoenix. To use, mix 1 part tea tree oil to 10 parts olive oil, then dab on affected areas with a cotton ball. Some people are allergic to tea tree oil, so be sure to perform a patch test before applying. 2. Olive Oil High in omega-3 fatty acids and [vitamin E](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/vitamin-e), olive oil appears to ease psoriasis symptoms in multiple ways. Olive oil is a great moisturizer that does double duty as an anti-inflammatory to calm irritated skin. Apply a small amount to your scalp, elbows, or anywhere you have psoriasis plaques, says Dr. Burns. Or, for a soothing full-body soak, add 2 teaspoons (tsp) of warmed olive oil to your bath water. Evans notes that olive oil is also an important part of an anti-psoriasis eating plan. A growing body of research (such as a [study in a 2018 issue of JAMA Dermatology](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2687981)) suggests that [the Mediterranean diet](/mediterranean-diet/guide/), which emphasizes extra-virgin olive oil, can help [prevent psoriasis](/psoriasis/guide/causes/) from getting worse. 3. Coconut Oil [Coconut oil](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/coconut-oil-health-benefits-nutrition-facts-uses-more/) can help counter dryness caused by psoriasis by trapping moisture in the skin, says Burns. Gently rub a small amount on psoriasis plaques, as you would any moisturizer. You can also use the oil on the scalp to help loosen psoriasis scales. 4. Oatmeal Found in many health and beauty products, oatmeal helps relieve the itchiness and inflammation associated with psoriasis. To prepare an oatmeal bath that won't leave your tub full of soggy bits, add a half-cup of dry oats to a leg of pantyhose, knot the top, and drop into the water before you step in. Evans warns, \"Oatmeal baths are useful to calm itching, but they also can be very drying, which may exacerbate psoriasis \u2014 inherently a very dry condition.\" 5. Apple Cider Vinegar [Apple cider vinegar](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/apple-cider-vinegar-nutrition-facts-health-benefits-risks-more/) can help calm psoriasis itch, but Burns warns that it's important to dilute the vinegar properly before using. She recommends mixing one part [apple cider vinegar](/diet-nutrition/diet/apple-cider-vinegar-nutrition-facts-health-benefits-risks-more/) to two parts water. Dab the diluted vinegar onto your skin or scalp, avoiding any areas that are cracked or bleeding. Be sure not to leave the solution on longer than 10 minutes; otherwise, it might make your skin even drier and more irritated. 6. Aloe Vera \"I love this plant,\" Burns says. \"It helps reduce inflammation and can speed up healing time.\" Its many uses, she says, include soothing minor burns, cuts, and scrapes, thanks to its strong antibacterial, antiseptic, and fungicidal properties. [Aloe vera](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/aloe-vera-benefits-risks-uses-more/) also promotes cell growth and acts as a detoxifying agent. Researchers have found that compounds in [aloe vera](/diet-nutrition/diet/aloe-vera-benefits-risks-uses-more/) help skin retain moisture, which promotes healing. You can use pure aloe gel or look for creams with about 0.5 percent aloe content. Apply two to three times a day to soften skin and calm psoriasis flares. 7. Baking Soda [Baking soda](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/baking-soda-uses-benefits-side-effects-recipes-more/) isn't just for cooking and cleaning: [You can use it in your self-care routine](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/baking-soda-uses-benefits-side-effects-recipes-more/) for everything from whitening teeth to relieving the itchiness of psoriasis. Burns recommends mixing 1 tsp of [baking soda](/diet-nutrition/diet/baking-soda-uses-benefits-side-effects-recipes-more/) with a small amount of water to make a paste that you can apply to psoriasis patches. Use with caution: \"Baking soda can be helpful for itching, but like oatmeal it can be very drying,\" Evans says. 8. Dead Sea Salt People travel from all over the world to float in the Dead Sea, located on the border between Israel and Jordan. This body of water is 10 times saltier than the ocean and rich in minerals with purported healing powers. To relieve psoriasis itchiness and irritation at home, add Dead Sea salts (or substitute [Epsom salts](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/magnesium-sulfate)) to a warm bath, then soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Be sure to apply moisturizer afterward to prevent dryness. 9. Pine Bark Extract The pine bark supplement Pycnogenol has antioxidant properties, Burns says, which may bolster the effects of your other psoriasis treatments. Just be sure to check with your dermatologist before adding pine bark to your beauty or supplement routine. 10. Mahonia Aquifolium (Oregon Grape) This is a powerful antimicrobial herb. A review of clinical trials published in December 2018 in the [Journal of Clinical Aesthetic Dermatology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30666279/) found that in five out of seven research studies, mahonia led to an improvement in psoriasis symptoms, with minimal side effects. Look for a cream containing 10 percent mahonia and apply it to any mild or moderate psoriasis plaques. Additional reporting by [Beth W.
