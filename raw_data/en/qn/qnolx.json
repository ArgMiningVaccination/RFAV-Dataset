There are certain food items that apart from being delicious are of great help to body. Here are six everyday foods that can help to fight against certain infectious problems like cold and flu by boosting the immune system... Turmeric There are a number of herbs and spices that provide great immune-boosting benefits, but among these all Turmeric is known as one of the most powerful anti-inflammatory spices. Turmeric is most commonly used in Indian cuisine and it gives a bright yellow colour to every dish it's added to. Apart from providing various immunity boosting benefits it also helps to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid. Citrus Fruits Vitamin C is one of the best nutrients to fight against cold as it helps to build up the immune system. It helps to increase the production of white blood cells that are mainly responsible to fight against infections. Majority of citrus fruits are high in Vitamin C, therefore, consuming them can help to boost the body's immunity. Some of the most effective citrus fruits include oranges, lemons, grapefruits, limes, etc. Garlic Garlic is another food ingredient that many people turn to after getting sick. It is a powerful natural immune booster because it has amazing natural anti-microbial properties; therefore, along with killing the harmful bacteria it also prevents their growth, which is very important for a healthy immune system. This natural antibiotic has one big benefit over over-the-counter antibiotics that bacteria generally do not develop a resistance to garlic's anti-microbial properties as they mostly do with pharmaceuticals. Ginger Apart from Turmeric and Garlic, Ginger is also regarded as one of the best natural immune booster. It helps keeping body warm and break down the accumulation of toxins in your organs, mainly the lungs, sinuses and lymphatic system. Keeping these crucial organs toxins free definitely help prevent illness and infection. Moreover, Ginger also has powerful anti-inflammatory properties and it promotes healthy sweating that can help fight the symptoms of cold and flu. Vitamin D Many experts believe that vitamin D is one of the most important nutrients for a healthy immune system. No doubt our bodies produce vitamin D naturally, but we have to depend on the sun for this process. May be this is one of the main reason that we are likely to get sick more often in the Fall and Winter, as this is the time when we're not exposed to as much sun as in the Spring and Summer. However, there are certain food items, particularly of western diet that are rich in vitamin D such as salmon, canned tuna and oysters. Apart from it, a number of studies have shown that taking a vitamin D supplement can help to reduce your risk of getting the flu by 40 per cent. Almonds Vitamin E is also considered as a key to healthy immune system. Nuts, especially almonds, are rich in Vitamin E and also have healthy fats. Consuming almonds on regular basis can help body fight against diseases by strengthening the immune system.
