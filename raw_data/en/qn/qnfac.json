Important Information Liens on Real Property Upon receipt of Medicaid, a lien may be filed and a recovery may be made against your real property under certain circumstances if you are in a medical institution and not expected to return home. Medicaid paid on your behalf may be recovered from persons who had legal responsibility for your support at the time medical services were obtained. Medicaid may also recover the cost of services and premiums incorrectly paid. Transfer of Assets Federal and State laws provide that an individual may be found ineligible for nursing facility services for a period of time if an individual or an individual's spouse transfers an asset for less than fair market value within the look-back period. The look-back period is the 60 months immediately prior to the date an individual is both institutionalized and has applied for Medicaid. Annuities As a condition of Medicaid coverage for nursing facility services, applicants are required to disclose a description of any interest the individual or the individual's spouse has in an annuity. This disclosure is required regardless of whether the annuity is irrevocable or a countable resource. In addition to the purchase of an annuity, certain transactions made to an annuity by the applicant or the applicant's spouse within the look-back period, may be treated as a transfer unless: The State is named the remainder beneficiary in the first position for at least the amount of Medicaid paid on behalf of the annuitant; or The State is named in the second position after a community spouse or minor or disabled child, or in the first position if such spouse or representative of such child disposes of any such remainder for less than fair market value. If documentation is not submitted verifying that the State has been named remainder beneficiary, you may be ineligible for coverage of nursing facility services. If the annuity is a countable resource at the time of application, you/your spouse are not required to name the State as remainder beneficiary. I. Certification and Authorization I certify under penalty of perjury, that the information on this form is correct and complete to the best of my knowledge.
