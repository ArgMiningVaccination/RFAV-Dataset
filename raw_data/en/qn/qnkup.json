Franklin, DVM, DACVIM ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Erin Contino, MS, DVM, DACVSMR, Educational Programs Committee Chair Carey M. Ross, Scienti c Publications Coordinator Published by the American Association of Equine Practitioners ISSN 0065-7182 \u00a9 American Association of Equine AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 iPolicy Statement The primary purpose of publishing the Proceedings is to provide documentation of the scienti c presentations in abstract form, available at the AAEP Annual Convention. Its further purpose is to offer easily accessible information that will assist the AAEP membership, and others in the equine industry, in the daily responsibility of providing the best possible care for the horse. Mission Statement To improve the health and welfare of the horse, to further the professional development of its members, and to provide resources and leadership for the bene t of the equine industry.

The SREC is composed of AAEP member volunteers from both small and large private prac- tices as well as academia and industry. Members include both general practitioners and specialists. The San Antonio program includes invited papers for the \"In-depth \"and \"How to \"sessions as well as sessions comprised of papers that independent authors submitted for consideration. Topic choices for the invited \"In-depth \"and \"How to \"sessions are based on member feedback from AAEP CE Needs Analysis surveys. Topic session leaders are selected by the Program Chair, and then these session lead-ers invite a slate of speakers to prepare the papers that become an \"In-depth \"overview or a series of related \"How to \"talks. Although invited, these papers undergo a rigorous peer review process by the SREC. Papers submitted by independent authors are each assigned 3 reviewers from the SREC. The reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Content is scored using the criteria of Study Design, Study Quality, Innovation and Impact, Practicality, and Manuscript Quality. This year 122 papers were submitted for the 59 available slots on the program. Non-scienti c sessions addressing business, ethical, and industry concerns are also planned as the scienti c program materializes. Speakers who are invited to participate in these sessions prepare papers that are also reviewed by members of the SREC for inclusion in the Proceedings. The peer review process for the AAEP Proceedings is rigorous. It requires an enormous effort by every one of the 50+ members of the SREC to create the best possible program for the AAEP membership. Many volunteer hours were spent putting together the San Antonio program, so please thank them for all theirhard work creating this program for you. ii 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSFrom Your President Dear AAEP Members, Family, and Friends: It is my pleasure to welcome you all to San Antonio, Texas and the AAEP 68th Annual Convention and Trade Show.T h e2 0 2 2P r o g r a mC h a i ra n dP r e s i d e n t - E l e c tD r .R o bF r a n k l i ni sa l s oh a p p yt ow e l c o m eu st oh i sh o m es t a t ea n dh a sw o r k e dr e a l l y hard with the Educational Programs Committee (EPC) to pull together an excellent program. There is plenty of scienti cc o n t e n t included but also lots of time to explore other content that really matters to our profession including business, well-being, and thenext generation. A huge shout out to some of the many tireless volunteers of this organization who all contributed time and effort tothis program including the Educational Programs Committee and the Scienti c Review and Editorial Committee. A special thank you to the AAEP staff, as well as EPC leaders Drs. Erin Contino and Luke Bass. One last word of appreciation -the speakers! THANK YOU! We couldn 't do this without all of you. As you explore the convention venue, please take time to thank our Educational Partners in the Trade Show -AAEP is grate- ful for their presence here this week, as well as throughout the year. They are ever supportive of our daily work and are ourfaithful partners in the well-being of the horse. We couldn 't do our jobs without them, and we bene t enormously from their generous participation in our organization. This has been a challenging year for AAEP and many of our members, with issues in recruiting and retaining horse doctors and staff. Last year at the convention, we were hearing from the Recruitment and Retention Task Force led by Dr. Carol Clark about perspectives of students, new graduates, and practice owners. This year, we are moving towards a different place thanks to the hard work and vision of many. For me, this visit marks the second time I have been to Texas this year -therst time was in April to convene a Practitioner 'sS u m - mit in Dallas to explore the current crisis and to strategize about plans for action. Next, the Board of Directors created an operational planto address this issue head on and in the summer, they approved the creation of the Commission on Sustainability in Equine Practice withseveral important subcommittees including internships, students, practice culture, emergency coverage, and compensation. All these groups have dedicated members working on these critical elements and this year' s convention will mark an important step in beginning to craft solutions that can be shared and scaled up across our ranks. Rest assured that the profession is not the only part to our strategic plan. The Board of Directors remains committed in other key areas -education and the horse. You will hear about all the great work that members are doing throughout this convention. Support- ing efforts in all areas of the strategic plan is a key priority of this organization and we are extremely grateful to everyone who hasdonated to The Foundation for the Horse. It is through this foundation and its tireless supporters that we have the resources to make signicant change. If you have not done so yet please stop by to contribute what you can -time, treasure, or talent! Thank you for help- ing us meet our ambitious $10M fundraising goal to support work on behalf of the horse! Finally, make sure to take a moment to kick back and enjoy a conversation with a friend. Convention is a special time of year when we see old friends and make new ones. Remember that we need one another. Make time to lift up colleagues who arestruggling so they can stand shoulder to shoulder beside us and pave the way for those that are coming behind us so they don 't have to trip and stumble like we did. Best wishes for a fantastic 2022 Convention! I can 't wait to see you around here! It is an honor to serve this organization, Emma K.

Abstracts: Guidelines for Authors For those who intend to publish in a refereed journal 69thAAEP Convention San Diego, CA November 29 - December 3, 2023 ALL papers must be submitted online at https://s3.goeshow.com/aaep/annual/2023/AAEP.cfm by March 15, 2023, 3:00 p.m. E.T. Please make sure you have reviewed the General Guidelines. To encourage submission of the newest scienti ci n f o r m a - tion for inclusion in the AAEP Annual Convention program and simultaneously not jeopardize future publication of this material in a refereed journal, the following criteria have been developed for these submissions of Scienti c Papers that will be published in the AAEP Proceedings. In such instances, the published abstract should be approx- imately 250 words. These \"abbreviated abstracts \"should fol- low a structured format with the same headings (see below) as the full-length scienti c paper. Please be aware that the Take Home Message is included in the total word count. The abbre- viated abstract does not need references, but appropriate acknowledgments should be included. Note this abbreviatedabstract is not required for Review, How-to, or In-DepthPapers. A 1500-word long paper conforming to the General Guidelines must also be submitted to allow the reviewers toassess the experimental design, materials and methods, statis-tical analyses, results (with graphs, tables, charts, etc.) and adiscussion of the results as it pertains to interpretation andconclusions. The submitting author must include a statementthat only the short abstract can be published in the AAEPConvention Proceedings. It remains the author 's responsibility to preserve their right to publish in a refereed journal by con- tacting the respective journal to discuss their prior-publication criteria so that an accepted abbreviated abstract will not jeo-pardize publication in the refereed journal.

The clinical signicance should also be included, as well as a clear state- ment of the objective or purpose of the submission. The state-ment of objectives is usually found in the last sentence of the Introduction. Materials & Methods: The Materials and Methods section should describe experi- mental methodology in the case of a didactic study or, in thecase of a clinical study, should include a description of thepopulation from which the animals were selected and howthey were selected for inclusion in the report.Data obtained and how they were obtained must be described. A description of the statistical methods used to summarize data, test hypotheses, and characterize the signi cance of results should also be included. Normality of the data should be described, and statistical analysis should be appropriate for the distribution of the data (parametric or non-parametric). For weights and measures, metric units should be used. Dosagesshould be expressed entirely in metric units and with speci c time intervals. Results: The Results section should include actual results with numbersand data must be presented. When possible, quantify ndings (mean, median, proportion) and present them with appropriateestimates of measurement error or uncertainty (such as stand-ard deviation (SD), standard error (SE) or con dence interval) in addition to the results of hypothesis testing. If the data can bewell represented with a graph or gure, these are encouraged if subsequent publication is not anticipated. If numbers and dataare not presented due to concerns regarding publication in a ref-ereed journal, indications of relative differences between groups such as odds ratios, % change, and signi cant differences must be included in the submission to be considered acceptable. In these instances, the authors should submit the data in the form of means, standard deviations, or other descriptions of compari- sons among groups in an appendix, which will not be published and only used for review purposes. Discussion: In the Discussion section, important ndings documented in the results of the study should be stated. Results should be related to other work which has been done and how the resultsdiffer or agree with previously published work and why any dif- ferences may have occurred should be discussed. The practi- cal take home message for the equine practitioner should beclearly de ned and stated in the summarizing nal statement. This statement may be longer, but should be similar in contentto the take home message at the beginning of the paper. The following items must be fully explained in the paper: the number of horses that have been worked on, how many will beaffected, and evidence that the procedure works and is safe.

Reese Hand, DVM, DACVS There are multiple options for intra-articular (IA) joint therapy that can safely be used in the eld without specialized equipment and be cost effective. Author 's address: Equine Sports Medicine and Surgery, injections are one of the most fre- quently performed procedures in an equine veterinarypractice. This practice is performed in hospital andeld conditions. Osteoarthritis is the most common reason for IA therapy and is a very common clinicalproblem in today 's horses. The primary goal of IA therapies is to provide symptom modifying and/or dis- ease modifying effects. 1,2Practitioners are faced with multiple options for IA therapy. Therapies include, but are not limited to, corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid(HA), and a variety of biologicals. It is important tounderstand the different types of therapies and theuse of therapies in speci c situations. This discussion will focus on the traditional treatments used forequine IA therapy. 2. Materials and Methods The speci c procedure for injecting a joint will not be discussed in this paper but rather the focus will be onthe most common medications and doses used to treatosteoarthritis or synovitis. This discussion will be lim-ited to IA corticosteroids and HAs.3. Results From a cross-sectional survey of AAEP members fromApril to May 20203, the following are the results of the most common corticosteroids used: triamcinolone aceto-nide (TCA), methylprednisolone acetate (BME). TCA was the most frequentlyused medication to treat high motion joints. The most common reported dose for TCA ranged from 5 -10 mg per joint. Methylprednisolone acetate was the most frequent therapy used in low-motion joints. The most commonreported dose of MPA ranged from 20 -40 mg per joint fol- lowed by 40 -80 mg per joint. Betamethasone esters were reported as the third most common corticosteroid used inboth high and low motion joints. The most commondose for betamethasone was 4 -6 mg/joint followed by 6 - 12 mg/joint. Iso flupredone acetate and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were also choices for therapy but wereused by less than 10% of respondents. The most commonreported dose per joint of iso flurane acetate was 5 -10 mg and for dexamethasone was 4 -10 mg. In the survey, many of the respondents always or occasionally includedamikacin when injecting a joint. This dose ranged from50-125 mg per joint. Recent literature would caution against using amikacin routinely in joint injections NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 1JOINT THERAPIES IN THE FIELD: WHAT TO USE AND HOWhowever as it has been found to be detrimental to carti- lage.4T h ec h o i c eo fH Ao rp o l y s u l f a t e dg l y c o s a m i n o g l y - cans (PSGAGs) in combination with corticosteroids is a common practice. There are multiple options available including but not limited to HA and PSGAGs.a-dThe dose for HA commonly used is 10 -22 mg per joint and PSGAGs is 250 mg per joint. Choices of which HA to useis often based on clinical preference, cost, and availabil-ity. High motion joints are often treated with higher mo- lecular weight options to improve viscosity and reduce friction 5,6 Intra-articular injections performed in the eld setting have special considerations that differ from those that e x i s tw h e nt h ep a t i e n ti st r e a t e di nah o s p i t a l .A t t e n t i o n to sterility should be closely monitored when performingIA injections in the eld. Due to these eld conditions, many clinicians will often add antibiotics to injections.Additionally, when in the eld, availability and accessi- bility without preparation of the product is an important factor. Many of the specialized or biologicals require spe- cial processing or temperature constraints that make itimpractical for the eld use. For this reason, the ease of off the shelf products such as corticosteroids and HA areappealing for IA treatments in the eld. Even though these drugs have been used routinely for decades in horses, inherent risks remain. These include but are not limited to joint sepsis, laminitis, and overall joint impact.Literature will support that septic arthritis is uncommon following IA therapies. 7-9It has also been found that IA corticosteroids have not been shown to increase the risk of joint infection.5,6TCA is one of the most commonly used IA therapies, concerns with its use have beendiscussed relating to its association with laminitis.Historically, clinicians have stayed below the total body dose of 18 mg due to this association. However, TCA does not appear to increase the risk of laminitis inhealthy horses, 10-12,and a safe total body dose has not yet been established.3Doses up to total body dose of 40 mg have been used with no effects of laminits.10MPA has been a long-standing joint treatment; however, r e c e n ts u r v e y sh a v es h o w nt h es i n g l ej o i n td o s ed e c r e a s - ing from 40 -80 mg to 20- 40 mg per joint.3This is largely associated with evidence of harmful effects on cartilage metabolism.14,15 4. Discussion With the growing interest in athletic and pleasure use of horses, the need for management of soreness will con- tinue in the equine patient. Corticosteroids used by themselves or combined with HA or PSGAGs have pro-ven for decades to be successful in managing osteoarthri- tis as well as synovitis in the equine patient. Overall, the use of corticosteroids is very economical. Even with thecombination of HA or PSGAGs, the costs are within most client 's budgets to treat their horses. When guidelines are followed, traditional joint therapies are very economi- cal, readily available, and successful for the management of joint conditions in the eld.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author and the paper have adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Polyacrylamide hydrogels have been shown to ex- hibit low coef cients of friction and have been used for contact lenses and as acellular cartilage implants.2,3 Viscosupplementation has been an objective of intra-articular therapy for management of osteoarthritis,and PAHGs can provide a synthetic joint lubrication. The objective of viscosupplementation is to restore the normal lubrication in joints with in flammation and car- tilage surface damage. Polyacrylamide hydrogels are being utilized as a de- vice for intra-articular lubrication in both humans 4,5 and horses.6-8This inert material has mechanical properties similar to normal synovial fluid and has recently been shown to effectively decrease friction in both mechanical and interleukin-1 b-induced surface- damaged cartilage.9,10The polyacrylamide hydrogels have been shown to decrease lameness in horses forprolonged periods of time after treatment admini- stration.7,8 A prospective study of polyacrylamide hydrogel for the treatment of osteoarthritis in 43 horses reported as i g n i cant decrease in lameness; 82.5% of the 43 horses were sound at the 2-year follow-up.6In 12horses with proximal interphalangeal joint osteo- arthritis, 8 horses were sound 6 months after treat-ment. 7Both of these studies utilized a 2.5% polyacrylamide material designed to be a bulking agent. Another polyacrylamide hydrogel being used in humans with osteoarthritis consists of 4%polyacrylamide, and this polymer was speci cally designed to be minimally reactive in the joint. 8In this study of 28 horses that met inclusion criteria,there was a signi cant ( P<.001) decrease in me- dian lameness score with 23 of 28 (82%) horsesimproved based on study criteria. The PAHGs are often discussed interchangeably, but the manufacturers agree that they may not act similarly. A common misunderstanding is that the dif- ference between the 2 commercially available materi-als is the concentration. One product is a 4% PAHG a and the other a 2.5% PAHG.bHowever, the reason there is a wide range of applications of PAHGs isbecause they can be very different based on monomercontent and percent cross-linkage. 11There is not a direct comparison available, but published histologicevaluation of synovial membranes from joints treated with the 2 products is dissimilar.12,13The 4% PAHGa has been shown to adhere to the cartilage and syno- vial membrane surface and remain on the surface,particularly in areas of damaged cartilage.10,12The 2.5% PAHGbhas been noted to be within the synovial membrane with multiple macrophagic cells for pro-longed periods of time.13 NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 3JOINT THERAPIES IN THE FIELD: WHAT TO USE AND HOW2. Case Selection As a newer therapy, initial case selection tended toward chronic osteoarthritic horses refractory to multiple therapies. The general trend was that these horses would improve approximately 1 lame-ness grade following treatment and maintain thatimprovement for 90 to 120 days. As veterinariansbecame more knowledgeable of the PAHGs, thetrend has been toward treating horses earlier inthe disease process. Horses that have been treated1 to 2 times with more traditional hyaluronic acidand corticosteroids may now be treated with PAHGbefore the osteoarthritis progresses further. Basedon anecdotal reports, most joints in the horse have been treated with PAHG. Some of the more com- mon applications are noted below. The metacarpo/metatarsophalangeal joints in both sport and racehorses may be the most frequentlytreated joints, likely because of the incidence of pathol-ogy. There may be some thickening or lling of the joint notable in the palmar/plantar pouches after treat-ment that persists 2 to 4 weeks after administration.Repeated administration of 4% PAHG aup to 4 times at 45-day intervals in metacarpophalangeal joints didnot result in any negative effects on cartilage, syno-vium, or biomarkers of cartilage metabolism. cDistal interphalangeal joints in sport horses may be the next most common application. D u et ot h el a r g es i z eo ft h es t i fle joint, some practi- tioners have used a \"double dose \"of stifl es. When utilizing 4% PAHG,athe 2.5- mL dose should be an adequate volume to coat the articular surfaces, so a single dose is likely adequate.On the other end of the scale, tarsometatarsal and dis-tal intertarsal joints are likely well coated with 1 mLof PAHG. Similarly, when managing bilateral navicu-lar syndrome cases, a syringe may be split betweenthe 2 bursae. 3. Administration Since PAHGs tend to be more viscous than most materials clinicians are used to administering, the \"feel \"of the material going readily into the joint is dif- ferent. Larger gauge needles, 18 or 19 ga, are indi-cated to improve ease of administration. Smallergauge needles can be used, though the injectionshould be done slowly and with care to avoid displac-ing the needle or disconnecting the needle from the sy-ringe due to pressure. The PAHG is not eliminatedquickly as would a periarticular corticosteroid, so con- rmation of intra-articular placement is useful. It is not expected that PAHGs carry an elevated risk for infection following intra-articular injection. The addition of antibiotics can be considered, how-ever, based on the clinician 's preference. Due to their inert and insoluble characteristics, PAHGs are notknown to interact with intra-articular antibiotics com-monly utilized in the horse and have been seen com-bined in some studies. 14Standard aseptic sitepreparation, with sterile injection technique, remains the most important method to prevent contamination of the injection site. Corticosteroids are commonly utilized intra-articu- lar, often in combination with viscosupplements, to control pain and in flammation. There are no known corticosteroid/PAHG combinations that cause inter- actions between the products. Concurrent adminis- tration has been reported by clinicians using PAHG,though no formal investigation has been performed. It is suggested by 2.5% PAHG bto avoid concurrent corticosteroid administration with their product to prevent downregulating synovial broblasts, which encourage cellular proliferation and vessel ingrowthacross the gel incorporated into the synovial mem-brane. The 4% PAHG ais dissimilar in its interaction with the synovial membrane; therefore, this mecha-nism is not relevant when considering its adminis-tration with corticosteroids. double-blinded 4 weeks and weeks postinjection ( P=. 0 4 than hyaluronate or triamcinolone.15 It is recommended that horses are rested for 2 to 3 days, followed by walking exercise for a week, andthen low-impact exercise with a gradual return to full exercise over 2 to 3 weeks. This is a longer period than many therapies, but the response to therapydoes not occur rapidly. Response to treatment varies. Some cases show improvement within days after injection, while others may take up to 30 days.Generally, a gradual improvement is seen between 1 and 3 weeks. If some improvement is noted, but the lameness is not eliminated, the veterinarian shouldconsider a second dose at 5 to 6 weeks after the initial injection. 4. Limitations Polyacrylamide is not a quick x for lameness. Horses require some rest following therapy, and there may be a slow improvement over 2 to 3 months. Injection technique is important to ensure the PAHG is withinthe synovial cavity. There have been a few horses that have had an increased lameness for 2 to 4 weeks following admin-istration. There are 2 potential causes of this, andboth may be correct. Periarticular administration can result in swelling and effusion. The PAHG is hydro- philic, resulting in a lling the joint space. The PAHG in 2.5% PAHG bw a sd e s i g n e da sat i s s u e ller, so it will remain in the subcutaneous tissue anextended period. Second, there is the occasional horse that will have an increased lameness and synovitis af- ter work, in the r s tw e e ko rt w oa f t e rt r e a t m e n t .T w o plausible explanations for this are impingement of the synovium that may be thicker following administra- tion of the PAHG and pushing of the PAHG intoJOINT THERAPIES IN THE FIELD: WHAT TO USE AND HOW 4 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsubchondral defects. Overall, knowledge is still lim- ited relative to some of the other joint therapies. 5. Conclusions The understanding of how and when to utilize PAHGsis rapidly evolving. Case selection, injection technique,and post-treatment-controlled exercises are importantto successfully add these materials to any practice.There are differences in the PAHGs available, so vet-erinarians need to be familiar with the product theyare using and how to best utilize the material.

Stanozolol reduces apoptosisin equine chondrocytes in vitro by a combination of stimulating insulin-like growth factor-1 production and decreasing nitric oxide production.1In vitro gene expression matrix metalloproteinase-1, and b-exposed equine chondrocytes.2In humans with chronic osteoarthritis, decreased jointpain was associated with increased transforming growth factor- b1 (TGF- b1).3One in vitro study dem- onstrated that there was a dose-dependent increase in matrix production stimulated by increased TGF- b1 synthesis with the inclusion of stanozolol.4 A dose response study utilizing doses of 1, 2.5, and 5 mg of stanozolol in the metacarpophalangeal jointhas been completed.5During the study, the authors noted mild increase in effusion in the joints that had been treated with stanozolol. All horses in the study started with a baseline lameness of 2/5 utilizing theAAEP lameness grading scale. Outcome was time to adecrease of lameness by at least 1 grade. The results showed that these lamenesses were improved at all 3 of the dosages of intra-articular stanozolol. However,the lamenesses improved the fastest following the 5-mg dose administered twice, 1 week apart, resultingin 5 of 6 horses with a lameness score of 0 or 1. Thelameness decreased by more than 50% at all doses af-ter 4 injections. An abstract published in 2012, on the retrospective evaluation of the use of stanozolol in performance horses, evaluated 60 horses, 50 being racehorses, many of which were refractory to previous treat- ments. 6Horses received a mean of 4 treatments of 5 mg intra-articular at weekly intervals. There was greater than 6-month follow-up available for 77% of the cases. There were no adverse reactions and a ben-ecial effect in 39% of cases, uncertain in 39%, and not bene cial in 22%. In another study that was dou- ble blinded, weekly intra-articular doses of 5 mg ofstanozolol were administered to horses with acuteand chronic osteoarthritis. 7Acute osteoarthritis was dened as less than 1 month of symptoms, with chronic osteoarthritis being more than 1 month ofsymptoms. The maximum treatment period was 21 days and 35 days for acute and chronic groups, respectively. A positive outcome was at least a 1-grade reduction in AAEP lameness score. The lame- ness score was 0/5 in 15 of 21 horses in the acute group after 2 treatments and in 7 of 19 horses in thechronic group after 4 treatments. They also examinedthe quality of the synovial fluid at the time of each injection, which was considered to be subjectiv-ely normal only in the acute group after the third NOTES 6 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSJOINT THERAPIES IN THE FIELD: WHAT TO USE AND HOWtreatment. Similar to what was noted by Rinnovati et al. in the dose response study, there was a mild swelling of the treated joints for a few days after treatment that regressed rapidly and spontaneously and did not require intervention. 2. Case Selection Because stanozolol is not a mainstream therapeutic with Food and Drug Administration approval, much of the information provided here is opinion from veterinarians rather than evidence-based. In the author 's opinion, stanozolol is an underutilized intra- articular therapy, likely a result of limits of availabil-ity and controlled substance regulations and perform-ance-enhancing drug testing regulations. Stanozololshould not be considered a quick x as the overall goal of stanozolol is for it to allow healing of the joint includ-ing cartilage, synovium, subchondral bone cartilage,and associated ligaments and menisci. Therefore, thistherapy should include a rest and rehabilitation sched- ule. In most cases, a series of injections are performed at weekly or greater intervals. With these factors inmind, the author feels the two more common applica-tions are osteochondrosis lesions in young horses andperformance horses with lameness localized to the jointbut less likely to have osteoarthritic degeneration tothe point that returning the joint to normal function isunlikely. Subchondral cysts of the medial femoral condyle, when identi ed in young horses, anecdotally have been one of the more frequent uses of stanozolol. Early screening of western performance horses for subchondral cysts is frequently performed due tothe relatively high incidence in this population.Resolution of the cysts have been reported anecdo-tally following serial intra-articular administrationof of cyst via ultrasound guid-ance or during arthroscopy is also discussed, and thismay also be done in concert with a transcondylarscrew. Furthermore, in the author 'so p i n i o n ,t h e application of stanozolol in horses with meniscalinjuries in conjunction with rest and a rehabilitationprogram may provide a positive outcome. Racehorses with palmar/plantar osteochondral disease can be dif cult to con rm diagnostically and are consistently dif cult to manage. Anecdotal reports of 5-mg weekly serial intra-articular stanozolol tre-atments and a controlled exercise program haveimproved the likelihood of return to performance ofthese horses. 3. Administration It is important that the 5 mg/mL micronized stanozolol in suspension be used for intra-articular administra- tion. The micronized particle size is used for intra-articular therapy because the large crystals in theintramuscular product may potentially damage thejoint. Stanozolol is frequently dispensed in a 5-mL vial,with 5-mg/mL concentration. With a 5-mg dose, there are multiple doses in a vial. The suspension needs tobe established by agitation of the vial prior to drawinga dose from the bottle. The micronized stanozolol isnot viscus and is easily administered with routineintrasynovial injection techniques. There can be someincreased joint effusion following treatment, as noted in the two studies above. 6,7There will be an occasional flare that can be managed with phenylbutazone and ice. The coadministration of a corticosteroid may in- hibit the desired anabolic pathways, so this is not rou-tinely performed. It is utilized with and without theaddition of hyaluronic acid, and the addition of antimicrobials can be done based on the veterinar- ian 's preference. 4. Limitations The primary limitations to stanozolol use are avail- ability and controlled substance requirements in addition to the lack of large case-controlled studies. There is not a major manufacturer source available in the United States. In Europe, stanozolol is com-mercially available. aIn the United States, 5 mg/mL micronized stanozolol is available from compoundingpharmacies. The compounding pharmacy guidelinescan require extensive information about the patient/ client that is being treated. The pharmacies must be licensed to ship to the practitioner 's state, so this can also be a limiting factor. Stanozolol is a prohibitedsubstance in many testing jurisdictions because of theanabolic effects of larger doses administered intra-muscularly. Stanozolol is banned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\u00c9questre Internationale. It is a prohibited substance with the United States Equestrian Federation with an estimated 47-day withdrawal. Stanozolol is prohib-ited or banned in most racing jurisdictions, potentiallyuniform rules will provide more consistent guidelines.The potential effects of international travel and salesof horses need to be considered. A typical systemic dose administered intramuscu- larly is 0.55 mg/kg, resulting in the administration of 250 mg or more. 8Systemic doses administered intra- muscularly can be detected for prolonged periods of time. The administration of 5 mg micronized stanozo-lol intra-articular is detected in plasma for a relativelybrief time, but contamination, injection technique,and combination therapy can all potentially result in violation of foreign substance rules. The disposition of stanozolol in plasma after intra-articular administra-tion of 5 mg stanozolol administered into both theright and left tarsocrural joints of 12 sound horseswas determined. 9T h ed r u gw a sq u i c k l yf o u n di ns y s - temic circulation and was eliminated rapidly andcould not be detected after 36 hours following intra- articular administration. Particle size of the stanozo- lol, joint health, periarticular administration, andadditional factors can all result in a different outcomefollowing administration.JOINT THERAPIES IN THE FIELD: WHAT TO USE AND HOW AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 75. Conclusion Stanozolol can be a useful component for managing joint disease. It is an affordable disease-modifying drug. Commonly used corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatories that can be bene cial in the manage- ment of joint disease. Stanozolol has some anti- inflammatory effects but also stimulates production of anabolic cytokines including insulin-like growth factor-1 and TGF- b1. The veterinarian needs to be aware of forbidden substance regulations when uti- lizing stanozolol.

Introduction Osteoarthritis and in flammatory joint disease are common causes of lameness and poor performance in sport horses.1,2This degenerative process is largely driven by upregulation of cartilage matrix degrading proteases and proin flammatory the affected joint.3These in flammatory mediators catabolic processes result in the loss of articular carti-lage, leading to pain and further degradation of the joint.3 The traditional use of steroid injections into joints affected with osteoarthritis has been hypothesized to have deleterious effects on cartilage over time, as well as other endocrine related side effects, which lim- its their judicious use in equine practice.4-6More recently, a variety of orthobiologics have become avail-able for equine practitioners to treat in flamed joints, b u tm o s ta r en o td e s i g n e dt od i r e c t l yt a r g e tt h ea c t i v e process that leads to cartilage degradation.2,7-9 Alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) has recently emerged as a potential treatment of cartilage-based pathology and in flammatory arthritides due to its chondropro- tective effects.10The treatment of joint- and disk- related injuries with concentrated A2M has been well documented in human, canine, and equine medi- cine.11-13A2M is a large (720 kD), acute phase protein that is a part of the innate immune system.14It is a negative regulator of catabolic factors associated withinflamed joints.10A2M 's major functions include thenonspeci c inhibition of 4 classes of and gene regulation.10,16 Notably, the A2M molecule has the unique ability to inhibit the in flammatory cascade by baiting and trapping the harmful proteases that are responsible for cartilage catabolism.17The matrix metalloprotei- are integralin the process of articular cartilage degradation, and studies have shown that A2M inhibits these degr- ading enzymes in a concentration-dependent binding proteases, the A2M molecule undergoes a conformational change to allow it to beremoved from circulation through phagocytosis andexcreted via the bloodstream. 22A2M has also been demonstrated to bind to proin flammatory cytokines, most notably IL-1 and TNF- a, within synovial fluid of in flamed equine joints (Fig. 1).10,12,22 -24 A2M is mainly synthesized by hepatocytes and in smaller amounts by macrophages, synoviocytes, and articular cartilage.10There are higher levels of A2M in plasma in comparison to synovial fluid in part due to the large molecular weight of A2M, which prevents its diffusion into the joint.10In order to isolate and concentrate the A2M molecule, blood is collected from that patient and is then spun and ltered using an Alpha2EQ mini kit.aThis is a portable, point-of-care NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 9JOINT THERAPIES IN THE FIELD: WHAT TO USE AND HOWsystem that allows practitioners to collect, process, and treat affected equine joints within 60 minutes. 2. Materials and Methods Considerations For best results, a 3-day washout period following administration of alpha-2 agonist sedatives and 5-day washout period following administration of nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs should be observed.bThere are no known negative interac- tions with bisphosphonate medications, shockwavetherapy, or laser therapy. The portable centrifuge and processing equipment should be set up in a clean, enclosed environment, suchas an exam or tack room. The provided sterile drapeshould be laid out over a work surface (the author of this paper often uses a table or the centrifuge 'st r a v e l case as a work surface) and the contents of the Alpha2EQ MiniKit blaid out. Before prepping for blood collec- tion, it is recommended to organize the equipment so that the blood can be processed ef ciently after col- lection. Necessary processing equipment, except forACD-A, cand step-by-step instructions are included in the kit. Blood Collection The patient 's jugular vein should be aseptically prepped for blood draw. Then, 6 mL ACD-A should be drawninto two 60-mL syringes using sterile technique. Using a1 9 - g a u g eo rl a r g e rn e e d l eo rb u t t e r fly, perform sterile venipuncture and carefully draw 34 mL of blood for a total volume of 40 mL. Disconnect the syringe, recap, and invert 7 times to adequately mix the blood and anti- coagulant before recapping and setting aside on a sterile eld. Repeat these steps for the second 60-mL syringe. After blood has been collected for processing, the horse may be sedated and anti-infl ammatory medications can be used, including at the time of administration. Onceblood has been collected, it should be processed within 30 minutes. Processing Sterilely connect the 60-mL syringes to a 1.5-inch blunt needle. Dispense 10 mL of the anticoagulatedblood into each of the 8 vacutainer tubes provided. In a balanced manner, place all 8 lled vacutainers into the centrifuge, and close and lock the centrifuge lid.Select 3400 rpm for 10 minutes and ensure that the brake is disengaged before pressing \"Start.\" Once this spin cycle is complete, remove each vacutainer one ata time, alcohol wipe the septum, and connect the vacutainer to the vacutainer access device. Using the stopcock attached to the vacutainer access device, aspirate the plasma from each of the 8 vacutainers. To begin the concentration process, remove the 2 conical tubes from their sterile packaging and place inthe provided stabilization holders. Then, remove the 50-mL syringe that contains the plasma from the vacutainer access device and attach a 4-inch aspira- tion needle to the syringe. Inject 19 mL of the plasma into each of the 2 conical tubes. Any additional plasma left in the syringe may be discarded. Next, place the conical tubes into the conical tube holders in the cen- trifuge using a balanced technique. Again, select 3400 rpm for 10 minutes and ensure that the brake is disen- gaged before pressing \"Start. \"Immediately following the spin cycle completion, place the conical tubes intothe stabilization holders. Using an alcohol wipe, swipe off the septum of each conical tube. Then, connect a 4- inch aspiration needle to a new 50-mL syringe and draw off the concentrated plasma into the syringe, tak- ing care not to aspirate the last 1 mL above the lter of the concentrated plasma. Typically, the volume ofAlpha2EQ injectate obtained is between 29 and 32mL. Use a sterile female adapter to transfer the Alpha2EQ f r o mt h e5 0 - m Ls y r i n g ei n t os m a l l e rs y r i n g e s .T h e choice of syringe size and volume of injectate can be tailored to the patient' s treatment plan. Once proc- essed, the Alpha2EQ product is stable for up to 4 hoursat room temperature or for up to 12 hours if it is stored in the refrigerator. Based on results of comparative Trypsin assays, the biological activity of the molecule has been validated after storage at -18\u00b0C for up to 6 months. Further testing is ongoing to establish via-bility of the molecule at 1 year. d Storage Any excess Alpha2EQ injectate that will not be immedi- ately used can be stored in a capped syringe or vial in a Fig. 1.

The authors of this paper recommend storing the unused injectate in 4-mL ali- quots using 6-mL syringes that have been drawn back to 5 mL to allow for expansion during freezing and then placed in a sterile sleeve. The sterile sleeve or other con-tainer should be labeled with the patient informationand expiration date prior to storage. Injection Therapy In order to determine which joints would bene tf r o m intra-articular therapy of Alpha2EQ, a thorough clini-cal examination should be performed with particular attention paid to degree of lameness, joint effusion, and diagnostic imaging ndings.1,25In Table 1, the volumes of Alpha2EQ used for various equine joints are sum-marized. All injections are administered using standard intra-articular and intralesional injection technique. 3. Results To establish the ef cacy of joint injection therapy using Alpha2EQ, the results from intra-articular joint therapy using Alpha2EQ performed by the author 'sc l i n i c between January 2020 and September 2021 were eval-uated. There was a total of 180 individual horses and893 individual injections performed. Across these cases, there was only 1 reported case of a joint flare. Table 2 summarizes the number and sites of the injections. Three injection sites were chosen to further evalu- ate based on the ease of ability to compare clinical parameters: the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, the tarsometatarsal and distal intertarsal joints, and the cervical dorsal articular facet joints. The followingselection criteria were applied to the new data set: horses must have been in active training at the time of injection, horses could not have received adjunct treat-ments (such as shockwave), and horses could not havereceived any additional injection therapies in the same limb. All horses were presented for a recheck examina- tion within 8 weeks of injection. The clinical parametersevaluated included joint effusion, lameness gradeaccording to the American Association of EquinePractitioners (AAEP) scale, response to flexion test, and pain on palpation. A scoring system based on clinical ex-amination ndings was applied to numerically repre- sentndings (Table 3). Distal Interphalangeal Joint A total of 38 cof n joint injections on 19 horses were analyzed and 78.9% of those cases had improvementin at least one clinical parameter. The average initial effusion score was 2.3, and the average postinjection effusion score was 1.3. The average initial lamenessgrade was 1.4 and the average postinjection lamenessgrade was 0.5. Tarsometatarsal and Distal Intertarsal Joints A total of 28 sets of injections on 14 horses were ana- lyzed. All horses presented for bilateral lower hock joint injection therapy for sport-associated distal tarsitis.Horses were excluded if there was concurrent concernfor soft tissue injury in the pelvic limb. Overall, 85.7%had improved flexion responses. At recheck examina- tion, 57.2% of the horses had 1 grade of improvementand 10.7% of horses had 2 grades of improvement toflexions. Cervical Dorsal Articular Facet Joint A total of 48 dorsal articular facet joint injections on 14 horses were analyzed. Pain improved on 71.4% of cases and 42.9% improved 2 grades, 17.8% improved 1 grade, and 10.7% improved 3 grades. 4.

There are additional advantages of this orthobiologic for managing in flammatory joint disease when compared to alternative products on the market, namely, the large injectate volume achieved and stability as a frozen product for up to 6 months ormore. As an orthobiologic, Alpha2EQ offers a nondop-ing approach to managing in flammatory synovitis, which is an advantage for clients competing in high-performance equine sport. The mechanisms of actionof the molecule are not impacted by the use of seda-tives and nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory medications at the time of treatment. Based on results within apopulation of sport horses competing in various disci-plines, injection therapy with Alpha2EQ has provento be effective at managing acute and chronic in flam- matory synovitis. Speci cally, there was a reduction in lameness as well as joint effusion and there wasimprovement of flexion test response and a reduction of pain on palpation. Since these data were compiledretrospectively, there was no case control comparison,which the authors recognize is a limitation on theresults. However, the veterinarians involved weresenior practitioners in an established sports medicinepractice that follows a uniform examination protocoland uses the accepted AAEP lameness scale.

General knowledge about best prac-tices for use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in horses islacking because the science around its use continues toevolve rapidly. Speci cally, inconsistency in study design, PRP characteristics, and outcome parametershave resulted in inconsistent results. In one system-atic review of clinical and experimental data onhumans and horses, bene cial effects were observed in 46.7% of patients, with an absence of positive resultsin 43.3% of patients. 1Issues pertaining to indications, characterization of PRP, and methodology will be dis-cussed. This paper will identify key variables in theformation and utilization of PRP in horses. 2. Materials and Methods Platelets are naturally occurring cells in the blood-stream. Following their formation by megakaryocytes,platelets are located throughout the vascular system.When exposed to injured endothelium, platelets degra-nulate, releasing growth factors from alpha granules,initiating the clotting cascade, and stimulating angio-genesis. Introduction of large numbers of platelets intoan injury is thought to create an overall anabolic effectby augmenting tissue healing and in flammation locally. Key regenerative growth factors stored in alpha gran-ules, and their basic functions can be found in Table 1.Blood is processed in various fashions dependent upon equipment. Most PRP systems are either \"buffy coat \"based or \"plasma \"based. Buffy-coat-based sys- tems tend yield higher white blood cells (WBCs) with lower platelet numbers. Because of the high vari- ability of equine hematocrit values as well as manyunique kits and protocols in most PRP semiautomated commercial systems, there is a high degree of variabil- ity produced of platelet numbers, concentrations, andadditional contents. 2The double spin technique has been described for maximizing platelet number.3,4 Characterization of PRP preparations is critical in terms of optimizing protocols and formulations.Parameters such as presence WBCs and red bloodcells in the preparation, as well as whether the horse isbeing treated with an antiplatelet medication such as aspirin, rocoxib, or other nonsteroidal anti-in flamma- tory drug, may affect response to treatment and have a signicant effect on the ef cacy of the end product. It is unclear how platelet numbers and concentra- tions affect safety and ef cacy. However, to be classi- ed as PRP, platelet numbers must be substantially greater than baseline plasma. When choosing a sys-tem, it is important to consider cost of the equipment, cost of the \"kits, \"whether the system is \"open \"or \"closed, \"and whether the system is portable and dura- ble. It is recommended that the clinician test indivi- dual samples to determine platelet numbers and concentrations they are delivering. This can be accomplished by taking a whole blood sample and NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 13JOINT THERAPIES IN THE FIELD: WHAT TO USE AND HOWdocumenting platelet count. A 1-mL sample can also be submitted of the undiluted PRP generated by the equipment (request sample to be agitated before PRP levels measured as platelets tend to clump). The ratioof platelets in PRP over platelets in whole blood pro- vides a concentration factor. Generally, most prepara- tions should yield 4x to 10x concentration. Oftentimes there is additional plasma (platelet- poor plasma) that is generally discarded despite hav- ing potential valuable ingredients. In addition tomeasuring platelet numbers in the PRP sample, quantifying presence of WBCs can also be useful. Generally, neutrophils have an in flammatory effect on surrounding structures and are not desirable formost PRP preparations. In one study, comparisonbetween human tissue treated with leukocyte-rich PRP and leukocyte-poor PRP resulted in greater cell death in synovial cells treated with the leukocyte richpreparations. 5However, in instances of chronic injury, neutrophils may help in breaking down brosis and undesired debris. Monocytes, on the other hand, may behelpful in producing additional anti-in flammatory prod- ucts and growth hormones and may be of value to keepin the PRP being produced. It is unclear how many platelets should be used in optimal concentrations in treating different tissue types.PRP samples can also be lysed by putting them throughone or more freeze/thaw cycles or by exposing the sam-ples to excessive positive or negative pressure. 3. Results Although use of PRP for treatment of soft-tissue inju- ries has been well documented, published results arecontradictory. In equine practice, PRP is used widely in soft-tissue injuries. Increasingly, PRP is used for treat- ment to synovial structures. The Equine CliniciansData Initiative was created in 2021, with the goal ofcapturing large case numbers of naturally occurringcases. At this time, the group consists of 7 equine prac-tices contributing data on the following: 1. Adverse events 2. Basic demographics of horses treated3. Outcome parameters4. Perception of ef cacy from vet and trainer Preliminary signalment data suggest that PRP is being used widely in treatment of soft-tissue injury (Fig. 1) and joint disease. Additionally, PRP is usedfor treatment of spinal injuries in humans (Fig. 2) andhorses. 4. Discussion Numerous therapeutic treatment options currently exist for treatment of soft-tissue injuries and joint- related injuries in horses. In many horses, use of cor- ticosteroids is contraindicated due to underlying met-abolic or medical issues. Production of PRP in theeld requires relatively inexpensive equipment and kits as well as requiring a signi cant amount of time to process. Despite these \"hassle \"factors, PRP is becoming a mainstream therapeutic option for manyequine sports medicine practitioners. Additionally,the onset of action is less predictable than with corti-costeroid use in joints. Adverse reaction includesregional swelling, discomfort, and transient lame- ness. Small-scale studies tracking human patients ' response to PRP injections into the lumbar spine suggest a longer period of bene ti se n j o y e di n patients treated with PRP versus corticosteroids(Fig. 2). Standardization of dosage, concentration, and opti- mal time of delivery is needed. It is the author 's impression that the use of PRP in joints creates a re-gional therapeutic bene t and carries a lower likeli- hood of \"masking \"a nearby injury. Additionally, there appear to be some horses that are \"nonrespond- ers\"who appear to not bene tf r o mt r e a t m e n t . Depending on the speci cs of each case, the author prefers a minimum 2-week window prior to competi-tion following treatment to PRP. It is also worth not-ing that in human athletes, the World Anti-DopingAgency initially prohibited PRP in 2010 but subse-quently allowed use of PRP in 2011 due to lack of de ni- tive evidence of effect from treatment. As of 2022, theF\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00c9questre Internationale allows use of PRPon horses out of competition, at home, and with adequatewithdrawal time. With United States EquestrianFederation rules, PRP is permitted, adhering to the \"12- hour \"rule and a 4-day intra-arterial injection with- drawal time. Important considerations when using PRP on equine patients include the following:Table 1.

Schnobrich, VMD, DACT Author 's address: Rood and is in flammation of the endometrial lining of the uterus that, without resolution, results in a decrease in fertility due to a pathologic change in theuterine environment. Because only the super cial layers are involved, endometritis, unlike metritis, doesnot result in systemic disease and life-threateningsequelae such as laminitis and sepsis. Despite this, it isa major cause of reproductive loss and infertility in the mare, being the third most common medical condition in the mare, and persistent mating-inducedendometritis (PMIE) is reported in 15% to 35% of maresafter breeding. 1-3T h ec a u s e so fe n d o m e t r i t i sa r em a n y and ultimately result in a reduced ability of the uterus to resolve in flammation and clear in flammatory debris. Factors that cause or predispose a mare to endometritis include anatomic defects, degenerative changes of theendometrium, endocrinopathy, decreased immune func- tion, exposure to infectious pathogens with varying viru- lence, and contamination such as occurs in mating(PMIE) or postfoaling. These alterations in the uterineenvironment and endometrial lining, including itssecretory properties and immune function, can become chronic and persist in a state of dysfunction and infl am- mation. The challenge to the practitioner is identifying when endometritis is present, if it is a normal physiolog-ical response or an abnormal state that requires inter- vention, what the inciting cause is, and whether there is an infectious component, and developing an appropri-ate treatment for resolution.2. Normal Endometrial Inflammatory Response It is a normal physiologic response of the mare' se n d o - metrium to become in flamed following breeding or foal- ing. This in flammation induces changes in uterine contractility, secretions, and immune functions that help evacuate contaminants (semen, debris, microbes) from the uterus and restore uterine health in a timelyfashion. Following breeding, spermatozoa, debris, andbacteria in the uterus induce infl ammation by activat- ing the immune system. 1-3Neutrophils are recruited to invade the uterine lumen and and Prostaglandin secretion results in increased myometrial contractions that expel debris andfluid from the uterus.5In normal mares at about 6 hours after breeding, anti-in flammatory cytokines that modu- late the immune response These cyto- kines include interleukin (IL)-1 known as IL8], and TNF a) and the uterus has cleared the stimulus of in flammation, the uterus returns to a more normal milieu.6-8This is noted ultrasono- graphically by the absence of fluid in the uterine lumen 24 to 36 hours after breeding and a decrease in edemafollowing ovulation.4,6,8When the normal uterine clear- ance mechanisms, anatomic barriers, and immuneresponse fail to resolve in flammation, chronic endometri- tis ensues. This can be infectious or noninfectious based NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 17INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITISon the inciting cause and progression of the condition. Normal mares that resolve breeding-associated in flam- mation 24 to 36 hours after breeding are referred to as\"resistant \"to PMIE. Resistant mares are able to resolve this breeding-induced infl ammation in a short time frame (96 hours).4,8\"Susceptible \"or\"problem mares \"are mares that cannot resolve the infl ammatory insult of breeding within 48 hours of breeding. Susceptible maresalso experience prolonged in flammation, uterine fluid accumulation, and uterine fluid neutrophilia beyond 96 hours.4,9-14Additionally, these mares are unable to clear intrauterine bacterial challenge with Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus within 96 hours, compared to \"resist- ant\"mares.15,16 3. Persistent Mating-Induced Endometritis The diagnosis of mating- (PMIE) includes transrectal pal- pation and ultrasound ndings 24 hours after breed- ing that include > 2 cm of intrauterine fluid and excessive endometrial edema relative to time of ovula-tion (edema should decrease within the periovulatory window and after ovulation).14-17Predisposing factors for mares with PMIE include anything that impedesuterine clearance and resolution of infectious or noninfectious contamination. Anatomic defects would include a pendulous uterus, a cervix that fails to relax, scar tissue that traps debris and infectiousagents, and large endometrial cysts that mechanically block uterine clearance mechanisms. Immunologic effects that predispose mares to PMIE are exacerbated proinflammatory responses (as seen in aged mares) and endocrinopathies that cause inappropriate or ineffectiveimmune responses such as pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction and equine metabolic syndrome. 16-19The type of pathogen introduced may also affect the mare' s ability to respond effectively.20Virulence of pathogens as enhanced by a protective bio lm may make the like- lihood of persistent infection and chronic endometritismore likely.20,21Additionally, degenerative changes of the endometrium such as poor lymphatic drainage,decreased normal mucus production, and impaired mucociliary apparatus can lead to an increased suscep- tibility to PMIE.19When managing a mare with a his- tory of PMIE, or that has predisposing factors (aged, poor anatomy of the reproductive tract) for PMIE, it is helpful to understand the mare 's prior reproductive his- tory. Ideally, the mare is available to observe through acomplete estrous cycle prior to breeding. This allows the practitioner to determine the underlying cause for failure of appropriate uterine response. Furthermore,serial examinations allow the veterinarian to determine when the issue is occurring and to prospectively treat for optimal uterine health. For example, if the mare begins to accumulate fluid early in the cycle, ecbolic agents (oxytoxin 10 IU, IM twice a day) or a prebreed-ing lavage (lactated Ringer 's solution lavage until ef flux clears) can be utilized to assist in clearance. 19,22 Postbreeding lavages administered 4 to 6 hours afterbreeding help remove in flammation, debris, andcytokines that prolong the in flammatory response.23 Antibiotics and immune modulators (dexamethasone, platelet rich plasma, mycobacterium cell wall extract)are used in some cases of mares with impaired anatomyor decreased immune function to help prophylacticallydecrease an excessive in flammatory response associ- ated with PMIE and aid in pathogen killing. 24,27With vigilant examinations, PMIE mares are often easilyidenti ed in the peribreeding period, which allows for prompt treatment. It can be challenging to diagnose theinciting cause or reason for persistent in flammation in mares with chronic endometritis and thus, poses a chal-lenge to the practitioner. This population of mares hasendometritis that developed from mating, contamina-tion, or other factors, and the clinician must identifythe cause of persistent endometritis so an appropriatetreatment plan can be made. 4. Chronic Endometritis Chronic endometritis (infectious and noninfectious) can present in a variety of ways clinically as there are many different factors that can cause the endome-trium not to be able to resolve in flammation. The di- agnosis of endometritis must be made with carefulassessment of the mare 's history, systemic health, reproductive anatomy, and results from diagnosticsampling of the uterus. Differentiation of infectiousversus noninfectious endometritis is traditionallymade with diagnostic endometrium (swab, small-volume lavage, or bi-opsy) and cytology. The history of a mare with endo-metritis often includes decreased pregnancy rates;increased pregnancy loss before 40 days of gestation;previous identi cation of uterine in flammation and infection on uterine cytology, culture, and/or biopsy;irregular estrous cycles; and shortened return toe s t r u sd u et oe n d o m e t r i a li n flammation causing pre- mature luteolysis. 5,14,28,29The reproductive tract can look variable based on the inciting cause, distribution,and severity of the endometritis. Mares may have sig-nicant bacterial load and deep endometrial in flamma- tion, with few ultrasonographic signs and negativeresult on swab culture and cytology. In E. coli infections, it has been shown that often the endometrial cytology isnegative, whereas endome-trial cytologies are often positive. 30Because of the variation in presentation, if one is suspicious of endome-tritis based on clinical ndings, further diagnostic tests are indicated. Diagnostic sampling of the uterus isessential to determine if in flammation is present, and this is performed using uterine cytology and/or histol-ogy (biopsy). lavage. 30-33T h r e eo fi n flam- mation, cell types present, presence of urine crystals,mucous, debris, hyphae, yeast, and bacteria all help to understand the factors affecting the uterine environ- ment. Infl ammation is generally categorized as mild (normal), moderate, or severe. The following categoriesINFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS 18 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSmay be used to de ne the endometrial in flammation: normal (no white blood cells [WBC] to rare WBC/100 epithelial cells [EC]), mild in flammation (1- 2 WBC/100 EC), moderate in standard of diag-nosis of endometritis. 34-36This allows assessment of the inflammatory cell character and distribution and sever- ity of in flammation. Endometrial biopsies can be useful for identifying chronic endometritis when traditional cytologic sampling fails to identify in flammation.34-36 5. Noninfectious vs. Infectious Endometritis Noninfectious endometritis can occur when there is con- tamination (air or urine) that continues to infl ame the endometrium or when in flammation from foaling or caustic agents does not resolve but does not contain an infectious component. Post-mating-induced endometri-tis is often noninfectious. Identi cation of infectious en- dometritis is best achieved with diagnostic tests that identify microbes, such as aerobic culture of uterine swab, lavage ef flux, or endometrial biopsy. 14,19Aerobic culture of uterine biopsy is the most sensitive and spe- cic means of diagnosing infectious endometritis.31,34,39 Aerobic culture of low-volume lavage ef flux and subjec- tive character of lavage fluid have been reported as also being sensitive for detecting microbial organisms that may be harder to detect (E. coli , fungal organisms).40 Polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequenc-ing of uterine samples are also helpful for detecting dif - cult infectious organisms, but these tests are lessreadily available. 41Disruption of bio lm,\"activation \"of latent infections, and bio lm assessment have been pro- posed as novel diagnostic tools to identify underlyinginfections and susceptibility to nonantimicrobial agentsnot identi ed with traditional methods. 20,42- 44These infusions of either bio lm disruptors or inflammation-inducing agents that stimulate suspected latent bacteria to replicate and make them easier toidentify and treat. 20,42 -44 Using currently available diagnostic tests, it is essential to incorporate all available information tomake an appropriate diagnosis. Assessment of medi-cal and reproductive history and evaluation of themare 's reproductive tract in estrus and diestrus (to include transrectal evaluation, vaginal speculum ex-amination, and digital cervical evaluation) allow iden-tication of anatomic ndings that may contribute to subfertility. Intrauterine fluid, uterine edema, a cer- vix that fails to close, evidence of air in the vagina oruterus, and/or hyperemic vaginal excessive intrauterine fluid accumulation >2 cm at any time (particularly if echogenic), and fail- ure of the cervix to dilate are abnormalities that war- rant further investigation.2,4,5,17Culture and cytologysamples are often taken during estrus as there is a decreased chance of obtaining a false negative sample.Furthermore, the mare 's immune system is better prepared to respond to iatrogenic contamination intro-duced during sample taking. Moderate in flammation and any signi cant growth on aerobic culture of the endometrium suggests that the mare has endometri-tis and may require treatment. Hysteroscopy is usedin cases of persistent endometritis despite appropriate treatment or when ultrasonography reveals signi - cant abnormalities of the uterus (hyperechoic debris that persists, abnormal fluid accumulations). Once en- dometritis is diagnosed, the inciting cause must beidenti ed in order to formulate an appropriate and successful treatment. History is again important as dystocia or unusual intrauterine treatments can often cause issues that must be addressed to abate theinflammation (cervical defects, uterine adhesions). Anatomic factors that cause chronic endometritis areimportant to identify and resolve as often withouttheir resolution, no intrauterine treatment will be cu- rative. Failure of the vulva, vestibuo-vaginal fold, and/or cervix to protect the uterus from contaminationmust be addressed, most often surgically (Caslick' s, cervical repair). Recto-vaginal stulas, urine pooling, and aspiration of air into the reproductive tract arenot as common causes of contamination but must also be ruled out in cases of chronic endometritis. Adhesions, diverticulae, scar tissue, and large cysts can form areasof debris and pathogen accumulation, which may alter normal uterine clearance mechanisms. Evaluation of the systemic health of the mare is equally essential asimmune function and ability to resolve uterine infec- tions may be compromised by (pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction,equine metabolic syndrome), excessive body condition, pain, or stress. 6. Summary Endometritis is a condition that involves both normal and abnormal progressive uterine responses to in flam- matory factors such as sperm, microbes, and debris. The challenge for the clinician is differentiating theabnormal uterine response and implementing appro- priate treatment. Careful evaluation of the mare, appropriate diagnostic tools, and interpretation ofresults can aid in identi cation of pathology and lead to appropriate treatment. Unfortunately, there is nosingle test with perfect sensitivity or speci city for identifying causes of endometritis. Therefore, practi- tioners must rely on complete clinical evaluation of the mare to institute effective treatments. Fortunately, themajority of pathologic endometritis cases can be cor- rectly identi ed and easily diagnosed in routine brood- practice.INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH?

Summary Sport horse mares presented for breeding in Europe typically fall into two age categories, 3 to 4 years oldand late teens, re flecting the loss of elite 6- to 15-year- olds to a competitive career. The two groups differmarkedly with respect to their susceptibility to persis-tent breeding-induced endometritis (PBIE), whereaspects of susceptibility can be further in fluenced by whether the mare has ever carried a foal to term and,if so, how long ago she last foaled. Young maiden andfoaling mares are typically resistant to PBIE. By con-trast, mares that retire from a successful sporting ca-reer in their late teens are often nulliparous but stillaffected by age-related changes that increase horses may also have poor perineal conforma-tion as a result of low body-fat reserves. Moreover, thecervix of aged maiden mares is often brotic and fails t or e l a xa d e q u a t e l yd u r i n ge s t r u s ,i m p e d i n ge v a c u a -tion of the in flammatory fluids resulting after breed- ing. Conversely, maiden mares will not be affected byconditions associated with multiparity, such as apendulous uterus, or foaling-induced damage to thecaudal reproductive tract. This paper assesses the rel-ative susceptibility of young versus teenage mares,and broodmare versus embryo donors, to endometritis and discusses strategies to reduce the impact of PBIE on the success of breeding the aged maiden mare. 2. Introduction Show jumping and dressage mares are only allowed to compete at the highest level beyond 7 years of age. However, if they are successful, they may con- tinue to compete until their mid-teens. As a result,jumping and dressage mares are typically presented for breeding either when they are 3 to 4 years old, i.e., before they enter serious training and competi-tion, or when they have retired from competition at around 14 to 16 years of age. In short, an elite dressage, show jumping, or eventing mare 's compet- itive career will often extend beyond the time at which her fertility starts to decline (approximately 14 years). 1Given that owners are likely to want progeny from proven performers, this presents a di- lemma as to whether competing or breeding should take precedence. This can, in part, be tackled byusing the mare as an embryo or oocyte donor duringher sporting career. 2However, riders often com- plain that managing mares for insemination andembryo collection, and in particular the relatedincreased frequency of estrus, compromises training and performance. Furthermore, there have been suggestions that the physiological stress of training NOTES 22 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSINFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITISand competition could compromise fertility and embryo quality.3Oocyte recovery by ovum pick-up (OPU) has the advantage that it can be performedas a one-off, outpatient procedure; moreover, intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection and in vitro embryoproduction may yield multiple embryos such thatthere is less need to repeat oocyte recovery ses- sions. 4Nevertheless, OPU is an invasive procedure, and actively competing mares more often suffer postprocedure discomfort, normally for only 1 to3 days, but occasionally for longer (7 to 10 days). A reasonable proportion of serious breeders pre- empt the issue of fertility decline during a competitivecareer by breeding mares when they are 3 to 4 years old, before they enter serious training or competition, either to carry a foal or to yield embryos. Clearly,these young mares are ideal candidates for breedingin terms of their expected fertility, while giving birthcan help to protect against or at least delay the onsetof cervical brosis. Alternatively, of course, carrying a foal to term itself carries a risk of serious complica- tions that could compromise future fertility, including cervical tears. On the other hand, using mares exclu-sively as embryo donors over the course of manyyears, and never allowing them to foal, appears toexacerbate the brotic changes to the cervix more commonly associated with the aged maiden mare.The alternative to breeding at a young age is to wait until a mare 's competitive career is over before she becomes a broodmare or embryo donor. Despite never having had a foal, these teenage mares will still beaffected by age-related changes that increase the like-lihood that they will be susceptible to PBIE. And,since endometritis is one of the most common reasons for mares failing to establish or maintain pregnancy after breeding, 5anticipating and preventing or treat- ing PBIE is an important aspect of managing oldermares in the peri-insemination period. 3. Endometritis and Fertility Uterine infection and/or in flammation can be detri- mental to fertility in numerous ways. First, if theinfection and/or in flammation is pre-existing, the neu- trophils already recruited to the uterus may capture,bind, and phagocytose the spermatozoa soon afterthey are deposited in the uterus, thereby reducing thelikelihood of conception. Second, the persistence of uterine in flammation beyond day 6 after ovulation can interfere with the establishment of pregnancy, ei- ther by a direct toxic effect on the embryo when itenters the uterine lumen or because the in flammation stimulates PGF 2arelease leading to pre- mature luteolysis or luteal compromise. In the longerterm, persistent or recurrent uterine in flammation may lead to a disturbed uterine environment andaccelerate the development of chronic degenerativechanges in the endometrium (endometrosis), both ofwhich compromise the ability to maintain pregnancy.4. Breeding-Induced Endometritis During the last 20 years, it has also become increas- ingly clear that endometritis is not always a result of microbial infection. In fact, it is now accepted that the most common instigator of endometritis is mating or insemination and that a transient uterine in flamma- tion is the normal physiological response to the intra- uterine deposition of semen (thus, breeding-induced endometritis).6Furthermore, the spermatozoa them- selves appear to be the primary instigator of the inflammatory reaction, which presumably serves to aid the elimination of \"excess \"spermatozoa that do not make it through the utero-tubal junction and intothe oviductal sperm reservoir within the rst 4 hours after insemination. 5This breeding-induced in flamma- tory reaction consists of two major components: 1)physical clearance of fluid, spermatozoa, contaminat- ing microorganisms, and in flammatory products pro- duced in response to insemination. This mechanical clearance is primarily a result of myometrial contra- ctions that initially help to transport spermatozoa to-ward the oviduct but are subsequently more impo- rtant in eliminating uterine fluid and the other remnants of insemination through the cervix. This physical clearance is further supported by mucociliary action and lymphatic drainage, with the latter becom- ing increasingly important as the cervix tightens andlocal immunity wanes following ovulation. 72) The sec- ond arm of the in flammatory response is a cascade of immune system responses that further help to elimi- nate foreign material and restore the uterus to a \"clean, \"noninfl amed state. Since it would not be sen- sible to develop immunological memory to spermato- zoa, much of the immune response is initiated via nonspeci c receptors and involves innate pathways including the complement system, proin flammatory cytokines, and neutrophils where the latter play a cru-cial role in trapping spermatozoa and bacteria eitherby direct ligand-receptor binding or by extruding their DNA to form so-called neutrophil extracellular traps. 5 The uterine in flammatory response begins within 2 hours after insemination and peaks at around 4 to 8 hours, both in terms of neutrophil recruitment and proin flammatory cytokine production, after which a combination of mechanical clearance of the stimuliand a shift in the balance of cytokines toward anti- inflammatory mediators should serve to dampen the response and ensure that uterine clearance is com- pleted by 48 hours after breeding. 6The mare 'si n t r i n - sic reaction is further modi ed by various components of seminal plasma, which can augment uterine con-tractility and suppress the in flammatory response, most importantly shortening the duration of the inflammatory reaction. For example, seminal plasma contains prostaglandins that can stimulate myometrialcontractions and factors that inhibit neutrophil trap-ping and phagocytosis of live spermatozoa (CRISP 3) but enhance that of dead spermatozoa (lactoferrin), thereby enhancing the likelihood that live spermatozoaINFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS AAEP PROCEEDINGS Vol. 68 / 2022 23reach the oviduct after insemination, even in the of pre-existing in flammation.8 5. Persistent Breeding-Induced Endometritis A young, reproductively healthy mare will resolve the breeding-induced infl ammation within 24 to 48 hours.6Since it is not practical to monitor the elimi- nation of neutrophils or the change in the balance between anti- and proin flammatory cytokines, the elimination of ultrasonographically visible uterine fluid and reduction in uterine edema are the most use- ful proxies for the successful completion of uterine clearance. In young, healthy mares, this usually takesup to 6 hours after breeding with fresh semen but of-ten takes longer after frozen semen insemination(12 hours). 5In mares \"susceptible \"to postbreeding en- dometritis, however, the normal uterine defensemechanisms are compromised such that the clearanceof spermatozoa and in flammatory debris is not com- pleted within 48 hours, and signi cant uterine fluid accumulation (> 2 cm) will persist beyond the 6- to 12-hour time windows quoted above. As a result, it is ad- visable to check susceptible mares relatively soon af- ter arti cial insemination, e.g., 4 to 6 hours, to enable timely initiation of treatments to enhance uterineclearance and/or modulate the in flammatory response. These additional treatments may be as simple as theuse of ecbolics, such as oxytocin, to stimulate myome-trial contractions and enhance the expulsion of fluid or uterine lavage with sterile 0.9% saline or lactatedRinger 'ss o l u t i o n( L R S )t or e m o v et h e fluid and any offending spermatozoa, bacteria, and in flammatory byproducts that it might contain. Early and aggressivemanagement of PBIE very much improves the likeli- hood of rapid resolution and reduces the risk of sec- ondary infection. Therefore, in practice, it is importantto identify mares likely to be susceptible to PBIE sothat they can be monitored more intensively aroundthe time of insemination, both to minimize the num-ber of in flammatory challenges (i.e., inseminations) and, following insemination, to ensure the rapid com-pletion of uterine clearance and dampening of theinflammatory cascade. While susceptibility to PBIE may only become evident following the rst insemina- tion, the aged maiden mare is an obvious candidatefor closer monitoring, and a thorough initial examina- tion may reveal predispositions to PBIE that need to be addressed. 6. Old Maiden Mare Issues When presented with a teenage maiden mare recently retired from competition, it is important to remember that she has no breeding history and, therefore, mayhave undiagnosed congenital anomalies or problemsnormally diagnosed in 3- to 4-year-olds. Recently retired sport horses may also be slow to start cycling at the start of the year because of low body-fatreserves or treatments received during their competi-tive career. The lack of body fat may also predisposeto poor perineal conformation, adding an extra predis- position to pneumo- and urovagina and pre-existing infective endometritis. As a result, during the rst ex- amination, more attention should be paid to carefullychecking whether the mare requires a Caslick 's proce- d u r ea n df o rt h ep r e s e n c eo fi n t r a u t e r i n e fluid or inap- propriate edema (i.e., more edema than is consistentwith cycle stage and follicle development). 7Since both flu i da n de x c e s s i v ee d e m aa r ei n d i c a t o r so fi n flamma- tion, if they are present, it is advisable to collect a uterine sample for cytological and microbiological investigation to rule out a pre-existing infection. Even if the fluid proves to be sterile and free of in flamma- tory cells, it can be advantageous to lavage the mare' s uterus with LRS prior to insemination.9In some cases, the fluid recovered may be very turbulent, sug- gesting excess mucus. A mucolytic agent, such as N-acetyl help to breakdown excess mucus by reducing disulphide bonds,6thereby facilitating re- moval. In older maiden mares and older mares thathave been used as embryo donors without ever giving birth, it is important to check cervical relaxation dur- ing estrus, preferably by digital examination. The cer-vix can be brotic, long, and tortuous. The brotic nature of the cervix becomes increasingly severe withan increasing number of years without foaling, and this change can signi cantly interfere with postbreed- ing uterine clearance. Cervical relaxation can beassisted by manual dilation at the time of insemina- tion and in combination with uterine lavage and/orecbolic treatment at the rst postbreeding examina- tion. In severe cases, topical application of prostaglan-din E products, e.g., 1 mg of misoprostol (PGE1: Cytotec tablets dissolved in 0.9% saline or crushed and mixed with sterile gel) or 1 mg of prostin E2 (PGE2; either in tablet or gel form), at around 4 to 6 hours after insemination may further enhance cervi- cal relaxation and assist the evacuation of accumu- lated fluid. Probably the best long-term remedy for cervical brosis, however, is foaling since parturition involves a complete remodeling of cervical architec-ture at the level of the cells and extracellular matrix. The owners of a mare intended as an embryo donor may take some convincing that it is better to keep her in foal because establishing pregnancy in these mares may be a challenge. 7. Age-Related Degenerative Changes Chronic endometrial degeneration is known to be more a factor of age than parity in mares. Therefore, a career as a sport horse is not protective against endo-metrial degeneration; in fact, years of barrenness may even hasten brotic changes.10Although the extent of brotic degeneration, and therefore the prognosis for carrying a foal to term, can be examined via an endo- metrial biopsy, there are no treatments proven to reverse the degenerative process. This means that a biopsy is most useful for highlighting the likely chal-lenge and/or helping to make the decision of whether to let the mare carry a pregnancy or to use herINFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS 24 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSprimarily as an embryo or oocyte donor. Symptomatic treatment for endometrial degeneration can include more frequent use of ecbolics postinsemination, since endometrial degeneration has been associated with reduced myometrial contractility as a result of an accumulation of nitric hysteroscopic re- moval of large endometrial cysts using electrocautery or an Nd:YAG laser. Older mares are also more likely to be affected by oviductal blockage, and repeated fail- ure to establish pregnancy or recover an embryo with- out any obvious underlying cause are reasons to consider oviductal therapies. Laparoscopic11or intrau- terine application of PGE2 known to restore oviductal patency. PPID is another condition of the older horsethat can predispose mares to PBIE by compromisingthe normal immune response. Proper diagnosis of PPID and management using pergolide can help nor- malize both the postbreeding in flammatory reaction and possible abnormalities of cyclicity. 13 8. Breeding Management of the Teenage Mare Since it is safest to assume that a teenage maiden mare is at increased risk of susceptibility to PBIE, efforts should be made to ensure a minimal number of inseminations per cycle. This will include frequent (at least daily) monitoring of follicle development, combined with the use of an ovulation-inducingagent (i.e., human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] or a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] analog); in addition, flushing the uterus with LRS to remove fluid 0 to 2 hours prior to insemination can help pro- vide a \"clean \"starting point, and timing the insemi- nation further in advance of ovulation than normal(e.g., 18 -24 hours instead of 6 -12 hours) will allow extra time to resolve any issues with persistent uter- ine in flammation. Following insemination, early (4 - 6 hours postinsemination) identi cation and removal offluid using a combination of large-volume uterine lavage, uterotonic agents such as oxytocin or a PGF 2a analog, and cervical dilation is also essential to limiting the duration of the uterine in flammatory response.6With respect to the uterotonic drugs, some studies suggest that lower doses of oxytocin (5 -10 IU) may be more effective in promoting uterine clearance than higher doses (> 20 IU) because the latter cause a nonproductive uterine \"spasm \"rather than waves of contraction.14And while PGF 2aanalogs, such as clo- prostenol, are useful alternatives to oxytocin because of their longer duration of action (4- 5 hours compared to<45 minutes), their use postovulation is not recom- mended because it will compromise subsequent cor-pus luteum function.15In some susceptible mares, conventional treatments appear to be inadequate toresolve the postbreeding in flammatory reaction in a timely fashion, and it may be worth considering theuse of systemic corticosteroids to modulate the in flam- matory reaction. Both a single large dose of dexamtho- sone 16and daily administration of prednisolone17 have been reported to improve the likelihood ofpregnancy or embryo recovery in susceptible mares. Corticosteroids also appear to limit postinseminationedema and fluid accumulation and correct deviations in the balance between pro- and anti-in flammatory cytokines reported during PBIE. 9. Conclusions Sport horse mares submitted for breeding often fall into two distinct populations. Young mares prior to a competitive career are typically resistant to PBIE and require little speci c postbreeding management; moreover, having a foal at a young age may help delay the subsequent development of cervical brosis. Mares retired to breeding after a successful competi- tive career present a different challenge and are com- monly affected by brotic degeneration of both the cervix, which interferes with the ability to relax and allow the elimination of fluid, and the endometrium, which may compromise both myometrial contractility and the ability to provide an environment conduciveto embryo development and placentation. One of the most important aspects of managing the retired sport horse mare is therefore early postbreeding monitoringforfluid and simple but aggressive therapies to enhance uterine clearance and limit the duration ofinflammation.

The development of acute and chronic cases of endometritis is the result of de ciencies in the mare 's ability to eliminate an infection and the causative bacteria' s unique pathogenic properties. The mare 's uterine defense mechanisms to bacterial infection are well understood and consist of physical,immunological, and mechanical barriers. 1Bacteria uti- lize numerous methods to survive degradation by thehost immune system and antibiotic therapy. One sur-vival tool utilized by bacteria is the production of a bio-lm. Bio lms allow bacteria to be unrecognized by the host immune system, prevent exposure to antibiotics,and allow for exchange of genetic material leading toantibiotic resistance. 2 The purpose of this review is to describe how altera- tions to host defenses in combination with the patho-genicity of bacteria result in chronic cases of bacterial endometritis. 2. Pathophysiology The presence of bacteria within the uterine lumen results in a rapid in flux of neutrophils, immunoglobu- lins, and serum proteins. Neutrophils from susceptiblemares have reduced in vitro ability to phagocytize bac-teria as compared to resistant mares. The in flammation associated with the innate immune system results influid production into the uterine lumen. 3-5 Thenal defense mechanism against bacterial endo- metritis is mechanical uterine clearance of bacteria andinflammatory products. Several studies have shown that mares susceptible to uterine infections havedecreased clearance of uterine flu i da sc o m p a r e dt or e - sistant mares. 6-10After intrauterine inoculation with bacteria, susceptible and resistant mares have similaruterine myometrial contractions for 6 to 8 hours postin- oculation, but it depresses in susceptible mares after 8h o u r s .11-13Failure to clear bacteria and in flammatory products from the uterus results in continued activationo ft h ei n n a t ei m m u n es y s t e m ,w h i c ht h e nl e a d st oaf u r -ther increase in in flammatory cells, immunoglobulins, and serum proteins reaching the uterus, which contin-ues to activate the innate immune system. Bacterial Lifestyle Bacteria are capable of living in two different life-styles: planktonic or bio lm states. Planktonic bacte- ria are single bacterial cells that are free flowing in suspension. Bacteria in this lifestyle are utilizingavailable nutrients for procreation. These individualcells are relatively susceptible to recognition and deg-radation by the host immune system. They are alsosusceptible to changes in environment (desiccation,lack of nutrients, etc.) and are more sensitive to anti-biotics. However, the planktonic cell paradigm does NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 27INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITISnot accurately re flect the growth of bacteria that are associated with a bio lm.2 In the last several decades, the bio lm state has been considered to be the more prevalent lifestyle with ;80% of the overall world bacterial biomass living in abiolm.14In natural environments, these bio lms are invariably a multispecies microbial community-harboring bacteria that stay and leave with pur-pose, share their genetic material at high rates,andll distinct niches within the bio lm. 14 Therst step in bio lm formation is migration and adherence to a surface; a medical example of a sur-face would be bone, orthopedic implants, or epithe-lium throughout the body. Individual bacteria willmigrate (if capable) until other bacteria (same speciesor other) are encountered and microcolonies start toform. At this point, the planktonic and bio lm life- styles can be differentiated from each other. Thistransition to a bio lm lifestyle is associated with downregulation of genes associated with flagella pres- ent in a planktonic state. Additionally, there is an up-regulation of genes associated with polysaccharideproduction increase leading to production of an exopo-lysaccaride (EPS) matrix that forms the scaffold forthe bio lm community. Clinically, bio lms signi cantly interfere with tra- ditional methods for treating chronic bacterial infec-tions. Bacteria within a bio lm are protected from the host immune system as white blood cells havereduced ability to move and function, and the thicklayer of EPS prevents antibodies from reaching bacte-ria deep within the bio lm. Bio lms protect bacteria from antibiotics by providing a diffusion barrier thatdecreases the amount of antibiotics that reach thebacterial colonies. This creates a microenvironmentthat slows down bacterial metabolism and, therefore,replication of bacteria. Slowed replication makes bac- teria more resistant to antimicrobial agents. 15-20 As antimicrobial agents come in contact with the biolm, the agents must traverse through a layer of thick EPS, DNA, RNA, lipids, and proteins in order to reach bacteria buried deep within this protective bar-rier. Bacteria in the outer region may be killed, but adecrease in the level of antibiotics reaching the inner-layer bacteria contributes to the formation of a nidusfor chronic infection. The thick layer of EPS found in bio lms not only pre- vents antibiotics from penetrating but also limits thediffusion of oxygen and nutrients. Oxygen and nutrientdeprivation consequently result in a decreased bacterialmetabolic rate as compared to planktonic bacteria.Reduced metabolic rate impairs bacterial multiplication,which further enhances antimicrobial resistance. 11,20- 22 It has been proposed that, in the horse, bio lms play an important role in chronic uterine infections re- sistant to antimicrobials due to bio lm production.23 Additionally, acute and chronic nonhealing wounds on the distal equine limb showed greater incidence ofbiolm-producing bacteria as compared to a skin sam- ple near the wound.24Therefore, there is evidence for bacterial bio lm production in the horse.Biofilms in the Horse Evaluation of bacteria isolated from the equine uterussuggests that the majority of pneumonia produce biolm in vitro.25In the horse, using a model of infec- tious endometritis, a bio lm-involved infection has been able to be successfully established.25The adher- ent bio lm material is multifocal, with the greatest ad- h e r e n c eo c c u r r i n gb e t w e e nt h et i s s u ef o l d sa n di nt h euterine horns.25The bacteria were identi ed with greater numbers deep in the endometrial glands as compared to the luminal surface.25An alteration in the host immune response was identi ed, with reduced polymorphic neutrophils (PMNs) surrounding areas of adherent bio lm as compared to areas free of bacte- ria.25Unfortunately, no clinical diagnostic tests are available for the detection of a bio lm-related infec- tion.25In human medicine, a bio lm is suspected if appropriate antibiotic therapy is administered and the infection is unable to be eliminated; potentially, similarcriteria and treatment recommendations are war- ranted for uterine infections in the horse. 3. Treatment Options for Biofilms Bacteria residing in a bio l mc a nb eu pt o1 0 0 0t i m e s more resistant to treatment with antibiotics as com-pared to free-living (planktonic) bacteria. Admini- stration of antibiotics alone is not effective in elimi- nating chronic bacterial infections suspected of involving a bio lm in both human and veterinary medicine.13The goal in treating a bio lm-associated infection is to remove the bio lm material and kill the bacteria residing within the bio lm. A series of in vitro and in vivo studies were con- ducted to assess bio lm dispersal and/or bacterial kill- ing for antibiotics and nonantibiotic agents alone or in combination against Gram-negative bacteria.25Data indicated that antibiotics and nonantibiotic agents are more effective against bio lm if administered concur- rently (i.e., in the same syringe).25Table 1 describes treatments for infusion into the equine uterus based on the in vitro data. The treatments contain the mini- mum amount of antibiotic or nonantibiotic agent needed to be effective in killing E. coli ,K. pneumoniae, andP. aeruginosa . Treatments should be administered every 24 hours for a minimum of 3 treatments. Using this treatment protocol, complete bio lm dispersal and bacterial killing were achieved, in vitro. In all cases, antibiotic sensitivity testing should be performed to optimize treatment success. Bacteria inherently resist- ant to an antibiotic will still be resistant when that anti- biotic is used in combination with a nonantibiotic agent. It is important to note that some nonantibiotic agents and antibiotics should not be combined in the same sy-ringe. For example, the in vitro data indicated that mix- ing acetylcysteine with antibiotics in the same syringe resulted in reduced activity of the antibiotics. If a clini-cian is electing to use acetylcysteine, an option is to useit as an intrauterine infusion to break up mucous;INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS 28 2022 Vol. 68 AAEP PROCEEDINGShowever, a large-volume uterine lavage should be per- formed prior to instillation of antibiotics into the uterus. 4. Summary Treatment of bio lm-associated endometritis in the horse can be frustrating due to the lack of clear diag-nostic techniques to know if a bio lm is involved. Fortunately, there are proven in-vitro- and in-vivo - based treatment protocols that can effectively treatuterine infections suspected of involving a bio lm. A thorough understanding of the lifestyle differencebetween planktonic and bio lm-associated lifestyles can help guide clinicians in case selection and treat-ment options available currently and in the future.

Introduction Antimicrobial resistance is both a veterinary and global challenge. The incidence of resistance affectsall body systems, including the reproductive tract. In h o r s e s ,as t u d yb yD a v i se ta l .1revealed resistance patterns for common uterine pathogens, most notably Streptococcus subsp. zooepidemicus (S. (E. coli ), over a 5-year pe- riod in Florida. E. coli isolates demonstrated an increased resistance to trimethoprim sulfonamide andampicillin over the course of the study period. The re-sistance patterns of S. zooepidemicus did not increase over time; however, there was a signi cant amount of resistance to oxytetracycline throughout the study,andS. zooepidemicus was found to be highly resistant to enro floxacin in the rst 3 years of the study. The challenge to slowing bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is in the hands of veterinarians andthe research community so that educated selection ofantimicrobials is based on ef cacy and pharmacoki- netics of commonly used antibiotics. To increase anti-microbial stewardship, antibiotics should be usedwhen there is a con rmed infection, and treatment should be based on antimicrobial sensitivity. The unfettered use of postbreeding antibiotic infusions in mares is a practice with questionable ef cacy that has potential to accelerate bacterial resistance to antibiot-ics in equine reproductive medicine. Following a review of the literature, Cooke concluded that routine postbreeding antibiotic infusions are not justi ed andshould only be used in mares susceptible to endome- tritis. Cooke evaluated 11 papers that focused onintrauterine antibiotics and endometritis in the horse.None of the studies showed a signi cant increase in pregnancy rates following postbreeding antibioticinfusions. 2In a recent study by Bailey, pregnancy rates were similar in young Thoroughbred maresadministered intrauterine antibiotic infusions afterbreeding compared with untreated mares. aThere d o e sn o ta p p e a rt ob eac l e a ra d v a n t a g et or o u t i n euterine antimicrobial administration in the postbreed-ing period. Instead, antimicrobial use is best directedat mares with clear indication of bacterial endometri-tis. Not only is this the best practice for veterinarypatients, but many of the antibiotics that areroutinely used to treat bacterial endometritis andother uterine conditions are also considered critical tohuman health. 3According to the World Health Organization in 2018, the following antibiotics werelisted as critically important or highly important anti-microbials for human health: gentamicin, ampicillin,ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim, to name a few \u2014a sobering realization that emphasizes the need for their judicious use. 4 2. Bacterial Endometritis Bacterial endometritis is a common cause of reducedfertility in the mare.5The most common infectious agents involved in the disease are S. zooepidemicus NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 31INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITISandE. coli .6-8The standard method for the diagnosis of bacterial endometritis is endometrial culture and cytology using a double-guarded culture swab andcytology brush, respectively.9It has been suggested that scientists and clinicians should come to a consen-sus on uniform thresholds when evaluating samples.The proposed criteria for in flammation would vary depending on the sample type, with 2% polymorpho- n u c l e a rl e u k o c y t e s( P M N )f o ru t e r i n es w a b s ,1 %PMN for cytobrushes and biopsies, and > 3 PMN/highpower eld for samples from a low-volume uterine la- vage or a uterine biopsy. The proposed criterion forendometrial infection would be > 4 colony forming units of a pathogenic monoculture or a mixed culture ofE. coli andS. zooepidemicus . 10If the culture and cy- tology results do not correlate, meaning there is a pos-itive culture and negative cytology or vice versa, thena diagnosis of bacterial endometritis becomes morechallenging. E. coli often fails to produce cytologic evi- dence of infection, 1,8and it may go undetected with a standard swab culture.10In situations where the cul- ture and cytology are more sensi-tive diagnostics such as low-volume uterine lavage,endometrial biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction toidentify microbial DNA can be used to con rm the di- agnosis. 7,11,12Once a diagnosis of bacterial endometri- tis has been made, an appropriate antibiotic can beselected based on the results of the endometrial cul-ture and sensitivity. False positive diagnoses of bacte-rial endometritis are likely very high given that manypractitioners will treat a mare with laboratory resultsthat are less than conclusive than those describedabove, and some will treat based on clinical signsalone, even in the absence of growth on culture orcytologic evidence of infl ammation. 3. Antimicrobial Therapy to Treat Bacterial Endometritis in Mares When using antibiotics to treat bacterial endometritis in mares, it is important to select an appropriate anti- biotic for the situation, use the correct dose, providethe best route of administration, and treat for theappropriate duration for the isolated organism. Thecommon methods for antimicrobial administration formares with bacterial endometritis are intrauterineinfusion and systemic administration. 4. Intrauterine Antimicrobial Therapy Intrauterine infusion is a common route for antimi- crobial administration in mares with bacterial en- dometritis.13It is possible to achieve higher drug concentrations in the uterine lumen and endome-trium after intrauterine therapy than with systemictherapy. 14In some cases, the total amount of antimi- crobial necessary for treatment is lower with intrau- terine administration.15Additionally, intrauterine administered antimicrobials concentrate locally in the genital tract, thereby producing minimal distur-bances in the microbiome of other body systems.16However, intrauterine antibiotic administration can cause in flammation in the uterus that may persist for many days following treatment and may negatively impact the ability of the mare to become pregnant.14 Intrauterine antibiotic therapy during diestrus can place the mare at risk for the development of a fungal endometritis or infection with another bacterial patho- gen.17For this reason, it is preferable to use intrauter- i n et h e r a p yw h e nt h em a r ei si ne s t r u s .U t e r i n elavage is often used in conjunction with intrauterine antimicrobial infusion when treating mares with bac- terial endometritis. Exudate the uterine lumen may inactivate or dilute the antimicrobial to the point where it is no longer effective. Uterine lavage before antibiotic infusions will remove in flammatory debris and improve the contact of the antibiotic with the uter-ine lumen and endometrium. 13 The volume of antibiotic required to ensure uni- form distribution throughout the uterus without lossthrough the cervix ranges from 50 to 200 mL. 14One report suggests that at least 60 mL of fluid is required to cover the entire endometrial surface of a normal mare.18Conversely, overdistention of the uterus and loss of antibiotic through the mare 'sc e r v i xd u r i n g estrus may contribute to treatment failure or evenbacterial resistance if an insuf cient dose of antibiotic is used for treatment.19 The duration of intrauterine antimicrobial therapy traditionally ranges from 3 to 7 days, but the time frame appears to be based on convenience rather than on conclusions derived from scienti cs t u d i e s .18It has been recommended that mares with mild uterine infec-tions, based on endometrial biopsy, be treated for 3 days. Recommended treatment time for mares with moderate infections is 5 days of intrauterine therapy, and mares with severe infection should be treated for 7d a y s .20Proper hygiene is important when perform- ing intrauterine treatments so that pathogenic bacte-ria from the clitoris or vestibule are not introduced or fecal contamination does not occur.21If an examina- tion per rectum is planned prior to intrauterine infu-sion, washing and drying the perineum and then inserting a rolled feminine pad into the mare 'sv e s t i - bule prior to entering the rectum helps to prevent fecal contamination of the caudal reproductive tract during transrectal examination. Antimicrobials used for intrauterine therapy are generally infused into the uterine body. Alternatively,antimicrobials may be infused into the mare 'su t e r u s via the deep horn infusion technique. Half of the anti-microbial solution can be infused into the tip of the left uterine horn, and the remaining solution can be infused into the tip of the right uterine horn. The entire infusion can be done with a single deep horn AI pipette. To date, this technique has not been com- pared to traditional uterine body infusions to deter- mine if one is more ef cacious than the other. However, intuitively, it seems that the deep horntechnique might better ensure distribution of the anti- microbial solution through the uterus.INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS 32 2022 Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS5. Systemic Antimicrobial Therapy Antimicrobials may also be administered systemically to treat bacterial endometritis. One of the main advantages of systemic therapy is the ability to treat a mare during any stage of the estrous cycle.Treatment is not limited to estrus, which allows the duration of therapy to be extended to 10 to 14 days, and even longer if necessary. 13Theoretically, systemic antimicrobial therapy results in tissue concentra-tions within the genital tract that are comparableto those in the blood and may be a better treatment option for bacteria, 14such as Streptococci ,t h a tm a y be dormant or reside deeper in the endometrium.16 Systemic antimicrobial therapy eliminates iatrogenic contamination of the uterus during treatment and prevents the dilution or inactivation of antibioticsby intraluminal exudates. 22Systemic antimicrobial administration also reduces potential endometrialirritation and allows for treatment around thetime of insemination without risk to the sperm or changing the intrauterine environment. 13However, systemic antimicrobial administration can cause widespread disturbances in the body 's microbiome with resultant colitis and diarrhea.16,23 6. Antimicrobials Used in and have limited Gram-neg- ative activity.23,24The most common formulations used in equine reproduction include procaine penicil- lin G, potassium penicillin, ampicillin, and ticarcil- lin. Ampicillin is better able to penetrate the outer wall of Gram-negative bacteria, giving it a betterspectrum of activity against E. coli and Proteus spp. 23Ticarcillin has been shown to have good activ- ity against E. coli ,Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Proteus.13Penicillins are administered both systemi- cally and intrauterine to treat bacterial endometritisin mares. 13,24Limited studies have evaluated the use of penicillins to treat bacterial endometritis. In one study, intrauterine infusion of 3 g ampicillin diluted in 60 mL of sterile water produced endome-trial concentrations above minimum inhibitory con- centration (MIC) for Streptococcal spp. at 24 hours. 19 Ticarcillin (6 g) administered intrauterine in two different volumes of sodium chloride (250 mL vs. 60 mL) produced tissue concentrations that were higher, for a longer period, after the larger volumewas infused, likely due to slower absorption of the larger volume. Unfortunately, endometrial concen- trations of the antibiotic were only evaluated for6 hours following the infusion, and the time above MIC for common bacterial pathogens was not addressed. 25Ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid were administered intrauterine (6 g and 0.2 g, respectively, in 100 mL of saline) and intravenously (50 mg/kg ticarcillin and1.67 mg/kg concentrations ofticarcillin were higher following intrauterine adminis-t r a t i o nw h e nc o m p a r e dw i t hi n t r a v e n o u sa d m i n i s t r a -tion; however, tissue concentrations declined rapidly, leading the authors to conclude that frequent adminis- tration of ticarcillin would be necessary to maintaindrug concentrations above MIC for susceptible patho-gens. 26The authors failed to de ne what was meant by \"frequent. \"They also concluded that the addition of clavulanic acid to ticarcillin for the treatment of bacte-rial endometritis was questionable given its low concen- trations and short duration of activity in tissue fluids. Cephalosporins Cephalosporin antibiotics are commonly used to treat bacterial endometritis in the mare.13,22,24The different formulations are ceftiofur of activity againstGram-positive and some Gram-negative organ- isms. 23,24Several studies have been conducted using various ceftiofur formulations intrauterine and sys- temically to determine if the antibiotics are availableat concentrations suf cient to treat S. zooepidemicus andE. coli , the two most common pathogens involved in bacterial endometritis. Intrauterine administration of ceftiofur sodium (1 g every 24 hours) was shown to achieve appropriate en-dometrial concentrations to combat Streptococcal bacterial endometritis but often inadequate concen-trations to treat E. coli bacterial endometritis The study found that the active metabolite of ceftiofur(desfuroylceftiofur acetamide) maintained concentra- tions above MIC 90(minimum inhibitory concentration to inhibit growth in 90% of isolates) in the endome- trium for S. zooepidemicus for 24 hours following a 1-g infusion of ceftiofur sodium in mares with experimen-tally induced S. zooepidemicus endometritis. The active metabolite was able to maintain concentrationsabove MIC 90forE. coli in the endometrium of healthy mares for 48 hours but was unable to maintain MIC 90 concentrations in the endometrium of all the experi-mentally infected mares for 24 hours, leading theauthors to conclude that ceftiofur sodium (1 g intrau-terine once daily) may not be an appropriate stand-alone treatment for E. coli bacterial endometritis. 27 There is con flicting evidence whether ceftiofur sodium or ceftiofur hydrochloride administered intra-muscularly can achieve adequate endometrial concen-trations to treat common pathogens involved inbacterial endometritis. In one study, 28normal mares were administered a single intramuscular injection ofceftiofur hydrochloride at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg. Serumand endometrial concentrations of ceftiofur were maintained above the MIC for S. zooepidemicus and E. coli for 24 hours after drug administration. In a dif- ferent study, 29normal mares were administeredINFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 33ceftiofur sodium at a dose of 2 mg/kg intramuscularly every 12 hours for 5 treatments. Active metabolites ofceftiofur (desfuroylceftiofur) were not detected in theendometrium following the last treatment. When nor-mal mares were administered ceftiofur crystalline-free ofthe active acetamide) were detected above MIC for S. zooepidemicus for 96 hours following a single intramuscular injection. Repeated injections of ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (0,4, 11, and 18 days) prolonged tissue concentrationsabove MIC for S. zooepidemicus for 25 days. 30 Aminoglycosides Aminoglycosides are concentration-dependent, bacteri- cidal antimicrobials23,24that Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcal spp.24Gentamicin and amikacin are the two used aminoglycosides in equine reproduction. Genta- micin, administered intravenously at a dose of 6.6 mg/ kg, produced serum, intrauterine fluid, and endome- trial tissue concentrations that were greater than the MIC values reported for common uterine pathogensfor 24 hours. 31Gentamicin has also been shown to be an effective treatment when administered by intrau-terine infusion. Ovariectomized pony mares were administered an intrauterine infusion of 2.5 g of genta- micin (50 mL of 5% aqueous solution) for 5 days.Endometrial tissue concentrations on day 5 werehigher than the MIC for susceptible reproductive bac-teria. The authors concluded that repeated intrauter-ine treatments with gentamicin produced bactericidalconcentrations within the endometrium. 32Similarly, amikacin administered by intrauterine infusion (2 g in200 mL sterile saline) produced endometrial tissueconcentrations above MIC for 24 hours for species ofPseudomonas, E. coli ,a n d Staphylococcus . 33As t u d y by Orsini et al.34several years later corroborated these ndings and found intrauterine therapy with amika- c i nt ob es u p e r i o rt oi n t r a m u s c u l a ra d m i n i s t r a t i o n based on tissue concentrations, cost, and the risk for morbidity associated with systemic administration. Gentamicin and amikacin have an acidic pH that can be irritating to the endometrium,20and for that reason, both antimicrobials should be buffered withan equal volume of 8.4% bicarbonate to avoid irrita-tion of the endometrial lining. 13,22Aminoglycosides work best in an alkaline environment, and tissuedamage and bacterial death can decrease the uterinepH and render aminoglycosides ineffective. For thisreason, a uterine lavage should be performed prior tothe infusion of aminoglycosides. 13Practitioners often mix aminoglycosides and beta lactam antibiotics (pen-icillins) together in the same syringe for uterine infu- sion. Such practices should be discouraged because the acidic aminoglycosides can diminish the effective-ness of penicillin G (potassium Fluoroquinolones with against bacteria, including P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriacaea . used off-label in equine medicine, enro floxacin is not licensed for use in the horse in the United States.13When administered systemically at 5 mg/kg intravenously, enro floxacin reached adequate concentrations in the endome-trium to treat susceptible bacteria found in endome-tritis. 35,36A study by Ellerbrock et al.37treated pregnant and nonpregnant intravenous enrofloxacin mg/kg) and oral compounded enrofl oxa- cin (7.5 mg/kg) and found both were appropriate to treat susceptible bacteria with an MIC <0.25 mcg/mL. The authors concluded that drug dosages may need tobe adjusted with bacteria with MIC > 0.25 mcg/mL.Endometrial tissue concentrations were not assessedin the study, but the authors stated fluoroquinolones penetrate most tissues well. However, intrauterine infusion of enro floxacin is not recommended. Once daily intrauterine infusion of enrofl oxacin for 3 days caused severe, acute mucosal necrosis and signi cant endometrial brosis and inflammation. 38Intrauterine infusion of a water- based of enro floxacin (50 mL of 2.5% sus- pensionbadministered daily for 3 days caused a tran- sient in flammatory reaction in the uterus but no long- term effects. However, the concentration of the drug in the endometrium was not clear based on time oftesting. Enro floxacin is a concentration-dependent antimicrobial; therefore, the authors concluded thatdrug concentrations closer to the time of infusionm i g h tb em o r ea c c u r a t e . 39 Cipro floxacin (60 mL of 10 mg/mL solution) was infused intrauterine into mares in estrus.

Recently, it was shown that the oral administration of trimetho- prim sulfadiazine suspension (24 mg/kg q 12 hours for 5 treatments) resulted in endometrial concentrations sufcient to treat E. coli andS. zooepidemicus based MIC values.43 Tetracyclines Tetracyclines are generally bactericidal at high concentrations.23 Tetracyclines have a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but a limited spectrum of activity against common equine endometrial pathogens.44The two common for- mulations of this drug used in equine practice are oxy-tetracycline and doxycycline. Both antimicrobials are generally administered systemically. Oxytetracycline has been infused into the uterus of normal mares (6 g once daily for 3 consecutive days).Oxytetracycline concentrations in the endometrium remained above MIC for several common uterine patho- gens (E. coli ,S. zooepidemicus ,K. pneumoniae ,a n d P. aeruginosa) up to 8 hours postinfusion. Oxytetracyclineinfusion produced only transient uterine in flammation. 45 Little work has been done to evaluate the use of doxycycline to treat mares with endometritis. In onestudy, systemically administered doxycycline (10 mg/ kg, PO, q 12 h) showed that concentrations of doxycy- cline in the endometrium of normal mares may cient to treat susceptible Gram-positive pathogens (MIC0.25 mcg/mL). 46 In summary, to better understand the best prac- tice for treating bacterial endometritis, more studies are needed. Drug absorption and endometrial tissueconcentrations of antimicrobials may be affected by the route of administration, volume of infusion, anddose of the drug, as well as the in flammatory state of the uterus and even the stage of the estrous cycle. Todate, few studies have critically evaluated the ef cacy of commonly used antimicrobials in mares with bacte-rial endometritis. For now, treatment of bacterial en-dometritis should be based on culture and sensitivity.The antimicrobials used for treatment should have demonstrated ef cacy in their ability to concentrate in the endometrium at levels suf cient to combat com- mon uterine pathogens (Tables 1 and 2). Before initiat- ing intrauterine treatment for bacterial endometritis,a uterine lavage should be performed to rid the uterusof debris and bacteria. Whenever possible, nonantimi-crobial therapies should be an integral part of thetreatment for bacterial endometritis. And nally, the longstanding, indiscriminate use of postbreeding uter-ine infusions should be discouraged.

ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS 36 2022 / Vol. 68 AAEP PROCEEDINGSA Menu for Treating Postmating-Induced Endometritis: When Antimicrobials Are Not the Only Answer Ryan A. Ferris, DVM, MS, DACT Author 's address: Summit ammatory condition of the uterus, is one of the most common reproductive abnormalitiesencountered.1,2Persistent mating-induced endometri- tis refers to the accumulation and retention of in flam- matory fluid in the uterus for more than 48 hours after breeding.3-5Mares with fluid present in the uterus 48 hours after breeding are considered suscep- tible to developing postmating-induced endometritis. Mares free of in flammation 48 hours postbreeding are considered resistant to postmating-induced endome-tritis. Failure to evacuate intrauterine fluid and the inflammation that follows leads to reproductive inef - ciency and signi cant economic loss to the mare owner.6,7 Mares with PMIE typically appear normal (i.e., no intrauterine fluid is seen on ultrasound and neg- ative ndings on endometrial culture and cytology). In some mares with PMIE will build exuber-ant edema as estrus progresses. Mares at risk forPMIE are often older (>15 years of age), have poorconformation of vulva or a pendulous uterus, andhave a Kenny biopsy score of 2 or greater. 8,9A thor- ough history is often the most rewarding element ofa diagnostic workup for identifying mares prone todeveloping PMIE; mares with a history of recurring embryonic loss or failure to conceive are at a higher risk for developing PMIE.10Additionally, if a mare has developed PMIE in previous seasons, problems with fluid clearance will continue in the future. One of the key differences in differentiating PMIE from infections endometritis is that mares with PMIE have normal endometrial culture and cytology prior to breeding.10PMIE is an in flamma- tory response to the spermatozoa, not an infectiousevent. Mares being treated for PMIE typically do not require antibiotic intervention as an active infection is not present.10The use of antibiotics in the treatment of PMIE should only be considered ifthe uterus is inoculated with signi cant and known quantities of bacteria during the breeding or treat-ment period. Examples of this would be semen withhigh levels of bacteria or contamination during auterine lavage. The goal for treating mares with PMIE is to assist in clearing the in flammatory fluid from the uterine lumen and to decrease the in flammation in the endo- metrium. 10The severity of PMIE varies greatly, and every mare does not need to receive all available treatments. The veterinarian should develop a treat-ment plan for each mare that results in eliminationof intrauterine fluid by 48 hours after ovulation. NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 37INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS2. Treatment Options Removal of Inflammatory Products from the Uterus Oxytocin (10 -20 IU, IM, or IV, q 4 -6h o u r s )i st h e rst line of defense and is administered to most mares with PMIE.11-13Oxytocin induces progressive uterine contractions capable of clearing intrauterine fluid. Mares with a small volume of fluid in the uterine lumen and an open cervix may be treated successfully with oxytocin alone. Administration of greater than20 IU of oxytocin induces the myometrium to spasm and not have normal myometrial waves associated with uterine clearance.12 An alternative ecbolic agent is prostaglandin F 2a (PGF 2a), which can cause prolonged uterine contrac- tion as compared to oxytocin (5 hours vs 40 minutes,PGF 2avs oxytocin) A dosage of 250 lgc l o p r o s t e n o l sodium can be administered intramuscularly, to aid in clearance of intrauterine fluid.14-16In the author 's experience, most mares will respond to oxytocin and cloprostenol sodium similarly with effective fluid clear- ance after treatment. However, in the author' sc l i n i c a l program, there are mares that repetitively have notcleared fluid following oxytocin treatment and will effectively clear this fluid with cloprostenol sodium treatment. Administration of cloprostenol sodiumprior to ovulation can be effective at clearing uterine fluid. However, administration postovulation results in altered corpus luteum development, reduction in systemic progesterone concentrations, and reduced pregnancy rates. 16 Acupuncture, both in its traditional needle form and through electrical stimulation, has been anecdo- tally suggested to improve uterine fluid evacuation. While many of these reports appear promising, a con-trolled blinded clinical study did not show an advant-age of acupuncture in treating fluid postbreeding as compared to traditional therapies like oxytocin. 16 However, it should be noted the number of marestreated was small and the acupuncture points treated may be different between previous anecdotal evidence a n dt h i sc o n t r o l l e ds t u d y .17,18Iffluid remains follow- ing oxytocin or prostaglandin administration, or in cases of moderate to severe PMIE (>2 cm fluid depth), uterine lavage is typically performed.15Uterine la- vage removes the spermatozoa and prevents inductionof further in flammation, and also removes the in flam- matory cells and mediators from the uterine lumen. The uterus can be lavaged with either lactated Ringer' s solution or sterile physiologic saline as soon as 4 to 6 hours after breeding without adversely lower- ing pregnancy rates. 19 Recent work in 2020 compared a routine uterine lavage at either 1 hour or 4 hours after deep horn in-semination.20Pregnancy rates were found not to be different in a controlled study of normal mares.20 These ndings indicate that within 1 hour after deep horn insemination, the spermatozoa required for fer-tilization will be protected in the mare' so v i d u c t .Af o l - low-up study indicated that subfertile mares had ahigher pregnancy rate after a uterine lavage 1 hour af- ter deep horn insemination as compared to 4 hours.20 This increase in pregnancy rates may be due to removing the stimuli (spermatozoa) for continued inflammation from the uterus quickly and starting to focus on decreasing in flammation postmating. It is important to note that the suggested adjustment intime from breeding to lavage from 4 hours to 1 hour was speci cally focused on mares bred by deep horn insemination and not using a routine body insemination.20 An interesting nding associated with increased de- velopment of PMIE was stall con nement during breed- ing management.17In 1 study, mare con nement in 12 /C212 stalls during breeding management was associ- ated with up to 78% of susceptible mares accumulating fluid postbreeding.17The use of lunging at a trot for 15 minutes (6, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48 hours postmating) in the 48 hours postbreeding dramatically reduced the rate of fluid retention by 66% in susceptible mares after breeding.17Exercise, when possible, is a simple tool to aid in uterine flu i de v a c u a t i o ni nt h ep e r i o v u l a t o r y period.17 Modulation of Inflammation Dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, can be used tomodulate in flammation during the breeding process. Bucca et al21showed that administration of dexama- tho-sone (50 mg, IV, at the time of breeding) resultedin increased pregnancy rates in mares that had at least 3 risk factors for developing PMIE: abnormal reproductive history, positive endometrial culture,>2 cm endometrial fluid prior to breeding, abnormal endometrial fluid >1.5 cm, plasty, abnormalities of the reproductive tract, and postbreeding fluid persisting after 36 hours after mating. This enhancement in pregnancy rates is likely due to altering proin flammatory cytokines af- ter breeding in mares. 22As the dexamethasone is altering in flammation in abnormal mares, there is no effect on pregnancy rates when administered tonormal mares. Lower doses of dexamethasone were not shown to be as effective in reducing in flammation after breeding,23and long-term dexamethasone administration was associated with ovulation failurein some mares.24Daily administration of predniso- lone (0.1 mg/kg every 12 hours) 4 treatments before breeding and 1 treatment at the time of breeding was associated with an increase in pregnancy rates.25 The majority of nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs have resulted in lack of clinical improvement in PMIE and associated with increased incidence of anovulatory follicle formation.26,27Administration ofrocoxib, a COX-2 selective anti-in flammatory drug, was shown to modulate in flammation in mares p r o n et oP M I Ew h e na d m i n i s t e r e df r o mo v u l a t i o ninduction until 24 hours after arti cial insemination (AI). Treatment resulted in decreased migration of white blood cells into the uterine lumen and reducedINFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSinflammatory mediators. The dose of rocoxib used in this study was 0.2 mg/kg as compared to the more com- monly used dose of 0.1 mg/kg, once daily (after a singleloading dose of 0.3 mg/kg).28 Bacterial cell wall extracts have been investi- gated regarding their effects on uterine immunesystem and enhancement of pregnancy rates.While the majority of work is focused on clearanceand treatment of infectious endometritis, a studyi n2 0 1 2e v a l u a t e dt h ei m m u n er e s p o n s et os p e r m a - tozoa. Mares were treated with 1.5 mg Settle IV a 24 hours prior to insemination. Overall, a downreg- ulation of IL-1 messenger RNA was found in thispopulation of susceptible mares 6 hours after AI.22 Large-scale clinical trials showing alterations inpregnancy rates using bacterial cell wall extracts arelimited in the treatment of PMIE. Mucolytics and Chemical Curettage uncommonly, the lavage effl from mares with PMIE contains excessive quantities of mucus.29 Chronic uterine in flammation often results in produc- tion of exuberant production of mucus, which manifestsas a thick mucus layer overlying the endometrium.Mucolytic agents such as N-acetylcysteine, or focusing stopping mucous production, includ- ing dimethyl sulfoxide or kerosene, can be effects in some mares. N-acetylcysteine dis- rupts disul de bonds in mucus, making it less viscous. Infusion of 3.3% N-acetylcysteine (30 mL of a 20% solu-tion diluted in 150 mL saline solution) has been associ-ated with an increase in pregnancy rates in mares thathave excessive mucus accumulation. 30 Infusion of a 30% solution of dimethyl sulfoxide into the uterus results in improvement of biopsy grade,and treated mares tend to have an increased preg- nancy rate.31Although intrauterine infusion of kero- sene is associated with a severe endometritis and necrosis of the luminal epithelium, 50% of treatedmares with a category II or III biopsy score becamepregnant on the subsequent cycle and carried foals toterm. 32It is thought that the severe infl ammation and necrosis results in removal of mucus and exudatefrom the uterine epithelium.32Kerosene treatment typically consists of infusion of 50 to 500 mL of kero- sene undiluted into the uterus. Typically, lower vol- umes are used during diestrus and larger volumesduring estrus to account for an open vs closed cervix.Uterine lavage and ecbolics are used 12 to 18 hourslater to remove residual kerosene and debris from theuterus. 3. Platelet-Rich Plasma Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a ltrate of whole blood plasma with a high concentration of platelets. PRP contains various growth factors and cytokines that act in an anti-in flammatory manner throughout the body. This therapy has become common to reducePMIE in flammation and fluid accumulation post- breeding.33-38Common time points to use PRP are48 and 24 hours prior to breeding and 6 and 24 hours postbreeding. 4. Summary Multiple treatments have been utilized to treat PMIE in the horse. The clinician is faced with the challenge of how to select these treatment options in clinical practice. Overall, as the severity of PMIE increases,the treatments required to manage fluid retention and uterine in flammation are increased. The best approach to treating mares with PMIE is to obtain athorough history, perform serial examinations, and optimize the treatment regimen for each, individual mare.

Summary Fungal endometritis is an uncommon problem in mares and can be challenging both to diagnose and toresolve. Molds or yeasts are estimated to account forless than 7% of diagnosed endometritides. It is assumed that fungal colonization is opportunistic, developing into a clinical infection only in a chroni-cally disturbed uterine environment; pneumovagina,recalcitrant bacterial or breeding-induced endometri- tis, necrotic foci, and intrauterine antibiotic therapy have all been cited as predisposing factors. However,because the exact conditions that facilitate fungal col-onization of the uterus are not known, there is no sin-gle treatment or combination of therapies proven to offer a high likelihood of resolution. On the other hand, recent studies have examined in vitro sensitiv-ity of common fungal pathogens with the aim ofidentifying \"best choice \"antimycotic agents, and post- treatment pregnancy rates have been reported to behigher than previously assumed. Nevertheless, it isessential to augment intrauterine antimycotic ther-apy by treating for a potential reservoir of infection inthe caudal reproductive tract (vagina and clitoral fossa) and correcting any suspected predispositions (e.g., inadequate vulval seal). In the author 'se x p e r i - ence, the chronicity of fungal infection affects amena-bility to resolution, and multimodal therapy based around > 5 days of antimycotic therapy is central to successful clearance. If antimycotic treatment is notsuccessful, then a period of breeding rest, or otherstrategies to encourage the re-establishment of uter- ine and vaginal environments capable of withstand-ing fungal proliferation, can be effective. 2. Introduction Fungal endometritis is an uncommon problem in mares, with a reported incidence of 1% to 7% of diag-nosed uterine infections. 1,2The molds and yeasts most commonly detected are Aspergillus spp. andCandida spp., respectively, although a wide range of other organisms has been reported.1,3,4Most fungal organ- isms that enter the uterus probably derive from envi-ronmental sources, with the skin and feces consideredto be important potential reservoirs. Fungi have also been cultured from the urethra of stallions and are fairly common contaminants of stored or transportedsemen; 5while there are no conclusive reports of fungal endometritis as a result of mating with an infected stallion, it is important to consider the possibility of the stallion or semen as a source. Fungal endometritis is almost certainly an opportun- istic condition, relying on previous disturbance, compro- mise, or overload of the normal uterine defense mecha-nisms or a more generalized immunosuppression orcompromise. This is presumably why fungal endometri-tis is commonly associated with a history of uncorrectedpneumovagina, 6recurrent bacterial or persistent post- breeding endometritis, and/or intrauterine antibiotictherapy aimed at treating or preventing bacterial NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 41INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITISinfection.1-4,7Prolonged local antibiotic therapy has been proposed to disturb the vaginal or uterine micro- biome and disrupt the mechanisms that normally pre-vent molds or yeasts from becoming established. 6,8At present, although preliminary studies have beenreported, the normal composition of a mare' su t e r i n e microbiome has yet to be established, and it is unclearto what degree it varies between physiological and pathological states. 9Indeed, it is more likely that the problem starts within the caudal reproductive tract, where antibiotics that \"leak back \"after intrauterine infusion disturb the \"commensal \"flora, resulting in an altered vaginal pH and, possibly, the elimination of bac-teria capable of secreting antifungal substances, all of which may reduce the barrier to fungal proliferation. Indeed, it has been proposed that the molds or yeaststhat colonize the uterus are often harbored in a \"reser- voir \"in the vagina, vestibulum, and iatrogenically into the uterus during insemina-tion or other intrauterine treatments. Other factorsthought to predispose to fungal endometritis include systemic immune de ciency or endocrine disorders 1 and the presence of a necrotic focus in the uterus or va- gina, e.g., following dystocia or placental retention.10 While the response of fungal endometritis to treat- ment is often described as poor, ease of resolutionmay in part depend on coinfection with other organ-isms, the duration of infection prior to diagnosis, andthe identity of the causal organism. For example, Candida spp. have been reported to penetrate deeper into the endometrium and/or grow intracellularly, where they are more resistant to clearance by antimi-crobials administered via the intrauterine route. Bothintracellular colonization and an untreated reservoirof infection in the caudal reproductive tract are cited as explanations for the high rate of treatment failure and/or recrudescence. 1,11 3. Clinical Signs and Diagnosis Mares diagnosed with fungal endometritis are typi- cally older mares with a prolonged history of dif culty in becoming pregnant, often associated with multiple attempts to treat other uterine infections or combat inflammatory reactions. In this respect, 95/128 (74%) mares diagnosed with fungal endometritis at UtrechtUniversity during 1987 to 2001 were barren at thestart of the breeding season. 11In common with other reports, most of the mares for which the informationwas recorded also had a recent history of intrauterine antibiotic therapy (52/60: 87%) and/or pneumovagina (58/152: 35%). Other factors history of mares with fungal endometritis includedystocia or retention of the fetal membranes (18%),early embryonic death (13%), and abortion (7%). 11 Typically, mares suffering from fungal endometritis show obvious signs of uterine in flammation such as copious uterine fluid (33%)11and vaginal discharge that can vary in color (white-grey-yellow) and consis- tency (thick mucoid to watery). Freeman et al.12reported a greyish vulval discharge to be common among mares affected by fungal endometritis. Denitive diagnosis of fungal endometritis is usu- ally based on a combination of cytological examination and aerobic culture of uterine material recovered using guarded swabs, cytology brushes, or low-volumelavage. If there is a suspicion of fungal endometritis,it is important to alert the laboratory since culture onlow-pH, bacteria-inhibiting Sabouraud 'sd e x t r o s e agar will reduce the likelihood of missing molds oryeasts due to bacterial overgrowth. In addition, a cul- ture should not be declared negative for fungi until 5 days of incubation because fungal growth can bevery slow. 12Cytological examination will often, but not always, reveal signs of an ongoing infl ammation (e.g., frequent neutrophils) and may also pseudohyphae, or, less com-monly, elongated fungal hyphae (Fig. 1). Yeasts are oval to spherical in shape, are around 3 to 5 mmi n length, and typically have a surrounding capsule with al o wa f nity for dyes that, therefore, remains clear after staining. 1,4Candida albicans can easily be mis- diagnosed because cultured colonies resemble bacteriawhile, on super cial examination, a gram or Diff- Quick stained group of yeasts can be mistaken forstaphylococci. Endometrial biopsies have also beenadvocated for the diagnosis of fungal endometritis, ei-ther as a more reliable source of material for seedingculture plates 2or for investigating the likely success of treatment; fungal elements deep in the endome-trium (more reliably identi ed using Gomori 'sm e t h e - namine silver stain)4and extensive endometrial brosis, whether a predisposing cause or a result of the fungal infection, are associated with poor subse-quent fertility.10 Metabolic tests can help to better specify the iden- tity of fungal organisms, while DNA-based tests Fig. 1.

ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS 42 / Vol. 68 PROCEEDINGS(polymerase chain sequencing, whole ge- nome ampli cation) and mass spectrometry are being developed for more accurate diagnosis and discrimina-tion of fungal identity. Currently, there are still a num- ber of practical drawbacks, such as the need for prior c u l t u r et oe i t h e ri n c r e a s ef u n g a ll o a do rn a r r o wd o w n candidates on the basis of colony appearance, or costs (e.g., sequencing platforms) that have made widespread commercialization dif cult and mean that the range of fungi that can easily be detected is limited. 4. Prognosis and Treatment The prognosis for mares diagnosed with fungal endo- metritis is generally considered to be poor, either because the organisms are dif cult to eliminate or because they subsequently return. The reasons forfailure to clear fungal infections include resistance of invasive organisms to intrauterine or systemic ther-apy, inadequate duration of treatment, and failure to adequately address predisposing factors or to elimi- nate the reservoir of infective organisms in the caudal reproductive tract. On the other hand, some cases of fungal endometritis recover spontaneously or follow- ing non-speci c therapies aimed primarily at re-estab- lishing the normal flora and environment within the caudal vagina (e.g., removal of a \"bacteria, e.g., semen), presumably because this corrects the distur-bances that permitted initial fungal colonization. For this reason, attempts to resolve fungal endometritis should include correction of any suspected predisposi-tions (e.g., poor vulval closure) and treatments to clear inflammatory products and reduce the load of infec- tive organisms; e.g., large-volume uterine lavage com-bined with uterotonic drugs (e.g., oxytocin) to promote uterine emptying, with the possible adjunct of muco- lytics such as N-acetyl cysteine to remove mucus accu- mulations that may hinder access of antimicrobials to the causal organisms. Given the dif culty in resolving fungal endometri- tis, it is not surprising that many treatments havebeen tried, using either speci c antifungal agents or more general means of killing, combatting, or remov-ing the organisms. However, because it is rare for any single clinic to see large numbers of cases, few treat-ment protocols have been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Nonspeci c intrauterine treatments described anecdotally to be effective include 0.05% povidone-io-dine solution, 2% acetic acid, 6,111% to 20% dimethyl sulfoxide.4Of these, intrauterine povidone-iodine infusion should be used with caution since there are reports of overly concen- trated solutions or nonpovidone iodine causing severe endometrial damage, including brosis and adhesion formation.13Similarly, while the author commonly infuses 250 mL of 2% acetic acid into the uterus aspart of the treatment for fungal endometritis, the ace- t i ca c i di sw a s h e do u tw i t hl a c t a t e dR i n g e r 'ss o l u t i o n (LRS) 3 to 5 minutes after infusion because it causessignicant uterine irritation characterized by serousexudation and sloughing of endometrial tissue over the following 1 to 2 days. While this may sound coun- terproductive, it is possible that in the case of invasive yeasts or molds, endometrial debridement facilitatesaccess to, or removal of, the fungi. Of 33 mares treatedby uterine infusion of 2% acetic acid for 1 to 3 consecu-tive days, 11 were cleared of fungal infection (33% ofmares; 22% of 49 treatment cycles). 11 The speci c antifungal agents are divided into two major classes: the polyenes and the imidazoles, wherethe former are all examples of imidazoles.4,14If available, antimycotic susceptibility screening can aidin the selection of an appropriate antifungal.1If not, antimycotic selection can be based on availability of asuitable formulation, supported by the report that thein vitro sensitivity of 69 fungi isolated from the uterus of mares and tested at Cornell University was 100% to nystatin, 96% candidacidals, and because they workmore effectively in an acid environment, acetic acid la-vage prior to the onset of treatment may be advanta-geous. 1,11With respect to the route of administration, systemic administration of antifungals generallyrequires long periods of treatment (weeks) and isassociated with high costs and signi cant side effects, not least because many are poorly absorbedfrom the gastrointestinal tract. Fluconazole is a no-table exception since it is relatively inexpensiveand has good gastrointestinal availability, and ithas therefore been proposed as the drug of choicefor systemic (oral) therapy, starting from the onsetof estrus and continuing until 2 days after ovula- tion; 4however, recurrence of infection after fluco- nazole treatment is reported to be common. The author prefers intrauterine administration of antifungals, starting as early as possible in estrus to allow a long duration of treatment (> 5 days) in the pe-riod that the uterus is endocrinologically primed toclear infection most effectively. Suggested drugs anddoses for daily intrauterine treatment of fungal or yeastendometritis include nystatin (0.5- 2.5 million units), amphotericin B (100 -200 mg), fluconazole (100 mg), and clotrimazole (500 -700 mg). 7While the response to ther- apy is anecdotally considered to be disappointing, it ispossible that this in part relates to short-lasting orintermittent periods of administration. In a clinical trialin which the experimental imidazole, parconazole, wasinfused daily for 6 or 10 days into the uterus of maressuffering from fungal endometritis at Utrecht University, the causal agent was eliminated from 27 of 81 mares treated at 135 cycles (i.e., 33% ofmares and 20% of treatment cycles), whereas shorter(2-3 day) treatment durations were invariably ineffec- tive. 11In the author 's experience, 5 consecutive days of intrauterine nystatin infusion offers a similar like-lihood of resolution (20% of treated cycles). Based onthe above experiences, current fungal endometritisINFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 43treatment protocol involves a single 250-mL infusion of 2% acetic acid, which is flushed out with 3 L of LRS within 5 minutes, followed by intrauterine infusion of50 mL of a 10-mg/mL clotrimazole solution. Clotrima-zole infusion is repeated for 6 consecutive days, after rst removing any accumulated fluid by lavage with LRS, and is combined with daily topical application of clotrimazole cream to the vagina and clitoris. Initialresults are promising, and recently, Nielsen et al. 2 reported pregnancy in 24/50 mares (48%) treated forfungal endometritis using 3 consecutive days uter-ine lavage with saline followed by the introduc-tion clotrimazole tablet. In the early 2000s, lufenuron, the benzoylphenyl urea derivative used for flea control in dogs and cats, was popular for treating fungal endometritis inmares, based on a report of the successful resolution of fungal endometritis in 4 mares treated with a sin- gle intrauterine administration of 540 mg of lufe-nuron. 15The rationale for this treatment centered on t h ef a c tt h a tl u f e n u r o n 's primary anti-insecticidal property is the ability to interfere with chitin biosyn-thesis. Since fungi also incorporate chitin into theircell walls, it was proposed that lufenuron might in-hibit fungal growth. However, fungal endometritiswas not cleared in any of 3 mares treated with 540 mg o fl u f e n u r o ni nt h ea u t h o r 's clinic, and subsequent studies have failed to demonstrate any in vitro anti- fungal activity of lufenuron (e.g., against Aspergillus 16such that it is unclear whether lufenuron, or other chitin synthesis inhibitors, areeffective in the treatment of fungal infections in theuterus of mares or in other situations. As indicated above, an important adjunct to intrau- terine antifungal treatment is topical treatment of the vagina and clitoris (e.g., with clotrimazole cream) toremove any reservoir of organisms that might other-wise lead to reinfection. Two further observationsworthy of mention are the following: (1) The clearanceof uterine fungal infection has been noted in a handfulof mares allowed a prolonged period of breeding rest (months) following apparently unsuccessful antifun- gal treatment. It is possible that a combination ofreducing the number of infectious organisms by treat-ment combined with a long period of rest to encouragerestoration of the normal vaginal microenvironmentwas suf cient to facilitate \"spontaneous \"clearance. (2) Although there is clearly a concern that the bacteriamay mask the continuing presence of fungi, the post-treatment streptococcal infection often appears to be anindicator of successful fungal elimination. Moreover, the streptococcal infection is readily resolved by intrau- terine antibiotic treatment, which does not appear toretrigger the fungal infection.5. Conclusions Fungal endometritis is an uncommon problem that can be challenging to resolve. At present, a combina- tion of nonspeci c therapy with 2% acetic acid or 1% to 3% hydrogen peroxide and/or > 5 days intrauterinetherapy a c antifungal agent best chance (20% -50%) of resolving the fungal infection and establishing pregnancy. While contem- poraneous correction of any anatomical abnormalities and treating a potential reservoir of infection in the caudal reproductive tract or correcting any general- ized immune compromise may reduce the risk of rein- fection, a second estrus may be required to complete elimination of the fungus or to resolve a subsequent bacterial endometritis. Signi cant improvements in therapy are likely to require a clearer understanding of the conditions that permit the establishment and maintenance of fungal infection in the mare 'su t e r u s .

It is also important to note that many susceptible maresalready have an adverse environment (i.e., uterine fluid accumulation and endometrial in flammation) even before breeding, which can be harmful to the sperm. Therefore, therapies to mitigate endometrial inflammation and improve the uterine environ- ment are required to improve the fertility rates of susceptible mares. Traditionally, therapies for endometritis have included ecbolic agents (i.e., oxytocin, prostaglandin), uterine lav-ages, anti-in flammatories, and antibiotics. 3However,some mares, particularly aged mares, fail to respond to traditional therapies. As a result, alternative treat-ments have been developed to improve fertility ratesi nm a r e sw i t he n d o m e t r i t i st h a ti sd i f cult to resolve. Biologic agents, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP), autologous conditioned serum (ACS), mesenchymalstem cells (MSC), and the MSC-conditioned medium(MSC-CM) have become prominent therapies inhuman and veterinary medicine. In the last ten years,these therapies have been tested and used to treatmares with endometritis with promising results. 8-15 This manuscript provides an overview of biologicalagents that can be used to treat mares with endome-tritis and how each one of them can be helpful inbroodmare practice. 2. Methods Platelet-Rich Plasma Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become a popular ther- apy to treat mares that fail to become pregnant due touterine problems. PRP mitigates post-breeding in flam- matory response9,11- 15and reduces the risk of uterine infections,9which makes the PRP a good alternative to treat mares with endometritis. Platelet-rich plasma is a fractionate of whole blood plasma with high platelet concentration. The platelets NOTES 46 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSINFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITISare cytoplasmatic fragments of the megakaryocytes that carry numerous growth factors (e.g., vascular en- dothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor b), cytokines (e.g., TNF- aand CLX8), These growth factors, cytokines, and anti- microbial peptides are released after platelet activation and act in an anti-in flammatory matter. Even though the mechanisms of PRP to mitigate in flammation are not yet well elucidated, the suppression of in flamma- tory markers (e.g., COX-2, metalloproteinase-3, TNF- a, IL1b, IL6, CXCL8) has been described in several in vitro studies,16-18as well as in mares treated with intrauterine infusion of PRP.9,13In addition, PRP has demonstrated antimicrobial activity against microor-ganisms-causing endometritis19-21and reduced post- breeding uterine infections in mares susceptible toendometritis.9 Many protocols can be used to produce PRP.22Auto- mated commercial and manual protocols have beendescribed. These protocols differ in time to prepare, costs, practicality, volume of blood needed, and materi- als required for processing. Therefore, the protocol used will depend on the practitioner 's choice. In addition, variations of PRP quality can be observed between practitioners, methods, and animals. Although not all t h ep r o t o c o l sa v a i l a b l et op r o d u c eP R Pw i l lb eo v e r - viewed in this study, the authors will comment on the most commonly used and proposed therapies in mares. Additional protocols can be reviewed in other manu- scripts.22,23In addition, a commercially available ly- ophilized PRPahas been recently described for use in broodmare practice.24 Many clinicians have employed protocols using vacutainer tubes or blood transfusion bags to producePRP with good results for intrauterine infusion in mares. The vacutainer tubes protocol is the most com- monly used in the eld. Using this protocol, blood is collected in 4.5 mL vacutainer tubes containing 3.2%sodium citrate to produce PRP. Blood tubes are centri- fuged at 120 /C2g for 10 min. After centrifugation, the top third layer of the plasma is discarded, while theremaining plasma adjacent to the buffy coat is recov- ered as PRP (Fig. 1). The amount of blood collected toproduce PRP by this method depends on the practi- tioner 's choice or the number of tubes placed in the centrifuge. To produce PRP using a blood transfusion bag, blood is collected in a 450 mL blood transfusion bag contain- ing 63 mL of citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution with adenine as an anticoagulant (CPD-A). Four hundred milliliters of whole blood are split into eight 50-mL tubes and centrifuged at 400 /C2gfor 15 min. After the rst centrifugation, the plasma fraction is recovered and transferred into 15-mL conical tubes. This fraction is submitted to centrifugation at 1000 /C2gfor 10 min. After the second centrifugation, 2.5 mL of plasma atthe bottom of each tube is preserved as PRP (Fig. 1). This method produces around 40 to 50 mL of PRP for intrauterine infusion.Practitioners have recently described another proto- col that involves harvesting blood in a 60 mL syringe prelled with 7 mL of CPD-A. The mixed-blood is transferred to a 50-mL falcon tube and centrifuged at400/C2gfor 15 min. After centrifugation, the whole plasma fraction ( ;30 mL) is used for intrauterine infu- sion (Fig. 1). Many different protocols to obtain PRP have been used to treat mares with uterine problems. The number of treatments, the time that therapy was implemented, and the volume of PRP used for intrauterine infusion varies between studies. 9,11-15,24 Independent of these differences, PRP therapy wasable to reduce uterine in flammatory markers and improve the fertility rates of mares in all reports.9,11- 15,24 Results of PRP therapy in mares are highlighted in Table 1. In one of the authors 'studies,9mares received four uterine infusions of PRP (Fig. 2). In this study, thetreatments were performed 48 and 24 h before and six and 24 h after breeding. The authors observed a sig- nicant bene t of those treatments in mitigating endometrial in flammation and uterine infections. However, implementing four treatments can be timing-consuming and expensive. Therefore, some practitioners have chosen only one or two treat- ments in a cycle to employ PRP therapy, as reported in other studies.11-15In the author's experience, the best time to infuse PRP in mares to improve theuterine environment, mitigate post-breeding in flam- mation, and increase the chances of a mare becom-ing pregnant are 24 h before and 4-6 h after breeding. Practitioners can modify the protocol tobestt their practice. 3. Platelet Lysate Platelet lysate (PL) is derived from freeze-thawing PRP. The PL contains all growth factors and cyto- kines released by the platelets after activation.25,26 Platelets are activated during cryopreservation, andthe bioactive molecules released during this process are preserved in the PL.25,26An advantage of PL com- pared to PRP is that this platelet-derived product can be frozen and stored long-term, making it available for immediate patient use. The processing of PL is simple. After PRP is obtained, it is diluted with platelet-poor plasma (PPP)obtained during the processing protocol to bring a nal volume of 10 to 20 mL. Thereafter, the PRP alone or the PRP+PPP should be frozen at /C080\u00b0C. The freezing process will cause platelet disruption/activa- tion, and the PL containing platelet-released growth factors will be obtained.27P Lc a nb ef r o z e ns t o r e d until needed. Before intrauterine infusion, PL mustbe at room temperature (20-25\u00b0C). Of interest, this therapy has been recently implemented to treat horses with osteoarthritis injuries.28,29In a recent report, PL reduced PMN counts, intrauterine fluid accumulation, and edema score of mares susceptible to endometritis after breeding.30Results of mares treated with PL are highlighted in Table 1.INFLAMMATION, INFECTION, OR BOTH? ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS AAEP PROCEEDINGS Vol. 2022 474. Autologous Conditioned Serum Autologous conditioned serum (ACS) is whole serum- containing elevated concentration of anti-in flammatory cytokines and growth factors such as IL-1R a,T G F b, FGF-2, and IL-10.31There are two commercially avail- a b l em e t h o d st op r o d u c eA C S ,t h eI R A Pb,a n dI R A P IIc. These methods consist of stimulating white blood cells, most speci cally the monocytes, to secrete anti- inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. The mono- cytes are stimulated to produce regenerative and anti- inflammatory proteins without adding drugs. For this, the whole blood is incubated with sterile borosilicateglass beads for 24 h serum-containing II produced a better anti-in flammatory cytokine pro le than IRAP in the horse. 31Autologous conditioned serum has been used to treat various musculoskeletal conditions in both humans and horses.32-34In one study, ACS (IRAP II) was tested for intrauterine infusion in normal mares.10The primary nding was a reduction in the neutrophil counts in en- dometrial cytology after sperm challenge was observed.(Table 1). Further studies are needed to address theeffect of ACS in mares susceptible to endometritis. 5. Mesenchymal Stem Cells Stem cells have been used to treat many human and veterinary medicine conditions due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. These cells have the ability to differentiate into dif- ferent lineages (e.g., skeletal myoblasts, cells, and endometrial cells.35,36 Fig. 1.

Inaddition, embryonic stem cells have been associatedwith tumorigenesis potential. mes- enchymal stem cells (MSCs) problematic.Mesenchymal stromal cells that canexhibit multilineage differentiation. MSCs canbe isolated from various tissues, such as bone mar-row, fatty tissue, dental pulp, umbilical cord, amni-otic membrane, endometrium, menses blood, andmore. 39,40 The ability to cultivate and isolate MSCs in vitro is a distinct advantage of this therapy in both humanand veterinary medicine.39,40In equine medicine, bone marrow and adipose are the most commonlyused sources of stem cells41,42and have been used as regenerative therapy in treatment of cartilage andtendinous tissue. 43,44Although stem cells have not yet been employed to treat uterine problems in mares,some studies have reported promising results usingstem cells in the injured endometrium and also for mod-ulation of endometrial in flammation. 10,45,46 Because of the regenerative potential of stem cells, this therapy has been employed to treat injured tis-sues that have complex regeneration. Regenerationof the endometrium has been indicated in one studyusing rats as an experimental model treated withstem cells. 47In mares suffering from CDE, intrauter- ine infusion of MSCS therapy may induce early(7 days) and prolonged (60 days) remodeling of theendometrium and promote glandular epithelial cellsproliferation. 46Preliminary results of one of the authors 'studies have demonstrated that endoscopic endometrial injections of MSCs may endome-trial brosis and the endometrial biopsy score 48of mares suffering from CDE. For endome- trial injection of MSCs, a flexible endoscope and injection needles coupled to a Te flon catheter are used. Mares are restrained in an examination stockand sedated (e.g., xylazine or detomidine). The endo- scope is passed manually through the vagina andcervix, and then the uterus is insuf flated with air to allow visualization of the entire endometrial surface.Injections of 0.5 mL of the MSCs solution are per-formed following a horizontal line from the extremity of one uterine horn to the other (Fig. 3). The amount of MSCs used for this therapy depends on the practi- tioner 's choice. The authors suggest a concentration between 12 to 20 million cells for endometrial injections. 49 Although there is a lack of information on MSCs therapy aiming to treat endometritis in mares, thistherapy has been reported to decrease neutrophil numbers and increase anti-in flammatory ILRN expression in normal mares.10Despite the regenera- tive potential of MSCs, these cells also a widerange of bioactive molecules (PGE2, TGF b, IL-10, IL- 1 R a ,C X L 8 ,H G F ,a n di N O S ) ,w h i c hc a nd r i v et h emodulation of the in flammatory process.50-52The immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs has been reported to treat acute and chronic in flammation53and has been successfully used to treat infl ammatory conditions in horses (e.g., osteoarthritis, tendinitis, and tendon and ligament injuries).54,55These data demonstrate the potential of stem cells therapy to treat uterine diseases Fig. 2.

Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Conditioned Medium Mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (MSC- CM) is the culture medium used for in vitro stem cells culture and growth. MSCs secrete a wide range of paracrine signaling molecules, such as cytokines, che-mokines molecules which modu-late in flammation and tissue repair.56-58Although the employment of MSC-CM as therapy is relativelynew, some reports have already shown the immunore-gulatory capacity of this therapy in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions in a variety of species, 59,60 including horses.61 In a recent study,8MSC-CM mitigated the endome- trial in flammatory response in mares susceptible to endometritis. After breeding, mares treated with MSC-CM had reduced intrauterine fluid accumula- tion and IL10 inthe uterus of susceptible mares. Although fertilityrates were not statistically affected in that study, a numerical increment was observed. A small number of animals was used in this study which may havecontributed to lack of difference in pregnancy rates. Inar e c e n ts t u d y d, intrauterine infusion of MSC-CM was used to treat barren mares (n = 8) (data non- published). In flammatory markers (e.g., neutrophils, cytokines, and intrauterine fluid accumulation) were downregulated by MSC-CM therapy. However, MSC- CM did not reduce uterine infections or improve thefertility of barren mares. Data of MSC-CM treatment in broodmare practice are highlighted in Table 1. Although much more must be explored in MSC-CM therapy before the treatment is implemented in equine practice, the authors 'results encourage the use of this therapy to treat uterine in flammatory con- ditions in mares. In addition, MSC-CM has the bene t in that it is not a cell suspension and can therefore beeasily manufactured, lyophilized, stored, and trans-ported. Moreover, MSC-CM does not require tests todetermine compatibility with possible recipients, thus avoiding potential rejection. 58,61Further studies are needed to evaluate and understand the effect of MSC- CM therapy in barren mare 's practice. 7. Discussion Endometritis in mares has been traditionally treated with multi-modal therapies.3These thera- pies consist of the use of ecbolic drugs (e.g., oxytocin, prostaglandin), uterine lavage, mucolytic and antisep-tic agents, anti-in flammatory drugs, and antibiotics. However, some mares fail to respond to traditionaltherapies, and alternative treatments have beenresearched for those mares. The increasing incidenceof antibiotic-resistant microorganisms increases the necessity of alternatives. 3,4 Among the biologic therapies, PRP has been tested the most and has been used in the practice.9,11- 15 Besides the ability to mitigate the post-breedinginflammation in mares susceptible to endometritis, PRP has also been described to reduce the risk of uter-ine infections in susceptible mares. 9In vitro studies have described the antimicrobial potential of PRP,even against some bacteria causing endometritis inmares 19,20,62,63Most impor- to treat mares hasimproved fertility rates.9,11- 15All these facts have made PRP gain popularity in equine reproductivepractice. In addition, other types of platelet-derivedproducts, such as PL and a commercially available ly-ophilized PRP, 1have been tested with success on the treatment of mares suffering from endometritis.24,30 Therefore, platelet-derived therapies can be consid-ered an ef cient therapy for broodmare practice. While other biologic therapies (e.g., ACS, MSCs, MSC-CM) have not been tested for antimicrobial prop-erties in mares, all of them have proven to reduce theuterine infl ammatory reaction after sperm challenge in mares. 8,10Although not all these therapies have been tested in mares susceptible to endometritis but theMSC-CM, they might be helpful approaches to controlthe exacerbated endometrial in flammation in this cate- gory of mares. The uterine in flammatory response in susceptible mares starts even before the sperm chal-lenge. Mares susceptible to endometritis have animbalance in the flammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1 b,I L 6 ,C X C L 8 , and TNF a) upregulated in the endometrium even before contact with antigens (sperm or bacteria).64,65In addition, these mares are unable to produce suf cient anti-in flammatory cytokines (e.g., IL10 and IL1R a), which delays the resolution of the in flammatory process.64,66As a result, an exacerbated and delayed inflammatory reaction with a high in flux of in flamma- tory cells into the uterine lumen causes intrauterinefluid accumulation, which produces a hostile uterine environment.6In one study testing intrauterine ther- apy with MSCs and ACS 24 h before breedings, theauthors observed a reduction in in flammatory markers but not a reduction in intrauterine fluid accumulation after sperm challenging in mares.10Fertility was not tested in that study. However, the results reported inthe mentioned study are encouraging since only maresconsidered normal were enrolled. 10Mares considered normal or resistant to endometritis do not present exa-cerbated and delayed post-breeding in flammatory reaction;65so they are not prone to changes using immunomodulatory therapies.8,64,67Therefore, the results described by the authors10encourage research with ACS and MSCs in mares susceptible to endome-tritis.

ROOT CAUSES OF ENDOMETRITIS a-smooth development of pathological brosis in the horse endometrium.45,46 Preliminary results of the authors 'group demonstrate that MSCs may improve the endometrial score of mares suffering from CDE.68Moreover, in rats as an experi- mental model, MSCs regulated in flamma- receptivity (integrinagb3 and leukemia inhibitory factor). 47It is well known that mares with a higher grade of endometrial brosis are more prone to develop endometritis and have fewerchances to carry a pregnancy to term. 48Therefore, MSCs might have a potential application in mares withCDE and must be further explored. Of interest, theMSC-CM has shown potential to mitigate post-in flam- matory response in mares susceptible to endometritis. 8 In this study, the intrauterine infusion of MSC-CM,before breeding or mixed with semen, increased intrau-terine expression of IL10, and reduced post-breedingintrauterine fluid accumulation, endometrial PMNs counts, and uterine expression of IL6 in mares suscepti-ble to endometritis. Although fertility rates were notchanged in the study, a positive numerical difference(2-fold) could be observed after MSC-CM therapy. In addition, it was interesting that MSC-CM was not harmful to the sperm when semen was supple-mented with MSC-CM, which opens an alternativefor the time of treatment using this therapy. Anotherimportant bene t of MSC-CM is that it is not a cell suspension; therefore, it does not require tests todetermine compatibility with possible recipients. 58,61 Moreover, MSC-CM can be frozen or manufactured,lyophilized, packaged, and transported, which makesthis therapy available more quickly than others (e.g.,PRP, MSCs, ACS) for immediate application. In summary, biologic therapies provide an excel- lent treatment for alleviating post-breeding in flam- mation in mares. The regulation of the in flammatory factors and the in flammatory process create a better uterine environment both for the sperm and theembryo entering the uterus. Although much moremust be explored in biological therapies to treat uter-ine problems in mares, the evidence so far is en-couraging.

Introduction While the collection of whole blood and nasal secre- tions from horses with clinical disease for themolecular testing of equine herpesvirus (EHV)-1 isconsidered the diagnostic gold standard and is welljustied by all stakeholders, the testing in contact horses is sometimes dif cult to justify, mostly because of the owners 'perception that nasal swabs are invasive and cause momentary discomfort. Thepurpose of this study was to explore sampling optionsfor a reliable and logistically more feasible protocolduring a large EHV-1 outbreak. 2. Materials and Methods Seventeen horses with clinical infection as well as 19healthy herdmates, all part of an equine herpesvirusmyeloencephalopathy (EHM) outbreak, were enrolledin the study. Following owners 'consent for study enrollment, each horse was sampled 2 to 4 times ati n t e r v a l so f2t o6 d a y sd u r i n gt h eo u t b r e a k .A l ls a m -ples were collected using 6-in. rayon-tipped swabs.Nasal secretions were used as the gold standard sam-ple type. Additional samples, including swabs from themuzzle/nares, swabs from the front limbs, rectal swabs,swabs of the feed bin, and swabs of the water trough,were collected as well. All swabs were tested for thepresence of EHV-1 by quantitative polymerase chainreaction (qPCR), targeting the gBandORF 30 gene. 3.

For horses with clinical infection, EHV-1 was detected in 31 nasal swabs, 30 muzzle/nares swabs,7 front limb swabs, 7 feeders, 6 water troughs, and 6rectal swabs. Not all positive muzzle/nares swabs corre-lated with a positive nasal swab from the same set,but all other positive swabs did correlate with a positivenasal swab in their respective set. The agreementbetween nasal swabs and muzzle/nares swabs was74%. Agreement between nasal swabs and the other 4swab types was low.

Introduction While horses are apparently susceptible to SARS- CoV-2 infection based on the homology between thehuman and the equine ACE-2 receptor, no clinical orsubclinical infection has yet been reported in theequine species. The aims of the present study were todetermine if SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in nasalsecretions of equids with acute onset of fever and re-spiratory signs using quantitative polymerase chainreaction (qPCR) and to investigate the seroprevalenceagainst SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of healthy racingh o r s e sw i t hp o s s i b l ee x p o s u r et oh u m a n sw i t hS A R S -CoV-2 infection.2. Materials and Methods To investigate the possible clinical role of SARS-CoV-2 in equids, nasal secretions from 667 horses withacute onset of fever and respiratory signs were testedfor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR. The sam-ples were collected from January to December of 2020and submitted to a commercial molecular diagnosticlaboratory for the detection of common respiratorypathogens (equine in fluenza virus, equine herpesvi- rus types equine A and B viruses,Streptococcus equi subspecies equi). Additional serum samples from a separate cohort of healthy horseswere tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using an Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 60 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE I: DRUGS, DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, AND DISASTERSenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay targeting the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The se- rum samples were collected in 2020 from a cohort of 587 racing Thoroughbreds in California after track personnel tested qPCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. 3. Results and Discussion While 241/667 (36%) equids with fever and respira- tory signs tested qPCR-positive for at least one of the common respiratory pathogens, not a single horse tested qPCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Amongst thehealthy racing Thoroughbreds, 35/587 (5.9%) horses had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Similar to dogs and cats, horses do not seem to develop clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, horses may act as in- cidental host and experience silent infection following spillover from humans with COVID-19.Acknowledgments Funding Sources This study was funded by an Advancement in Equine Research Award from Boehringer Ingelheim AnimalHealth and by the Center for Equine Health, Schoolof Veterinary Medicine, University of California,Davis, with additional contributions from public andprivate donors.

Introduction The addition of calcium to resuscitation fluids is a common practice even though studies evaluating the effects of calcium have been performed primarily inhealthy horses. This study tested the hypothesis that intravenous calcium administration will affect heart rate, gastrointestinal sounds, and electrolytes in met-abolically unstable endurance horses. 2. Materials and Methods Sixteen endurance horses eliminated from a 100-mile (161-km) endurance ride that required intravenous fluid therapy were enrolled. Horses were randomly assigned to receive 0.4 mg/kg/minute of calcium (23% calcium glu-conate) over approximately 1 hour diluted in 10 L of anon-calcium-containing isotonic crystalloid or 10 L of a non-calcium-containing isotonic crystalloid. Biochemistry proles were determined on blood samples collected before and after treatment. Physical examinations wereperformed before and after treatment where gastrointesti- nal sounds were de ned as 0 (absent), 1 (diminished), or 2 (normal). Heart rate was recorded every 15 minutes. Data were compared using 2-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. 3. Results Calcium administration was associated with lower heart rates 45 minutes after starting the infusion ( p= 0.002) but less improvement in gastrointestinal sounds com-pared controls ( p= plasma phosphorous concentration ( a decrease in muscle enzyme activity (creatine kinase, aspartatet r a n s a m i n a s e )w e r ea l s oo b s e r v e d( p\u00bc0.046). 4.

Introduction Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly labile and delayed processing might alter analysis results. The objective of this study was to determine effects of time andaddition of autologous serum on CSF analysis results. 2. Methods Ten adult horses were used in this prospectivestudy. CSF samples were collected from all immedi-ately after euthanasia. Serum was collected beforeeuthanasia. Samples were divided into 15 aliquots(2 mL each); 1 aliquot was submitted for CSF anal-ysis within 60 minutes of collection. In 7 aliquots, 4drops of autologous serum (200 mL) were added and stored at 4\u00b0C (serum group); the remaining 7 werestored unaltered at 4\u00b0C (control group).

Equines do not actually sink like shown in movies; they \"float\"on the surface of most mud environments. Literally thousands of images can be pulled up on internet searches of horses entrapped in a variety of scenarios and positions. The purpose of this article is to suggest how to respond to a call that a horse is \"stuck in mud \"and to provide guidelines and best practices to assist the responding equine veterinarian to function in an ef cient, effective, and safe manner to direct equine extrication from a mud entrapment scenario. Modern techniques for manip-ulation of entrapped horses place emphasis on the use of common tools, flat and looped webbing, occasional specialized equipment, and proper positioning of a team of personnel to achieve effectiveresults for various mud rescue situations encountered in a practitioner 's daily work. Note: Methodology and procedures for equine eld medicine, rst aid treatment, and eld euthanasia as of- ten required on scene are well covered in other sources and thus will not be addressed in detail here.Author 's address: Technical Large Animal Emergency Rescue, Inc., 1787 GA Highway 18 E, Macon, GA 31217; e-mail: delphiacres@hotmail.com. \u00a92022 AAEP. 1. Introduction It is important for the veterinarian and their staff to be a b l et od i r e c tt h es a f e ,e f cient, and effective extrica- tion of equines from mud entrapment (Fig. 1). Successdepends on the veterinarian 's ability to interact with other responders while utilizing appropriate equip-ment and techniques to extricate the animal. Majorsafety concerns are inherent to mud and water scenar-ios (hypothermia, crush syndrome, drowning, \"vac- uum\" effect of mud), and well-intentioned responders have been injured or crushed by struggling horses inmud situations 1and even killed by their own horse in such scenarios.2Responders prepare for two scenarios \u2014owners/bystanders that might be involved or injuredand an equine patient that is medically stressed, trapped, potentially injured, and unpredictable. From the Horse 's Perspective Entrapment in mud is very different from whathumans perceive it to be. Horses that appear to be lyingcalmly are actually very stressed and have been strug- gling to self-rescue, sometimes for hours. Recumbent or trapped horses often lie quietly for a few minutes due toexhaustion, but their instinct is \"a down horse is a dead horse \"; they will usually struggle intermittently. They do not comprehend that arriving humans are there toassist; instead, they interpret new noises and activity as threats to their survival and may panic and struggle harder. Thus, safe manipulation of horses from mud NOTES 68 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE I: DRUGS, DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, AND DISASTERSentrapment requires knowledge of behavior and anat- omy to prevent injury when placing webbing or slings,2 as well as proper personnel positioning (Table 1). Successful responses to mud rescue scenarios are intimately tied to a practitioner 'se x p e r t i s ea n da d v i c e . Every entrapment is different, and thus there is no standard operating procedure that can be applied to ev- ery situation. However, best practices in equine techni-cal rescue do exist for safer, more ef cient approaches to these scenarios. (Note: \"Best practices \"refers to pro- cedures that produce superior results in particulart y p e so fs i t u a t i o n sa n dc o n s t a n t l ye v o l v eb a s e do n knowledge and technology available at the time.) S l i d e s ,d r a g s ,v e r t i c a ll i f t s ,a n da s s i s t sa r eb a s i ct ot e c h -nical large animal emergency rescue\u2014 a specialty type of heavy rescue for some re and rescue emergency response services. Callouts of emergency respondersfor equine mud entrapment frequently result in a request for a local veterinarian through dispatch at the local 911 center. In this article, it is assumed the veteri-narian is responding (Fig. 2) and wants to proceed withan effective plan for extrication. Example 1: Dr. Erica Koch gets an evening call from 911 dispatch and the horse owner requesting as-sistance for a mud rescue of a horse trapped for severalhours about a half mile (1 km) from the trailhead (December 2020). She deployed to the parking lot and was assisted by re/rescue personnel to hike to the actual location of the animal (off trail, laterally recum-bent in thick, wet mud and chunks of ice, getting darkand below freezing temperatures). After providingtreatment in situ, the animal was manually manipu- lated with webbing out of the mud onto a tarp, and the tarp was dragged to flat ground where the animal stood and walked to the trailhead, where it was loadedinto a trailer and delivered to Dr. Koch 's clinic for fol- low-up care (hypothermic and dehydrated). Example 2: The owner was riding along the Columbia Riverbank, Washington when the horse slipped into the mud (Fig. 3). She called 911 for assis- tance, and they reached out to a local technical largeanimal emergency rescue (TLAER) team to resp-ond to the location. Meanwhile, the owner discussedoptions with the TLAER team leader, who suggested they give the animal room to move and stop pulling on the head. The owner let the horse relax, and it self- extricated a few minutes later before the arrival of deploying rst responders. 2. Understanding the Problem Mud entrapment is fundamentally a small surface area problem. Equines have a much greater weight on a tiny surface area of their hooves and long legs \u2014like a large drum walking on toothpicks. Thus, they easilyflounder into unstable ground where a human can stand (Fig. 4). Based on the fluid physics, the less an animal moves, the easier it is to extricate as struggling causes a dewa-tering \"vacuum effect, \"creating suction around the extremities as the particles of sand and soil pack around them. Since horses do not understand \"Stop struggling! \"like humans would be ordered to do, dis- traction with hay or grass may be attempted. As they become more exhausted and depressed, horses stopstruggling, and their medical condition deteriorates as hypothermia and crush syndrome become more likely. Equines do not sink like shown in movies \u2014they actually \"float\"on the surface of most mud environ- ments due to their large lungs and gaseous intestinal production. Upon arrival to the scene, they will tend to have their head and neck and 6 to 12 inches of topline and hindquarters out of the mud, with their nostrils flaring due to desperate efforts to escape (Fig. 5). Pressure applied to the chest and abdomen of a horse (especially by mud, also by webbing or slings) causes a physiological response (squeeze or sulk) that minimizes effort to struggle, resulting in diminishedefforts by the animal to get up, especially if excite- ment is managed well by the animal handler. This physical \"sedative effect \"has been utilized by farriers, veterinarians, and horsemen throughout history to cause horses to become quiescent for various proce- dures. However, it is dangerous to personnel when the pressure is relieved; the horse may give an explo- sive effort or reactions \u2014be ready to step back. Fig. 1. Mud entrapment presents signi cant challenges to responding equine veterinarians including egress/access, personal safety, interactions with other emergency responders, and eld conditions for handling and treatment of the horse(s). Left photo \u2014Initial efforts using the saddle as a pulling point was a good strategy for a pilot line, but the leather failed, and that position on the dia- phragm causes panic in the horse. Right photo \u2014As more responders arrived with ground pads of plywood, a simple forward assist was employed to pull the exhausted horse to solid ground. Note that the head should be lifted to protect the eye; both the head andthe tail should not be used as pulling points.

Digging is not recom- mended except in a few cases of very dry soil or tomove obstacles blocking the path of extrication. Takecontrol and tell responders to stop digging by hand orwith machinery while a plan is made (Fig. 6) to get webbing around the abdomen and chest of the equine for a forward assist, sideways slide, or vertical liftmanipulation. Simultaneously, a path should be cre-ated for extrication. When manipulated out of entrapment onto flat ground and then allowed into sternal recumbency, most horses will rise and stand on their own whenthey are ready. Thus, facilitating self-rescue with assists or drags/slides is a best practice that prevents the practitioner from having to use more complicatedslings and vertical lifts (except when animals are belowground such as in a well or hole in mud). Horses insome scenarios may have special medical concernssuch as severe injuries, stress, shock, hyper or hypo-thermia, dehydration, crush syndrome, and/or exhaus- tion and may require intensive medical intervention. Time course of the rescue is often very long measured from when the animal went into the mud; techniques and tools that make responses more ef cient are pre- ferred. By the time it is recognized by the owner or other people, 911 services are called out, they call theveterinarian, and upon arrival, several hours usuallyhave passed, and the animal is medically becoming more delicate by the moment. Practitioners should involve 911 personnel from the very beginning (mud ina paddock, trail ride emergency, septic tank, deep well,out on the mud flats, etc.) because it speeds up the over- all efciency of the response. 3Fire/rescue departments have the techniques and expertise to stabilize the situa-tion and provide safety and security to all the respond- ers; after all, they do extrications of people from unusual situations as a matter of course. Very few own-ers have the equipment, training, and expertise toTable 1. Best Practices for Mud Extraction \u0081Assess the situation, call for resources, make a good plan, bring needed resources and personnel to the scene, and prepare for the extrication. Communicate with various groups and develop a coordinated effort that incorporates safety for the horse and humans. When performed in the dark, the rain, or on steep hazardous terrain, the rescue is that much more challenging. \u0081Get scene lighting by re/rescue early; they can provide medical rehabilitation, rst aid, and heating and cooling resources for both people and animals. \u0081Helmets should be worn when working with recumbent animals, especially by the animal handler. \u0081Animal handler should have a lead rope and halter available to catch and control the horse (or use an emergency rope halter). Control of the head is crucial so that the extricated animal does not get loose after extrication. Opposition re flex will occur if the head or legs are pulled upon, with counter-productive results. Slapping or stimulating a downed horse or pulling on the head (opposition re flex) is not helpful. \u0081Note that no one needs to pet the horse or get into the mud. Well-intentioned owners and responders may get into the mud toassist the animal; encourage them to stay out of the dangerous zone (near head, neck, and limbs) where a floundering horse can crush or drown a human. Do not allow people to wade into the mud; they should be working from on top of the mud (using ground pads of plywood or similar methods for spreading human weight on top of the mud.) \u0081Allow the animal to self-rescue where possible; rst, remove obstacles such as trees or debris, but leave the legs, head, and neck free to move so that the animal can balance itself and make active efforts to extricate itself. \u0081Plywood or other slick substrates are not recommended to be placed in front of the horse; horses physically cannot perform the maneuver of lifting their front ends and then pulling themselves forward, or they slip off it. \u0081Do not attach slings or webbing to the head, neck, tail, or legs to pull. Be cautious and remind others to stay out of the kill zone near the legs. The abdomen and chest are better anchor points for webbing or slings for manipulations and drags out of the mud. \u0081Do not use the tail as an attachment point for any mechanical manipulations and do not tie it to anything\u2014 only careful manual shifting of the recumbent horse by no more than 2 people. The tail can be broken, seriously injured, or traumatically amputated by application of excessive force. \u0081Use blindfolds while horses are recumbent to protect the downside eye and relax the animal. Ensure it is easily removable or fastened so that it will fall off on its own if the person handling the animal loses control. Protect the downside eye (e.g., H\u00e4st Becker head protector, apersonal flotation device from the re truck, or similar equipment). Horses use their head and neck as a lever to rise and when struggling may cause serious injury to an unprotected eye. \u0081Sedation and/or anesthesia should be carefully evaluated by the practitioner based on the animal 's medical status, time in situ, and potential for injury to a person or itself. \u0081Use wide, flat webbing with looped ends or continuous loops (instead of ropes) for any type of manipulation; the greater surface area provided by webbing/continuous loops minimizes injury to the skin. Use soft padding to protect soft tissue structures.Animals can be rolled laterally onto the ground pads, rescue glide sled, or a tarp for sliding to solid ground. \u0081Assists and drags/slides employed by the responder are most effective. Use the pectoral and pelvic girdles as attachment pointsfor webbing used in manipulations. The muscle and bone structures here will protect the delicate soft structures (nerve, blood vessels, organs, tendons, and ligaments) beneath. \u0081Always treat dead and live animals with respectful and professional methods; anyone could be watching or taking video. Social media is ever present.MEDICINE I: DRUGS, DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, AND DISASTERS 70 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSattempt equine extrications safely on their own \u2014it takes teamwork to achieve safety and ef ciency for all on scene. Hypothermia is common and is dependent on how stressed the animal is, environmental conditions, body size of the animal, presence of flowing water, etc. Prevention and aggressive treatment should be initi- ated immediately to minimize the effects. Accidentalhypothermia after extrication can be prevented by cor- rect core rewarming strategies to prevent the \"after drop\" effect of cooling on the heart and core. 4 Responders in mud eld environments must con- sider many variables: safety (for the human respondersand the animal), resources (people, equipment, tools, logistics), environment (precipitation, cold, heat, hu-midity), medical (stability of the patient, arrival time oftreatment), and unusual situational concerns such asaccessibility, structural integrity, or hazards (e.g., Is the horse partially hanging from a bridge, trapped inmud under a large dead tree, or \"down \"in mud at the bottom of a well? Is the \"mud \"actually a septic tank? What other hazards are involved?) In the past, human emergency responders extri- cated animals without veterinary assistance, and minimal attention to the health status of the horse was paid. Why? The common assumption was thathorses were big and strong, but several hours to daysafter seemingly \"successful \"rescues, untreated equine victims often died \"unexpectedly \". Today, responders are taught that horses are medically fragile and needveterinary attention immediately. They utilize the \"golden hours\" concept to track the steadily deterio- rating medical condition (Fig. 7) of affected equine vic- tims. 5The fundamental challenge on any large animal mud rescue scene is to balance the need to ex-tricate and transport with safety for all personnelwhile providing medical care to the patient. It is known that winch cables and ropes around the neck or attached to the tail, legs, or head are dangerousto the animal and should never be used. These poor\"rescue\" methods used in the past re flect human instincts to solve a problem but often caused iatrogenicinjury in the equine victim (traumatic amputations[Figs. 8 and 9] asphyxiation, corneal dam- age, myopathy, neurologic injury, etc.). b-dModern large animal mud rescue techniques and training are based on research and development into these scenarios anda r em o r ee f cient, safer for both responders and the equine victim, and prevent iatrogenic injuries. The unusual places and orientations (Table 2) that animals commonly are found require appropriate per-sonal protective equipment such as helmets and may require specialty tools (mud lance ef o ri n j e c t i o no fa i ro r w a t e ri n t ot h em u dt ob r e a kt h es u c t i o n ,N i c o p o l o u s needleffor guided placement of a pilot line, and web- bing around the body of the animal). Strategies ande q u i p m e n tt om i t i g a t et h e s es i t u a t i o n sa r ea v a i l a b l e .Team training using mannequins is an excellent way to practice these techniques and utilize this specialized but easily locally made equipment (Fig. 10).

A literature search reveals very little information about frequency,extrication methods, or treatment of injuries involvedin mud rescue of equines. This is a gap in knowledgeand, and it represents a rich opportunity both for research and statistical analysis. Thus, knowledge in response to mud extrication \u2014or suggestions for better prevention and respon- se\u2014come from the author 's extensive collection of journalistic and anecdotal reports, unpublished datafrom colleagues, hundreds of full-scale mud rescue train- ing events with mannequins placed into scenarios dupli-cating past situations, professional reghters sharingtheir career knowledge, actual owner accounts, social media postings/photos, and personal reports from veteri-narians/technicians/nurses that have responded to thesescenarios. Worst-Case Scenarios Eighteen horses trapped in mud in southern China in April 2020 recently were highlighted on YouTube\u2014 thereghter 's desperate attempts to assist the horses over 3 hours demonstrate the challenges with attempt-ing to extricate exhausted equids in these situations(Fig. 17; https://www.scmp.com/video/china/3079174/reghters-rescue-18-horses-trapped-deadly-mud- northern-china). In another dif cult mud rescue scenario in the United States, ve horses ended up trapped in a muddy area of a pasture near Indianapolis, Indiana, and they were attended by the large animal rescue team from Morgantown, Indiana. They quickly contacted a veteri-narian and worked as a team using forward assists andsideways drags to remove all the horses in less than2 hours from when these horses went into the mud.They were fortunate that the weather cooperated and that the horses were found in daylight (Fig. 18). Factors to Consider Before Responding \u0081Time: Responding may cause the practitioner to miss their normal calls for part of the day. Will 911 dispatch provide a police escort to the scene? How far is it to the scene? \u0081Environmental conditions: Is it raining, cold, or dark? Fig. 9. A previously deceased horse was lifted by tractor within minutes of con rmation of death to demonstrate what can happen. Traumatic separation of the tail is obvious \u2014the skin above the anus tore, as did the muscles, and bony column has separated at the level of the joint at the base of the tail (left). Dissection of this traumatic separation of muscles, nerves, and bone/joint in the tail of this euthanized horse (right). Do not use the tail as an anchor point for pulling an animal out of mud.

Posterior: Animals that fall into holes, ditches, or other obstacles where the rump is well below the rest of theirbody; mud may be deep or shallow. Dorsal: Befalls horses that slip, fall, or are thrust into a tight space and end up on their backs with their hooves pointed upward; this might be a riverbank, ditch, hole, or creek.Patency of the airway is a big concern here. Sternal: Horse is laying on its ventral surface with legs either trapped in a downward position (various) or folded and rest- ing upon them. The sheer weight of the animal contributes over time to com- partment/crush syndromes, myopathies, or neuropathies \u2014 victim should be attended to quickly \u2014within 4 hours of being recumbent for best opportunity at full recovery. Once extricated to flat ground, sternal is a preferred position for completed technical rescue scenarios at the nal hand off to the veterinarian; this is the \"recovery position \"for downed equines. Given appropriate time and treatment, most horses will rise on their own.MEDICINE I: DRUGS, DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, AND DISASTERS 74 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS\u0081Payment and liability: Will the veterinarian get paid for their services/medications? Emergencyresponse services do not charge for extrications.For the practitioner, these are dif cult ques- tions. Check with the state veterinarian 'so fce for legal advice on liability and requesting pay-ment, even just to cover costs. Practitionerscannot afford to respond to many of these sce-narios if required to donate time, effort, drugs,and expertise. \u0081Training: Incident command system (ICS) protocols(utilized by all 911 professional emergency responseservices) and rescue procedures are crucial forsafety. Emergency rescue requires training to han-dle the wide variety of mud scenarios encountered. \u0081Equipment: The basic load of equipment needed by the practitioner will include eld medical equip- ment, lengths of webbing for manipulations, and various tools. Responding 911 services rarely havespecialty types of large animal rescue equipment(mud lance, rescue glide, Nicopolous needle, etc.).However, a variety of useful extrication equipmentused for a variety of rescue situations will bebrought to the scene by re/rescue services, as well as plenty of manual help. Risk Assessment/Animal Evaluation It is important to perform a risk assessment and not jump into the mud next to the horse. Both the veteri- narian and the incident commander should work to- gether to decide at what point the horse(s) can beapproached safely for evaluation. A good risk assess-ment should evaluate the \"risk versus bene t\"of vari- ous strategies for extrication of the horse(s) and shouldinvolve the veterinarian 'so p i n i o n( e . g . ,I ft h ea n i m a li s not savable, why risk anyone 's life to extricate it and w h ym a k ei ts u f f e r ?T h eo w n e rs h o u l db ec o a c h e do n t h en e c e s s i t yf o rh u m a n ee u t h a n a s i a ) .N oo n es h o u l d get close to horses in mud until there is safe access/e g r e s se s t a b l i s h e d( m u do rg r o u n dp a d s ,p l y w o o d ,o rother flat accessibility equipment). If much of the body is under the mud, a full physical exam is impossible,but a basic assessment should include the following: \u0081Primary triage \u0081Initial rst aid and early treatment \u0081Extrication and follow-up treatment \u0081Secondary triage \u0081Transport to de nitive care location for further treatment and observation Veterinarians should consider wearing a minimum level of personal protective equipment (gloves, cover-alls, helmet) and a harness if below-grade rescues(wells, ditches, etc.) are to be performed. Concerns with Sedation or Anesthesia Use in Mud Scenarios Coordination between the veterinarian and the response team increases the ef ciency of veterinary Fig. 10. Mud rescue best practices are learned using a realistic RequipTMtraining mannequin.gHere, reghters in safety harnesses and personal protective equipment are approachingthe animal on top of ground pads.

A horse trapped in a muddy part of its own pasture for sev- eral hours. First, the responding large animal rescue team emplaced 2 webbing straps for sideways drag/slide in the simple con guration, using the Nicopolous needle to get around the chest and abdomen down in the mud. Now they are utilizing mud lances to inject low- pressure air down to the mud around the hooves \u2014over 5 feet down. Once they break the suction effect, simultaneously, the sidewaysdrag manipulation is used to get the animal onto its side with the legs out of the mud and to flat ground.

If forced to anesthetize a horse in water or a muddy environment, ensure the nostrils do not go into thewater as the horse goes unconscious as the head andneck are very heavy. Have a plan for support and buoyancy. Remember that certain drugs can impact maintenance of physiologic thermal balance andhypothermia (Fig. 19).Table 3. Basic Manipulations for Mud Rescue FORWARD ASSIST -Allows the legs and head to be free so that the horse can use their own muscular effort to self-rescue by moving forward, usually to solid ground. Minimize entanglement and clear obstacles and egress routes so that when the animal begins to move, it can (Fig. 12). There are three con gurations of this method. 1. SIMPLE/BASIC -This con guration of the forward assist is the simplest to attach and remove and easiest to learn; however, it is also most subject to slipping and is not appropriate for vertical lift from posterior recumbency (out of manholes, etc. where onlythe forequarters and head are within reach.) A 10-m piece of webbing is laid over the animal 's withers at the halfway point, and then each end of the webbing is wrapped under the chest at the sternum and pulled anteriorly between the legs and attached with a carabiner to a long rope for manual pulling. 2. CINCH/LARKSFOOT -This con guration literally cinches around the animal 's chest, minimizing the chance of webbing slip- page. It is commonly used to tie an animal off in its current position (on a bridge for example) so that it cannot fall further into trou-ble. One 10-m piece of webbing with loops at each end is wrapped around the animals 'chest at the withers, and then one end of the webbing is fed through the loop at the other end, fed anteriorly between the front legs, and attached with a carabiner to a long rope for manual pulling. 3. WIDENER/SWISS SEAT FORWARD ASSIST -This con guration cinches around the animal 's entire forequarters and pectoral girdle, minimizing slippage while effectively doubling the surface area of the webbing on the animal 's skin, therefore reducing the chance of injury from pressure used to pull the animal out of entrapment. While slightly more dif cult to envelope around the animal in the mud, and taking more time to remove, it does not come off the animal if properly placed (Fig. 13). One 10-m piece of webbing is held at the animal 's chest below the thoracic inlet at the halfway point, and then each end of the webbing is wrapped over the withers, around each side of the animal, down under the chest at the sternum (through the mud with a pilot line initially), pulled anteriorly between the front legs, and fed up through the existing webbing at the thoracic inlet; then, both looped ends are attached with a carabiner to a long rope for manual pulling. For horses trapped in mud in pos- terior recumbency (but below ground in wells, manholes, etc.), the loop of webbing may be attached to an overhead lifting point to perform a vertical lift using a crane. BACKWARD DRAG/SLIDE -This drag method is useful when access from the front or sides of the animal in the mud is not possible or practical. This is similar to the simple forward assist, but the webbing is threaded over the hips and between the back legs;then, both looped ends are attached with a carabiner to a long rope for manual pulling (Fig. 14). SIDEWAYS DRAG/SLIDE -This drag method is useful for providing numerous manual pulling points and minimizing the animal 's instinct to struggle while moving the animal up a bank or to the side on flat muddy ground. There are two con gurations of this method: SIMPLE/BASIC and HAMPSHIRE SLIP. Both require 2 pieces of 5-m-long, 10-cm-wide webbing (10-m length for draft horses.) It is preferred that the head be controlled by the animal handler to reduce possible injury to theeye or facial paralysis. The weight of the animals 'body is used to the advantage of the rescuers to keep it recumbent while increasing the surface area of the animal in contact with the unstable ground surface (mud, etc.) while being moved to safe ground. 1. SIMPLE/BASIC (Fig. 15) -This con guration can be used to pull the animal sideways along the ground, on top of the surface of mud, up a bank in a modi ed low-angle vertical lift, or to roll and maneuver the animal into a different position. Two pieces of 3-m webbing are separately flossed under the animal into position (front position) around the abdomen directly behind the front legs and (back position) around the abdomen directly in front of the back legs. 2. HAMPSHIRE SLIP -This con guration can be used to pull the animal sideways without causing it to roll or struggle out of position. This method has been used in serious mud entrapment scenarios in the United Kingdom to move a floundering horse in quicksand over 200 m to safe solid ground. Two pieces of 3-m webbing are separately flossed under the animal into position (front position) around the abdomen directly behind the front legs, and then the top portion of the strap is fed between the frontlegs, under the neck of the animal, back to the rescuers at the dorsal aspect of the animal, around the abdomen directly in frontof the back legs then fed between the back legs (back position), and under the tail and back to the rescuers at the dorsal aspect of the animal. VERTICAL LIFT -This is the least preferred option because it usually involves heavy equipment, greater coordination, and expense. Sedation is normally required, with close coordination between the operator of the equipment, animal handler, and attending vet-erinarian. Vertical lifting has been well covered in the veterinary literature for a large variety of slinging equipment and methods of horses \u2014most commonly used by emergency responders and veterinarians in technical rescue scenarios is the simple vertical lift web sling (Fig. 16; commercial versions available include the H\u00e4st Becker sling jand the Loops systemk). A major concern with implementing vertical lift slings is that personnel must be trained in their use to maximize safety when working around a trapped, frightened animal to prevent injuries. Initial sedation or light anesthesia of the animal is essential for placement in a sling to prevent it from struggling and injuring itself or rescuers. Vertical lift sling systems may visually appear to place signi cant pressure on the abdominal area of the animal; however, abdominal, thoracic, and pulmonary perfusions have not been observed to be signi cantly impaired in rescued animals lifted in this manner for 2 to 12 minutes (>20-minute lifts in training scenarios with demonstration animals over 300+ training evolutions, over 200 reported rescue efforts.) Pregnant mares have been successfully lifted using this technique.6Contact pressure is minimized when using wider straps for the lift because they increase the surface area of the contact points on the animal. When used in conjunction with appropriate lifting equip-ment, simple vertical lift slings can provide a suitable and affordable means of short-term vertical lift of large animals.MEDICINE I: DRUGS, DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, AND DISASTERS 76 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSpecial Concerns Special to Technical Extrication in Mud Scenarios Older animals, animals possibly enduring a laminitis episode, or similarly sensitive animals should be eval- uated for preexisting conditions for which the animalwas \"self-medicating \"by stepping into the cool mud willingly and then becoming unable to extricate itself.Even when a trained large animal rescue team effects an ef cient rescue and an on-scene veterinar- ian treats the animal immediately, the animal can still die. 7Failing to treat equines for crush syndrome and accidental hypothermia in cold or wet situationsimmediately after the extrication is a common causeof death. Recumbent animals entrapped in mud sce- narios are subject to abnormal orientation, shock, Fig. 12.

Crush injury in equines that have been recumbent for long periods orimpinged by weight of other animals or objects inmud entrapment can cause latent injuries that mightnot be recognized on scene. These factors over a pro-longed period (>4 -6 hours) have been shown to causelocalized and distant organ injury or death in the horse, as well as muscle death and ongoing injury after6 to 7 hours, especially in sedated and anesthetized horses. The mud response scenario with very high reperfusion injury and mortality rate is any entrap- m e n tf o ro v e r1 2 h o u r s ;2 4 h o u r so rm o r eh a sa n extremely poor prognosis. Horses are capable of sur- viving mud entrapment with aggressive warmed fluid therapy and immediate thermal support. Animals in shock, with severe injuries, with poor body condition, or that are geriatric should be triaged ef ciently. (Note: These factors must be considered to provide appropriate and timely prophylactic treatment to theanimal \u2014treatment methods are well covered else- where in the literature.) 4. Discussion Incident Command Response Framework The practitioner is just one member of a large group of emergency responders responding under a common protocol known as the ICS. The basic principles of ICS are fully applicable to mud rescue: \u0081Planning: An action plan must be developed. \u0081Team approach: Every responder is part of a team and knows their job. \u0081One coordinator: The incident commandercoordinates the response; they are the leader and shoulder the responsibility for the entire scene. \u0081Safety: Safety is priority, for both the animal victim and all human rescuers. \u0081No freelancing: Individuals responding/acting on their own constitute a risk and a liability to others. The incident commander has the authority to remove them from the scene. When the Call Comes to the Office The caller may be a 911 dispatcher, client, or unknown horse owner or bystander. If the caller is a 911 dispatcher, ask them to send the re/rescue department and law enforcement to the scene for lifesafety. If the owner is calling you, ask them to also call 911 for assistance and life safety prevention. Preliminary Information to Obtain During the Call \u0081Name and contact information of caller \u0081Exact location and clear directions to the scene or closest access \u0081Number of horses involved \u0081Brief description of the situation \u2014advise caller to text photos if possible \u0081Photos or short videos of the scene should be requested; they allow you to develop plans and coordination while responding Fig. 14.

Photo courtesy Patterson Fire Rescue, NY.MEDICINE I: DRUGS, DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, AND DISASTERS 78 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSThe Role and Responsibilities of the Practitioner Different from clinical and eld practice, there are many dangers in eld environments where the veteri- narian is not the \"authority having jurisdiction \"over the scene (the authority having jurisdiction will be the re department or police of cer that arrived rst), and the practitioner is expected to t into the working model of ICS on scene. The incident commander isethically and legally responsible for the safety andlives of all personnel and the victim on their scene.The incident commander will assist the animal(s) when the scene is stable, people have been taken care of, and it is safe to do so. The veterinarian or their technician/nurse should direct medical stabilization and handling but shouldnot pull on assist/extrication devices or perform theactual extrication \u2014let the professional emergencyresponders do their job. By taking a management and advisory role, and a less hands-on approach for the extrication, the practitioner can plan and prepare for treatment and transport options, advise the IC and theowner, and prevent injury to themselves by staying out of the danger zone. Interaction with the Owner/Bystanders Allowing horse owners or bystanders to take charge of an extrication attempt is dangerous and unsafe to everyone else on scene. The owner is im- portant as a source of information and for authori-zation of the horse' s treatment, transport to denitive treatment area, or decisions on sedation and euthanasia. If possible, keep owners out of theway of the rescue efforts\u2014 many animal owners will be emotional, while veterinarians have train-ing to remain calm, make rational decisions, andhandle the situation professionally. Close coordina- tion with the owner can ensure better outcomes based on diagnosis and early treatment options, or at the least in euthanasia being selected for induc- tion at a rational point. Make the Assessment Upon arrival to the scene, the veterinarian should meet the incident commander, look at the entire sce- nario, and come up with an incident plan. The sceneneeds to be stabilized and people extricated before the animal(s) are extricated. Horses can perceive and may react to everything going on (voices, tools, vehicles,footsteps, extrication equipment), which is another reason for a good plan and ef cient extrication strat- egy before getting too close. Approach slowly while talking to the horse(s), evaluating their stress and ori- entation \u2014askre/rescue personnel to provide light- ing for everyone 's safety. Are animal(s) dead or alive? Fig. 16. A draft horse trapped in a muddy hole in pasture (left photo) at least 6 hours before discovery by owners. A simple web sling with vertical lift was used to extricate the horse with a large excavator and then used to support the exhausted animal until it could stand.

A variety of methods were used in this scenario; how- ever, not all were the best way to extricate the horses. Forwardassist (putting the webbing around the chest as they did here) is an excellent way to do this, but responders must realize that although humans are able to walk on the crusty surface of the mud, horses weigh more and break through more easily. Yelling or whistling does not motivate horses; instead, efforts shouldfocus on commands used to coordinate the extrication.

What obstacles exist? Can you assist the horse to extricate itself? Ask yourself questions based on the scenario: How much equipment do you need, and how far is it to bring to the scene? Dif cult scenarios will require tree- or metal-cutting equipment to access the animal(s) or to provide a clear egress path forextrication \u2014reg h t e r sk n o wh o wt od ot h a t . Animal Handler If possible, assign personnel with advanced horse handling expertise or an equine technician/nurse. Most police and re ofcers do not have experience with horses, and animal-handling skills for emer- gency situations are a specialty skill set. Lack of train-ing may cause them to underestimate the extremeweight, strength, and refl exive speed of a trapped or injured horse. The handler at the head of the animal (if it is a safe place to be) is in the best position to advise about themedical status, potential behavior or reactions of theanimal, approach techniques, and body positioning. T h ei m p o r t a n c eo fs a f ep o s i t i o n sa r o u n dt h eh o r s eshould be emphasized by the handler to operationalpersonnel who may forget as they work around the horse. Triage When Multiple Horses Are Involved Triage is common for veterinarians involved in response to mud entrapment as more than one animal can get trapped in the same situation (Fig. 20). The Fig. 18. Left photo: There are 5 horses in this mud scenario and 3 miniature horses standing with their trapped friends. Right photo: Using sideways drag with webbing to extricate each horse.

Pool noodles are used to keep the nostrils out of the muddy water, and painted plywood ground pads are used to safely work around the animal for sling emplacement. The horsewas extricated successfully using the Becker sling for a vertical lift and returned to the owner 's property but was hypothermic (2 \u00b0F below normal rectal temperature) and died the next morn-ing in its stall, probably due to accidental hypothermia.

Conduct a cursory inspection of all animals that you can safelyreach, and then attempt to assist animals that are easiest to ex- tricate rst, especially those with cooperative dispositions or in the best position for ef cient rescue. Provide treatment in situ to those waiting. Here, the responder in the mud should be on aboard instead. The mule was deemed easier to extricate in the rst attempt, although the horse was more amenable to the pro- cess. Both were eventually extricated and provided treatment.

Conduct a cur- sory inspection of all animals that you can safely reach; then, salvage animals r s tt h a ta r ee a s i e s tt oe x t r i c a t e , have cooperative dispositions, and present the leastthreatening injuries. Severely injured horses must beevaluated for euthanasia; for animals that have a more reasonable chance of survival, support in situ or extri- cate and evaluate. Documentation of injuries with pic- tures or video of animals before euthanasia is wise practice. Expectant animals (ones that have the poorestprognosis) should be euthanized ef ciently to prevent suffering, based on resources and personnel. Field Euthanasia Before providing medical attention or euthanasia to horse(s), consult with the owner/agent about possibletreatment/cost and prognosis. Exhausted, stressed, hypothermic, and dehydrated animals often stay re- cumbent for a long time after being extricated from mud; this is not always an indicator of a poor prognosis,and sternal recumbency is recommended. Some owners refuse veterinary attention to horses even in cases where the prognosis is good or fail to authorize eutha- nasia. Check local and state regulations that affect these decisions about animal welfare and ownership.

Proactive Involvement and Training Practitioners can contact their 911 call center dis- patch and ask if there is a local, regional, or state team or re department/rescue squad with training in methods and procedures to safely perform equine mud rescue. These teams may be private, associated with a veterinary clinic or school, or with a re depart- ment. Provide your 24-hour contact information to thelocal 911 emergency dispatch center. Over the last 30 years, an increasing number of pro- fessional emergency responders and veterinarians have received training in technical emergency and disaster rescue of large animals (TLAER) and animalsearch and rescue for equines. These courses are aligned with National Fire Protection Association Standards for Technical Rescue 1006, 2500, and150\u2014which include teaching proper and safe tac- tics, use of realistic training mannequins to prac- tice hands-on procedures and techniques for mudrescue, extrication of large animals, and dealingwith unusual scenes. 5. Conclusion Local equine practitioners are the responders of choice due to their expertise in horse behavior,handling, and medical knowledge \u2014am u dr e s c u ei s n e v e rs i m p l eo re a s y .P r i o rp r e p a r a t i o na n dc o m -munication with local law enforcement and re/ rescue groups, training in simple techniques andbest practices, along with specialized equipment will contribute to improved outcomes. With emphasis on appropriate protective equipment for personnel (i.e., helmets) and the entrapped horse, appropriate mud rescue manipulation techniques, and proper positioning of personnel, the veterinary practitioner and their staff can assist the rescue team to achieve safe and effective results when moving recumbent horses trapped in various mud situations.

Introduction Levamisole is sometimes administered to race- treat equine are ARCI Class I Foreign Substances. Thepresence of levamisole and some metabolites inpost-race regulatory samples is prohibited. Pre-vious studies have examined single doses of thedrug, and the paucity of data on the dispositionof levamisole after multiple, consecutive dosesled to this study being performed. This studyexamined the disposition of levamisole in serumand urine after 7 days of a typical dosingregimen.2. Materials and Methods Six healthy Thoroughbred geldings were treated with 500 mg of levamisole hydrochloride orally at 12-hour intervals for 7 days. Serum and urine sampleswere analyzed over a 28-day period and pharmacoki-netic parameters determined. 3. Results The terminal half-life of levamisole in serum washighly variable between horses. Following the nal dose: serum levamisole was above LOD in 5/6 horsesfor 3-14 days (one horse remained over LOD on thelast testing day), compound II was below LOD in all6 horses by 14 days.

Gosselin, DVM Recruitment and retention of veterinary talent is a priority for every equine veterinary practice owner. Practices that invest in developing a team-based culture can reduce employee turnover, enhance theworkplace environment, and improve pro tability. Author 's address: Millbrook \u00a92022 AAEP. 1. Introduction Equine veterinary medicine is experiencing a hiring crisis. While the United States economy is posting re-cord low unemployment rates,1the number of prac- tices looking for talent has never been higher. Thedemand for equine veterinary medicine has surgedduring the pandemic, and practices are desperatelysearching for new associate veterinarians, licensed a n du n l i c e n s e dt e c h n i c i a n s ,a n do f ce staff. Less than 1% of new veterinary graduates are interested in equine practice and more than 50% of those youngv e t sl e a v ee q u i n ep r a c t i c ei nt h e rst 5 years. 2Of those veterinary teams, support staff included, thatare still in the equine trenches, many are overworkedand experiencing burnout. 3The revolving door, or high employee turnover model for veterinary talentand support staff is no longer sustainable. Practiceshoping to hire and retain talent, should considerthat potential employees are looking for purpose andflexibility in the workplace. Employees want to feel respected and valued, products of a healthy practiceculture. It is not enough to start a veterinary business,hire some employees, schedule appointments and go towork. Instead, practices that want to avoid cripplingstaf ng shortages must reduce employee turnover andinvest in establishing a healthy, team-based practiceculture. 2. It All Begins with Mission, Vision, and Core Values The mission statement, vision statement, and corevalues are the foundation to every culture. A group ofpeople working together toward a shared goal, orteam, cannot work together or understand the goalwithout establishing these concepts. While it is hardfor many veterinary business owners to work throughthis process, it is essential that everyone understandsthe goals of the organization from the owner to thestall cleaner. These concepts should be discussed reg-ularly and updated as needed. 3. Lead with Empathy A healthy culture is a product of healthy leadership.Practice owners or partnership groups cannot build agreat culture if toxicity is the default. This can be theproduct of damaged relationships between partners orthe way individual partners view their employees.Practice owners must be critical of their existing cul-ture and recognize how and where they fall short asleaders. It is not fair for owners to expect the rest of NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 87BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MOTIVATING STAFF, RETENTION, AND TEAMWORKthe team to build and carry the culture. Successful leaders will own their mistakes, ask for feedback, andunderstand the roles that others play in the organiza-tion. Trust and vulnerability are the glue that holds ateam together. Gratitude is essential. 4. Hire and Fire to Improve Culture Considering the current job market, it may be tempt- ing to hire anyone that has a pulse and is available to work. However, practices must use extreme cautionwhen hiring and select people that complement their culture rather than strictly mirror it. Instead of hiring clones, selecting for candidates with similar back-grounds, education, and experience, practices shouldattempt to grow their organizations through consoli-dating a diverse group of people. Remember that it only takes a single toxic person to poison a culture. 4 Hire carefully to avoid bringing these people on board and do not hesitate to remove them if they cannot towthe proverbial party line. Write clear job descriptions and update them regularly. When practices hire for personality and culture t, it becomes easier to move people around in an organization, if they could con-t r i b u t em o r eo r nd more satisfaction in another position. 5. Communicate, Communicate, and (When in Doubt) Communicate Some More True teambuilding hinges on communication. With- out communication, managers cannot delegate, teams cannot function effectively and ef ciently, and organizations cannot grow and develop. Proactivecommunication is not micromanagement. Wheremicromanagement hones in on what a team memberdoes not perform, proactive communication serves asa method of support with regular check ins designed to coach and mentor. Proactive communication also requires active listening and a basic understandingof the speaker 's communication style. Personality proles are a valuable tool designed to tease out an individual 's preferred method of communication. Practices with healthy cultures enjoy communicat-ing. Team members huddle-up at communal spacesto chat and share ideas, engage in casual conversa- tion, and gather after work to socialize. 6. Candid Feedback is Valuable Successful practice owners are not afraid to give orreceive feedback. Employee feedback should be doled out in a timely and respectful fashion, never in front ofan audience or after an extended period of time. At the same time, successes should be shared and celebrated with the team during meetings, via Slack or email,and in the of ce (i.e., praise wall). Good leaders never take credit for other 's success but always bear the responsibility when the team falls short. Take everyopportunity to express gratitude when team membersexcel and help the organization shine. Practice ownersshould not hide from feedback, both from employeesand clients. Engagement surveys, 360-degree reviews, and exit interviews are simply a waste of time if the content is not taken seriously and issues are not fur- ther explored by management. 7. Compensation Matters While this seems like an obvious statement, prac- tices that are electing to invest in their team are reducing employee turnover because employees feelvalued. Practices must offer competitive wages toboth veterinarians and hourly employees. Pay atten-tion to what local businesses are paying and meet orexceed those rates. Consider compensating veteri-narians with a high base salary and an annual production bonus. Veterinarians will work more col- laboratively and spend less time ghting over clients and services. Practice owners are starting to thinkoutside the box with other forms of compensat-ion/bene ts. Potential employees are looking for flex- ible scheduling, shared on-call, paid time off, studentdebt support, cooperative childcare, paid familyleave, health insurance, and retirement investmentopportunities. Employee compensation is no longer\"one size ts all, \"as each employee values different benets. Practices can mix and max bene ts to per- sonalize and enhance compensation packages foreach individual. 8. Conclusion Equine veterinary practice is driving away veteri- nary talent. Practice owners need to start actively shaping their business culture to attract and retainemployees. This can be accomplished by setting corevalues/vision/mission, leading by example, hiringandring for culture t, communicating proactively, encouraging feedback, and providing fair compen-sation for employees. Practices that successfullyimprove culture will experience a workplace that ismore pleasant and productive, which will reduce em-ployee turnover and increase pro tability.

Introduction The veterinary industry at large has experienced ex- ponential growth through the global pandemic. In2020, veterinary industry revenue increased by 7.7%.1 Growth was attributed to an increase in pet ownershipand increased disposable income. The equine sector isno different. An August 2020 survey 2performed by Dr. Amy Grice revealed that a majority of respondentsindicated they were either not affected by COVID orexperienced an increase in revenue following onset ofthe pandemic. Doctors entering the equine veterinaryindustry have decreased in the past decade (Fig. 1below) despite the ongoing need for equine veterinar-ians\u2014creating obvious challenges and maybe not so obvious opportunities for licensed and unlicensed vet-erinary technicians (the term \"technician \"will be used throughout this paper and is all-encompassing). 2. Discussion It is the author 's opinion that the equine veterinary industry is historically lacking in technician utilization.A number of factors or perceptions likely contribute and are discussed in the next section. Historic Model of Veterinarians Working Solo and Relying on Horse Owners to Assist Sadly, 16% of the 524 respondents work without any assistance (Fig. 2).3Increasing concerns of safety and newer practitioners 'desire to nd ef ciencies that i m p r o v ew o r k - l i f es a t i s f a c t i o na r ed r i v i n gt h ed e m a n d for support team hires, in the author 's experience. Higher Technician Pay Driving Employees to the Small Animal Sector Numbers directly comparing small animal to large animal technician salaries are dif cult to come by. Anecdotally, the author has observed average hourlyr a t e so f$ 2t o$ 5m o r ei ns m a l la n i m a lc o m p a r e dt oequine. A recent survey of American Association ofEquine Veterinary Technicians and Assistants mem-bers 4(licensed, unlicensed, and practice manager roles combined) shows the most common hourly wage cate-gory is $15 to $20. See the gure below for details. A May 2019 survey5explored why veterinary respondents had left or considered leaving equine NOTES 90 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MOTIVATING STAFF, RETENTION, AND TEAMWORKpractice. The option \"low salaries and compensation \" was in the top 5 for responses. While the survey focuses on veterinarians, it is the author 'so p i n i o n that a similar trend would be identi ed in technicians given a similar survey. Difficulties of Generating Enough Revenue to Support Additional Team Members When technicians are underutilized, it is more dif cult to generate revenue that supports additional support team members or higher wages. That said, the AVMA-AAEP Equine Economic Survey3measured veterinary salaries by practice size (Fig. 4). Practices with multi-ple employees showed a trend in increasing veterinar-ian salaries as additional team members were hired.A solo practitioner adding an assistant earned just$126.99 less 3in salary for the year \u2014a small price to pay for a myriad of bene ts. After a practice employs a range of 5 to 9 staff members, veterinary income rises\u2014likely a re flection of more ef cient work flow and di- vision of labor. Equine veterinarians can also learn from small animal counterparts who average twice as many support team members per veterinarian.6For equine, ratios range from 1:0.5 (mobile) to 1:1.5 (com-bined ambulatory and hospital). These numbers com-pare to average small animal predominant clinicratios of 1:3. While vet-to-staff ratios are not the onlyfactor, the author believes they play a big part in thedisparity between equine and small animal averageannual doctor revenue\u2014 with small animal vets pro- ducing $200,000 more on average. 3While there are logistical hurdles to overcome \u2014one can only ts o many assistants in a work truck \u2014ac o m p a r i s o nt o small animal nancials and placing value on safety and career satisfaction quickly supports the hiring of additional assistance. The information provided abovehelps summarize why veterinarians need additionalhelp and shows that it is possible to create additionalv a l u ef o rt h ep r a c t i c ew i t hm o r ea s s i s t a n c e .T h ef o l l o w -ing section will help start a conversation with a prac-tice's owner and management to 1) hire additional help and 2) utilize technicians to the top of their skillset. 3. Solution Technicians are an integral part of the equine veteri- nary clinic and need to be recognized and utilized. In many states, a technician can do bandage changes,give intravenous and intramuscular medications, per-form laser/shockwave therapy, and operate radio-graph equipment while under the indirect supervisionof a veterinarian. Indirect supervision implies that a Fig. 1. Percentage of new graduates entering private equine practice.3 Fig. 2.

Remember thateach state 's veterinary medical board has a different policy for appropriate direct and indirect supervisionof tasks. Consult with your veterinary medical boardfor state-speci c guidelines. 7 Technician appointments have the mutual bene t of improving employee satisfaction for support teammembers who now have a more integral role inpatient care and doctors who have additional time tocomplete medical records, see more advanced cases, ortake an afternoon off. The following section will detailhow a practice can better utilize support team mem-bers and implement technician-driven appointments. 4. How-To \u0081Gain buy-in from doctors and practice owners. Remind them salaries for veterinarians increaseas the team grows (Fig. 4). \u0081Consult with your state 's veterinary medical board to determine tasks that licensed and unli-censed team members can perform with direct or indirect supervision. \u0081Assess your practice 's current use of technicians and assistants. How do you compare to partici- pants of the 2019 AVMA-AAEP Equine EconomicSurvey? Are support team members performing all the tasks they can legally? Figure. 5 can be used as a talking point with your team. \u0081Agree upon communication flow should a con- cern arise during a technician visit. A doctorshould be available remotely to eld any ques- tions. Video chat is a great way to receive real-time feedback if something unexpected occurs. \u0081Schedule dedicated time for solo appointments or\"double up \"on patient visits at the same location.\u0081Educate clients on the bene ts of technician appointment slots (more accessibility, nancial savings, etc.). \u0081Enhance client comfort with nondoctor visits.Writing a blog post or presenting at a client edu-cation seminar are both ways for technicians togain con dence from clients. \u0081Commit to improving technical skills duringdoctor appointments so technicians can con-tinue offering a wider range of services. \u0081Negotiate a pay increase that re flects the added doctor ef ciency or solo revenue produced by the technician. As a basic rule of thumb, revenueshould increase by 1.5 times the pay increase forthe practice to break even. This suggestionaccounts for the cost of goods sold, payroll tax, worker 's compensation, etc. \u0081Share the following excerpt from the October 2020 Equine Veterinary Journal with your owner or practice manager: How do you know if you can afford a technician? Somesimple numbers can get you started: The nationwideaverage salary according to the Bureau of LaborStatistics for a registered technician in 2020 was$17.43/hour, with a range from $12/hour to $25/hour. A 2019 report from the Veterinary Hospital Managers Association reports a range of $16.85 -$21.93 for cre- dentialed technicians. Data speci ct oe q u i n et e c h n i - cians was collected by the American Association ofEquine Veterinary Technicians in 2020 and is sharedin Figure 3. Self-reported wages were predominantlyin the $15 -20/hour range. This report is also broken down by state and time in the industry for easier comparison of wages. Since registered techni- cians are licensed individuals, continuing educa-tion and licensing fees are something to consider.Additional bene ts are clinic and location- Fig. 4.

See Table 1 for general assumptions: 5. Conclusion Industry leaders are predicting a de cit in veterinar- ians and veterinary support team members for the next decade. Now is the time to start rethinking the current equine veterinary practice model and allowtechnicians to start working at the top of their skill set in order to recruit and retain these valuable team members. Clinics who embrace this changing model willnd themselves working more safely and ef - ciently, resulting in client satisfaction, employee ful-llment, and business success.

This paper is abrief reminder that the impact of skeletal injuries onhorse attrition and industry costs; then builds thefoundation for understanding the need for skeletal ad-aptation to sport horse demands, the mechanisms for injury and adaptation, and the contributing factors to sport horse injuries; and lastly reviews concepts oftraining to shift the balance to adaptation and optimalperformance. 2. Cost of Poor Performance and Attrition The cost of poor performance, inability to perform, and attrition from equine sport can be huge. Musculoskeletal injuries have a large detrimental impact on the sporthorse industries. Injuries result in loss of horses fromtraining and racing, racehorse deaths, jockey injury anddeaths, and poor public perception of the racing industry.Inability to train racehorses in New York occurred for 8.1% of potential training days, 72.1% due to lameness. 1 Insidious, but devastating, outcomes include the adverse effects on industry economics.2As an example, median nancial return was $23,000 less for yearling Thorough-bred horses being broke and conditioned for 2-year-old in-training sales that lost 13 to 108 days of training com-pared to horses that lost only 1 to 11 days of training.3 Economic wastage in 2011 was estimated at almost $3 million each month in California racehorses and over $81 million per month nationally, based on ;3% of horses lost from racing each month and median yearlingauction price.aThe estimate does not include costs associated with training, treatment, rehabilitation,shoeing, and other expenses to prepare and keep horses in training and competition. High turnover of sport horses results in poor return on owner invest-ments. Consequently, elucidating and managing thecauses of skeletal injury should be key goals of thesport horse industries. 3. Skeletal Adaptation The skeleton is an energetically expensive part of the body. Mineralization imparts bones with the neces- sary stiffness and strength to support the body andallow for locomotion. However, mineralized tissuesare dense and heavy and thus energetically expensiveto carry and move. Consequently, the skeleton isdynamic and continually adapts, gaining or removing bone material in response to the most recent loading (exercise) conditions. The process is analogous to gain-ing or losing muscle mass with exercise or inactivity,respectfully. NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 95FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREBone damage occurs when higher than expected (recent) loads (stresses) cause bones to deform (strain) excessively. The most easily observable forms of damage histologically are diffuse damage and micro-cracking. One mechanism for preventing excessive de-formation and consequent bone damage formation is to enlarge the bone structure. The stress (stress = load/bone area) associated with high loads is reducedwhen bones get larger and the strains (deformations)within bone material become smaller because strain is proportional to stress for a given bone material. This process occurs during growth. Bones not only get lon-g e rb u ta l s og e tl a r g e ri nd i a m e t e rt os u p p o r ti n c r e a s -i n gb o d ym a s s . Sport horse training involves increases in bone loads, whether by inducing faster speed, higher jumps,or unique gymnastics. Ideally, the increase in exerciseintensity is graduated, allowing for skeletal adaptationt os m a l li n c r e m e n t si ns k e l e t a ll o a d s .S o ,w h a th a p - pens to induce skeletal adaptation? Slightly higher than expected loads or a change in expected activity cause submicroscopic- or micro- scopic-level damage to bone tissue, typically evidencedmicroscopically by diffuse en bloc basic fuchsin stain- ing (diffuse damage). Diffuse damage is capable of self-repair without inducing remodeling (bone resorp-tion followed by bone formation) 4because surrounding osteocytes are not perturbed.5This \"nondestructive \" type of damage only transiently reduces the stiffness (modulus) of the locally affected bone material.4 Further, bone damage near osteoblast or osteogenicprecursor (bone lining cell) covered bone surfaces can induce bone formation (modeling; Fig. 1). Bone mod- eling at sites of nondestructive bone damage alterthe size and/or shape of the bone structure and pro- tect against further damage at the same new load level or activity (Fig. 2). Ideally, training is increased gradually to allow for skeletal adaptation to increas- ing loads and exercise intensity. Further, only a Fig. 1.

A transverse section at the level of the line through the metacarpus illustrates the outer cortical region visualized in the undecalci ed histologic sections stained en bloc with basic fuchsin (box). The upper micrograph illustrates the junction of the in flamed periosteum overlying bone beneath the periosteal microcracks (ellipse) are coincident with collagen bers extending to the periosteum. Periosteal osteoblasts are stimulated to form new bone on the peri- osteal surface (modeling), which enlarges the cross-sectional area of the bone, reduces bone stresses (and thus strains) with the recently acquired higher loads, and reduces susceptibility of the bone to damage at the new level of exercise intensity. Note that there are no resorp- tion bays (porosities) in the cortex. The bone tissue will self-repair the microcracks without bone remodeling. Fig. 2. Transverse sections from 3 different racehorses illustrating the adaptation that the dorsomedial aspect of the metacarpal cortex ismaking in response to the higher magnitude of bone strain and change in strain orientation that occur locally in response to initiation and maintenance of high-speed activities (breezing at racing speeds and racing). 7Dorsomedial cortical expansion is the modeling response to outer cortical nondestructive damage, which reduces bone stresses and strains by increasing bone cross-sectional area. Adapted bones are resistant to recurrence of dorsal metacarpal disease.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 96 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsmall exposure to the new load level is suf cient to generate a bone modeling response.6Increased bone material reduces bone strains at the new exercise level and prevents further damage. 4. Bone Injury Bones incur a spectrum of bone damage. Mild, non- d e s t r u c t i v eb o n ed a m a g ep r o m o t e ss k e l e t a la d a p t a - tion. Large increases in bone loads, excessive loads,numerous repeated loads, or repeated loads on com- promised bone tissue can produce more severe bone damage. For example, continued high-intensity exer- c i s eo nm e t a c a r p iw i t hd o r s a lm e t a c a r p a ld i s e a s e before adaptation is completed can lead to incompletecortical fracture (stress fracture) or catastrophic com- plete bone fracture. 8 More severe forms of damage compromise osteocyte viability9and induce bone remodeling (Fig. 3).5The resorption of damaged bone material causes a tran-sient focal osteopenia until remodeling (bone forma- tion) comes to completion. Incomplete cortical stress fractures are a manifestation of this process (Fig. 4). Detection of a \"bone fracture \"on radiographic images is visualization of the porosities associated with a plane of microdamage. Delayed visualization after time of injury is the result of the time needed for bone resorption to create suf cient porosities for radio- graphic visualization. During repair, transient osteopenia compromises the strength and stiffness of the bone material.11,12 Consequently, repeating the most recent intense loads is more damaging because bone stresses, andthus deformations, are higher because of the reduced amount of bone material at the affected site. Further, this weakened site acts as a stress riser that can promote complete bone fracture under otherwise normal loading circumstances (Fig. 5).However, on completion of modeling (periosteal callus and trabecular thickening) and intracortical remodeling, the bone structure is stronger and thebone material is tougher, further resisting micro- crack initiation and propagation and increasing fa- tigue life. 13,14 5. Subchondral Bone Adaptation and Injury Subchondral bone tissues respond to increases in loading by the same processes that occur in cortical bone tissues. Mild, subclinical damage that resolves without remodeling induces trabecular thickening and subchondral sclerosis through micromodeling (Fig. 6). The addition of bone material is expected to increase the stiffness, strength, and fatigue life of the bone structure,15,16reducing bone deformations and Fig. 3. Left, Scanning electron micrograph of a transverse section from the intact humerus of a racehorse that had a catastrophic fracture of the contralateral humerus. The soft tissues (including cells) have been removed. Microcracks (red lines) are illustrated that obstruct canalicular flow of nutrients from vessels in the Haversian canals to osteocytes in lacunae between cracks. Absence of osteocyte lacuna between cracks is indicative of lacunar mineralization secondary to osteocyte death. Subsequently, osteoclasts are targeted to remove damaged bone (crack in resorption bay).10Right, Lower power scanning electron micrograph from the same speci- men illustrating focal osteopenia in a region of high-density microdamage.

Note the periosteal apposition of fresh, red, vascular woven bone on thefresh specimen and the gray (less mineralized) newer bone on the radiographic image. Periosteal modeling will contribute to increasing bone cross-sectional area and adaptation to the moreintensive loading conditions provided that intracortical remodel- ing continues to completion (new bone formation).FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 97damage under well-adapted circumstances for the exercise intensity. However, similar to cortical bone, subchondral bone is susceptible to different levels of microdamage.Changes in subchondral bone have been implica- ted in the progression of osteoarthritis in humans andhorses. 17-20Microdamage that devitalizes bone tissue is repaired by remodeling. The rst stage of repair by remodeling is bone resorption, which can create afocal porosity that acts like a stress riser and mayfacilitate complete fracture (Figs. 7 and 8). 21 Given time and absence of injurious loads, damaged subchondral bone tissue is capable of repair andregeneration. Subchondral support of overlying artic-ular cartilage maintains cartilage health. However, ifloading is continued on osteopenic subchondral bone, the overlying articular cartilage loses support. 17 Subsequent cartilage collapse into the underlying bone defect results in osteoarthrosis (Figs. 9 and 10). 6. Factors That Influence the Balance Between Adaptation and Injury Increased loading is required to induce adaptation to new loading circumstances. Training is needed to increase ability and performance. Knowledge ofthe factors that affect the amount and severity ofbone damage incurred during training are helpfulto achieve bone and joint adaptation without overtinjury. Although bones can be fractured in a single large traumatic accident, fractures in athletes are the resultof smaller repetitive loads. Bone, like other materials,will fatigue with repeated loading. Eventually, bones Fig. 5.

Right, Caudocranial (center top) and lateromedial (center bottom) projections illustrate the level (green lines) of sagittal (right top) and transverse (right bottom) sections viewed on the respective right computed tomography sections. Most relevant to complete frac- ture are the intracortical porosities (dotted green ellipses) that promoted fracture. Periosteal woven bone callus (yellow arrows) and trabecular thickening (blue arrows) are attempts to buttress the associated cortical weakness. Fig. 6.

The horse in the early stages of training (left) has compac- tion of subchondral trabeculae bone that resulted trabeculae bridge the proximal and distal regions of subchondral sclerosis in the seasoned racehorse (right). These changes are adaptations to increased bone loading associated with increased exercise in- tensity and are the result of micromodeling on trabecular surfa-ces. Note the absence of regions of local porosities.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 98 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSwill fail if repeatedly loaded in the laboratory.22,23 The relationship between number of repeated loads required for bone failure is exponential (Fig. 11). Higher loads create markedly more damage in far fewer cycles than low loads. Each loading cycle(stride of the horse) induces some level of damage in the bone material. Bone can sustain low level loads for a long time; nondestructive damage is continually self-repaired. Conversely, fewer large loads may induce destructive damage that requires remodeling for repair, increasing susceptibility to more damage with continued loading. At an extreme, the bone will ultimately fail (i.e., fracture) due to accumulation and propagation of cracks through the process of fatigue. Importantly, biologically, only a small number of higher than the most recent loads (4 -36 cycles, orstrides/gymnastics, of loading) are suf cient to stimu- late adaptive modeling responses. 6Excessive and re- petitive high loads only cause more bone damage, which can promote injury. A common cause of injuryis overtraining. Further, once an equine athlete hasachieved a high level of adaptation and performance,few loads are required to maintain the adaptation. Fig. 7.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 99However, the loading circumstances must be relevant to the intended performance so bone structures see the stresses and strains that are unique to the rele- vant sport. Each equestrian sport produces unique bone stresses and strains. For example, while swimming may maintain cardiovascular tness, swimming reduces loads on bones. In response, bones may lose bone material and become less able to sustain loads incurred on return to racing or jumping. While varied training activities are bene cial to skeletal health, training for sport speci c activities is a neces- sary component to be competitive without injury. A key strategy for increasing skeletal tness and optimizing performance is to manage the relationshipbetween the rate of accumulation of bone damage with repetitive loading and the rate that damage canbe repaired. Injury occurs when damage accumulation exceeds damage repair.11Adaptation occurs when damage repair exceeds damage accumulation. T h er a t et h a td a m a g ec a nb er e p a i r e dt h r o u g h remodeling is time limited. Osteoclasts remove dam-aged bone material very rapidly (within days to weeks). However, osteoblasts are much slower at rebuilding high-quality cortical osteons (requiring months). In the healthy equine athlete, the timerequired for healing can be prolonged by adverse con- ditions (such as continued loading on damaged bone material), but the time required for healing cannot be shortened less than the time for normal repair. Consequently, the goal is to keep the rate of damageaccumulation below the threshold for repair. O n ek e yt om a n a g i n gt h er a t eo fd a m a g ea c c u m u l a - tion and extending the fatigue life of bones, that is,the likelihood for training and competing without injury, is to manage the load level that horses incur with each stride or athletic maneuver. Known strat-egies include managing hoof conformation (e.g., avoid long toe underrun heel hoof conformation) ing (e.g., avoid unbalancing the hoof with asymmetric traction devices), which can increase the lever arm of the ground reaction force about the fetlock. 24,25 Another strategy is to minimize the magnitude ofthe ground reaction force that is transferred fromthe ground to the hoof through selection and man- agement of arena and race surfaces. 26-29Because of the exponential nature of the relationship betweenload magnitude with damage and fatigue life, manag- ing the load to the limb during each stride or activity Fig. 10. Left panel, Distal condyles (top) and radiographs of sagittal sections (bottom) at the level of the yellow lines on the condyles illustrate the progression of (1) sclerosis mediated adaptation to increased loading (left), (2) subchondral bone osteopenia secondary to damage resorption with an intact subchondral plate (middle), and (3) extensive subchondral resorption with collapse of the articu- lar surface (right). Right panel, Articular cartilage collapse secondary to loss of subchondral support manifests as irreversible osteoarthrosis. Fig. 11. The nature of the relationship between number of loads required for bone failure is nonlinear, with the highest loads having a much larger effect than low loads.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 100 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGScan have a large effect on risk for skeletal injury.30 Other strategies include managing the intensity of the activity (e.g., height of jump). The second key to managing the rate of damage accumulation is to manage the rate of loading, that is, the number of repetitions of an activity (e.g., strides,jumps, piaffes, cattle worked, etc.) over time. Eachloading event incurs some level of bone damage, withthe severity of damage related to the magnitude ofl o a d i n g .T h er a t eo fl o a d i n g - p r o d u c e dd a m a g em u s t be less than the rate of repair. And the bone must be allowed to recover, that is, repair the damage andadapt. Further, stimulation of adaptation by gradualincreased or altered loads will enhance resistance todamage accumulation. Training -Adaptation or Injury Skeletal adaptation occurs through a biological response to a stimulus created by a load that exceeded the level or intensity of recent load events. The stimulus causessome level of damage that transiently weakens theskeletal structure or material. 4W h e nt h ed a m a g ei s nondestructive and further is allowed to repair, the skeleton will respond to the stimulus by adapting to become stronger and more resistant to damage with arepeated bout of the same load. Training ideally pro-duces a subsequent stimulus of slightly greater magni-tude after tissue adaptation peaks. Over time, theathlete increases in tness and achieves optimal per- formance without injury (Fig 12). 31 When the loading bouts are too frequent, recovery (repair of damaged tissue) is not achieved. Subsequentloading bouts further weaken compromised tissue byincurring additional damage, which is magni ed by the imposition of a stimulus on already weakenedtissue. Monitoring Injury Risk Through Changes in Training Intensity Insight into the infl uence of training on propensity for adaptation or injury can be further attained fromhuman sport. 31A common approach to assessing risk for injury is to examine the acute:chronic workload Fig. 12. Conceptual visualization of training frequencies that either increase (top) or decrease (bottom) tness. Top, A stimulus (load) tran- siently decreases strength (reduced capacity). Adequate recovery time allows for adaptation and increased capacity. The subsequent load transiently decreases capacity; however, this capacity is still above the original capacity level. The related adaptive response further increases capacity. This sequence of training events enhances tness. Bottom, When consecutive stimuli are administered too frequently, there is insuf cient time for recovery and adaptation. Consequently, the second stimulus is applied to compromised (reduced capacity) tis- sue. The result is even further damage and further reduced capacity. This sequence of training events promotes injury. From Soligard T, Schwellnus M, Alonso J-M, et al. How much is too much?

Conceptually, the acute workload is thought to represent \"fatigue \"from recent events, and the chronic workload is a refl ection of \"tness. \"31If the acute:chronic workload ratio is low, the athlete is considered t for the recent activity. If the acute:chronic workload ratio is high, the athlete has had a recentincrease in workload or intensity of training. A high acute:chronic workload ratio has been associated with higher risk of injury than a low ratio. However, the \"U\"-shaped relationship between workload and injury dem- onstrates that both inadequate and excessive workloadsare associated with injury (Fig. 13). 33 High-Risk Times for Injury Three general causes of injury typically occur in 3 re- spective high-risk periods for injury. Injuries related to insuf cient conditioning to increasing levels of exer- cise occur early in the course of training and competi- tion. The rate of increasing level of training exceeds the rate that the skeleton can model and adapt to sus-tain the increasing loads without injury. In race-horses, humeral, scapular, and tibial stress-fracture-related complete fractures commonly occur early in aracehorse 's career 34-36and are consistent with injury after a high increase in training load observed in human athletes.37 Insuf cient conditioning may also play a role on injury risk after return to training after layup and rehabilitation.38-40If an athlete returned to their pre- vious level of training after reducing their workload during rehabilitation, their risk for injury would increase because of the rapid rise in workload after deconditioning during rehabilitation (Fig. 14).38-40 Horses that sustain a stress-fracture-related completehumeral fracture commonly incur this fracture within10 to 21 days following a return from layup. 41It is im- portant that the physical capacity of the athlete is maintained during rehabilitation.40 At the other end of the spectrum, injuries can occur from excessive workloads (Fig. 12). Injuries due to overtraining occur later in a horse' s career .I nr a c e - horses, fetlock proximal sesamoid bone injuries Fig. 13.

For sport horse industries, consideration should be given tocompetition schedules relative to the number ofhorses available for competition to allow horses totrain and compete at a level that allows for recov-ery and adaptation after events. For horses with injuries, consideration should be given to the activ- ities during rehabilitation and their infl uence on deconditioning and reconditioning of skeletal structures relative to the cardiovascular, respira-tory, and muscular systems.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 104 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSAccounts Receivable -Culture, Process, and Impact Robert P. Magnus, DVM, MBA Accounts receivable (AR) management is not dif cult if everyone is aligned with the processes and policies of the business. Taking a proactive approach with accounts will improve cash flow and the overall nancial health of the practice. Take the time to make AR a priority throughout the practice with all employees and stakeholders. No one likes to work for free or chase after outstanding AR from the hard work of the staff and doctors. Author 's address: 1025 AAEP. 1. Introduction One of the key drivers for a sustainable practice is healthy (low) accounts receivable (AR). The businessmay be growing at incredible rates, yet if the AR istoo high, cash is not accessible. Available cashdirectly affects the ability to proactively move thepractice forward by investing in staff and new oppor-tunities. Cash flow impacts the ability to pay bills, repair and buy new equipment, hire a new associateand staff, and can signi cantly hamper pro tability if AR is poorly managed. This presentation will delveinto the cash flow implications of accounts receivable using case examples and sharing dashboard ideasand metrics like average days AR to help ne-tune this important operational item. The presentation details, case examples, and sample tools in the slidedeck will be provided after the presentation. 2. Discussion The importance of AR is obvious, and yet why do manypractices struggle? The answer is straightforward andtakes effort: the business needs the right processes in place, a positive culture, and all staff including the doc-tors aligned to be successful. In this program the invoic-ing process, timing on billing, payment terms (the good,the bad, the ugly), and setting AR policies will be pre-sented in case report format. The impact of well-man-aged AR can be signi cant on many fronts. 3. Practice Culture A look at practice culture is another important factorwhen invoices are not paid. Culture refers to thebeliefs and behaviors that determine how a company'semployees and management interact and handle out-side business transactions like outstanding invoices.Often, a practice culture is implied, not expresslydened, and develops organically over time from the cumulative traits of the people the company hires.Successful practices develop their culture among ashared group of core values that guides behavior. Ifeveryone is not on board with process and policies, theoutcome will be less than ideal. Yes, just one person NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 105BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEwho is not aligned can be devastating to the practice cashflow and culture. 4. Cash Flow Whether keeping up with pharmaceutical bills or mak- ing the months payroll are struggles, understanding how AR relates to cash in the bank and the timing ofinvoices are important concepts. If a gap develops meaning bills are due and there is no cash, often AR is the problem. In essence if practices/practitioners haveto pay for medications before receiving money for using those medications (client invoices) it is hard to keep up with those bills and others in the practice. A cash flow gap (Fig. 1) will be reviewed in case presentations.5. Keeping Score Monitoring the business proactively is very important. The key is the word \"proactive. \"This is done with dening metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that help tell a story about AR. One of the best metrics is a measure called Average Days AR. Whencalculated monthly it provides a very quick snapshot of the practice. This KPI measures how many days it takes on average to receive money beginning from theday the service was provided. The calculation is in Fig. 2 For example, if payment terms for clients are net 30 days, KPI should never be above 30 days. Creating a custom AR dashboard (example in Fig. 3) that is monitored monthly will illustrate if AR policiesare effective. The result of proactive monitoring is an increase in cash flow and more. 6. Impact Finally, how does a poorly managed (low) AR impact the business? The lack of cash is obvious, Fig. 1. Cash flow Gap. Fig. 2. Average Days Accounts Receivable Formula. *EOM mean (End of Month).

Introduction Most veterinarians bring to the table a healthy sense of responsibility for their patients, a strong desire to heal them regardless of nances, and no particular love of difcultnancial discussions with clients. On the other hand, veterinarians also have amazing teams, from associate vets to support staff, that absolutely deserve to be well compensated and probably do not want to wait 90 days for that compensation. In fact, with theveterinarian and veterinary support staff wageincreases the profession has seen over the last year and a half (which are well deserved), and a paucity of equine veterinarians coming down the pipeline, it is critical tohave healthy cash flow to compensate them or there will ultimately not be staff to run the hospitals. One of the most important tenets of healthy cash flow is a healthy and low accounts receivable (A/R). An important metric that allows scaling of A/R is the dayssales outstanding, or DSO. This essentially meanshow many of a practice 'sd a y so fp r o d u c t i o na r et i e du p at any given time as unpaid A/R. M a n yp r a c t i c e sh a v eD S O sw e l li ne x c e s so f3 0d a y s , especially if they have traditionally not operated on apayment at time of service model. This has the follow-ing concerning implications for cash flow and business: 1. Hospitals with high DSO numbers are paying staff well before the client pays the hospital. Ifveterinarians are compensated on paid invoi- ces only, they may be waiting a long time to be paid as well. That is likely to be a source of discontent, especially if it is essentially thepractice 's fault that invoices are not being promptly collected on. This cash flow pinch may severely impact a practice 's ability to make facility improvements, purchase newequipment, etc. 2. Practices may be paying their vendors for products prior to the client paying them. In a perfect world, a hospital will have negotiated terms with vendors that allow them to collect from clients before the invoice comes due withthe vendor. This falls under the smart busi- ness concept of \"using other peoples 'money, \" which is the opposite of letting the clients use a hospital 's money free of charge! 3. The longer invoices are outstanding, the lower the chances they will ever be paid in full. Any-thing over 90 days is at signi cantly greater risk of default; Marsha Heinke estimates col- lection probability at 65% to 80%. 1 4. If partners are contemplating the sale of a practice at any point in the next few years, at the time of the practice 's sale, the A/R balance (especially anything over 90 days) may not bepaid out fully to the seller, meaning partners NOTES 108 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEcould be leaving a great deal of money on the table that really should have already beensafely in their bank account. 2. Solutions A practice acknowledges that their A/R could be healthier and recognizes it is important to improve it for the health of the practice. But where do managers even start on the process of improving it? First, man-agers should know the practice 'sA / Rm e t r i c sa n d start to evaluate and monitor them frequently andregularly. Awareness of the practice 's average A/R balance is a good place to start, but it can be tooeasy to excuse an A/R that has suddenly balloonedsince the practice had \"such a busy month last month. \"Managers should hold themselves more accountable, ideally, by taking the extra step ofdetermining their current DSO and watching itcarefully. DSO is easy to calculate. For any given period \u2014for example, the year \u2014take the A/R at the beginning of the period and the end of the period and average them. Take that average A/R /C2365 days and then divide by total gross income during that period. For example, if a clinic started 2022 off with $93,000 inA/R and ended the year with $74,000, the average A/R for the year was $83,500. Multiply $83,500 /C2 365 days = $30,477,500 and then divide by the prac-tice's gross income for the year, e.g., $4,000,000. Your DSO is 7.5 days. A key step in reducing DSO is to bill at the time of service rather than at the end of the month. How can a manager transform a practice from an end of the month billing paradigm to payment at the time ofservice? Remember this is a process, and not an over-night one, especially if a practice has successfullytrained their clients over the course of decades that they can pay whenever they please. One way is to start with new clients, and as the practice gets morecomfortable with this, it becomes easier and just partof the routine. 1. First, and most important, get the practice team and veterinarians on board by educatingthem on the importance of the change, and setDSO goals \u2014maybe even with rewards for the team when they are reached. 2. Work with the practice 's support staff to establish clear expectations of clients that arecommunicated and acknowledged in writingin advance of care. Ask every new client to puta credit card on le; they will be sent a pay- ment agreement that must be completed priorto any services being provided. The agreementshould allow the practice to charge that creditcard upon completion of services or after aquick veri cation with the client with a total before it is processed. Note that this willrequire that the practice have a systemcompliant with payment card industry stand- ards for saving the credit card to avoid liability for fraud. Ideally, staff members should nothave access to the card number itself but justhave a portal that allows them to identify the card by the last four numbers and run it with the client 's permission. Portraying this to cli- ents as a convenience and time saver for themgenerally is well received, and many of them seem to love to tell us to \"just put it on the card. \"Some large farms or accounts may not wish to do this, but if 80% of clients can be put on this system, the improvement in cash flow and time an A/R team will save will beremarkable! 3. Develop accurate and comprehensive estimate templates for all commonly performed proce-dures or conditions that require hospitaliza- tion and require the low end of the estimate as a deposit. Require that hospitalized patientinvoices be paid every 48 hours so they do notgrow and grow and surprise clients, and require that the full balance be paid at the time the animal goes home. Some clientsbecome a lot less understanding and apprecia-tive of the work that went into a $2500 colic hospitalization bill 30 days after the fact. This may require dedicating more staff to keepinvoices updated so that they are ready at thetime of discharge or use of an electronic white- board that makes invoicing more automated and accurate. 4. Make invoicing quick for the doctor/assistant team by using bundles or therapeutic pack-ages in a practice 's software such that a com- monly performed procedure can be invoicedout in 2 minutes. If veterinarians or staff arenot creating invoices for clients until the endof the month, every other measure becomes a moot point. And what are the odds they are going to remember the three extra tubes ofbanamine and 28 tubes of GastroGard theypassed out at the end of a farm call to Mr. Smith a month ago? 5. Completely eliminate or greatly tighten up the practice 's internal payment plans. Very few veterinarians make good bankers. In-stead, have actual banks do the banking. CareCredit and Scratch Pay are two of many banks that would love to take over that A/Rand know how to do it. Yes, they charge the practice a little more than a regular credit card, but increase fees enough to cover thatand move on. 3. Discussion Recruitment of equine veterinarians has increas- ingly become a challenge in part because of the com- paratively low compensation the equine eld offersBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 109compared to small animal veterinary practice. A key factor in improving practices 'protability and ability to appropriately compensate their veterinar- ians is reducing A/R. When managers get weak in the knees, they should remind themselves thatalmost no small animal veterinarians allow anysort of billing and in fact think equine practitionersare resistant in this respect. Or they should con-sider their dentist, who is likely excellent at gettinga signed estimate for any work they propose forpatients and certainly does not let them walk outthe door without payment of the estimated after in-surance responsibility. More attention paid to goodbusiness practices will ultimately improve the sus-tainability of equine practice.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Equine veterinary practice is highly rewarding, but it is not an easy career and equine ambulatory prac-tice can be a hard way to make a living. Managingthe business while juggling the challenges of dailyappointments in addition to emergencies is dif cult. Consequently, the overall success of any practice issometimes determined more by business skills thanveterinary skills. This paper will discuss some proc-esses that may help facilitate collecting money attime of service and therefore keeping accounts re-ceivable low. 2. Materials and Methods Develop a Culture of Collection It's important to develop the culture of collecting pay- ment at time of service early in your career. This is a philosophy that should be in place at the start of yourbusiness. Both solo practitioners and group practicescan establish this culture. Young veterinarians, dueto their high debt load, are often better at thinkingabout being paid, so harness their motivation and thatenergy. In a group practice, foster a team approach bytalking about accounts receivable and strategizingeasy ways to get paid, but have one person leading thecollections strategy. Take Time to Work on Your Business It's hard to say no to a horse in need, and sometimes you won 'tb ea b l et o ,b u tt a k i n gt i m et od e v e l o pa n d maintain your business and carry out an accounts re-ceivable strategy should also be treated as an emer-gency. Set aside a day to work on the business (i.e., noappointments). Set that expectation with yourself andyour clients. Manage Expectations During the appointment scheduling call or text, havethe receptionist give the client an estimate and get averbal approval that the estimate is agreed to. Duringthe appointment, keep the client informed of thecharges, and when recommending other treatments,make sure they know how that will affect the bill andget verbal approval to continue.

Introduction As the equine veterinary industry faces unprece- dented rates of attrition, in combination with an historically low entrance rate of veterinarians into theeld, practice owners 'focus must be on retain- ing current employees. Studies have shown psy-chological safety within the workplace to be one ofthe most important factors leading to team effec-tiveness, learning behaviors, and employee satis-faction in organizations where knowledge work isrequired. 1,2Additionally, the presence of psycho- logical safety within an organization can clearly becorrelated with company performance.3The objec- tives of this discussion are to introduce the ideaof psychological safety to veterinary professiona-ls, provide evidence that including psychologi-cal safety within a workplace will help decreasestaff turnover and increase staff productivity, andintroduce methods to implement this idea in a vet-erinary organization.2. Solution Psychological Safety: What It Is and What It Is Not Psychological safety is de ned as the belief that the work environment is safe for interpersonal risk tak- ing.1It has also been explained in the following way: \"Psychological safety is a condition in which you feel (a) included, (b) safe to learn, (c) safe to contribute,and (d) safe to challenge the status quo - all withoutfear of being embarrassed, marginalized or punishedin some way. \" 4Globally, studies have shown that only 47% of all employees feel that their workplacesare psychologically safe.5 A work climate where candor is allowed and expected, mistakes are forgiven, asking for help is notseen as a weakness, and questioning current normscan occur without fear is the basis for a psychologi-cally safe environment. Once this culture has beenestablished, team members often begin to feel moreengaged, innovative, and productive. It should also benoted that creating this environment is an active NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 113BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEprocess, not a set-it-and-forget-it task. The effort to make an organization safer must be championed by the leadership team. Owners and managers who are able to be vulnerable enough to display these behav- iors are imperative to creating a workplace culture that actually adopts the ideas of psychological safety. The term psychological safety may sound soft. It is far from that. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant describes it this way, \"What you're aiming for on a team, is a commitment to high standards and thepsychological safety to be candid with each other as you try to achieve them. \"6It does not mean that peo- p l en e e dt ob en i c ea l lo ft h et i m e .I ti sn o ta b o u tp u t -ting all of your trust in one key person. It is not about decreasing the standards to which you hold your employees. In fact, once team safety has been estab- lished, the opposite is true of most of these myths. Instead of walking lightly around someone 's feelings, when there is an atmosphere of established psycholog-ical safety, candid discussions can be held more easily. Once the team has developed a safety net that does not rely on a single person or speci c instance, per- formance goals can increase for everyone. Whenexpectations are not met, the environment of mutual respect and vulnerability allows for frank discussions about how to improve performance. Mistakes and fail- ures are also reported sooner, allowing for earlier cor- rection or intervention. According to Dr. Amy Edmondson, a pioneer in this eld, \"psychological safety sets the stage for a more honest, more challeng-ing, more collaborative, and thus also more effective work environment. \" 7 3. Discussion The practice of veterinary medicine is certainly the type of environment where learning and collabora- tion are required for success. Veterinary clinics alsodenitively fall under the category of VUCA; this is what Dr. Edmonson calls a company that confrontsvolatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. She has proven that psychological safety is directly tied to the bottom line of any VUCA organization due to the fact that \"employee observations, questions, ideas and concerns can provide vital informationabout what is going on - in the market and in the organization. \" 7 It is not a dif cult jump to make the assumption that employees who are more engaged are of morebenet to an organization. This idea has been well- studied in human healthcare in relation to costs andmedical errors. \"Disengaged employees lead to safety risks and staff turnover. Turnover means higherrecruiting and training costs, as well as a high per- centage of less experienced workers on staff. \" 7 Staff turnover costs contribute to a signi cant decrease in overall pro tability for veterinary prac- tices. According to Gallup, the annual turnover rate for all jobs in the US in 2017 was 26.3% and the cost t or e p l a c ea ne m p l o y e ec a nr a n g ef r o m5 0 - 2 0 0 %o f their annual salary.8Veterinary practices actuallyhave a much higher range of turnover rates, ranging from 30-50%.9The 2021 AVMA Economic State of the Profession Report states that 38% of veterinarianshave considered and 25% are seriously consideringleaving practice. Forty-seven percent of those veteri-narians cite work culture as a top reason for leavingthe profession. 10A 2020 study out of the UK showed that 43.7% of veterinarians surveyed reported thatt h e yw e r el i k e l yo rv e r yl i k e l yt ol e a v et h e i re m p l o y -ment within two years. Top reasons for their desire toleave included work-life balance, management, andsalary. 11 The data is clear in af rming that teams with high psychological safety also have higher performancemeasures. 1-4\"At a general level, employees who are highly engaged in their work roles not only focus theirphysical effort on the pursuit of role-related goals, butare also cognitively vigilant and emotionally con-nected to the endeavor. \" 12An in-depth example of this work is a multi-year study of teams at Google, whichwas code-named Project Aristotle. Of all the attributesthat helped explain team performance (clear goals, de-pendable colleagues, personally meaningful work, anda belief that your work has impact), a team was nevermeasured to be \"high performing \"without the pres- ence of psychological safety. 2These outcomes can be explained by the fact that interpersonal safety withina team allows for increased learning, collaboration,and innovation. When psychological safety is not pres-ent, \"people at work are not only failing to speak up with potentially threatening or embarrassing content,they are also withholding ideas for improvement. \" 7 Additionally, in healthcare-speci c settings, employ- ees who feel as though they work in a psychologicallysafe environment are able to support and bond withpatients more easily, are able to provide better clinicaloutcomes, and are more easily able to learn fromfailure. 13 How to Do It Building a framework of psychological safety is the responsibility of leaders at all levels in an organiza- tion. In the context of veterinary medicine, in partic-ular, an important place to start involves the ideaof Leadership Inclusiveness. Edmondson describesthree behavioral attributes of inclusive leaders: theyare those who are approachable and accessible, theyproactively invite insight from staff and employees,andnally, they admit their fallibility. Designing structures that allow for input and invite participation is an important aspect of being an acces-sible leader in a psychologically safe organization. Nolonger being seen as a boss who has all of the answers,but instead, one who is looking for contributorswith crucial knowledge and insight is a necessaryreframe. Another important step toward approach-ability is to clearly outline the values of the company.If employees share these values, it is easy for them toalign their purpose and contribution to the organiza-tion 's values. With that, the values must have clear,BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 114 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSactionable behaviors that are continuously demon- strated and reinforced by leaders. A key tool used by inclusive leaders is proactive in- quiry. This is de ned as \"purposeful probing to learn more about an issue, citation, or person. \"7Developing a genuine interest and concern in other people 's responses to a question is an imperative start to the formation of psychological safety. It is human nature to assume that one has a good sense of the organiza- tion, when in fact, the realities faced by employees areoften very different than those of the management team. Cultivating team collaboration encourages a broader perspective for all. A powerful question gener-ates deeper curiosity and invites creativity while channeling attention and forward progress. Thenal characteristic of an inclusive leader is the ability to admit fallibility. By personally demonstrat- ing vulnerability, admitting that mistakes are a part of innovation, the team is then allowed to have an open discussion regarding trials and failure. \"Al e a r n - ing mindset, which blends humility and curiosity \" diminishes the risk of being the boss who thinks they know it all. 7By destigmatizing failure and reframing it as a way to learn and improve performance, leaders a r ea b l et os h o we m p l o y e e st h a tt h eo r g a n i z a t i o n 's values are upheld while still focusing on personal andprofessional improvement. Google' s re: Work platform offers a concise sum- mary of additional ways to foster psychological safety within your team. 14Included are veterinary examples below each idea. 1.Demonstrate engagement *During weekly team meetings, a practice owner would be fully present and focused on the team 's discussion. They would ask follow-up questions,offer input, and be interactive to demonstratethat they are truly listening to any concerns thatare brought up during the meeting. \"It makes total sense that you 're struggling with getting Coggin 's test submissions completed since we are down a team member in the lab. Instead ofwaiting until the end of the day to start processingthe bloodwork like we 've always done, perhaps you could start entering them as soon as they aredropped off by the different veterinarians.\" 2.Show understanding *When a problem is brought to a veterinarian 's attention (owner hears from associate vet or as-sociate vet hears from technician), the veteri-narian recaps what they 've just heard, validates that they understand how that issue could becausing negative feelings, and asks questionsabout how to help the person move forward.\"Ih e a rt h a ty o u 're feeling really frustrated about Client X always calling your cell phone after hours. We have made her aware of our emergency line pol-icy. Do you have any ideas on things we could say to her to ease the pressure she puts on you? \" 3.Be inclusive in interpersonal settings *A practice owner must be available and approachable. They could make speci co fce hours where drop-in visits are encouraged, or t h e yc o u l ds e ta s i d et i m et om e e tw i t he m p l o y - ees individually. *A veterinarian could also share information about how to best communicate with them: \"I do really well with email but have a hard time processing face-to-face meetings without a little bit of prep. \" *Expressing gratitude for the team 'sc o n t r i b u - tions is also crucial during group gatherings. Take this time to be speci ca n de n c o u r a g e others to share their wins as well. 4.Be inclusive in decision-making *A practice owner has been approached by apharmaceutical rep with a great deal on a new vaccine product. It would require changing the practice 's current protocols and reminder sys- tems. The owner solicits input from the veteri-narians about how hard the protocol change will be for them in the eld and also asks the front of c es t a f fi ft h e yh a v et i m et og ot h r o u g h the entire patient list to change the reminderstatuses. The owner would then take into account the cost savings as well as the effect onall of their employees before making a nal de- cision. 5.Show con dence and conviction without appearing in flexible *During a clinic-wide staff meeting, the practice owner and practice manager thank everyone for the effort that was made on a recent socialmedia campaign that was launched to generate new business for the newly built hospital. They admit that while much effort went into thisidea, no change has been seen in the number ofreferral cases over the past two months. The management reassures everyone that business is doing well but they are still pursuing otherways in which to involve the local veterinar- ians.

An Important Note for All Veterinary Medical Professionals While the role of a veterinarian denotes a certain level of leadership within any organization, a speci ci n d i - vidual may not always be the decision-maker. If one wishes to advance to the level of psychological safety within the organization without support from the top, there are speci c actions that can be taken. Asking questions with good intention and actively listening to other people 's ideas conveys respect and reinforces the idea that all members of the team are valued.Being vulnerable, interested, and available shows a willingness to take an interpersonal risk; this will demonstrate an effort to create psychological safety within the smaller group dynamic. Creating a small space of safety and excellence within the larger con- text of the organization will make an impact on theeffectiveness of that speci cs u b g r o u p . The Enduring Work In the veterinary workplace, where stress is high, col- laboration is key, and clinical outcomes are depend- ent on well-functioning teams, psychological safety is crucial. Once the leadership team is active in creating this environment, focus then shifts to providing anappreciation for the rest of the team 's contributions of candor and feedback. If standards of safety and inclu-sion are not met, clear action should be taken againstthose who are unwilling to contribute to the collective environment. Team leaders must continually encour- age and reinforce the goal of progress, not perfection.If they can stay open to new ideas and feedback, thereis no doubt that management will see the bene to f more engaged and productive employees when evalu-ating their nancial bottom line.

Introduction Integrating a new graduate into practice is an excit- ing and rewarding, yet challenging, prospect. Athriving mentorship program has distinct steps andtimelines, clear advancement between steps, andregular meetings to assess progress while providingconstructive feedback. Recognition of challenges andsetting realistic expectations are vital to creating astrong mentorship program. This presentation willsummarize the challenges that exist for integratingnew graduates into practice and give clear recom-mendations for overcoming these challenges. 2. Challenges Certain challenges exist for all doctors, regardless ofexperience level, when starting at a new clinic: newsoftware, new team members, new protocols and work-flow, and new inventory. These issues affect the ef - ciency of any veterinarian, much less one fresh out ofschool. The challenges for a new graduate are com-pounded by issues speci c to them alone including adjusting to work flow in private practice as compared to the university setting, new interpersonal dynamicswith clients, other doctors, and support staff. Expectations of case workup in private practice often differ from the university experience. Newgraduates can become frustrated when a de nitive d i a g n o s i si se l u s i v e ,a n dg o l d - s t a n d a r dt r e a t m e n tis not an option. Case workups will often take moretime and can lead to frustration on behalf of both staff and clients. Communications, both with clients and peers, are a soft skill that takes time and experience to develop.Often, a new graduate can get sidelined by certain overeager types of clients or bulldozed by stronger personalities. Newer graduates may not have experi- ence being leaders in an established workplace and may struggle with giving direction to support staff. Lastly, a new graduate may get over-scheduled due to increased demands on the practice. Over-schedul- ing, or scheduling without needed support, can ham- per growth of veterinary skills and con dence. A busy practice that needs doctors to see cases may not sched-ule the new doctor in a way that increases their con - dence with practice flow, equipment use, and case workup. 3. Solutions Organizational Organizational strategies in staf ng and scheduling should be utilized to mitigate some of the ef ciency challenges. Assigning an experienced technician with a new graduate will increase ef ciency when nding medications and supplies in the practice vehicle, offertechnical support when setting up and utilizing equip- ment, and provide guidance when using practice soft- ware. Additionally, when faced with a stressful case, it's helpful to have an experienced assistant. \"Dr. NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 117BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEWright, would you like me to clip this wound for you? \" is a nice reminder of what needs to be done when the new practitioner may be feeling overwhelmed. A senior clinician checking over medical records and billing upon case completion will help train thenew graduate in practice billing policies, as well asmedical record style, and expedite con dence in these tasks. University-setting medical records are oftenlonger and more detailed than what is practical in theeld. This also provides the opportunity for case dis- cussion, and a chance to dissect how the appointmentwent outside of earshot of the clients. Scheduling Setting realistic time management expectations of the new doctor is integral for success in practice, especially when it comes to the length of time it may take for caseworkups at the start of a career. This is relevant forboth staff who schedule time for appointments, as wellas the new doctor for working within the designatedtime frame. Allotting more time for appointments atthe start of employment will ensure the new doctor willn o tf e e lr u s h e do ru n a b l et oc o m p l e t et h e i rd e s i r e dc a s ework up. This also decreases the chances of being lateto other scheduled appointments, which can start arelationship with a new client in a stressful manner. Inthe author 's experience, an additional fteen minutes per routine appointment provides an adequate buffer.By giving the new graduate time to sharpen theirexam routine, basic technical skills, and client commu-nication including history taking, treatment recom-mendations, and expectations, their chances of successon future \"re-engine days. \"will be increased. The author 's practice has successfully used a graduated appointment schedule for a new doctor,accounting for both appointment type and timerequirements. This allows for the growth of bothskills and con dence. Using the phased approach gives the doctor time to establish relationships withminimal on-site hiccups, which will increase the ac-ceptance of the doctor by the clients. The timing ofeach phase listed below is practice-dependent andshould be modi ed to best suit the needs of your practice. An example for a graduated schedule ofappointments is below. \u0081Phase 1: Shadow other doctors for both routine and emergency cases, meet clients, learn farm locations, practice using software, write medicalrecords and billing for cases seen with senior clini- cian; senior clinician to revise/edit for complete- ness of record and accuracy of charges. \u0081Phase 2: Schedule solo basic wellness and simple appointments; these provide opportunity for direct client interaction and communication in anon-stressful environment with a high likelihood for success and con dence-building. Examples of these appointments include vaccines, routine dentals, bandage changes, lasers, shockwaves./C14A senior clinician still double-checks records/ billing for completeness. /C14Emergency coverage can be added once allparties feel comfortable and the new doctorhas appropriate back up if needed. /C14In the author 's practice, the new doctor accom- panies senior clinicians on emergencies for six months and then begins to take primary emer- gency coverage; during this time, a senior cli- nician is available by phone and able to meeton the farm if needed for assistance. \u0081Phase 3: Continue to schedule complex cases/equipment with senior clinicians (lameness, gas-troscope, etc.) even as the new doctor increases the frequency of seeing their own appointments. Joint appointments with a senior clinician willprovide increased exposure to dif cult cases and examples of client communication while simulta- neously building skillset and con dence. /C14The newer doctor is responsible for writing medical records while the senior clinician pro-vides a nal review. /C14The newer doctor should take charge as muchas possible in these appointments with thesenior clinician present for advice and supportas needed. Communications Fostering effective client communication skills should begin with the opportunity to practice callbacks on routine cases. This allows the new doctor to becomecomfortable speaking with clients while simultane-ously reducing the pressure of communicating a diag-nosis and treatment plan. Ensure that when they are working with other clinicians that they are present for the entire workup and conversation and notdistracted by cleaning or putting away equipment.Remember that a new doctor is not a technician.Witnessing another clinician 's client communication is where they will pick up case-related communicationskills. Triaging ER phone calls is often stressful fornew doctors. Doing so succinctly and successfully takestime, experience, and practice. Answering the daytimeemergency calls for the practice is an opportunity tohave these types of conversations while still havingthe support staff and other clinicians available forquestions and assistance. Case Outcome/Expectations Helping the doctor navigate the gray area of case workups will help them form new roadmaps to case resolutions in the context of general practice asopposed to the university setting. Limitations ofequipment in the eld, client budget, and practicality of treatments are all topics that can cause stress andinsecurity to a new graduate coming from theBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 118 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSuniversity. Discussion of best on farm options avail- able will help create con d e n c ei nc a s ew o r k u p sa w a y from school. Directing doctors to the medical records of similar cases is a good, low-effort way to compare notes. Weekly or bi-weekly case rounds allow discussion ofcases and an opportunity to ask questions that mayhave arisen once off the farm. Using a Skills Matrix A skills matrix and a timeline helps new graduates reach expectations while ensuring that certain skills or case types don 't get overlooked. A timeline is neces- sary to ensure accountability, but flexibility is impor- tant. Clear metrics are imperative to chart progress toensure that the doctor has had enough opportunitiesto become pro cient. For example, if a new graduate has only seen two colics in two months, this meansthey are likely not feeling as comfortable with that skillset simply due to a lack of exposure. Amending the timeline and creating other opportunities to prac-tice those skills ensures the graduate has enoughchances to become comfortable with a particular skill.This may seem like extra work for the practice but gar-nering the skills that are needed to operate independ-ently early on with guidance will create con dence on behalf of both parties. A skills matrix displays the skills or competencies needed, along with the current and desired pro ciency level. At regular check-ins, both the supervising clini-cians and the new grad rate the new grad on eachskill. Any discrepancies in perceived skill levels areaddressed. The author' s practice holds these reviews monthly. Plans of action are established to ensureopportunities to practice skills- What opportunities forl e a r n i n g / p r a c t i c ea r ec o m i n gu pi nt h es c h e d u l et oh e l pll in some of the gaps? Are there upcoming clinics? Is there a broodmare herd or a supportive client that canbe utilized? The skills matrix in Figure 1 was derived from the AAEP Core Competencies list. 1It was then broken into several larger categories, such as routine proce-dures, radiographs, dentistry, nerve blocks, euthana-sia, and soft skills. Soft skills include tasks such as\"write clear discharge instructions in lay terminol- ogy, effectively and brie fly communicate treatment plans over the telephone, converse with farriers aspeers about a case. \"Paperwork is a category that is often overlooked. Paperwork skillsets should includeuploading and completing a Coggins and health cer-ticate, submitting lab work appropriately, upload- ing radiographs, processing payments, and other practice-speci c administrative tasks. Giving Feedback Providing effective feedback to a new graduate is the cornerstone of growth and improvement. Although varying personality types will receive and respond to feedback differently, following general guidelines is helpful for mentors. First, ask if the doctor is open tohearing some feedback. This ensures an open mindsetfor constructive thoughts. When providing feedback, Fig. 1. Examples from skills matrix (the complete document is available upon request, cara.wright.dvm@gmail.com).BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 119utilizing a structure that reinforces the good while pro- viding suggestions for improvements will maintain a positive outlook on the situation and increases the like- lihood that the recipient will stay open to the feedback given. Using af rmative statements help the new doc- tor become aware of areas of emerging strength, andcan build con dence. An example of an af rmative statement is \"patient assessments were accurate\" or \"identi ed appropriate treatments for likely diagnosis. \" One method of providing constructive feedback involves using the structure \"What went well ...but even better yet. \"Questions such as \"What did you do well? \",\"What do you wish you had done differently? \", and \"What did you learn? \"are all helpful when debrie ng a situation. Giving feedback in a timely manner is also imperative to keep the content fresh and action items ready to be implemented. 4. Conclusion By using the techniques outlined above, every practice can successfully integrate a new graduate into theirpractice by providing clear expectations, timelines for improvement, and constructive feedback. This willbuild con d e n c ea n de n a b l et h en e wg r a d u a t et o become an integral part of the practice sooner rather than later.

MacKenzie, DVM Maintaining good medical records in equine practice regardless of discipline is necessary from many stand- points: medical, legal, regulatory, and ethical. This paper will provide a review of these concepts so that equine practitioners can evaluate their current format against these standards. Author 's address: AVMA Trust, 1931 N Meacham Road, Suite 106, Schaumburg, IL 60173; e-mail: vetmack98@gmail.com. \u00a92022 AAEP. 1. Introduction The importance of producing and maintaining good medical records in equine practice cannot be overstated.While medical records have always been a legal require-ment of veterinary practice regardless of practice type, they also represent an equine veterinarian 's defense should a lawsuit or board complaint arise. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP)has addressed this critical topic in the past focusingon the nuances of equine practice as a hindrance inthe record keeping process as well as how to create alegally defensible medical record. 1Recently, AAEP 's Ethics Committee has highlighted the need of goodmedical records as part of several excerpts in their\"Ethical Practice \"series. One article discussed medi- cal records having an increased accountability in race-track practice and that traditionally this type ofpractice has used invoices only as part of their recordkeeping. 2Another \"Ethics in Action \"segment looked at a veterinary license defense claim where a stateveterinary board ned an AAEP member for not having medical records.3Lastly, The AmericanVeterinary Medical Association 's (AVMA) Professional Liability Insurance Trust (PLIT) has seen an increase in the number of malpractice claims and board com-plaints in the US in recent years.4,5 The AVMA PLIT program has been reviewing mal- practice claims since the early 1960s. During this time, the program has identi ed four key principles to help veterinarians minimize the likelihood of a mal- practice claim or a board complaint. One of the fourprinciples revolves around medical records and theneed to maintain good documentation in practice. The other principles are practicing good medicine, keeping people and patients safe, and practicing good commu-nication. In reviewing equine malpractice claimsthrough the program, the author has observed thatequine veterinary medical records have historically contained less information than what is required by most state licensing boards. So, due to the rise in bothmalpractice claims and board complaints, equinepractitioners may be at a disadvantage from a defenseperspective should they have a lawsuit led against them or be subject to a veterinary license defenseclaim. NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 121BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE2. Medical From a medical standpoint, records exist for document- ing examinations, treatment, communication, and the continuity of care. Records should be accurate, clear, and timely. Whether handwritten or digital, they mustbe legible and easy to follow. A SOAP (subjective, objec- tive, assessment, plan) format is highly recommended. Minimum requirements for medical records vary fromstate to state based on the state 's veterinary practice act. Equine practitioners should review these require-ments against their current practice to see if the mini-mum information is being captured in their current record keeping format. If practitioners are licensed in multiple states, medical records should meet the stand-ard of the state with the most requirements. Complete and legible medical records are imperative both in hospi- tal and in ambulatory practice. The quality of care willbe judged on the documentation within the medicalrecords. Documentation should show sound professional judgment based on information available at that time. For example, if a lameness exam is done with nerveblocks or joint blocks to localize the affected area, a thor- ough understanding of the results, i.e., percentage of lameness improved, should be documented to justify therecommended course of treatment. In addition, good documentation will ensure continuity of care should the horse be moved or treated by another equine veterinar-ian. A good rule to follow is that any equine practitioner who reads a medical record should be able to pick up where the last veterinarian left off with treatment ofthat horse. Items to include in medical records are writ- ten consent forms, anesthesia logs, surgery reports, physical exam ndings, daily boarding sheets, reproduc- tion exams, diagnostics recommended and declined by the client, lab results, estimate sheets, and all communi- cation including texts, e-mails, voice messages andverbal conversations. The practice owns these records,including original radiographs. The client of the records is entitled to copies upon request within a reasonable time period. Consult your state veterinary practiceact for speci cs regarding providing records to clients. And remember to check with your state veterinarypractice act as to ALL speci c record keeping require- ments, including how long records should be maintained (see below under regulatory for an example of a state veterinary practice act). Lastly, medical records also arean open component of communication practices. Dep- ending on what record keeping system is used in the practice, texts, emails, voicemail messages, social mediaposts, and verbal conversations should be captured and maintained as part of the medical record. Documented conversations around risks help show informed consentparticularly if a compounded or off-label medication is going to be used. 3. Legal Medical records are a legal document and are required to be maintained under the law of the state practice act. From a defense standpoint, if something was notwritten in the medical record, it did not happen. Equine practitioners can bene tf r o mu s i n gaS O A Pf o r m a tt o avoid legal pitfalls. Licensing boards and attorneys pre-fer to see medical records in the SOAP format, and they should be accurate and up to date. Using a medical soft- ware system that has time and date stamps is prefera- ble. If doing ambulatory work, utilize a system thatsyncs automatically, and if it does not, then have the re- cord updated within 24 hours of the last visit. Many state practice acts will stipulate a timeframe in which a record must be updated. Amendments should also be date and time stamped along with the justi cation for the amendment. Telemedicine is being utilized more fre-quently by equine veterinarians and this type of technol- ogy has many bene ts both to the practitioner and the client. These visits should be maintained in the formal medical record. Guidelines around telemedicine con- tinue to evolve and practitioners need to be aware of the legalities of utilizing telemedicine in their state. Most states and the AVMA Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics (PVME) still require that a valid veterinary-cli- ent-patient relationship (VCPR) exists in order to diag- nose, prescribe medication, or treat an animal. aThe AVMA has resources on telemedicine and these should be consulted to ensure that current methods are within the legal scope of practice for the state(s) that the veteri- narian is licensed in.bFinally, the medical record is not only a legal document, but also a con dential one and veterinary practices need to ensure that client con den- tiality is maintained. Medical records should only be released to the client upon request. Some states have seen amendments to state practice acts in this area of condentiality to allow for more transparency within horse racing jurisdictions among trainers, veterinarians,and regulatory authorities. 4. Regulatory Horse racing is just one area where veterinary medi- cal records are used for regulatory purposes. The increase in oversight on many racetracks has cast a spotlight on the medical record keeping practices of equine racetrack practitioners. This is one area where historically, the medical records were comprised mostly of invoices which represents a violation ofmost state practice acts. The increase in regulatory requirements on many racetracks has brought aware- ness to the medical record keeping area of racetrack practice with many practitioners now believing the lack of detailed medical records as substandard prac- tice.2State licensing boards regulate veterinary medi- cine through enforcement of the veterinary state practice act. Licensing boards may nd in favor of the veterinarian 's medical treatment based on a license defense claim but will issue a ne for lack of proper medical records since the board has access to reviewall the medical records when a client complaint is led. This is where equine practitioners need to be aware of the minimum record keeping requirements for their state and address their current format of medical records against this standard. For example,BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 122 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSbelow is the veterinarian patient record keeping sec- tion of the Texas Veterinary Practice Act.c \u0081Current through Reg. 47, No. 6; February 11, 2022, this is a summary of the important points: 8A legible document identifying the client, species,breed, sex, description, and patient history 8Name address phone number 8Prior client records 8Ancillary test results including laboratory, imag- ing, procedures 8Differential diagnosis 8Treatments which include dates, including call backs and returns 8Appropriate controlled substance documentation 8Alternative therapies and referrals 8Outcomes 8Ofcial health documents 5. Ethical Keeping good medical records is a matter of ethics. Equine practitioners have always understood the medi- cal, legal, and regulatory reasons behind good record keeping but may not have considered that keeping good medical records also represents an aspect of ethics. TheAVMA PVME includes language on medical records and the need to comply with standards established by state and federal law, which as listed in the above sec-tion includes speci c requirements for record keeping. a Equine practitioners have Ethical Guidelines from theAAEP, and under the Standards of the Profession, prac-titioners are to \"comply with the laws, regulations and standard of care of their appropriate jurisdiction. \" cThe AAEP, as previously mentioned, has included this topicwithin their \"Ethical Practice \"segments. Dr. Dunlavy is quoted in one of these articles as saying \"the account- ability of complete medical records is an ethical goalthat we should all strive for.\" 2 6. Research One bene t regarding keeping good medical records, particularly electronic records, is the potential for doing research. Medical records represent a wealth of information that when catalogued into a format thatallows for data mining can be very bene cial in pro- viding valuable information to the profession in termsof research papers. One publication reviewed a methodfor mining electronic medical records citing that exploi- tation of clinical experiences within electronic medicalrecords has the potential to revolutionize veterinarymedical research. 6 7. Summary Medical records are a necessary part of equine clinical practice and practitioners need to be aware of all the medical, legal, regulatory, and ethical reasons forproducing and maintaining good medical records inpractice. These reasons should be evaluated carefullyamongst equine veterinarians to ensure that their cur-rent record keeping formats are meeting all standards, especially in current times where veterinarians are hav- ing to defend themselves more than ever due to the ris-ing number of malpractice claims and board complaints.Should an equine practitioner be faced with either an al-legation of negligence, demand for monetary compensa-tion, or a board complaint, they should seek guidancefrom their professional liability carrier.

Grice, VMD, MBA With planning beforehand, dif cult conversations can be less stressful and more productive. Author 's address: PO Box 192, Virginia City, MT 59755; e-mail: amyvmdmba@gmail.com. \u00a92022 AAEP. 1. Introduction Difcult conversations take place frequently in most people' s lives, whether to resolve con flict, voice dis- agreement, or share feedback that may be hard for the recipient to hear. People generally fall along aspectrum in their comfort level with crucial communi- cation. Many people fear con flict and avoid it when- ever possible. At the opposite extreme, some have a pattern of high-con flict behavior that increases con- flict rather than reducing or resolving it. Still others are aware of their own biases in perception, communi-cate their feelings without dif culty, and are nei- ther judgmental nor reactive. This presentationwill explore each of these patterns, offer a frame-work for having dif cult conversations, and sug- gest best practices for achieving the desired result. 2. Discussion Many dif cult conversations arise due to con flict or disagreement between two parties. Disagreementscan be over values, motivations, perceptions, ideas,desires, and/or behaviors. When a con flict triggers strong feelings, a threat to a core need is often pres-e n t .T h e s ec o r en e e d sa r et of e e ls a f ea n ds e c u r e ,t of e e lr e s p e c t e da n dv a l u e d ,a n d / o rt oc o n t i n u et oh a v eastrong relationship. Con flict resolution allows people tond a peaceful solution to a disagreement among them. The disagreement may be personal, nancial, political, or emotional, but it arises from two partieshaving different needs or desires. When a disputearises, often the best course of action is negotiationthrough conversation to resolve the disagreement.These dif cult conversations can build increased trust and stronger relationships when they are handledwell. Conflict Avoidance Conflict avoidance is common among those in the helping professions. Those who are con flict avoi- dant view con flict as a threat to their survival and so they often have an instinctive reaction to stayfar away from dif cult conversations. Often early experiences in their lives have created a people-pleasing behavior that expresses itself as a fear ofupsetting others. They expect that speaking theirtruth will make things worse and expect negative out-comes if they share their thoughts, opinions, and feel-ings. Sometimes they ignore the issue by simplydenying it exists. They may detour the issue by NOTES 124 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEpivoting to a new subject. Commonly, those who are unnerved by con flict may simply shut down and withdraw. At work, these employees are generally seen as \"nice \"and have a reputation for never causing con- flict.1As a partner or an associate, this can look like going silent and enduring uncomfortable situa- tions instead of expressing issues openly until enough pressure has built up that they explode. Explosions are rarely effective conversations. Inaddition, some con flict avoidant people talk inces- santly about their issues with others but neverwith the person with whom they have an issue.This triangulation is unhealthy and lowers morale in the workplace. Maslow 's hierarchy of needs is a pyramid. After the basic needs of food, water, and shelter are met, safety and security are next in importance. Follow- ing these are love, acceptance, and belonging. 2 Human behavior is shaped by seeking to ll these needs. When acceptance and belonging are missing,loneliness, depression, and anxiety often follow. It makes sense that people who have experienced lackof acceptance of their ideas or feelings will try to avoid feeling this way again. It challenges their core need of feeling valued, safe, and secure. People wantto belong, and fear being ostracized. This leads to fear of con flict. When people who are con flict-avoidant encounter a difcult situation with others, they have a reaction in their limbic system, preventing them from think-ing clearly. They simply want to flee, as their heart beats faster and blood surges to their muscles to help them run faster to survive. Sometimes people actually leave the physical location as fast as they can. When a practice owner has this tendency, theiremployees are typically frustrated that they cannot be heard. When employees have this trait, they typi- cally store up resentment because they are afraid totell their truth and either poison the well with trian- gulation or nd another job. Being comfortable with con flict management is essential for a healthy business. According to Stuart Hearn, \"It can take time to change company culture, but it 's worth it in the long run. Help your employees reframe con flict as something constructive. We don' t want con flict to be aggressive or unnecessarily con- frontational, but debate and disagreement can be use-ful and bene cial for business. It can help if you demonstrate to your employees that management val- ues variance of opinion. Employees should feel on solid ground and be secure in the knowledge that ifthey stand up against an idea or process, they won 't have to worry about their job. \" 3 High-Conflict Personality Unfortunately, there are some individuals who makeeffective communication very dif cult due to possess- ing a high-con flict personality trait. People who exhibit high-con flict behavior have a pattern that increases conflict rather than reducing or resolving it. Thispattern repeats in almost all situations in disagree- ments with many different people. It is important to recognize that the cause of the escalation of the inter- action is not the actual issue that prompted the con-versation but is the person 'sh i g h - c o n flict personality and how they approach problem-solving. Typically, someone who has a high-con flict person- ality will exhibit a pattern of blaming others, zero-sum-game thinking, and extreme emotional out-bursts. 4The intensity of the blaming behavior is often unreasonable for the type of disagreement and maybe particularly harsh when directed at those inauthority or those who are close to them. It stemsfrom the heightened degree of threat that they feel.Because they feel as though they might not survive ifthey don 't prevail, they focus on attacking and blam- ing someone else, often in extreme ways. In contrastto their blame of others, they usually see no fault inthemselves and see themselves as free of all responsi- bility for the problem. Whatever early experience they have had that has shaped them presents as ght rather than flight. 5 Because those with this personality trait tend to react rather than taking time to analyze the situa-tion, hear different points of view, and consider sev-eral possible solutions rationally; compromise andflexibility seem impossible to them. Due to the high threat that they feel by not being in total control ofthe outcome, they often predict extreme outcomes ifothers do not handle things the way that they wantand react in extreme ways, even quitting a job orending a relationship suddenly. This heightenedthreat response also explains their often very emo-tional outbursts that can include intense fear, anger,yelling, or disrespect that can be quite surprising.Afterward, they may have regret but also may defend their actions as totally appropriate. 5Because of these individuals, not all efforts at effective com- munication will be successful. High Self-Awareness Those with healthy responses to con flict generally have high self-awareness and can comfortably speakto others with whom they disagree. They recognizethe importance of considering the other party 'sc o n - cerns, understand that their perception is not theabsolute truth, and are able to empathize with thosew h os t r u g g l em o r ew i t hc o m m u n i c a t i o n( F i g .1 ) . Mindfulness has been shown to help effective com- munication. It is a speci c state of attention which involves a constant focus on what is happening atthe present time in a way that is neither judgmental nor evaluative. Components of mindfulness include observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity. In a study of mindful-ness, relationship quality, and con flict resolution strategies used by partners in close relationships,the researchers found that acting with awareness,dialogue, and avoiding con flict escalation strategy were predictors of relationship quality. 6TheseBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 125same qualities are key tenets of effective con flict resolution. Resolving Conflict with a Difficult Conversation Conflicts continue to fester when ignored. Because ac o n flict involves a perceived (or occasionally real) threat to a person 's well-being and survival, the resulting discomfort persists until the problem is faced and resolved. People respond to con flicts based on their perceptions of the situation, not nec-essarily with an objective review of the facts. Perceptions are in fluenced by a person 'sl i f ee x p e r i - ences, culture, values, and beliefs. Con flicts trigger strong emotions. If one isn 'tc o m f o r t a b l ew i t h strong emotions or is unable to manage one' so w n emotions in times of stress, resolving con flict suc- cessfully will be dif cult. It is best to think of con flicts as an opportunity for growth. When a person can resolve con flict in a rela- tionship, the experience builds trust. People feel more secure knowing their relationship can survive chal- lenges and disagreements. With multiple successes, previous life experiences that led to con flict avoidance or high-con flict personality can begin to have less power. Seeking counseling to process these challenges can be life-changing for some. Successfully resolving con flict depends on the ability to manage stress quickly, control emotional responsesand behavior, pay attention to the feelings being expressed by others, and be aware and respectful of differences. Some of the most important informationexchanged during con flicts is communicated nonver- bally. Nonverbal communication is conveyed by emo-tionally driven facial expressions, posture, gesture, pace, tone, and intensity of voice, and makes up 70-90 percent of the total message received. Being mindful of non-verbal signals is part of facilitating the most effec- tive interchange. If one of the parties insists on nding solutions that are strictly rational, while ignoring feelings,their ability to face and resolve differences will be impaired. Emotional awareness helps a person understand what is troubling another person and understand what is really troubling themselves. It also assists them in staying motivated until theconflict is resolved, communicating clearly and effectively, and in fluencing others to a maximal extent. Working hard to see the situation through a differ- ent lens, the lens of the other party, builds empathyand more effective resolution of con flict. When a per- son demonstrates genuine caring about others 'out- comes, obviously values a future relationship, and aims for mutual gain, fear decreases. By focusing on w h a ti si nc o m m o nr a t h e rt h a no nd i f f e r e n c e s ,a n dinterests (e.g., why you want it) rather than positions(e.g., what you want), the more successful one will bein meeting the needs of all parties. This is also facili-tated by an open exchange of information between sides, and an enlargement of the bene t of agreement through innovative ideas. The following is a recipe for conducting a dif cult conversation. Completing the difcult conversation worksheet (Table 1) 7is recom- mended prior to the conversation. Before having a dif- cult conversation: \u0081Ask yourself what you really want. What is your desired outcome? \u0081Stop assuming the worst and acting in ways that con rm your \"story \"and looking for evi- dence that con rms your story. \u0081Ask yourself what the other side of the story might be. Nothing ruins a good story like hear- ing the other side. \u0081Ask yourself what role you might have playedin the situation. What is your responsibility? Setting the stage for having a dif cult conversation: \u0081Distill all the behaviors that illustrate the problem into a statement of the real issue, as you see it. \u0081Invite the other party to a private safe spaceand be ready to have the conversation immedi- ately even if you are trying to schedule it at a future time. \u0081Think about the conversation as a negotiation where everyone 's needs matter. During the dif cult conversation:Healthy Responses Unhealthy Responses The capacity to recognize and respond to the things that matter to the other personAn inability to recognize and respond to the things that matter to the other person Calm, non-defensive, and respectful reactionsExplosive, angry, hurtful, and resentful reactions A readiness to forgive and forget, and to move past the conflict without holding resentments or angerThe withdrawal of approval, resulting in rejection, isolation, shaming, and fear of loss of personal or professional relationship The ability to seek compromise and avoid punishingAn inability to compromise or see the other person's side A belief that facing conflict head on is the best thing for both sidesThe fear and avoidance of conflict; the expectation of bad outcomes Fig. 1. Healthy and unhealthy responses to con flict.BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 126 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS\u0081Start with the facts as you see them. \u0081Describe the gap between your desired outcome and the current reality. \u0081Share your story and ask for theirs. \u0081Ask clarifying questions, using re flective listening. \u0081Listen with an open mind and open heart. \u0081Listen for what is felt as well as said. \u0081Make con flict resolution the priority rather than winning or \"being right \". \u0081Focus on the present, not on the past. Concluding the dif cult conversation: \u0081Brainstorm options. \u0081Agree on a plan of resolution. \u0081Ask if there are missing details or unresolvedissues. \u0081Stay flexible. If other issues come up, consciously decide whether to and when to address them. \u0081Agree to check back in. Other thoughts: \u0081Pick your battles. \u0081Be willing to forgive. \u0081Know when to let something go. Adapting Communication for Conflict Avoidants and High- Conflict Personalities Conflict avoidants 'fear can sometimes be allayed by speaking to it directly, such as by saying \"I know this is hard/uncomfortable for you, but I care about our relationship/this practice/your success,and I hope you will hear me out. \"Another method is to frontload the approach with a positive senti-ment to minimize the other party 's defenses. For example, \"Dr. Jones, I am really impressed with how much positive energy you are bringing to thepractice, and I want you to know that it is helpingthe whole team. This makes me happy every morn-ing when I see everyone in a good mood. \"Then talk about the issue. \"I was surprised and hurt whenyou told Mrs. Smith that my proposed treatment for Fluffy was \"old school \"a n dy o uc o u l do f f e r something more effective. I wish you had talked tome about your concerns instead. \"Without this thoughtfulness, one might be inclined to say \"How dare you call me \"old school \"and insult me to a cli- ent! Who do you think you are! You 'v eg o tal o to f nerve for someone just a few years out of school! \" 8 The rst example is respectful and allows Dr. J o n e st oh a v ea no p p o r t u n i t yt oe x p l a i no ro w nh e rbehavior, make things right, and salvage the workrelationship. It offers an off ramp to de-escalatethe issue and prevent it from happening again inthe future. The second example is a more aggres-sive confrontation that seems to label Dr. Jones as a bad person and suggests her position at the prac- tice could be in jeopardy. With the heightening ofthe threat level that she feels, Dr. Jones is morelikely to be hurt, defensive, and shut down withoutreflecting on her own behavior. This may lead to her withdrawing and beginning to search for a newposition before her worst fears come true. By pro-viding the space for the person who is being con-fronted to explain their perspective, clarify amiscommunication, or own a misstep, the experi-ence can be the r s ts t e pt o w a r dac o n flict avoidant learning that they can emerge from a disagreement with relief rather than disaster. With those people who possess high-con flict per- sonalities, the challenge is greater. At their worst, these individuals are narcissists or have borderlinepersonality and may utilize emotional blackmailregularly to get their way. Narcissistic personalitydisorder is a mental condition in which people havean in flated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, trou-bled relationships, and a lack of empathy forothers. Behind the fa\u00e7ade of extreme con dence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to theslightest criticism. 9Borderline personality disor- der is a mental illness that severely impacts a per-son 's ability to regulate their emotions. This loss of emotional control can increase impulsivity, affecthow a person feels about themselves, and nega-tively impact their relationships with others. 10Table 1.

Typically, this means the blackmailer setsup a comparison, induces guilt or obligation, andfollows with a threat. It is important to understand that emotional blackmail is an attempt to meet unmet needs, manage fear, and maintain control. 11 Fear, obligation, and guilt (FOG) are what emo-tional blackmailers rely on for successful manipu- lation. Receivers feel fear of consequences, obli- gated to act, and guilty for not doing what they 've been asked. The blackmailer quickly learns whichparts of the FOG triad are most effective in manip-ulating an individual; they learn which emotional triggers work best. Emotional blackmailers are of- ten very good at spotting the people who are likelyto respond to these tactics the best. 12Unfortunately, compliance guarantees repetition, so one must resist, de- spite feeling urgent need for relief from the blame and emotionally reactive storm. The receiver experiencesrelief when they comply: feelings of fear, obligation, andguilt recede, so they are rewarded for complying. Butthis then means the blackmailer will double down on this behavior. To disrupt emotional blackmail, one must be cu- rious about the unmet needs of the blackmailer, must nd empathy for them, and must want to change the dynamic. This requires remarkableemotional control, but if one is prepared in advance and understands the manipulation, overcoming the storm is possible. 11Part of the preparation involves determining where one 's weaknesses will allow the high-con flict individual to gain traction. Understanding one 's\"hot buttons \"will provide the self-awareness to divert the emotional response(Table 2). Unfortunately, people with a high-con flict personality may leave one unable to manage a con-frontation effectively, despite one 's best effort and preparation. They may appear enraged or shockedand create an endless drama with no productive reso-lution. In this case, it may be appropriate to end theemployment relationship. A person who is incapableof resolving con flict productively may have deeper issues that are intractable and often lead to a spiralof distrust and animosity.3. Conclusion When careful thought is given to the desired out-come, responsibility is taken for one 's part in the sit- uation, and both empathy and curiosity are thefoundation of the communication, better outcomes are often assured. By recognizing the legitimacy of conflicting needs and perceptions, an increase in trust and respect is realized. In the event one is expe-riencing repetitive dif cult conversations with a high-con flict individual without satisfactory resolu- tion, severing the relationship may be the most pro- ductive path.

These tools include developing a professional identity, broadening one 's perspective, drawing and honoring boundaries, and successfully managing the transition between work and home life. Authors 'address: McKee Pownall Equine \u00a92022 AAEP. 1. Introduction Most veterinarians are by now familiar with the 2016 AVMA-AAEP Survey of Equine Practitioners1that revealed troubling statistics about the current state of the equine industry. Many young practitioners are choosing not to renew their equine association mem-berships within the rst 5 years of practice, and fewer graduating veterinarians are choosing to enter equinepractice (5.7% in 2003 vs 1.5% in 2018). Endeavoringto understand this trend, Dr. Amy Grice 's2 0 2 0s u r v e y on Leaving Equine Practice 2revealed that veterinar- ians who choose to leave practice do so because of thelifestyle and required work hours (58%), obligation tocover emergency calls (53%), low compensation com-pared to small animal counterparts (52%), mentalhealth concerns (46%), and the culture of the equineveterinary industry (37%). As an industry, equine medicine requires substan- tial change to address rates of compensation and theeconomics of practice, safety, and the accepted cul-tural norm of how the industry operates. Whileindividual veterinarians are not able to address theseindustry problems on their own, it is possible for indi-viduals to reframe their involvement in the industryand have more control over how the stressors ofequine practice affect them on a personal and profes-sional level. Mindfulness Originating in Eastern philosophy, mindfulnesshas been de ned in various ways, the core of which describes a phenomenon where participants cultivatefocus and awareness on both internal and external stim-uli. Jon Kabat-Zinn, 3perhaps one of the Western world 's most famous mindfulness researchers, describes mind-fulness as \"the awareness that emerges through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment bymoment. \"The opposite scenario, not being in the present moment and functioning in a state of mindlessness,leads to feelings of discontent, increased stress, and aninability to recognize the subconscious behaviors thatcreate this state. 3 NOTES 130 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEOver the last decade, mindfulness has received sig- nicant attention, both in mainstream popular culture and the scienti c literature, particularly due to the well- documented evidence that mindfulness contributes to psychological well-being, mental health, physical health, and overall understanding of self. Unfortunately, a gap remains in the understanding of what mindfulness is, as it is narrowly associated with the image of a meditat- ing Buddha, perfectly posed while in deep concentration. Although meditation is the most common tool to develop a mindfulness practice, activities such as yoga, body scan techniques, breathing exercises, and tai chi can ac- complish the same goals by teaching nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness. While it may be dif cult for some, it is important to remember that mindfulness is askill that is learned over time with repeated practice. The impact of mindfulness in practicing veterinar- ians has been scarcely evaluated. Quanti able data have been gathered to investigate the relationship between mindfulness and resilience in veterinary stu- dents,4the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on veterinary students,5,6and the impact of mindful- ness on attention and rumination in veterinary stu- dents.7However, there has been little investigation into how practicing veterinarians are actively usingmindfulness to impact their daily work lives. As such, this research seeks to understand how equine veteri- narians describe the impact of mindfulness as it relates to their ability to adapt to the unique chal- lenges of equine veterinary medicine in the long term. 2. Methods Social scientists study the nuance of human experi- ence through rigorous qualitative research methods. As such, a qualitative study design was chosen to understand the experiences of equine veterinarians who use mindfulness, as numerical data do not always capture participants 'perceptions of their own experience. Social media platforms and email listservswere used to solicit participants. Inclusion criteria were limited to practicing equine veterinarians whoactively use mindfulness to support their daily work life. Fourteen veterinarians were interviewed using a semistructured technique with open-ended questions. Most resided in the United States (13/14), with one participant from New Zealand. There were two male and 12 female veterinarians. Most participants had greater than 10 years of clinical experience (13/14) with one intern veterinarian who had two years of ex- perience. The 13 experienced veterinarians found mindfulness practice later in their careers, whereas the intern veterinarian had developed these skills prior to entering vet school. In addition, most experi- enced veterinarians had not received mental health, well-being, or mindfulness training in veterinary school, whereas the intern veterinarian had reported some degree of training in veterinary school on these topics. Interview responses were transcribed and coded using NVIVO software. First-order codes were group-ed to identify second-order themes, which included rea- sons for pursuing mindfulness, cultivating an aware-ness of self, developing a broader perspective, drawingand honoring boundaries, building life and career resil-iency, and improving subjective well-being. The studydesign was approved by the Research Ethics Board atthe University of Guelph for protection of humanparticipants. 3. Results Several key ndings were identi ed across the inter- pretive analysis. Veterinarians reported that theirmindfulness practice: -Supported professional growth and the develop- ment of a professional identity by practicing nonjudgmental awareness and self-compassion. -Enabled the development of a broader perspec-tive that has both clinical and professionalbenets. -Facilitated setting and maintaining boundariesthat support a sustainable practice. -Was undertaken to improve subjective well- being and develop life and career resilience, leading to the desire and capacity for veterinar-ians to stay in practice. 4. Discussion: Building a Toolbox for Sustainable Equine Medicine When asked why they pursued mindfulness training, many veterinarians felt a sense of desperation in prac- tice, reporting an inability to cope with life and career stressors, symptoms of burnout, and a desire to take bet-ter care of themselves and their families. Participantsfelt they did not have the mental and emotional toolsnecessary to cope with equine practice, leading many toconsider alternative career choices. In adopting mindful-ness, participants strongly believed that it was whollyor in part responsible for developing key skills that sup-ported their professional toolbox for sustainable equinepractice. 5. Tool Number 1: Developing a Professional Identity The concept of a professional identity, or professional self-awareness, is rarely discussed in veterinary medi- cine. Although most veterinary programs now includea focus on developing soft skills such as emotionalintelligence and communication, there appears to be agap in professional self-development and transforma-tional self-awareness training. The consequence isthat new practitioners struggle to understand the im-portance of these soft skills and fail to implementthem into practice life. Furthermore, seasoned equinepractitioners have received little training in thisregard, and this has partly contributed to the currentclimate in equine practice.BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 131A professional identity is an inherent sense of self that includes an understanding of personal and professional motivations, boundaries, values, goals, strengths, and weaknesses.8Symptoms of a poorly dened professional identity include seeking valida- tion and self-worth through professional interactions,9 self-blame when cases don 't turn out as expected, struggling with imposter syndrome, having unrealis-tic expectations of one 's knowledge and abilities, feel- ing a need to work all the time, worrying about what clients and coworkers think of one 's personal charac- ter, and ghting a constant need to please people by always being available and responding to unreasonable requests. These symptoms were reported by nearly all participants at one point in their career, the result ofwhich was excessive stress and career dissastifaction. 8 A professional identity can be developed through transformational learning processes with the end goalbeing a heightened sense of self-awareness. For par-ticipants, the key factor that facilitated this growth was learning to not seek validation and self-worth through career success, a skill learned by practicing nonjudgment and developing self-compassion. Practicing Nonjudgment Learning to be nonjudgmental of self was a transfor-mative process that helped participants de ne their professional identity by knowing, understanding, and accepting a realistic picture of the scope of theirinvolvement in any situation. Nonjudgment is culti- vated through mindfulness as one learns the process of being aware of present-moment thoughts, behav- iors, and feelings, and accepting them for what they are without trying to change them. 10Without the practice of nonjudgment, the tendency to scrutinize, ruminate, and judge one 's role in a situation can lead to maladaptive coping mechanisms, heightened anxi-ety, and excessive stress.11B e i n ga b l et oc l e a r l yd e ne expectations of self based on current circumstances allowed veterinarians to accept themselves as they were, thereby learning to seek internal validation unrelated to career success. Developing Self-Compassion The second element that veterinarians felt contributed to their professional growth was self-compassion. Self- compassion has been correlated with the trait of non- judgment,4and the two constructs run parallel in impor- tance. Developing self-compassion allows one to respond to personal shortcomings, failures, and judgments with kindness, similar to how one would support a close friend.12Mindfulness is an important mediator of self- compassion because, in order to respond with kindness,one must rst acknowledge personal suffering through a mindful lens. Participants frequently noted that learning self- compassion played a signi cant role in learning not to seek external validation through their career. Thiswas particularly important when a mistake was made or things didn 't turn out as expected, as participants reported a tendency to blame themselves in thesesituations. Practicing self-compassion was imperative to accepting mistakes, learning, and moving forwardrather than spiraling into a cycle of shame and self-blame. Perhaps most importantly, developing self-compassion helped participants set realistic expecta-tions for themselves in tough situations, accept theirpersonal limits based on current levels of knowledge, and training, and reduce levels of imposter syndrome. Nearly all participants reported that the transforma- tive self-knowledge gained from their mindfulness prac- tice enhanced their professional sense of self. Learningto seek internal validation was imperative for reducingfeelings of stress, anxiety, and burnout, and signi - cantly contributed to remaining in equine practice. 6. Tool Number 2: Perspective Taking Perspective taking is de ned as the ability to see a sit- uation through another person 's point of view and is an important component of developing empathy and building relationships.13Particularly in physicians, perspective taking has been linked with improved patient care, improved physical well-being, and has apositive protective factor against burnout. 14This can easily extend to veterinary medicine, as there is oftensignicant dissonance between how a veterinarian would like to treat an animal and what the owner maywant or can realistically afford. This can create astressful situation, particularly for young practitioners,making the skills of nonjudgment and perspective tak-ing important. Reframing clinical expectations awayfrom \"getting the right answer \"to\"making a difference for this pet and this person \"can signi cantly change how veterinarians nd success in their days. This not only expands the range of possible outcomes availableto the veterinarian and client but helps to reduce thestress associated with owner constraints. Ak e yb e n e t of perspective taking is improved clin- ical decision making; learning to \"think outside the box \"was a skill that most practitioners were able to develop with mindfulness. Participants reported they were able to make more informed, pragmatic, and eth- ical decisions leading to more positive outcomes withsatis e dc l i e n t s .M i n d f u l n e s sa p p e a r st oi m p a c td e c i - sion making by regulating attention on the presentmoment, allowing for fair assessments of the perspectiveof all parties involved, and engaging in enhanced cogni- tive ability to make unbiased and ethical decisions. 15In equine medicine, this can lead to improved clinical out- comes for patients, less judgment of owner decisions,and improved compassion for individual circumstances.Veterinarians reported being more at peace with theirdecisions and carrying less resentment, anxiety, andfear of decision making, particularly when limited by owner nancial constraints. Interestingly, some partici- pants noted that this appeared to mitigate the effects of compassion fatigue, highlighting an important area offuture research regarding the impacts of mindfulness.BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 132 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSCurbing Ruminative Thoughts Rumination is a coping mechanism that involves exces- sive focus on unwanted thoughts. This may include recurrent analysis of situations with negative outcomes,stress-induced thinking associated with recent interac- tions, searching for meaning in negative situations, or overanalyzing thoughts, decisions, and actions.16This is particularly important for veterinarians as the tendencyto replay clinical cases, outcomes, and interactions with owners is common. As the professional expectations of veterinary school often set veterinarians up to seek per-fection and carry unrealistic expectations of themselvesand their abilities, rumination becomes a key coping mechanism that many veterinarians use to deal with the disconnect between expectations andreality. Rumination is perhaps one of the biggest hindrances to mindfulness and present-moment awareness, as bydenition ruminative thoughts are replaying past or future events. The combined ability to see a broaderperspective while practicing nonjudgment of self wasfound to be a powerful tool for interrupting distressingthought patterns. Mindfulness appeared to in fluence this by allowing people to recognize their thought pat-terns when they occurred, learn to nonjudgmentallyassess such thoughts and differentiate facts from c- tion (i.e., \"the story I 'mt e l l i n gm y s e l fv st h et r u t h \"), practice self-compassion, and be able to see how theirthoughts t into the bigger picture. Veterinarians described a newfound ability to let go of situations byshifting the internal dialogue toward less reactive andmore compassionate thoughts. This reduced stress lev- els, allowed for greater professional satisfaction, and allowed veterinarians to enjoy their personal timewithout being distracted by distressing, repetitivethoughts of work. 7. Tool Number 3: Drawing and Honoring Boundaries Learning to form and honor structural, emotional, and social boundaries, was an important theme that emerged across nearly all interviews. Boundaries areparticularly important for equine veterinarians astheir work life has a much higher tendency to merge with their personal life, and learning to integrate work and life in a sustainable way is important forwell-being, resilience, and career longevity. Manyindividual differences exist on the continuum of ac- ceptable boundaries, but mindfulness consistently facilitated the development and understanding ofwhat works for an individual in practice. Separating Work from Life by Managing the Transition Between Them In Dr. Grice 's 2020 survey,258% of vets leaving prac- tice cited excessive work hours and lifestyle as the main reason. Interestingly, despite being satis ed with their career choices, most participants still felt they didn 't have an acceptable work -life integration. That said, mindfulness taught them to reframe their perspective on their work -life integration, drawboundaries around what was acceptable and unac- ceptable, and most importantly, be present when engaged in both personal and professional time. For this group of veterinarians, their professional and personal lives appear to exist in separate spheres that don 't necessarily compete with each other as expected in the traditional de nition of work -life bal- ance. Integrating work and life successfully requiredrespecting the boundaries of both spheres, being pres- ent and in the moment when engaged in either aspect,and quickly transitioning between spheres with awareness when necessary. This resulted in higher personal and professional satisfaction from bothaspects of life, even if not fully balanced. Participantsreported that mindfulness was important in facilitat- ing their ability to accomplish this by learning pres- ent-moment awareness, and being able to do so was amajor step toward nding peace and longevity in equine practice. Creating a Practice That Works The art of saying no is an important skill that many veterinarians struggle to learn. Many participants discussed the dif culty of saying no to clients, particu- larly early in their career, and how this often led themto overextending their physical and emotional boun-daries. Interviewees reported that mindfulness helped them to acknowledge and prioritize their own needs, and this facilitated drawing boundaries and saying nowhen necessary. This led to more control over howthey spent their time, limited interactions with bad clients who were emotionally and nancially draining, decreased tolerance for clients who were verbally abu- sive or unreasonable, and provided less guilt or fear of potential consequences when saying no. Most impor- tantly, saying no allowed veterinarians to align them-selves with great clients who shared their values and respected their professional relationship. This had a direct impact on lasting professional ful llment and a desire to stay in practice. 8. Tool Number 4: Life and Career Resilience Mindfulness has been shown to predict resilience through the development of self-compassion,4,17posi- tive affect,18and nonjudgmental awareness,4and par- ticipants emphatically agreed that mindfulness was a signicant contributor to personal measures of resil- iency. Although there are numerous de nitions of re- siliency in the literature, to this population, resiliencewas de ned by learning to believe in a future that is good. Believing in the Future to Be Good Allowing oneself to believe in a future that is good, de- spite dif cult personal circumstances in the moment, appears to be an important predictor of resiliency. Although only a small number of participants reportedsuicidal thoughts at some point in their career (4/14), nearly all could recall very dif cult times when they were not sure how to move forward. Many believed thatBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 133mindfulness allowed them to nd a renewed passion for life by learning to believe in the future. This is particu- larly important for veterinary professionals given theincreased tendency for suicidal ideation. Mindfulnesshas been shown in the general population to be a protec- tive tool for curbing suicidal ideation through the devel- opment of a \"zest for life, \" 19indicating that mindfulness- based interventions and resilience training may play arole in helping to combat veterinary suicide. Career Longevity Linked with resilience is the concept of career longev- ity. Given the unprecedented rate of attrition from equine veterinary medicine, career longevity was theinitial focus of this research. Participants unani- mously agreed that mindfulness has in part extended their career to date, and in many cases, mindfulnesscompletely rede ned participants 'view of equine prac- tice such that they never want to stop. This seemed tobe facilitated by nding joy in practice, reigniting a passion for practice, being able to maintain perspec-tive on work- life balance, and perhaps most impor- tantly, gaining perspective on what individuals needon a personal level to be successful. 9. Tool Number 5: Improving Personal and Professional Well-Being Previous studies have suggested that the main factors that contribute to veterinary well-being include work environment, degree of autonomy, and levels of work.However, in this research, well-being was described as being in fluenced by factors that focused less on career and more on participants 'approach to life in general. These included developing a new focus in life, reduced negative affect, and improved physical health. A New Focus in Life When asked what mindfulness has done for them, participants frequently referred to a newfound focus in life. This focus was abstract and dif cult to de ne but appeared to be developed by learning to take careof oneself and \"nding a better way to do life. \"Vets commented that mindfulness \"changed my brain and my approach to life, \"\"let me be in control of my own thoughts, actions, words, and behaviors, \"\"helped me learn to prioritize me, \"\"helped me learn to accept where I am in life, \"\"helps me understand what is truly important, \"and \"makes me a better person and a better doctor. \"There was an overwhelming senti- ment that mindfulness was inextricably tied to partic-ipants 'overall well-being, and this greatly contributed to their desire to stay in equine practice. Reduced Negative Affect Negative affect refers to one 's subjective degree of dis- tress and can include states of anger, sadness, anxi- ety, guilt, and fear.20This group of veterinarians was prone to negative affect at points in their career, with many reporting pervasive feelings of sadness, anger,guilt, and shame prior to adopting a mindfulnesspractice. Although these feelings did not necessarily go away, mindfulness provided a tool to appropriatelydeal with these feelings so that they were less taxingto their mental health and well-being. Interestingly,negative affect has been shown to positively correlate with increased work hours and poor work -life integra- tion (workaholism), 21an important point for equine veterinarians to consider. Mindfulness has been shown to combat negative affect,21and a similar trend was seen among participants, as many reported feel-ing less angry, less resentful, and less emotionally re- active. Particularly in regards to work -life balance, reduced levels of negative affect helped veterinarians accept their work -life balance rather than resent the profession for what it demands. This positively in flu- enced participants desire to stay in practice long term despite long hours and dif cult working conditions. Improved Physical Health Health care workers with high levels of stress are prone to fatigue, poor sleep habits, heart and blood pressure problems, premature aging, cancer, mental health issues, and other health concerns.22 Mindfulness has been shown to be an effective treat- ment for a range of similar health conditions,10and a number of participants reported improved physicalhealth as a result of their mindfulness practice. The reported physical bene ts included reduced blood pressure, improved sleep patterns, improved physi- cality at work, improved ability to ward off or healfrom work-related injuries, reduced back pain, andreduced body tension. Most participants felt thatmindfulness allowed them to nd an appropriate bal- ance in life such that they could preserve their physi-cal health for the long haul. Especially given equineveterinarians 'propensity to work despite physical health bene ts facili- tated through mindfulness training positively impacted both subjective well-being and career longevity. 10. Conclusion and Practical Implications for Equine Practice It is well known that equine veterinarians struggle with mental and physical health challenges that increase their risk for burnout and leaving equine practice. This is the combined result of personal, pro- fessional, and industry stressors that need to beaddressed to support veterinarians over the longterm. Although achieving substantial change in theindustry is beyond the scope of this paper, thisresearch clearly supports the use of mindfulness in changing how personal, professional, and industry stressors affect an individual veterinarian. This groupof veterinarians described substantial improvementsin subjective well-being, resiliency, and career longev-ity by cultivating the tools required to create a sus- tainable career. Major bene ts included developing a professional identity through mindful self-compassion and nonjudgment; broadening one 's perspective, lead- ing to improved clinical decision making and aBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 134 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGShealthier perspective on both career and personal life; creating a sustainable practice with boundary setting; reframing work -life integration to be in the present moment and allow for maximum ful llment from both aspects of life; and cultivating a profound innerstrength and personal measure of resiliency. In conclusion, this research re flects the views of a group of passionate, mindful equine veterinarianswho are not only personally and professionally satis-e d ,b u tw h oh a v en od e s i r et ol e a v ee q u i n ep r a c t i c e . Given the issues facing equine practice, there is nogreater bene t for veterinarians, highlighting the potential impact of mindfulness training early in one 's career to support long-term health, wellness, and ca-reer success. Limitations of this research include a gender bias toward female veterinarians predominantly in the United States, where work attitudes and perceived work stressors are similar. Although younger gener-ations of equine vets are largely female, there is a large proportion of practicing male vets in other parts of the world that this research does not aptlyrepresent. Furthermore, given the qualitative nature of this research, there is a principal researcher bias in data interpretation and the possibility that partic- ipant responses were affected by the researcher 's presence. As there is no statistical representation, all conclusions represent the principal researcher 's interpretation of the data, and no statements canbe made about causality. 11. Resources Undertaking a mindfulness practice can be initially over- whelming, but it is important to remember that mindful- ness is a skill that needs to be learned and practicedregularly. There are numerous books and apps available that provide meditation training and prerecorded medita- tions to practice, in addition to scienti cally backed courses for mindful stress reduction. Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, creator of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society, has published many books onthe topic and created the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program. This 8-week program, initially developed for the University of MassachusettsMedical Center, has been widely researched for its numerous bene ts on stress reduction, physical health, and mental health, and is a great resource for people looking to get started. It is widely accepted as standard training in medical education for doc- tors, nurses, and psychologists. For those that nd meditation intimidating, yoga is an excellent place to learn about mindful movement and slowly ease into meditation concepts. There are many ways to practice mindfulness that don 'tn e c e s - sarily involve meditation, so trying different techni-ques (meditation, yoga, tai chi, breathing exercises,body scan techniques, etc.) that promote focused, pres- ent-moment awareness is important in understanding what works for an individual.Acknowledgments The principal author thanks Dr. Elizabeth Kurucz (Associate Professor of Leadership and Sustainability,Lang School of Business, University of Guelph) for herguidance and oversight of the research process.

Introduction It goes without saying that some degree of communi- cation with horse owners is a necessary part of doingbusiness in equine practice, but one would be hard- pressed to nd an equine veterinarian who wished to spend more time on the phone with current or poten- tial clients. This is especially true for demanding or high-maintenance clients that call multiple timesper day, expect every question to be answered with-out charge, or those where we might hope the call-back goes straight to voicemail. Some of us may evenemploy an app for just that purpose. For most equine veterinarians, time spent on the tel- ephone is not billed, yet we often spend signi cant por- tions of our day providing advice at no cost to clients.Time spent on excessive or prolonged calls is not onlynancially taxing but also emotionally and even physi- cally burdensome. One does not need to read manysocial media posts within private veterinary groups toappreciate that such conversations contribute to burn-out, lack of overall well-being, and even attrition fromequine practice. Compared to our small animal coun- terparts, equine veterinarians spend the least amountof time on billable tasks, the opportunity cost of whichis not insigni cant. Time spent texting or answering emails can be equally laborious, even more so if after-hour boundaries have not been established or enforced.While the focus of this presentation relates to tele-phone time, much of what will be discussed can be ex-trapolated to other forms of communication. As part of a large academic practice for over 2 deca- des, issues related to telephone time and wellnessbecame an increasingly signi cant concern over the years. The large number of residency programs withinacademia naturally yields a high turnover of doctorsand exposure to many communication styles. Mosthouse of cers are early in their career and highly focused on developing specialty expertise. This is notto suggest that all young practitioners lack communi- cation skills, as some are naturally gifted. The issue does, however, seem to be more prevalent amongyoung veterinarians, even more so with those wellindoctrinated into equine practice culture where the NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 137BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEclient comes rst 24/7/365. As we address the problem of attrition from equine practice, it is important for practice owners and senior associates to be aware ofissues related to excessive communications and tomentor accordingly. In multidoctor practices, newassociates or those early in their career rarely sharethese concerns with senior clinicians, often due to their perception that communication at all costs is expected for client retention. The purpose of this presentation is to increase a w a r e n e s so ft h i si s s u e ,w h yi ti si m p o r t a n t ,a n dto present ways to reduce telephone time/nonbilledhours in equine practice. Although based on experien-ces within a large academic hospital, excessive tele-phone time can be equally problematic in large, small, and even solo doctor practices, and strategies pre- sented can be employed across practice types. Thisdiscussion is not to devalue the need for quality clientcommunications within equine practice but to addressthe problem of excessive or prolonged conversationsthat reduce our ability to take care of our practice as well as our own professional and personal needs. 2. How Did This Evolve? Excessive telephone time is rarely an issue in small animal practice. With appointments stacked every 15 to 30 minutes, there is simply no time for prolongedphone calls, even more so when one considers thesheer number of cases seen in one day. Technicianphone calls (or resident/student phone calls in aca- demia) are a much more accepted means of communi- cation within small animal practice. In contrast, horseowners have been conditioned to expect to speak only with a veterinarian and frequently only with their specic veterinarian. While spending even 15 minutes on the phone with a small animal client is almost unheard of, it is not uncommon for some equine veter- inarians to engage in 30- to 60-minute phone callswith horse owners. As a result, we have trained ourclients that it is acceptable to remain on the phoneuntil every major or minor question is answered, oftenin the belief that such a show of dedication will resultin client loyalty and make them less likely to switch to a competitor. Perhaps we think we \"have the time \" because we are driving between calls. Regardless of the rationale, we are effectively devaluing our timeand expertise. And the next time they call, they willlikely expect the same level of attention whether weare driving or not. Admittedly, this issue is not new; it has been part of equine veterinary culture for decades. T h ed i f f e r e n c eb e t w e e np r a c t i c et y p e sw a sw e l l illustrated at last year 's AAEP convention during the panel presentation of equine veterinarians who hadleft equine practice. 1One of the panelists had recently transitioned from equine to a small animal practice in the same geographic area. She noted that clients who previously had no qualms contacting her via phone/text at any hour regarding their horse no longer did sowhen they had concerns about their dog/cat as clientsof her new, small animal practice. It is noteworthy that these clients exhibited signi cantly different behavior without the panelist establishing any \"new \" boundaries as a small animal veterinarian; strong evi- dence that it is possible and feasible to retrain our cli-ents, but we must also retrain ourselves as equineveterinarians. 3. Why We Must Address the Problem What is the opportunity cost of our time? The concept of opportunity cost is one of the r s tt ob et a u g h ti n any business curriculum, yet it is often overlooked by many professionals. Opportunity costs are what isg i v e nu pw h e nw ei n s t e a dc h o o s et op e r f o r mad i f f e r -ent task. For example, if we spend an hour on thephone during work hours, we are giving up billable tasks, such as lameness exams, taking radiographs, injecting joints, and so on. The value of that opportu-nity cost is what we could have earned during thesame time period, and that amount de nes what we should be charging for our telephone time. Even with- out a paying client, we should not be giving away this time unnecessarily. Opportunity costs could be any number of important tasks necessary for our practiceor our personal well-being, including downtime withfamily or friends or just relaxing for a few minutes. Itis not unusual to hear stories of equine veterinarianspulled away from dinner to talk to the same clientwith whom they already had multiple conversations during the day. There is little doubt on a repeated ba- sis that such instances contribute signi cantly to burnout within equine practice. It is equally important to acknowledge that when we give away our time, we are effectively eroding ourexpertise and reducing our value proposition, not onlyin the eyes of clients but also to each other as col- leagues. It could easily be argued that clients who keep us on the phone for extended calls have alreadyshown that they do not respect our time, even if weperceive them as \"nice. \"If we consider our physician counterparts, most of us would be hard-pressed torecall any telephone conversations with our own doc-tor. And if such phone calls occurred regularly or were prolonged, we might wonder why they were not busier and may even question their expertise. WhileCOVID-19 may have normalized telemedicine withinhuman medicine, and to some degree within veteri-nary medicine, most veterinarians have not kept up inour ability to capture these costs. We must move away from the thought that \"if I charge for telephone con- sults and my competitor does not, I 'mg o i n gt ol o s e that client. \"Instead, we must frame that conversation differently; if we don 't charge, we are further jeopard- izing the health of our industry. As mentioned previously, this issue extends beyond telephone time. When combined with texting, e-mail,and social media, unbilled time is a signi cant, and of- ten overlooked, contributor to poor salaries in equine practice compared with other sectors. 2When we rou- tinely give away signi cant portions of our time, weBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 138 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSalso model that behavior to new equine veterinarians. Not only do we perpetuate the problem, but we limit our ability to pay them a competitive or even livablewage. Proposed solutions to salary issues routinelyfocus on raising prices, with the counterargumentthat clients will leave for a less expensive competitor,assuming there is one. If instead we begin to trulyvalue our expertise and charge appropriately for allservices performed, including bill capture at the timeof service, we will reduce our subsidization of horseownership and may be able to offer more competitive salaries to our new entrants. 4. How to Address the Problem Recognize the Emotional Driver If this discussion resonates for you or others in your practice, the rst step is to recognize which emotion is triggered that contributes to the behavior. Perhaps itis a strong desire to feel liked, where the offendermight think, \"If I push the client off the phone, they won 't like me. If I don 't answer ALL their questions, they 'll go to someone else who will. \"Perhaps it is expected within a practice to do anything to keep a cli-ent happy (i.e., \"I fIa n s w e ra l lt h e i rq u e s t i o n s ,t h e y will respect my knowledge and remain loyal to the practice \"). Getting to the root of the problem for an individual veterinarian is important. Is it truly inex- perience, a desire to prove their dedication to clients,or a need to impress others with their dedication toequine practice in general or all of the above? This isan especially important consideration for practiceowners or other associates who may already be ef - cient/effective in their communications. Merely tellinga na s s o c i a t et or e d u c et h e i rt i m eo ne a c hp h o n ec a l li s unlikely to be effective without understanding the emotional driver behind the behavior. Set Goals What is the appropriate phone call duration? Thatwill depend on each practice, but a goal should be set.For anyone highly effective in their conversations,this might be less than 5 minutes. For others, settinga goal of no more than 15 minutes when a long phonecall is anticipated may be a good place to start. Lookat a clock when the phone call begins and watch the minutes. It will help. Listen and Practice to Develop Your Skill Set Perhaps you lack the skill set to appropriately end or shorten phone calls. Every group practice likely hassomeone who is an excellent and ef cient communica- tor. Listen to those colleagues during their phone callsor in-person communications. Recognize and emulatewhat they do to be so effective. Do they prep a client atthe beginning of their call for a limited discussion; thatthey only have a few minutes to provide an update or to discuss next steps? Do they transition the phone call into an appointment, especially with an exception-ally needy client? Ask for communication tips withinrelevant social media groups. These groups can be atreasure trove of advice and experience. Practice any key phrases out loud by yourself so that it becomes sec-ond nature. Practice again before making that call- back. Learn to Transition Calls to Appointments It is important to recognize that every client questionor thought does not need to be addressed in one phonecall (or e-mail or text). This does not make anyone a \"bad \"veterinarian. If a client routinely has excessive questions, inform them you only have a speci ct i m e - frame before you have to see your next patient (even ifyou do not) and that they should prioritize their most important questions. If you feel an appointment is necessary, then book that appointment where you canbill for that consult time and answer questions appro- priately: \"Hi Ms. Smith, I have just a few minutes before my next appointment, but I wanted to give you a quick update that Sassy 's bloodwork was slightly abnormal, so we 'll need to perform that ultrasound exam we discussed. I 'll have my receptionist contact you to schedule an appointment. That way you' ll have my full attention to answer all your questions. \" Alternatively, if a virtual consult is appropriate, then ask if they would like to make a telehealth appointment and share the fees with them. For those of us resistant to this idea, it may help to considerthat equine veterinarians have been performing vir- tual consultations for decades; we just haven 't been charging for this service. Communications Policy Every equine practice would bene t from developing a basic communications policy, even solo practitioners. Such a policy can be posted on the practice webpage and/or social media pages where it can easily be referred to if and when a client abuses your time. Thispolicy should set clear expectations of what you are able to provide and is an excellent tool to fall back upon when a boundary-pushing client complains thatthey are not getting what they need. First and foremost, the communications policy should set expectations for appropriate clientbehavior with allmembers of your team (use such terminology even if you are a one-person practice).At a minimum, it should state that all communica-tions must be collegial and respectful; that abusive or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and can result in client termination. Offenses could includeabusive language, social media attacks, excessive after-hours texting, or inappropriate use of a perso- nal cell phone (if that is not the accepted means ofprofessional communication). The policy should clearly state the type(s) of com- munication allowed by the practice (of ce phone, text, etc.) for regular appointments, emergencies, and infor- mation calls. For example: \"Requests for appoint- ments can only be made by calling (XXX)867-5309. Please note that requests made via Facebook mes- senger or other means of social media cannot be answered. \"Clients may still try to do so, but if youBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 139miss any requests and that client gets upset, the com- m u n i c a t i o n sp o l i c yi sa ne a s yt o o lt of a l lb a c ku p o n ,while also depersonalizing the issue at hand. In hospital settings, communications policies should also state the expected number of daily updates forinpatient cases. For example: \"Updates will be pro- vided once daily for stable, noncritical inpatients; 1- 2 times per day as appropriate for ICU patients. \"The policy should also address how you will respond to non-emergent communications or information calls.Underpromise and overdeliver is key. Consider that in-formation-only calls might be answered on a time-per-mitted basis, especially if you are an established busypractice. For nonemergent inquiries, calls returnedwithin 24 to 48 hours is a reasonable expectation.Goals should be achievable, and all doctors and staffshould understand and abide by all aspects of the pol-icy. Relatedly, it is critical that all staff be involved increating communication policies, including reception-ists who are often the rst point of client contact and can be pressured by, or even side with, a dif cult client. Lastly, when sharing these boundaries with clients, itis not necessary to elucidate the rationale behind them;a defense mechanism seldom engenders empathy froman offending client. While there are many types of problem clients, those expecting excessive communications throughout theday are particularly challenging and often becomedemanding and even unreasonable. This may be a long-standing client, a trainer with a large barn or one per-ceived as highly valuable to the practice in somecapacity. For this type of client, it is even more impor-tant to be able to refer to your communications policy.It may be helpful to remember that this type of client of-ten prevents you and your team from providing care toall patients and that no one client should inhibit your ability to do so. This situation can occur in any type of practice, from solo to large multidoctor practices. 5. Conclusion It is hoped that this discussion will help to improve an issue that is all too common but infrequently addressed within equine veterinary medicine. As equine practice continues to grapple with attrition, it is important to become aware of allissues that contribute to burnout, job dissatisfaction, reduced nancial viability, and low salaries. Telephone time is one of many problems within the equine segment of veterinary medicine, and strategies to reduce this time are critical for nancial, emotional, and mental well-being.

Introduction Lameness is one of the most common problems facing equine veterinarians. Properly and effectively diag-nosing and treating these musculoskeletal ailmentscan be a real challenge, even to the most experiencedclinicians. However, a proper and correct diagnosis isan absolute requirement for an appropriate choice oftreatment(s) and an accurate prognosis. This goal canonly be achieved by following a meticulous and sys-tematic approach to lameness diagnosis that encom-passes each of the necessary logical and chronologicalsteps to complete the full picture of information that is necessary to resolve this clinical puzzle with the help of the concrete observations of diagnostic imag-ing that form the basis of the diagnostic process. The last 20 years have seen tremendous growth and advancement in equine diagnostic imaging, especiallywith the advent of technical improvements in radiog-raphy and ultrasonography, the wider accessibility and the arrival of positron emission tomography(PET). With this vast and frankly overwhelmingarray of diagnostic imaging tools at the practitioner 's disposal comes the need to better understand each ofthe available imaging modalities. Speci cally, the equine practitioner must be able to clearly identifywhich imaging modality will provide the best informa-tion for an accurate diagnosis in each speci clameness case. This paper deals speci cally with the factors involved in the choice of the correct imagingmodality/modalities appropriate for the patient, inparticular the choice of MRI. 2. Clinical Examination and Diagnostic Analgesia MRI is indicated when a lameness problem has beenlocalized to an anatomical area (e.g., the foot) andother imaging modalities have failed to provide anunequivocal diagnosis. Lameness should rst be localized to an anatomical area because unlike nu-clear scintigraphy, MRI is not a screening technique. Accurate knowledge of the localization of the cause of lameness as well as the pitfalls encountered with thetechnique and interpretation of diagnostic anesthe-sia is indispensable when interpreting MR images. 1 These rules apply even in the face of newer, morepowerful 3T magnets with faster scanning times nowallowing routine screening of the foot, pastern, andfetlock regions in horses with distal limb lamenesswith only short general anesthesia times. The sys-tematic process leading up to the choice of imagingmodality is illustrated in Fig. 1. The steps involvedin this process are listed in Table 1. Many steps of this process rely heavily on subjective clinical impressions that may lead to inaccurate con-clusions. The development of lameness measurementtechniques with inertial sensors 2has allowed much progress in this area. Pitfalls of interpretation of the NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 141CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESSresults of diagnostic anesthesia are numerous and must be well-known by the lameness clinician3because localization of lameness is paramount in determiningwhich imaging modality is most appropriate (Fig. 1). 3. Imaging Modalities MRI is not a substitute for in-depth clinical investiga- tion and conventional imaging techniques, and many causes of lameness can continue to be diagnosed with-out MRI. Nonetheless, the use of MRI has highlighted the limitations of both radiography for imaging bone and ultrasonography for imaging soft tissue lesions. Abrief review of the currently available imaging modal-ities in equine sports medicine and lameness practice is presented in Table 2. 4. Magnetic Resonance Imaging General Principles The generation of an MR image is based on the move- ment of hydrogen atoms generating a measurableelectrical current in the body. MRI produces a gray-scale image of tissue hydrogen protons by placing them in a strong magnetic eld, exposing them to a radiofrequency pulse and measuring the MR causedin the tissues in response to this pulse. The imaginginformation obtained is based on the structure andbiochemical environment of those hydrogen atoms inthe tissues. High-Field vs. Low-Field MRI Both high- eld and low- eld magnets are used in equine practice, and it is important to know the dif-ferences between both systems. High- eld magnets are superconducting, closed, cylindrical bore mag-nets with magnetic eld strength in excess of 1 T (currently 1.5 T or 3 T), while low- eld magnets are open, permanent magnets with a eld strength below 0.5 T. Image quality and resolution increase withincreasing magnetic eld strength and increasing eld homogeneity. Consequently, low- eld systems generate less tissue signal, require longer acquisitiontimes, and produce lower-resolution images with lessuniform signal, less image detail, and more motionartefact than high- eld systems. Even so, several studies have shown that low- eld magnets are capa- ble of producing adequate diagnostic quality imagesof the distal limb up to the carpus/tarsus, 4-6and even of the sti fle.7A similarly high lesion yield was reported in direct comparisons between high- and low-eld magnets.8,9 Strengths and Weaknesses of MRI Because of its unique mode of image acquisition and construction, it is essential to understand the factors that in fluence the MR signal characteristics that produce the diagnostic images and to learn thestrengths and weaknesses of the technique. Theadvantages and disadvantages of MRI are summar-ized in Table 2. Comparison of MRI and Other Imaging Modalities In comparison with MRI, radiography is incapable of detecting cartilage abnormalities in horses with distal limb joint lameness. Radiographic abnormal- ities are also absent in many forms of subchondral ortrabecular bone injury (e.g., bone contusions, boneedema, subtle or focal subchondral bone resorption;Fig. 2). Radiography, however, has better bone ver-sus soft tissue contrast when compared to MRI andis therefore more sensitive for soft tissue mineraliza-tion (Fig. 3) and subtle bone contour changes likeosteophytes, enthesophytes, and small osteochondralfragments. As bone has the same low-intensity sig-nal as tendon, ligament, and brous joint capsule, osteophytes and entheseophytes or areas of dystro-phic mineralization are frequently invisible on MR images if they occur in or near a tendon, ligament, or enthesis. Small osseous fragments or osteophytesmay also remain invisible on MR images due to par-tial volume averaging across the width of the imag-ing slice if it is thicker than the fragment or bony Fig. 1.

Ultrasonography is limited by the hoof capsule in lameness of the foot. Ultrasonographic ndings may be equivocal in lameness associated with the palmar/plan- tar soft tissues of the distal limb. Ultrasonography, however, gives a better representation of ber pattern in tendons and ligaments and is not plagued by magic angle and flow artifacts. The ratio between T1 and T2/short tau inversion recovery (STIR) signal in MR images of tendons, on the other hand, can be used to determine whether an indolent ultrasonographica b n o r m a l i t yo ft h es u p e r cial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is still \"active \"and poses high risk.10,11One study found that horses whose hyperin- tense tendon or ligament lesions had resolved on STIRimages were signi cantly more likely to be sound than horses whose lesions persisted on STIR images.12A combined ultrasonographic/standing low- eld MRI pro- tocol of transverse T1 and T2* gradient echo (GRE)and T2 and STIR fast spin echo (FSE) sequences has been proposed as the most accurate method of monitor- ing tendon healing with a view to a safer return to fastexercise in eventers. 11Even though high- eld MRI has been shown to be more sensitive than ultrasonography for diagnosis of subtle injuries of the suspensory branches and the distal sesamoidean ligaments,13 ultrasonography can still be a useful adjunct modalityalongside MRI. A concurrent ultrasonographic exami- nation is always indicated in such cases to determine whether true ber pattern abnormalities can bedetected that correspond to the area of signal increase on low- eld MR images and to try and establish a baseline T 0image of the lesion that can be used to aid ultrasound-guided intralesional therapies but also to provide follow-up information without needing to repeat expensive MRI examinations. In spite of recent reports suggesting a reasonable correlation betweenultrasonographic and MRI examinations,14-16results of ultrasonographic examinations frequently remain inconclusive. Both false positive and false negative ultrasonographic ndings were common in compari- s o nw i t hh i g h - eld MRI for the collateral ligaments of the cof n joint (ultrasound sensitivity 27%),17,18the deep digital flexor tendon (ultrasound sensitivity 13%),19and the origin of the suspensory ligament in hind limbs (ultrasound sensitivity 66% and speci city 31%).14,20Ultrasonographic examination is therefore not considered a necessary rst-line imaging modality if a low- eld or high- eld MRI examination is being considered in those areas where there is a poor corre-lation between both imaging modalities (e.g., the foot and the proximal suspensory region). However, in other areas where the results of ultrasonography canbe equally or more reliable than those of a low- eld MRI examination (e.g., the digital flexor tendon sheath, the distal sesamoidean ligaments, and thesuspensory branches), it is advisable to performultrasonography prior to considering a low- eld MRI examination. If a high- eld MRI examination is planned, a rst-line ultrasonographic examination is less necessary. Fig. 2.

A corresponding area of low signal intensity onthe MR image (black arrow) is much less conspicuous.CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS 144 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSComparative studies between MRI and scintigra- phy have been performed for 264 horses with foot lameness.21Scintigraphy had low sensitivity for deep digital flexor eld MRI. The speci city of scintigraphy for these conditions was better with values above90% for all three conditions. However, only 50% of horses with grade 3 navicular bone edema lesions showed increased radiopharmaceutical uptake onscintigraphic images. 21It may be concluded that there is little added value of scintigraphy over MRI inhorses with foot lameness. In comparison with MRI, CT is unable to detect the presence of fluid or hemorrhage in bone. However, because of its superior bone detail and contrast anddependent on eld strength and sequence selection of MRI, CT is generally better at evaluating ne bone detail than MRI. Moreover, the thin slices offer a highresolution making subtle trabecular thickening,subtle periosteal new bone formation, and subtle sub-chondral bone surface changes conspicuous on CT images well before they become visible on low- eld MR images. For example, CT is more sensitive for early subchondral bone resorption and ssure forma- tion in the sagittal of the proximal phalanx (Fig. 4). 22Contrast enhanced CT may be useful in the identi cation of subtle but active soft tissue injuries that may not yet be visible on low- eld MR images(Fig. 5). One study suggested that the sensitivity of contrast enhanced CT for deep digital flexor tendon injuries in the foot (85%) was better than that of low-eld standing MRI (51%). 23A lag period of several weeks to months may exist between the onset of lame-ness and the appearance of signal abnormalities indic-a t i v eo ft i s s u ed a m a g eo nl o w - eld MR images, especially in the deep digital flexor tendon. 24Such early developing tendon lesions may be more conspic-uous on contrast enhanced CT images as they appearto enhance readily following injection of intravenousor intraarterial contrast when no abnormal MRI sig-nal is visible yet. Reports have been contradictory on the value of MRI for evaluation of articular carti- lage, 25,26and recent studies have suggested that CT arthrography is superior to MRI for assessment of car-tilage morphology and pathology. 27,28 A few recent comparisons are available between PET imaging and low- eld MRI of the foot and fetlock of horses.29-32It seems certain from the early observa- tions that the functional properties and high sensitiv-ity of both fluoride (F-NaF for bone remodeling) and glucose (F-FDG for metabolic activity) PET scanninghave the potential to reveal subtle lesions earlier thanother imaging modalities because functional changesin injured tissue precede the structural changes that are visible on CT and MRI. So far, such subtle lesions have included abnormalities of the navicular boneand of the entheses of the collateral ligaments, the Fig. 4. Corresponding dorsopalmar radiograph (A), frontal 3D T1 gradient echo (0.27 T; B), and CT (C) images of the right fore fet- lock of 3 different horses with a subtle linear area of subchondral bone resorption in the central part of the sagittal groove of the dis- tal phalanx (white arrows) surrounded by mild sclerosis. The lesion is most conspicuous on the CT image. Fig. 5.

A core lesion was visible in the same location on the corresponding 3D T1 gradient echo high resolution image during a fol-low-up MRI examination 1 month later (D). All MR images were obtained with a 0.27 T low- eld magnet.CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 145chondrosesamoidean ligaments, and the deep digital flexor tendon in the foot, as well as the injuries of the palmar condyles and the proximal sesamoid bones in the fetlock. Moreover, F-FDG PET agreed moreclosely with modalities used to detect active tendon lesions (arterial contrast CT and T2/STIR low- eld MRI) than with CT and T1 low- eld MRI.32 In conclusion, MRI is the only imaging modality that can assess all tissues in a single examination, yet the availability of MRI should not replace but rather complement radiographic and ultrasonographic nd- ings. Information obtained from radiographic, ultraso- and scintigraphic examinations helps withthe interpretation of MRI ndings. 5. Rationale for Selection of Imaging Modalities The equine practitioner has numerous diagnostic imaging options when working up a lame horse. When selecting an imaging modality, several factors must be considered, not least the anatomical region under scrutiny. Therefore, the consecutive steps of thedecision-making process need to be considered sepa-rately for different anatomical regions. The Foot \u0081It has become clear that proximal diffusion and migration of local anesthetic from a palmar digi-tal nerve block can desensitize even the pasternand fetlock regions and that this nerve block should no longer be considered speci c for foot lameness. 33An abaxial sesamoid nerve block is far too indiscriminate to localize pain to the foot as proximal diffusion of local anesthetic solutionresults in desensitization of the fetlock region(including the suspensory liga-ment) in most horses. Abaxial sesamoid nerveblocks should therefore not be used as a rst- line diagnostic nerve block in a lameness exami- nation to help decide which area requires MRI. \u0081Radiography is the rst-line imaging modality of choice for the foot provided good-quality radi- ographs are obtained. If good-quality radio-graphs of the foot fail to reveal any signi cant abnormalities, intra-articular anesthesia of the distal interphalangeal joint and intrabursal an- esthesia are useful to con rm that lameness is caused by pain in the foot. Ultrasonography isfrequently omitted during rst-line imaging ex- amination of the foot as it rarely produces aconclusive or complete diagnosis. \u0081In many parts of the world, low- eld standing MRI has become the gold standard second-lineimaging modality for horses with foot lame-ness without an obvious radiographic diagnosisbecause of its high sensitivity and speci city for the diagnosis of both bone and soft tissue injuriesin the foot and because it can be performedwithout the need for general anesthesia. Radio-graphs and MR images are complementary andalways need to be evaluated alongside one another (Figs. 3 and 4). If the low- eld MRI ex- amination of the foot does not reveal any signi - cant abnormalities that are compatible with the presenting clinical signs, then the MRI examina-tion should be extended to include the pastern and fetlock regions, especially if no further attempts have been performed to localize lame-ness more precisely with intrasynovial anesthe- sia after a positive palmar digital nerve block. \u0081If low- eld MRI fails to reveal any signi cant abnormalities in either the foot/pastern or the fetlock region, the possible ways forward are asfollows: 1) The localization of the cause of lame- ness was inaccurate and the diagnostic blocking process must be repeated, preferably with theuse of inertial sensors, 2to measure the lameness improvement objectively after each nerve block.2) Alternatively, the horse can be rested for 1 to 2 months and represented for a follow-up MRI examination, in view of the fact that there maybe a lag time between the onset of lameness and the development of signal abnormalities on MR images (Fig. 5). 243) Third-line imaging can be pursued with either high- eld MRI or contrast enhanced CT (or PET) as these modalities are more sensitive for subtle injuries than low- eld MRI (Fig. 5). Low- eld MRI has poor sensitivity for abnormalities of the lamellar tissues as well as the avascular layers of the hoof wall and sole (bruising, hoof abscess, seedy toe gravel, some keratomas, and other hoof wall masses). It also struggles to identify surface abnormalities of hyaline cartilage and brocartilage and of some deep digital flexor tendon injuries. Moreover, many horses with solar pain responsive to appli-cation of hoof testers or horses with poor dorso- palmar foot balance resulting in palmar heel pain have unremarkable low- eld MR images. The Fetlock \u0081Radiography is the rst-line imaging modality for the fetlock region. Osteoarthritis is a com- mon cause of fetlock lameness, and osteophytes, enthesophytes, and fragmentation of the articu-lar margin are most easily identi ed on good- quality radiographs. Ultrasonography shouldalso be part of the rst-line imaging protocol because of the high prevalence of soft tissue inju-ries on the palmar aspect of the pastern and fet-lock regions. However, several studies have reported a poor ability of ultrasonography to accurately predict the presence of marginalCROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS 146 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGStearing of the deep flexor tendon or flexor ever, had a 92% sensitivity and 56% speci city for the diagnosis of manica flexoria tears and a 54% sensitivity and 73% speci city for longitudi- nal tears of the deep digital flexor tendon.36,37 For horses presented with lameness localized to the digital flexor tendon sheath, contrast tenogra- phy should thus be performed as part of the rst- line imaging protocol alongside ultrasonography. \u0081In many parts of the world, standing low- eld MRI is the second-line imaging modality of choice for horses with fetlock region pain because of the high prevalence of subchondral bone injury characterized by the presence of bone edema inthe fetlock of sports horses and racehorses. 13,38 Motion artifacts may interfere with accurateevaluation of the soft tissues, but marginal tearsof the dorsal margin of the deep digital flexor tendon in the pastern region have been describedusing standing low- eld MRI. 39 \u0081Because soft tissue contrast and resolution are superior to that of low- eld, high- eld MRI is the most suitable third-line imaging modality. One high- eld MRI study reported distal sesamoi- dean ligament injuries as the most common nd- ing in 94 of 232 horses with fetlock lamenesswithout obvious rst-line imaging abnormal- ities. 40CT can also be used as a third-line modal- ity as it offers increased sensitivity for subtlesubchondral resorption (Fig. 4), sclerosis, and new bone production that may be missed on low- eld MR images and adds the ability to assess contrast enhancement in subtle but active soft tissue injuries in the fetlock region. The Metacarpal/Metatarsal Regions \u0081The obvious rst-line imaging modality for soft tissue swellings of the palmar/plantar meta-carpal/metatarsal regions is ultrasonography, including the use of Doppler ultrasound to detectnew or persistent abnormal vascularization of ligament or flexor tendons. 41-43 \u0081Radiographic contrast tenography may also be useful for soft tissue swelling extending distally into the region of the digital flexor tendon sheath (see above). \u0081Both MRI and contrast enhanced CT may be helpful second-line imaging modalities toanswer speci c that may remain lowing an ultrasonographic examination. High-eld MRI and contrast CT may be able to iden- tifyber abnormalities that cause lameness but are not detected with ultrasonography (e.g.,proximal part of the super cial digital flexor tendon). An abbreviated low- eld MRI protocol combined with serial ultrasonographic exami-nations has been helpful in deciding whensports horses can safely resume fast exercise. 11 The Proximal Metacarpal/Metatarsal and Distal Carpal/ Tarsal Regions \u0081A clinical diagnosis of proximal suspensory region pain relies heavily on localization of thecause of pain with diagnostic anesthesia as external signs of injury are frequently absent. However, all diagnostic anesthesia techniquessuffer from a lack of speci city, and none are able to single out the suspensory ligamentas the de nitive site of pain causing lame- ness. 20,44,45In one study, only 66% of horses with hindlimb lameness that was eliminated orsubstantially improved by a nerve block of thedeep branch of the lateral plantar nerve hadlesions of the suspensory ligament or the plan-tar cortex of the third metatarsal bone identi- ed on high- eld MR images. 20Observations in a study of 103 horses with pain in the distal tar- sal or proximal metatarsal region showed that Fig. 6. Transverse bone window (A) and soft tissue window (B) CT images and a T1 gradient echo MR image (0.27 T; C) of the prox- imal part of the third metacarpal bone of a 3-year-old warmblood showjumper with acute onset lameness that sub- carpal anesthesia. A small cortical avulsion fragment was visible on the CT image only (dotted white arrow). A focal area of signalincrease without an obvious fragment is visible in the dorsal margin of the medial lobe of the suspensory ligament on the MR image (white arrow). The soft tissue window CT image shows a corresponding area of subtle hypoattenuation (red arrow).CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 147the primary MRI abnormality frequently did not correlate with the diagnostic anesthetictechnique that improved the lameness most. 45 \u0081A combination of radiography and ultrasonog-raphy is the rst-line imaging protocol for horses with proximal metacarpal/metatarsalpain in order to rule out the presence of obvious bone or joint abnormalities (osteoarthritis and fractures) or severe proximal suspensory desmi-tis. Most frequently, however, the results of these examinations are inconclusive. Especially ultrasonography of the proximal part of thehind suspensory ligament has been reported to result in 66% false positive and 34% false nega- tive ndings when compared with high- eld 20A follow-up study that compared ultra- sonography with histology was unable to sup- port the reliability of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of proximal suspensory desmitis.14,15 Of 36 limbs with ultrasonographic evidence of moderate to severe ber damage to the proxi- mal part of the suspensory ligament, 53% had no histological abnormalities of the collagen ber pattern and organization, while 33% had mild and 14% had moderate ber abnormal- ities. Ultrasonography therefore resulted in a false positive diagnosis of moderate to severe ber damage in at least 54% of the suspensory ligaments in this study. The authors described cellular microscopic abnormalities of bro- blasts, myocytes, and adipocytes in 97% of thesuspensory ligaments, but ultrasonography isunable to detect microscopic abnormalities at a cellular level. A signi cant association was observed between microscopic ndings in myo- cytes and ultrasonography, yet the ultrasono- graphic abnormalities described at the outset related to the collagen ber pattern. 14 \u0081Given the limitations of ultrasonography in the suspensory desmitis (espe- cially in hindlimbs), it is tempting to propose low- eld MRI as an alternative rst-line or at least second-line imaging modality for the proximal and distal carpal/tarsalregions are commonly looked at concurrently dur-ing MRI examinations because it is dif cult to localize pain de nitively in either one or the other region with diagnostic anesthesia. 20,45However, the interference of motion artefact with image quality, especially in T2 spin echo and STIR images of this region, imposes signi cant limita- tions on accurate assessment of the soft tissue structures in this region with standing MRI. Unsurprisingly, many clinicians have consideredthe technique more reliable for the diagnosis ofosseous abnormalities than of proximal suspen- sory desmitis, 46while results have been more encouraging in forelimbs (Fig. 6).47,48MR images of the suspensory origin need to be assessed withcaution as motion artifacts (with standing low-e l dM R I )a n dt h ev a r i a b l ea p p e a r a n c eo ft h e muscle and fat tissue bundles should not be con-fused with signal changes caused by injury. Low-eld MRI may be helpful to identify osseous abnormalities of the tarsal and carpal bonesincluding sclerosis, slab fractures, and osseouscyst-like lesions, but motion artifact may interfere with accurate assessment of osteophytes, chip fractures, and joint space narrowing. \u0081In view of the problems of motion in low- eld MRI of the proximal metatarsal region, high-eld MRI might be regarded as a more suitable second-line imaging modality in hindlimbs. 46It is also a suitable third-line imaging modality ifthe results of low- eld MRI are inconclusive in forelimbs. 47 \u0081CT and contrast CT may have certain advan-tages as a third-line imaging modality. It is mores e n s i t i v et h a ne v e nh i g h - eld MRI for subtle new bone formation, bone resorption, and avulsionfragments (Fig. 6) associated with the proximal attachment of the suspensory ligament 49because of the lack of contrast between bone and soft tis- sue at the ligament-cortical bone interface on MR images. Moreover, contrast enhancement may be observed in active proximal suspensory desmi-tis lesions but not in chronic brosis on CT images. 50 The Stifle \u0081Radiography and ultrasonography are a usefulrst-line imaging protocol as they provide a reliable imaging diagnosis for many conditions causing sti- fle lameness and have offered the traditional basis for further arthroscopic exploration of the joint. \u0081Both low- and high- eld MRI 7,51as well as CT examinations52,53of the sti flec a nn o wb eu s e da s second-line diagnostic modalities for improved di- agnosis of injuries of this complex joint as many of the soft tissue structures of the joint cannot be evaluated comprehensively with rst-line conven- tional imaging modalities. However, general anesthesia is required for these cross-sectional imaging techniques, and current high- eld mag- nets impose a size limitation on the horse due to the diameter of the bore.

Conclusion While lameness is one of the most common reasons for a consult in clinical practice, it remains a challenging aspect of equine veterinary medicine. The most effec-tive way to diagnose musculoskeletal abnormalities isto integrate a thorough physical examination, gait analysis, and diagnostic anesthesia with the proper imaging modalities. Precise image acquisition andcareful interpretation if necessary by a specialist 55,56is the only road to an accurate diagnosis and prognosis.

Ross, Dyson, Murray, Martinelli, Ehrlich, Seeherman and othershave researched reported scintigraphy 's use as an aid for diagnosing musculoskeletal injury in the horse.3-10 Other uses of scintigraphy have included investigation of respiratory disease (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage), gastric emptying studies, identi cation of thrombus formation (primarily terminal aorta),using labeled white cells to localize regions of infection, and as an aid to identify parathyroid tissue in horses with hyperparathyroidism.11-25The primary use of scintigraphy in the horse is to identify possible areas ofmusculoskeletal injury that are causing poor perform- ance. In many instances, examinations are performed on horses for which a comprehensive clinical examina- tion has not been completed; this is a poor approach to its use as a diagnostic tool. Other common presenta- tions for an examination include horses with severe lameness that cannot be localized, multiple limb lame- ness, lameness that has been localized but cannot be identi ed, possible pelvic trauma or injury, and to assess horses that may have clinical problems associ-ated with impinging dorsal spinous and positron with a lameness iso- lated to a speci c region may be imaged with one ofthese modalities instead or combined with scintigra- phy. 9,26- 28 2. Principles The basic principle of scintigraphy is the detection of gamma rays that are emitted from the decaying nucle- otide by a gamma camera. The clinical informationobtained is based on the biochemistry of the pharma- ceutical and its interactions with the target organ, in this instance bone, and scintigraphy provides a physio-logic picture of the bone, primarily bone turnover and blood flow to the bone and not an anatomical picture of the bone. 29The nucleotide most commonly used in equine scintigraphy (technetium-99m) is bound to adiphosphonate diphosphonate to the hydroxyapatite portion of bone, and the intensityof the uptake or capture is related to osteoblast activity. Timing of the procedure relative to the bone injury can be important and factor into false negative studies. There are times where a client may want to give the h o r s es o m et i m eo f fa n dt h e np u r s u es c i n t i g r a p h yi f the horse is still lame. In general, this is the wrong approach, and scintigraphy, if it is an option, should be pursued prior to a rest period. When acute lame-ness occurs, the cause of the lameness will direct when imaging should occur. Acute lameness secondary to stress-related bone injury in horses in training/work NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 151CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESSwill lead to ongoing bone modeling, and the area of in- terest will have increased isotope capture at the areaof injury. Acute lameness secondary to acute traumawill take several days to develop increased osteoblastactivity, and most clinicians recommend a 7- to 10-daydelay before scintigraphy is performed. 3 3. Imaging Procedure Patient preparation is critical to image quality. Horses are admitted the day prior to being imaged to allow them to adapt to the surroundings and be prepared forimaging. In colder climates, the horse may be blan-keted and standing wraps applied to the limbs thatwill be imaged to avoid what some describe as the\"cold limb syndrome \", which is a lack of isotope cap- ture distal to the fetlock in most instances but caninclude the entire limb distal to the carpus and/or tar-sus. 30There is evidence that wrapping and blanketing alone does not prevent poor perfusion of the limb, andthe best means to avoid this problem is to longe thehorse at a trot and canter for 15 minutes prior toinjecting the isotope. 30Warmblood horses often have poor bone uptake compared to Thoroughbred race- horses secondary to reduced turnover of bone, less vig- orous exercise, and thicker overlying soft tissueresulting in shielding. There are reports that perineural and intra- articular anesthesia can impact pool and delayed(bone) phase imaging. 31,32Tibial, peroneal, ulnar, and median blocks are most commonly reported tocause soft-tissue capture of isotope at the site theblock was performed. This does not interfere withinterpretation if two images (lateral and dorso-palmar or plantar dorsal) of the regions are com-pleted as identi cation of the site of increased capture can be veri ed to be associated with the perineuralanesthetic site. Intra-articular anesthesia may impact pool-phase images for 7 to 10 days. 3,30 The shoes are removed, and the hooves are ban- daged or boots applied to prevent urine contaminationof the hooves. Standing wraps are applied to protect the lower limbs from urine contamination. An intrave- nous catheter is placed in the jugular vein, and 150 to 200 mCi (0.4 -0.5 mCi/kg) is administered. Image acquisition is divided into three phases: flow phase (vascular), pool phase (soft tissue), and delayedphase (bone). The flow phase lasts for the rst 1 to 3 minutes and is generally combined with the poolphase during image acquisition. The flow phase is used speci cally when imaging for aortoiliac thrombo- sis. During the pool phase, the radiopharmaceutical is located in the extracellular fluid space. The pool-phase images are generally obtained between 3 and 15 to20 minutes after injection and are used in an attempt to examine soft tissues such as tendons, ligaments, digital sheaths, and bursae. Positive pool-phase images are reported to occur when soft- tissue injury has occurred within 6 weeks of imag- ing. 3The pool phase is brief, so the region to be examined is limited. Negative pool phase imagesdo not exclude the possibility of soft tissue injury and some individuals do not use pool phase imag- ing because they nd limited bene ts in this imag- ing phase. The delayed-phase images are obtained2 to 4 hours after injection. The radiopharmaceuti- cal is localized in the bone and has been cleared from the soft tissues by excretion in the kidneys. In areas of acute and severe bone injury, the bone uptake can be seen as rapidly as 20 minutes after isotope administration. Obtained images are most commonly evaluated qualitatively, and the location and intensity of the Fig. 1.

Areas of increased capture or uptake are often described as hot spots. Image acquisition by the gamma camera is depend- ent on the operator to position the camera the samedistance from the horse on each side to facilitate accu-rate comparison of the same regions on oppositessides of the horse. Current software allows postpro- cessing of images such as masking areas of increased activity (i.e., the bladder, areas of capture in soft tis-sues after nerve blocks, or potentially areas of urinecontamination). In general, two images are obtainedof each region examined to localize areas of increasedcapture and avoid missing areas of capture that areshielded in one view. Dorsal imaging will provide little information of the palmar surface, and lateral imag- ing will provide little to no information of the medialsurface of the limbs. Solar margin views of the digitallow uniform examination of the distal phalanx.Image quality is related to isotope dose adminis-tered, counts acquired per region examined, distance of camera from the horse, motion, shielding, and background radiation. 3Shielding is an important concept to understand relative to false negativeimaging and understanding limitations of scintigra-phy. The soft tissue surrounding the pelvis willgreatly reduce the intensity of isotope capture whenthe pelvis is examined. Soft-tissue shielding in the stifle region can also be partially responsible for limi- tations associated with scintigraphy and sti fle lameness. 33Shielding also occurs when the limb is imaged from the lateral aspect of the bone lesion on the medial aspect of the limb; normal bone preventsthe emitted signal from reaching the camera. Positioning of the horse, sedation, and room com- fort each play a role in the managing motion, whichis most problematic when examining upper regionsof the limbs and axial skeleton. When the images are examined, areas of capture are described by the location, intensity, and characterof uptake (focal versus diffuse). Areas of photopenia have been described and thought to be related to com- pression of vasculature by abscesses and joint effusion,septic osteitis, sequestrum formation, and vascularthrombosis. 3,34 4. Applications As previously discussed, scintigraphy examinations a r ec o m m o n l yu s e dt ot r yt oi d e n t i f ya r e a so fb o n e injury in horses with poor performance but maybe no denitive lameness, in horses that are acutely lame but too lame to localize with local anesthesia (Fig. 1), and to provide con dence that subtle bone changes on radiographs are active physiologically, though thiscategory may be more frequently examined with MRI,CT, and PET. There are areas such as the back, pel- vis, and hip regions that cannot be examined by CT, MRI, or PET imaging in the standing sedated horse(Fig. 2). When examining horses for poor performancewith scintigraphy, it is important to discuss with theclient the possibility that no de nitive source of poor performance may be identi ed. The positive is that a number of problems may have been eliminated, but this could be because the horse is being imaged too long after the bone injury occurred, the area of injury is shielded or below the resolution of the system/tech- nique, or the injury is soft tissue related and not able to be detected via scintigraphy. Scintigraphy is gener- ally most helpful when a lameness has been isolated but an imaging diagnosis has not been identi ed or, at minimum, a thorough examination has been com-pleted and the clinician has a suspicion of where the lameness is originating (Fig. 3). Imaging horses that are not lame makes it dif cult to determine the signi - cance of isotope capture in some regions. Horses thatare lame and in which certain regions such as the Fig. 4. 11-year-old Warmblood mare that ran in a paddock and had an acutely severely (4/5) lame left forelimb. The lameness improved rapidly and blocked to a low 4-point nerve block. Scintigraphy was pursued to determine if there was evidence of any other injury. There is focal isotope capture at the intermediate tubercle of the hu- merus. Masking of the proximal caudal humerus.CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS 154 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSdistal limb have been eliminated allow the clinician to concentrate on the upper limbs and axial skeleton as acause of the lameness (Fig. 4). Scintigraphy in race-horses with nebulous lameness may allow the detec-tion of stress fractures and compensatory injury. Sporthorses with nebulous poor performance can be theleast productive studies, but subtle changes can be sig-nicant if they can be linked to clinical disease and improved performance when the region is blocked orother imaging modalities support an injured soft-tis-sue or bony structure. Some common problems that scintigraphy is bene - cial in identifying include distal phalanx navicular bone remodeling and injury, increasedactivity in proximal sesamoid bones associated withsesamoid injury or injury, bone injury and osseous cyst-like defects,osteitis at the suspensory thoracolumbar spondylosis, osteomyelitis, small car-pal and tarsal injury and osteoarthritis, andelbow injury (Fig. 5.). 6,8,9,22,26- 28,35- 65 5. Conclusions Scintigraphy can be very useful as a diagnostic tool in horses with undiagnosed lameness and poor per- formance, but it does have limitations. Ideally theselimitations will be discussed with the horse ownerprior to imaging in an effort to guide expectations.Scintigraphy provides a physiologic picture of themusculoskeletal system and generally requires radi-ographic or ultrasonographic examination to fullydescribe the injury. Positive studies are most com- monly obtained in horses with a lameness that has been isolated but not identi ed, though this may be a minority of the horses that are examined with scin- tigraphy. Recent injuries are more likely to be identi-ed compared to horses with chronic lameness or horses rested and imaged after a period of rest.Vascular imaging can be helpful in identifyingthrombus formation, though it is a rare cause of lameness. Increased isotope capture in soft tissues can be associated with soft-tissue injury or, insome instances, injury to adjacent bone. Similarly, increased isotope capture can be identi ed in osseous structures when the primary injury is in adjacent soft-tissue structures. Common locations for this phenomenon are increased activity in the navicular bone with deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) injury, increased isotope capture in the carpus in horses with proximal super cial or DDFT injury, and iso- tope the in or super cial digital flexor tendon injury. CT, MRI, and PET imaging are replacingscintigraphy in some instances, but scintigraphy con-tinues to be a useful diagnostic tool and can be com-plementary to these advanced imaging modalities.

Background Positron emission tomography (PET) is the latest addition to the equine imaging arsenal. The rst ever equine PET scan was performed at the University ofCalifornia, Davis in 2015, using a compact high-reso-lution PET scanner designed to image the humanbrain. a1This scanner was used to perform over 150 equine studies in a 5-year period, but all these scanshad to be performed under general anesthesia. In2019, a PET scanner speci cally designed to image the distal limb of standing horses bbecame available.2 The ability to perform equine PET without generalanesthesia has resulted in a steep increase in clinicaluse of this new imaging modality. As of January 2022,over 700 standing equine PET studies have been per-formed. With 3 imaging centers currently equipped,each performing 150 to 200 studies a year, and atleast 4 other sites to be equipped during 2022, thenumber of equine PET studies will keep quicklyincreasing. 2. Principles PET is a nuclear medicine imaging technique. Similarto scintigraphy, PET requires the intravenous injec-tion of a radioactive tracer prior to imaging. The majordifference between PET and scintigraphy is that PETis a cross-sectional imaging technique; instead of pro-jecting a 2-dimensional image like scintigraphy, PETpresents information in 3 dimensions. Similar to com-puted tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imag-ing (MRI), the PET data can be displayed either as astack of 2-dimensional images or using 3-dimensionalrendering display techniques, such as multiplanarreformatting or maximal intensity projections. As a nuclear medicine imaging technique, PET pro- vides functional information about the tissues beingimaged. This means instead of reporting the shape,size, or density of the body parts being imaged, likestructural imaging techniques such as radiographyand CT, PET provides information about activity hap-pening at the molecular level, based on the biodistri-bution and speci c accumulation of the radiotracer used. Several radiotracers are available for PET imaging; two of them are routinely used activity of glucose, commonlyused for oncological imaging in human medicine. Thistracer, however, is not speci c for the metabolic activ- ity of tumors and can be used in horses for assessmentof inflammation in soft tissues. 18F-NaF is an ex- cellent marker of bone turnover. Similar to thebisphosphonate radiotracers used in scintigraphy,18F-NaF becomes integrated to exposed hydroxyapa-tite matrix, detecting areas with osteoblastic or osteo-clastic activity. 3. Imaging Logistics An intravenous jugular catheter is necessary for injec-tion of the radiotracers. Typically, the radiotracers areinjected 30 to 60 minutes prior to imaging to allow NOTES 158 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSCROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESStime for biodistribution and accumulation at sites of increased metabolic activity. Once the tracers have been injected, horses need to be housed and handled according to local radiation safety regulations, simi- lar to scintigraphy patients. Based on the 2-hourhalf-life of the 18F radiotracers, patients can typi- cally be released from radiation safety protocols within 5 to 8 hours after injection. The scanner used for imaging of the distal limb in standing horses bwas speci cally designed for this application. It is composed of an openable ring of PET detectors, with a 25-cm internal diameter, that is posi-tioned parallel to the ground and set up on a wheelframe (Fig. 1). 2The scanner is pushed toward the s e d a t e dh o r s ew i t ht h er i n gi na no p e np o s i t i o na n d centered on the limb to image. The ring is then manually closed but is able to freely open if thehorse were to move. The height adjustment goesfrom ground level to 64 cm above the ground,allowing for imaging from the foot to the distal ra- dius or tibia. The detector height is 8 cm, but because the ring can translate vertically duringimaging over 14 cm, a maximal axial eld of view of 22 cm can be obtained per scan. Acquisition time for each scan ranges between 2 and 6 minutes depending on the site being imaged, the quality of uptake, and the selected axial eld of view. 2Including positioning time, imaging of both front fetlocks, for example, takes approxi-mately 10 minutes. In 20 minutes, it is possible to image all 4 fetlocks or both front feet and front fet- locks. Although not available in the original stand-ing equine PET validation study, a postprocessingmotion correction tool is now available, renderingthe acquisition fairly resistant to swaying motionduring sedation, which is particularly bene cial f o ri m a g i n gt h ec a r p u so rt a r s u s .4. Applications As equine PET is a recently introduced modality, the range of its applications is still evolving. The Fig. 2. Lateral (A, C) and dorsal (B, D) maximal intensity pro- jections of 18F-NaF PET images of the fetlocks of two different racehorses. The horse on the top row (A, B) shows moderate to severe focal uptake in the palmar metacarpal condyles (short arrows) and at the dorsal aspect of the third metacarpal bone(arrowheads). The horse on the bottom row shows mild focal uptake in the palmar metacarpal condyles (short arrows) but marked focal uptake at the dorsal abaxial aspect of the medial proximal sesamoid bone, where subchondral injury is asso- ciated with sesamoid fracture.

An exploratory study con rmed the value of 18F-NaF PET to detect sites of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake not appreciated with scintigraphy,7in particular involving the proximal sesamoid bones (Fig. 2). The ndings of the explora- tory study were con rmed in the rst standing equine PET clinical study, comparing 18F-NaF PETand scintigraphy in 33 racehorses (72 fetlocks).8In this study, the interobserver agreement for PET was higher than for scintigraphy, and PET detected more lesions than scintigraphy. The agreement betweenPET and scintigraphy for detection of increased uptake was highest for palmar/plantar metacarpal/ metatarsal condylar sites, but of the medial proximal sesamoid bones in this population compared with 6.9% for scin- tigraphy. Similarly, increased uptake in the proximalphalanx was identi ed much more commonly with PET than with scintigraphy (6.9% vs. 1.4%). In addi-tion to the higher detection rate of abnormalities inthe proximal sesamoid bones, PET allowed more detailed characterization of the site of uptake. The most common location for increased radiopharma-ceutical uptake in the proximal sesamoid bones in a population of 130 racehorses was the dorsal subchon- dral bone of the medial sesamoid, a site where boneremodeling has been associated with complete mid-body sesamoid fractures. For this reason, PET seems to have a major role to play in fracture risk assess- ment in racehorses. Fig. 3. 18F-NaF PET images of the tarsus of a horse with lame- ness localized to the distal tarsal/proximal metatarsal area over- laid on dorsoplantar (top dorsolateral-plantaromedial oblique radiographs. Despite mild radiographic changes, thePET con rms marked remodeling activity at the dorsomedial as- pect of the distal intertarsal joint (arrows). Note that the linear uptake across the distal tibia and proximal metacarpus is arti- factual at the edge of the PET eld of view.

There is marked 18F-NaF uptake in the left fore navicularbone (short arrow). The bone is abnormal on MRI (T1 hypointensity, STIR hyperintensity, and lysis of the flexor cortex), and increased uptake is also recognized with scintigraphy (short arrows). Focal 18F-NaF uptake is recognized at the sagittal ridge of theflexor surface of the right fore navicular bone (long arrow). Other imaging modalities did not detect any abnormality at this site. 6CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS 160 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSThe carpus and tarsus are other imaging sites where PET demonstrates obvious advantages over scintigraphy to better de ne anatomical location of abnormalities. The carpus is the second ana-tomical site most commonly imaged with PET inracehorses. PET allows uptake from the dorso-proximal aspect of the third carpal bone to be dis-tinguished from the dorsodistal aspect of theradial carpal bone, which typically cannot beresolved with scintigraphy. PET of the tarsus isparticularly interesting in sport horses with lame-ness localized to the distal tarsus or proximalmetatarsal area. PET is able to distinguish inactive distal osteoarthritis suspensory ligament (Fig. 3). Fig. 5. Multiplanar reformatted CT images (top row) and fused 18F-NaF PET/CT images (bottom row) of the left hind fetlock of a 14-year-old off-the-track Thoroughbred used for eventing. There is marked focal increased 18F-NaF uptake in the medial compact subchondral bone of the proximal phalanx without associated CT abnormality (short arrow). (Note that the lucency adjacent to the uptake in the transverse plane is a slice thickness artifact.) There is a focal short linear defect in the lateral compact subchondral bone of the proximal phalanx (long arrow), without associated 18F-NaF uptake. This suggests that the lateral lesion is an inactivelesion, likely developmental, whereas there is early stress remodeling of the medial subchondral bone. Fig. 6.

The 18F-NaF PET demonstrates focal increased uptake at the proximal lateral aspect of the distal phalanx (long arrows). The fused PET/ MRI con rms that this uptake is associated with the attachment of the collateral ligament of the distal interphalangeal joint (short arrows). Changes were not appreciated on MRI in the soft tissue part of the ligament, and the lesion was considered an enthesopathy rather than a desmitis.CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 161Fig. 7.

The top row shows the initial scan when lameness was localized to this area, and the bottom row is a recheck 4 months later when lameness had resolved. There is irregularity of the palmar aspect of the third metacarpal bone at the site of attachment of thesuspensory ligament with evidence of both resorption (long arrow) and enthesophyte formation (short arrows) on the initial CT images. This is associated with marked focal increased 18F-NaF uptake on the initial scan (arrowheads). On the recheck scan, the CT changes remain similar (arrows); however, the 18F-NaF uptake has resolved, con rming resolution of the active remodeling. Fig. 8.

Lateral is to the left. There are two focal areas of marked increased 18F-FDG uptake at the dorsal aspect of the DDFT, with the lateral area of uptake (long arrow) larger than the medial one (short arrow). These correspond to hypoattenuating areas on noncontrast CT with presenceof arterial contrast enhancement and hyperintensity noticed both on T1-w and T2-w MRI. On all modalities, the changes are more severe at the dorsal aspect of the lateral lobe (long arrow) when compared with the medial lobe (short arrow). This demonstrates biaxial active supranavicular dorsal brillation of the DDFT. 3CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS 162 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS18F-NaF PET Combined with CT or MRI for Optimal Bone Imaging Based on similar cross-sectional imaging proper- ties, PET can be overlaid with CT or MRI to create \"fused \"images. A dedicated softwarecallows PET data to be aligned with CT or MRI images acquired with other scanners.9The combination of the func- tional information from PET with the structural information from CT or MRI provides optimalassessment of the imaged area. PET/CT or PET/ MRI fusion is particularly helpful for assessment of subchondral bone and enthesis. These regionsare common sites of lesions for which both CT and M R Ih a v es o m el i m i t a t i o n s . For subchondral bone assessment, the detection of abnormalities on CT relies mostly on changes in the bone density, but sclerosis is very common and not specic for lameness causing pathology, and resorp- tion is typically only detected in the later stages of subchondral injury. MRI with the use of fluid-sensi- tive sequences can detect earlier changes in bone thanCT. This is particularly true for the trabecular sub-chondral bone where fluid accumulation can easily be recognized. However, MRI is much more limited in the assessment of the dense compact subchondral bone as changes in the compact subchondral bone areonly detected with CT and MRI when the lesion has progressed to signi cant resorption. Standing MRI image quality is also more greatly affected by patient motion compared to standing PET. The value of 18F-NaF for assessment of early changes in the compact bone was established in theinitial equine PET pilot study as focal increased 18F-NaF uptake was detected in the sagittal ridge of the flexor surface of the navicular bone of a horse where no abnormality had been detected with CT, MRI, and scintigraphy. This horse had a resorptive lesion at limb (Fig. 4). The combination of PET with CT was proven partic- ularly helpful for assessment of the fetlock in a popu- lation of sport horses. 10The most common sites of increased uptake were the medial subchondral boneof the proximal phalanx and the dorsomedial aspect ofthe distal third metacarpal bone. These are common sites of lesions, and the presence of increased uptake was associated with lameness in this population,based on diagnostic analgesia. In addition to recogniz- ing sites of subchondral bone activity, PET can help determine the clinical signi cance of other CT nd- ings. For example, a focal subchondral defect appa- rent on CT without associated increased 18F-NaF uptake suggests that the lesion is not active (Fig. 5). Diagnosing enthesopathies is also challenging be- cause of a requirement to detect changes in dense bone. PET seems particularly capable of detecting abnormalities at the attachments of the collateral lig-ament of the distal interphalangeal joint (Fig. 6).Increased uptake can also be recognized with PET at the attachment of the distal sesamoidean impar liga- ment on the distal phalanx. PET also identi ed theattachment of the chondrosesamoidean ligament on the distal phalanx as a possible site of injury. This lesion has been recognized in a population of horses with foot lameness. 5In the majority of cases, this nd- ing was associated with other navicular apparatus lesions, but in a few cases, the chondrosesamoidean enthesopathy was considered the primary source of lameness. Another common issue in the diagnosis of Fig. 9. Sagittal (left column) and transverse (right column) 18F-FDG images of the feet of 4 different horses. A, B, Normal horse, marked 18F-FDG uptake is present in the coronary band (arrow) with low uptake in the dorsal hoof wall (arrowheads). C,D, Horse with early acute laminitis; there is increased 18F-FDG uptake in the dorsal hoof wall (arrowheads). E, F, Horse with severe acute laminitis with protrusion of the distal phalanxthrough the sole. There is loss of 18F-FDG uptake at the coro- nary band (arrow).

G, H, Horse with quiescent chronic laminitis.There is decreased 18F-FDG uptake at the coronary band (arrow). The dorsal hoof wall appears distorted but presents a normal low 18F-FDG uptake (arrowheads).CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 163enthesopathies is the assessment of the signi cance of bone contour irregularities. For example, at the sus- pensory origin, it is fairly common to see the develop- ment of enthesophytes or focal areas of osseousresorption with other imaging modalities. This abnor- mal contour typically remains after resolution of the activity of lesions and can be appreciated in the inac-tive state (Fig. 7). PET has the ability to differentiate active enthesophyte formation or osseous resorption from chronic inactive changes. 18F-FDG PET Combined with CT or MRI for Staging of Soft Tissue Lesions The ability of 18F-FDG PET to detect tendon lesions was identi ed in the original equine PET pilot study with an example of a deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) lesion showing marked 18F-FDG increased uptake. A larger study in 8 horses with foot lame- ness compared PET ndings with CT and MRI and conrmed the ability of PET to detect DDFT lesions (Fig. 8).318F-FDG PET detected fewer lesions than CT and MRI, but this can be explained by the func- tional aspect of the modality. Chronic inactive lesions tend to remain apparent on noncontrast enhanced CT and on certain MRI sequences, butonly lesions with active changes will show increased uptake on PET. This is particularly helpful in stag- ing lesions and determining the clinical signi cance. 18F-FDG PET/CT has also been used in a smallgroup of horses with suspected proximal suspensorydesmitis. 11 18F-FDG PET for Assessment of Laminitis The ability to assess glucose metabolic activity in the foot with 18-FDG is particularly interesting for assess- ment and monitoring of laminitis. A pilot study in cases with severe laminitis con rmed that horses with acute laminitis demonstrate increased 18F-FDGuptake in the dorsal hoof wall.4Another interesting nding was that the 18F-FDG uptake decreases in the coronary band of horses with laminitis, both acute andchronic (Fig. 9). An ongoing study with repeated 18F- FDG PET scans in horses with chronic laminitis seemsto con rm the association between clinical signs and amount of 18F-FDG uptake. Further work is needed tofully establish the role of PET in laminitic cases, butthe early data are encouraging for PET to become a pertinent monitoring tool in chronic cases and poten-tially a prognostic indicator in acute laminitis. PET for Longitudinal Monitoring of Lesions Based on the functional nature of PET assessment, PET is particularly suitable for following lesions, both for assessing healing and monitoring recurrence. Theability to quantify the uptake with using standardizeduptake values (SUVs) adds to the convenience of com-parison between different scans. The SUV is a mea-sure of the amount of radioactivity per area, takinginto consideration the administered dose, the timebetween injection and image acquisition for decay cor- rection, and the weight of the patient. The maximal SUV (SUVmax) is the most convenient for assessmentof lesions. Normal equine bone typically has anSUVmax between 3 and 5, whereas SUVmax oflesions can be as high as 60. In the soft tissue, theSUVs remain much lower as normal tendons have anSUVmax of 1 or lower and lesions typically are in the3 to 5 SUVmax range. A longitudinal study assessing lesion healing in racehorse fetlocks during lay-up, 6 and 12 weeks after diagnosis, demonstrated thatlesions with lower SUVmax were more likely toresolve faster. 12The majority of the initially diag- nosed lesions were resolved or improved 12 weeks af-ter the initial diagnosis (Fig. 10). The exact lesion sitehad an effect on the likelihood of the uptake to resolve.Another study also in racehorses looked at monitoringpossible fetlock lesion recurrence once horses were back in training. Horses were scanned when return- ing to training after lay-up and 1, 2, 4, and 6 monthslater. Most horses did not show signi cant abnormal- ities at 1 and 2 months, but abnormal uptake reoc-curred in about half of the horses after 4 months.Abnormal uptake was more likely to develop at thesite of the original lesion that had been responsible forthe lay-up than in a different location. Outside of these two racehorse longitudinal studies, follow-up scans have been performed in a clinical pop-ulation of sport horses, in particular for assessment ofsubchondral lesions or enthesopathies with 18F-NaF,and for tendon lesions using 18F-FDG. As previouslymentioned, a study is currently assessing the value of Fig. 10. Maximal intensity projection, lateral view, of 18F-NaF PET data of the left fore fetlock of a Thoroughbred racehorse with marked increased 18F-NaF uptake in the palmar metacarpal condyle (short arrow) on the initial scan (A), which is still apparent but improved at the 6-week follow-up scan (B) and resolved at the 12-week follow-up scan (C).CROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESS 164 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSrepeated 18F-FDG PET scans for management of horses with chronic laminitis. 5. Conclusions PET is a relatively new imaging modality for horses but has already found many applications. 18F-NaF PET can be described as an improved 3D bone scan. Its ability to fuse with CT and MRI to provide func-tional information is particularly pertinent to detect early lesions or determine the signi cance of struc- tural changes. 18F-FDG PET is helpful for assessing the activity of soft tissue lesions, in particular in the DDFT or suspensory ligament. It also has pertinent applications in the assessment of laminitis. Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Its use in equinemedicine was gradual with only a few institutionsusing CT on a regular basis. However, recent advance-ments in technology and design have facilitated a rapidincrease in its use. CT is a cross-sectional imaging mo-dality that uses x-ray beams to generate tomographicslices of the animal. It has superior spatial resolution compared to radiographs, which allows for differentia- tion between bone and soft tissue. Conventional fanbeam CT machines require the use of a xed horizontal gantry requiring the horse to be placed under generalanesthesia for image acquisition. Images are acquiredby the x-ray generator and detector moving around thegantry in a helical fashion. Fixed CT machines requirethe use of a specialized CT table that move the point ofinterest through the gantry at a speci ed speed. Smaller, mobile gantries are also available and can bevery useful for intraoperative imaging. More recently, numerous CT systems have been made available in which several body parts can bescanned in the standing, sedated horse. Both standingfan beam and cone beam CT systems are currentlyavailable. a-cT h e s es y s t e m sr e q u i r et h eh o r s et oh a v e the region of interest placed inside the enclosedgantry (Fig. 1). Cone beam CT uses diverging radia- tion emitted in a cone shape that is detected by a de- tector plate and is not limited by xed annulus geometry. The open geometry of the cone beam CT creates a more flexible system that can be controlled by robotic arms (Fig. 2); however, the spatial resolu- tion is lower than that of fan beam CT. Computed tomography is considered a superior imag- ing modality for evaluating bone. Evaluation of soft tissues is limited especially compared to magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) which offers better spatial resolu-tion. Contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) can be used toovercome some of the limitations in soft tissue imaging.Contrast agents can be administered intravascularly orintra-articularly to highlight soft tissue and joint pa- thology. 1In equine medicine, CT is most useful, and at times critical, for early detection of bone pathology (e.g., subchondral bone injury); areas with complex anatomywhere superimposition makes interpretation of plainradiographs challenging (e.g., head, cervical spine); sur-gical planning in complex fractures (e.g., comminutedP1 fractures); surgical planning for fractures that do not allow adequate fluoroscopic or radiographic projec- tions (e.g., tarsal slab fractures); and surgical planning for bones with lack of direct exposure (e.g., P3). Imageacquisition is rapid and multiplanar and three- NOTES 166 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSCROSSTALK: COMBINING DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES FOR CASE SUCCESSdimensional (3D) reconstructions can be generated to allow examination of the body part in multiple different planes (e.g., sagittal, transverse, dorsal or any obliqueplane) or as a 3D image. 2. Diagnosis Computed tomography has been used quite exten- sively to examine the head in horses presenting with signs of sinonasal disease and dental disease.2It is also very useful for evaluating the temporomandibu-lar joints (TMJ), temporohyoid joints, and osseousbulla. The use of CT and CE-CT to diagnose intracra-nial disorders has been reported but MRI remainsthe superior imaging modality for these cases. 1In terms of dental disease, CT can identify early patho-logic changes in dentition such as widening of the pulp, gas accumulation, and periapical abscessation, all of which are impossible to diagnose on radio-graphs until the disease is advanced (Fig. 3). CT alsoprovides detailed information about the paranasalsinuses and the infraorbital canal. The TMJs, hyoid apparatus, base of the skull, and osseous bulla are very challenging to adequately examine using plain radiography alone. CT greatly facilitates diagnosis of infectious (e.g., TMJ otitis), osteoarthropathy (THO), TMJ osteoarthritis) disorders in this area. Bony of the equine foot including P3 bone fractures, are easily diagnosed and charac-terized using CT. Soft tissue disorders, such as deep digital flexor tendinopathies and cartilage injury in the distal interphalangeal joint, be investigatedusing intra-arterial (former) and intra-articular CE- CT (latter); however, MRI is likely the superior imag- ing modality. 3 As predicted, CT has also become incredibly useful in the early diagnosis of stress-associated bone injury or subchondral bone injury in racehorses and sport horses.4Early changes in bone are dif cult or even impossible to detect with plain radiography. The fet-lock is the most common site of subchondral bone injury and CT is quickly becoming the gold standardf o rb o n ei m a g i n go ft h i sj o i n t .D u et ot h ei n c r e a s e d sensitivity and speci city of CT, there is potential to prevent more serious or even catastrophic injuriesthrough early diagnosis (Fig. 4). CT can also be very helpful in diagnosing and characterizing traumatic,infectious, and degenerative disorders of the fetlock including condylar fractures, osteomyelitis, and osteo- arthritis (OA). A study by Olive et al. found that CT consistently identi ed OA lesions including osteo- phytes, subchondral Fig. 1. Standing fan beam CT systems including AstoaCT (left) and Qalibrab(right). Fig. 2.

Disorders such as occult osteoarthritis, subchondral bone injury, fractures, and proximal sus- pensory can all be diagnosed and character- ized using CT. In the author 's institution, CT has been particularly useful for evaluating horses with talocal- caneal and plantar distal tarsal osteoarthritis as these anatomic locations are dif cult to adequately examine with plain radiographs due to superimposition (Fig. 5). Complex carpal fractures and tarsal slab fractures also lend themselves well to CT imaging. Although tarsal slab fractures are generally simple, they can be chal- lenging to detect using radiography unless the perfect oblique projection is obtained. CT is also particularlyuseful for examining the enthesis of the proximal sus-pensory ligament, and CE-CT can be used to examinethe proximal suspensory ligament itself (Fig. 6). CT can also be useful for evaluating horses with sus- pected caudal radial exostoses or osteochondromas. The stifl e can be a challenging area to image using CT because of the size and shape of the anatomic region. CT scanners with large gantries can be used to obtain images of the stifl e, and CT arthrography has been shown to be useful in detecting joint pathol- ogy. 6At this time, stifl e CT can only be performed with the horse anesthetized. Computed tomography imaging of the cervical spine, especially with standing systems that allow for easier image acquisition of the cervical spine up to the articu- lation of C7-T1, has been critical in expanding theunderstanding of cervical spine pathology and provid-ing accurate diagnoses. Due to the complex anatomy,superimposition, and dif culty obtaining dorsoventral or ventrodorsal radiographs, the bechallenging to evaluate using plain radiography. CT isincredibly useful for examining the paired APJ can be very dif cult to identify on radio- graphs even when utilizing oblique projections to high-light the foramina; however, CT allows for examinationof this area in multiple planes and easily facilitates a denitive diagnosis (Fig. 7). Traumatic and infectious disorders of the cervical spine can also be easily investi- gated with CT. Finally, CT myelograms can be used todetermine spinal cord compression especially in horseswith axial compression that can be dif cult to detect during conventional myelography (Fig. 8). Recently, some institutions have been investigating the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in thehorse. 7New Bolton Center, has been combining standing CT and standing PET to further examineareas of suspected bone injury. The co-registration of the images has been very useful for con rming clini- cally relevant bony lesions (Fig. 9). 3. Surgical Planning and Treatment Preoperative CT can be invaluable for surgical plan-ning. Surgeons preparing for surgeries involving anatomical locations with complex surgical anatomy, complex fractures, fractures that do not allow ade- quate fluoroscopic or radiographic projections, and bones with complete lack of direct exposure willalways bene t from preoperative and, at times, intra- operative CT. Preoperative CT can be performed in the days leading up to surgery (an increasingly acces- sible option with the development of standing CT)or immediately prior to surgery once the patient isanesthetized (Fig. 10). Multiplanar reconstructions(MPR) allow for precise examination of bony anatomy, fracture con guration, and proposed drill and screw trajectories. Screw lengths can also be accurately measured using MPR images. This can be essential Fig. 4.

As mentioned, complex and comminuted fractures lend themselves well to preoperative CT imaging. CTprovides an in depth understanding of fracture planes and can be used to plan implant placement. This is particularly helpful in comminuted P1 and P2 fractures and complex carpal fractures. Preoperative CT is also very useful in horses with more simple Fig. 6.

Additionally, CT can be useful in the preoperative evaluation of all horses with condylar fractures as it helps to identify concurrent bony lesions includ- ing articular fragmentation, subchondral boneinjury and proximal sesamoid bone trauma, which can affect the surgical approach and prognosis (Fig. 12). 8 R a d i o p a q u em a r k e r sc a nb ea p p l i e dt ot h eh o o f or skin prior to the CT scan to determine the surgi- cal approach (Fig. 13). This is particularly useful when the margin of error is minimal (e.g., navicu-lar bone fracture). Placement of markers should be exact with repeat CT scans performed as needed until this is achieved. Intraoperative CT scans should be performed as needed to con rm the tra- jectory of drill holes and placement of implants. 4. Conclusion Computed tomography is an invaluable, increasingly accessible tool for evaluating the equine skeleton. It has proved essential in the diagnosis of certain disor- ders and surgical treatment of fractures involving the foot. CT also facilitates more accurate surgical plan- ning and approaches that can ultimately lead to betterpatient outcomes.

Introduction Emergency stabilization of the critical, weak, or re- cumbent neonate may focus on identi cation and treatment of common clinical conditions independentof the primary diagnosis. Recognition of the presenceof these conditions and selection of appropriate inter-ventions allows for a focused approach to emergencyevaluation and stabilization in the eld, as well as upon intake to a tertiary facility. The team may thenregroup to identify and address the primary diagnosisfollowing emergency stabilization. The following is a summary of the collective wisdom of equine neonatologists; various personal mentorsover the last 22 years; and the author 's personal clini- cal experience as a eld and hospital criticalist. The goal of this session is to arm the new practitioner withthe con dence to stabilize and evaluate the critical equine neonate in the eld. For further reading, please refer to the list of additional references at theend of this summary. 2. Hypoperfusion Hypoperfusion is de ned as inadequate blood flow through organs and tissues to supply the necessaryoxygen and nutrients for normal function.1Hypo- perfusion occurs in neonates to decreased myocar-dial and/or coagulopathy.Hypoperfusion is frequently observed in foals thathave not nursed in 4 hours, have increased fluid loss (diarrhea), or are septicemic.Foals suffering from hypoperfusion are commonly identi ed based on history and evaluation of perfusion parameters. Perfusion parameters in the neonatal foal include jugular ll, extremity temperature, pulse quality, mucous membrane color, capillary re ll time, mentation, urine production, blood pressure, and lac-tate concentration. Heart rate is not as reliable an in-dicator in foals as it is in adults. Serial monitoring ofthe perfusion parameters is used to guide therapy.Foals that have appropriate perfusion should havewarm extremities, have strong peripheral pulse qual- ity, have pink mucous membranes with a capillary rell time (CRT) of less than 2 seconds, demonstrate responsive mentation, and produce frequent, hyposthe-nuric urine (considered clinical perfusion parameters).Peripheral lactate concentrations should decrease byapproximately 50% within the rst 4 hours of therapy. There will be exceptions to these rules based on under-lying diagnosis, such as persistently altered mentationin neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS). Correction of hypoperfusion is a 3-step process. Circulating blood volume should be restored prior to administration of inotropes or vasopressors. In theauthor 's practice, hypovolemia is corrected through the administration of 10 to 20 mL/kg bolus of bal- anced crystalloid u tion, NormR, or PlasmaLyte A) up to a maximumtotal of 60 mL/kg. In practice, this equates to 1 L for a 50-kg foal administered over 15 to 20 minutes in a case of severe shock or 30 to 60 minutes in less criti- cal situations. Perfusion parameters are monitored, and foals that need more than 2 boluses often require NOTES 172 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICEmyocardial or vasomotor support as well. Limits are best monitored in the hospital via ultrasonographic assessment of cardiac output and indirect arterialand central venous blood pressure determination toavoid overhydration. If perfusion remains poor follow-ing restoration of circulating blood volume or maximal resuscitation, administration of dobutamine and/or norepinephrine is indicated. 3. Hypoglycemia Neonatal foals are predisposed to rapid development of hypoglycemia when not nursing adequately. Foals are born with minimal glycogen stores in the liver, muscle, or brain, and glucose levels drop signi cantly during the initial 2 hours of extrauterine life. Normal glucose concentrations are 80 to 160 mg/dL with leth- argy, weakness, and seizure activity observed with increasing severity of hypoglycemia. Any conditionthat results in decreased nutritional intake can lead to hypoglycemia in the equine neonate, including an inability to rise due to musculoskeletal disorders,colic, sepsis, and/or NMS. In addition, hereditary dis- orders of glucose metabolism and conditions such as septicemia or prematurity may result in increasedenergy demands. Glucose concentrations may be readily evaluated in theeld using a handheld glucometer. Human gluc- ometers have been shown to be reliable, although glu-cose concentrations may be underestimated when performed on whole blood. Glucometers are especially benecial for serial monitoring of trends in glucose concentrations during therapy and hospitalization. iSTAT aalso sells cartridges for glucose determination, including the CHEM8. Dextrose supplementation of the critical neonate in theeld should be judicious in the absence of a method for determining glucose concentrations. Hyperglycemia has repeatedly been demonstrated to have detrimentaleffects in human critical care studies1with strict glucose control between a range of 80 to 110 mg/dLresulting in improved outcomes. Therefore, bolusadministration of 5% dextrose containing fluids is no longer considered ideal among equine neonatologists.Full-term neonates have a glucose energy requirementequal to 4 mg/kg/minute dextrose. Therefore, initial fluids should consist of a 1% dextrose solution in balanced crystalloid fluid (20 mL 50% dextrose/1 L) are recommended when glucose concentration isunknown. A 1% solution supplies twice maintenance energy requirements (8mg/kg/min) for a 50kg foalwhen administered over a period of 30 minutes. This will allow for correction of mild hypoglycemia without signicant risk of iatrogenic hyperglycemia. When determination of glucose concentrations is availablestall-side and is <50mg/dL, administration of a 2% dextrose solution (40mL 50% dextrose/1L) may beconsidered to correct the de cit. Alternatively, if the foal's temperature is above 98\u00b0F, enteral feeding is preferred. In the author 's experience, a single admin- istration of 250 -500mL of mare 's milk via nasogastricintubation is reasonable; however, if the foal does not turn around quickly, additional nutritional planningwill be necessary. 4. Hypothermia Neonates are prone to hypothermia (body tempera- ture<98\u00b0F) due to increased thermal loss via evapo- ration, conduction, radiation, and convection. Thecritical ambient temperature for a normal healthy foal is 77\u00b0F with suf cient heat production in temper- atures below 37\u00b0F.2Ill and premature neonates, how- ever, are less capable of appropriate thermoregulationassociated with lower metabolic rates per surface areaand decreased heat production. Hypothermia can result in a shock-like state with progressive decline in cellular and organ function. However, hypothermia can be bene cial, as has been demonstrated in human CPR and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Hypothermia is associated with reduced metabolism, decreased in pre- vention of ischemic-reperfusion injury; therefore, per- missive hypothermia is currently recommended over aggressive warming. Increasing body temperature byno more than 1\u00b0F per hour with a body temperature goal of 98\u00b0F to 99\u00b0F is currently recommended. Rapid warming should occur when bradycardia ( <60 beats per minute), dysrhythmias, or temperature <96\u00b0F is present. Methods of warming include moving a foal into a warmer environment, moving it away from drafts,and applying a fleece or down cover. Bair bhuggers or heat lamps are also bene cial, but caution should be taken to not overheat the foal. Electric heating blan-kets or pads should not be used to avoid burns and ex- cessive peripheral vasodilation. 5. Hypoxemia Causes of hypoxemia include decreased inspired oxy-gen concentration, diffusion impairment, hypoventila-tion, V/Q mismatch, and right to left shunting of blood. The most common causes of hypoxemia in theequine neonate are associated with hypoventilation and V/Q mismatch due to prematurity, NMS, septice- mia, pneumonia, atelectasis of recumbency, or acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Assessment of respiratory function and oxygen sta- tus requires the use of a pulse oximeter and/or bloodgas analyzer, such as an iSTAT CG4 cartridge.Normal oxygen values are lower in the rst 24 hours compared to adults and greatly in fluenced by prema- turity, age, and position. Recumbency can reduce oxygen concentrations by up to 40 mmHg with normal lung function. Adequate oxygenation is indicated by SpO 295% and PaO 2>7 0 mmHg. Evaluation of arterial gases in conjunction with venous blood gas will provide improved assess- ment of global oxygen status, particularly in foals with neonatal isoerythrolysis. Provision of oxygen supplementation via intra- insuf is often the rst step in neonatalBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 173stabilization in an equine neonatal intensive care unit and may be administered within seconds of arrival.Humidi ed oxygen is supplied via small bore flexible tubing at rates of 2 to 10 L/minute with most critical and recumbent foals requiring 3 to 5 L/minute.Caution should be taken to avoid oxygen toxicity by reducing flow rates if PaO 2> 120 mmHg. Comparison of arterial blood gas on room air versus oxygen insuf- flation allows for assessment of maturity and degree of shunting. Foals that do not respond to nasal insuffl a- tion in the absence of congenital cardiac anomaliesmay require positive pressure ventilation on 100% oxy-gen. In addition to supplementation of oxygen, lung function is improved by maintaining sternal recum- bency over parasternal or lateral recumbency throughthe use wedges, sandbags, or bales of hay. 6. Hypoventilation Hypoventilation is de ned as PaCO 2> 55 to 60 mmHg resulting in respiratory acidosis, associated metabolicresponses, cerebral vasodilation, and increased intra- cranial pressure. The most common causes of hypoven- tilation in the neonate include NMS, prematurity,sepsis, and severe respiratory disease (e.g., NERDS/ NARDS). Permissive hypercapnia is allowed as long as mentation is appropriate and blood pH > 7.25.Assessment of ventilatory status requires arterial blood gas analysis, although poor mentation in the face of normalized cardiovascular function with analtered respiratory pattern and history consistent with prematurity or NMS may be suggestive. Therapeutic intervention depends upon the underly- ing cause of hypercapnia \u2014whether neurogenic, obstruc- in origin. Foals neurogeniccauses of hypoventilation, such as NMS or sepsis, bene- t from chemical ventilation via stimulation of the respi- ratory centers of the brain. Administration of doxapram or caffeine stimulates respiratory drive; however, doxap- ram has been shown to be more effective in foals in bothexperimentally induced and clinical hypercapnia. Obstructive disorders resulting in hypercapnia are best treated by addressing the primary problem, suchas upper respiratory obstruction, pleural disease, and pneumothorax. Foals that hypercapnia associ- ated with neuromuscular or respiratory muscle fatigueand those respiratory failure, including foals with botulism, ARDS, or prematurity, require positive pres- sure ventilation. 7. Hypobase Three types of acidosis may be observed in critical neonates, including respiratory acidosis and organic (lactic) acidosis, which have been inorganic acidosis associated with hypo- natremia and hyperchloremia may be present and is treated through gradual correction of electrolyte con-centrations and management of the underlying cause.8. Hypoimmunity Foals are highly susceptible to infection and require passive transfer of immunity via absorption of ma- ternal antibodies in colostrum shortly after birth.Premature lactation, incomplete vaccination, poorimmune status of the mare, or any illness of the foal that prevents proper colostral ingestion may prevent successful passive transfer and increase the risk ofsepsis. Therefore, any critically ill neonate should beassessed as to the need for intravenous plasma and/orantimicrobial administration. 9. Conclusion The status of critical neonates changes rapidly, and successful outcomes often require frequent ne-tuning of multimodal therapies under the observation of ateam of skilled professionals. Awareness of the 7 hypos and knowledge of how to address each can pro-vide guidance for emergency stabilization in the eld, as well as upon admission to tertiary care facilities.Basic therapies recommended by the author and eas-ily administered in the eld prior to referral that may improve overall outcomes include 1. restoration of cir-culating fluid volume not to exceed 40 mL/kg IV fluid total, 2. provision of maintenance nutritional needsvia 1% dextrose solutions or enterally administeredmare 's milk, 3. supporting body temperature via application of a lightweight blanket, 4. improvedventilatory status through single administration of caffeine at 10 mg/kg enterally, and 5. a single admin- istration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials.

Introduction Because many advances have been made in equine health, horses today live well into their 20s and 30s,making it even more important to provide their teethwith regular preventive care. Small problems that arerecognized and corrected at an early age seldom becomethe large problems seen in many of today' sa d u l th o r s e s . Current research is showing that equine teeth that func-tion normally and have a normal grinding patternactually wear more slowly and therefore last longer.This means that the better a horse 's teeth are main- tained, the longer its teeth will remain effective at grind-ing long-stemmed forage, the staple of the equine diet. Because not all dental problems in horses are obvious to the untrained eye or are revealed through clinicalsigns, it is important to have regular, comprehensivedental examinations conducted by a veterinarian. 1,2Due to the stoic nature of horses, obvious outward signs ofdental disease are often not present until the condition isvery advanced. Modern equine dentistry requires a phys-ical exam of the entire patient, sedation, and speciali-zed instrumentation to perform the oral examination.Advances in dentistry have brought forth new ways toapproach pathological conditions in the horse 'sm o u t h . Veterinarians well trained in equine dentistry have the skills to prevent most major dental problems that previ- ously have been accepted as an inevitable part of aging. 2. History and Physical Assessment Horses with dental disorders can show no clinicalsigns or a variety of often unspeci c clinical signssuch as partial to complete anorexia, salivation, quid-ding, weight loss, large undigested feed particles infeces, head tilting or tossing on the bridle, refusing totake a lead, foul odor from mouth, nasal discharge, orswelling of face, jaw, or mouth tissues. Before under-taking an oral evaluation, one needs to rst assess what the horse is fed and how the horse is eating (offer long-stem roughage and processed feed). It isalso important to determine when an oral examina-tion was last done and what the noticed pathologieswere. A complete physical examination is indispensa-ble in order to assess the overall health status of the h o r s ea n dd e t e r m i n ei ft h ep a t i e n ti ss u i t a b l et ob e sedated. 3. Sedation Proper and judicious sedation is a key element in thecomprehensive oral examination and also in the deliv-ery of any dental treatment. Always perform a physi-cal evaluation before sedating a horse. Do not sedateany horse with systemic signs such as fever, tachycar-dia, arrhythmia, or tachypnea without rst determin- ing the cause of such signs. Several sedation protocolsare used for dentistry; however, only a few have beenclinically evaluated on a large scale. In general, horsesare sedated with an alpha-2 agonist alone or in combi-nation with a synthetic opioid. 3,4Sedation should b eb a s e do nt e m p e r a m e n t ,b r e e d ,a g e ,a n dw e i g h t .Refractory horses should be rst sedated intramuscu- larly 30 to 40 minutes prior to the examination toimprove patient' s compliance. NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 175BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICEThe use of reversals is generally not recommended but can be done in case the horse becomes hypoten- sive, recumbent, or distressed. The use of tolazoline (4 mg/kg IV slowly) or yohimbine (0.075 mg/kg) is not without serious risk of idiosyncratic (anxiety, respira-tory distress, cardiovascular compromise due to vaso- dilation and airway constriction) and potentially fatal consequences as evidenced by clinical reports of drug reactions and possible death following their adminis- tration. 5Because of the reported fatalities, it is recom- mended to use tolazoline intramuscularly only and to give it in increments of 1/3 of the calculated full dose. 4. Equipment In order to perform a comprehensive oral examination, appropriate equipment is needed. A variety of dental equipment is available to facilitate the oral examination: -Full mouth speculum -Head stand or head support (mirror, bucket, brush, andchlorhexidine gluconate -Camera 5. The Oral Examination The oral examination encompasses a comprehensive assessment of the equine dentition and the supporting structures associated with the teeth. There are ve components to the oral examination: external oral ex- amination, oral soft tissue exam, occlusion, and endo- dontic and periodontal status. It is very important to record all ndings of the oral examination using a charting system. The external oral examination of the head focuses on any bony swellings (Fig. 1), draining tract (Fig. 2),mandibular lymph node, muscular uniformity (asym- metry, atrophy, hypertrophy), anatomical and devel-opmental changes, ocular or nasal discharge (Fig. 3), smell, and air flow through nasal passages. Visual assessment and palpation are essential in order to determine any possible asymmetry. Any mandibular callus, crepitus, draining tract, or pain on palpation may require mandibular radiographs to be obtained prior to placing a full mouth speculum so as not to exacerbate a possible underlying pathological process(fracture). The oral soft tissues include gingiva, mucosa, tongue, and hard/soft palate. The gingiva should betight in approximation of the tooth and light pink incolor. Loss or recession of the gingiva and an increased redness indicate gingivitis. The mucosa of the lips, cheeks, and lingual surface, as well as the tongue andhard/soft palate, should be light pink in color and devoid of abrasions/ulcerations. Abrasions that are commonly noted are due mostly to sharp enamelpoints formed during chewing as well as following bit injuries (Figs. 4 and 5). Examination of these tissueswill allow early detection of periodontal disease andoral neoplasia (Fig. 6). Occlusion refers to the grinding function of the teeth when the jaws are brought together. This is bestobserved during the external oral examination andreevaluated during the internal examination. Thiswould include the identi cation of incisor (Fig. 7) and cheek teeth malocclusion (Fig. 8) and evaluation of Fig. 1. Adult horse with bony swelling over the right maxillary sinus. Fig. 2. Draining tract associated with the right mandible.BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 176 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSmovement and range of motion. Missing teeth or the presence of supernumerary teeth should be noted as well as any associated overgrowth that might affectthe occlusion. The table angle of the cheek teeth and the level of staining should also be noted. An increase in color staining indicates lack of occlusion, attrition,or chewing resulting in the buildup of tannic acid staining from food material. An increased table angle on one side of the mouth indicates a lack of attritionor a functional inability to use these quadrants. The endodontic status evaluates the integrity of clinical crown (Fig. 9), occlusal dentin of the pulphorns/pulp chambers, and any decay (cemental orinfundibular). Cheek teeth comprise 5 to 7 pulp hornsthat have live pulp extending from the apical aspect of the common pulp chamber toward the occlusal sur- face. The function of the pulp is to produce primary,secondary, and tertiary dentin. Primary dentin is present in the pulp horns when the teeth enter the mouth. Secondary and tertiary dentin are producedwhile the teeth are being worn away. Without the abil- ity to ef ciently produce dentin, the pulp would become exposed over time and result in pulpitis. The chewing surface of every tooth should be closely exam-ined to identify any decay of the dentin in the pulphorns (often presence of feed material packed on the surface of the subocclusal secondary dentin, Fig. 10). The periodontal status is examined by noting anywhere in the mouth where food is caught and stagnating. Periodontal disease in the horse oftenbegins with food packing in the interproximalspace, leading to rotting feed, acid production, and bacterial overgrowth, which contribute to in flam- mation of the periodontal structures (Fig. 11). Initially, the gingiva becomes infl amed (red and Fig. 3. Mucopurulent right-sided nasal discharge. Fig. 4. Abrasions along the right buccal maxillary mucosa sec- ondary to sharp enamel points. Fig. 5. Abrasions along the tongue secondary to sharp enamelpoints. Fig. 6. Soft tissue mass along the cranial lingual aspect of theright mandible ( CLINICAL SKILLS FOR PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 177swollen). If the condition is not remediated, deeper structures such as bone and periodontal ligament become affected. This process leads to irreversible resorption of the interproximal bone and periodon-tal ligament. This process is painful for the horse and often causes quidding. The severity of a peri- odontal disease is best determined using probingdepth and dental radiographs. 6. Conclusion In summary, the equine oral examination is a com-prehensive specialty exam that should be carried outin a systematic fashion. The ndings of the oral ex- amination should be recorded on a dental chart and kept with the patient 's record. Dental records are im- portant medical information that may help establisha dental care plan for the individual horse. Further, it will document past dental ndings and procedures in case a different veterinarian becomes the primary Fig. 7. Incisor malocclusion (slant). Fig. 8.

Bell, DVM, DACVO Author 's address: Hagyard Equine Medical e-mail: sbell@hagyard.com. \u00a92022 AAEP. 1. Introduction A thorough ophthalmic examination should be per- formed if a horse is exhibiting signs of an ocular com- plaint (blepharospasm, ocular discharge, blepharedema,redness, vision changes, cloudy eye, etc.). An ophthalmicexam is also a key component of the prepurchase exami-nation. 1As many systemic diseases have ocular mani- festations of systemic disease, it is recommended toperform an ophthalmic exam in any sick horse.Performing routine ophthalmic exams in a consistentmanner will allow the practitioner to become con dent and capable in diagnosing and treating ocular disor-ders. This talk and associated paper will focus on per-forming and interpreting ophthalmic examination inthe horse. 2. Ophthalmic Examination The ophthalmic examination should be performed in asystematic manner.2It is helpful to perform the exam in the same order each time to avoid missing an essen-tial part. Ideally, a medical history of the horse shouldbe available to the examining veterinarian to correlateany clinical ndings with medical events or accidents (e.g., corneal scar responding to history or corneal ulcerand treatment). 1Reason for the exam should be docu- mented, along with a description of clinical signs, dura-tion, previous/current treatment, and response totherapy. Prior and existing medical therapy is impor-tant to know. For example, topical atropine may resultin mydriasis for up to 14 days in horses. 2,3The veterinarian should have the following equip- ment and supplies2: \u0081Focal bright light source, such as a penlight or Finoff transilluminator \u0081Magni cation is often \u0081Indirect fundoscopic lens (e.g., \u0081Direct ophthalmoscope useful animal urinary catheter, saline,betadine solution) \u0081Eyewash/saline for ocular flushing The initial part of the ophthalmic exam should include observation of the horse in its surroundings in NOTES 180 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICEa well-lit area. The horse should be observed for response to movement and people or other animals approaching.4 A step-by-step approach as outlined below will ensure allcomponents of the exam are complete. 5There are a vari- ety of ophthalmic examination sheets that may be help- ful to guide the examination and enable drawing of pictures to document lesions and evaluate progress over time (Fig. 1).6 Initial evaluation of symmetry, globe position, eyelash orientation, and cranial nerve evaluation (CN II, III, IV, V, VI, VII) should be performed prior to administeringsedation as long as this is safe for the handler, examiner,and horse. 2,7Safety of all involved is of utmost impor- tance and overrides the need for any examination com-ponent. Thus, sedation should be administered initiallyif needed. Environment The initial components of the exam, including vision testing, evaluation of symmetry, nerve blocks, and adnexal examination, should be performed in a well-litarea with minimal noise and distractions if possible.2 To adequately examine the cornea, anterior segment,and deeper structures of the eye, an area that can bedarkened is ideal to maximize lesion identi cation. 2,6 Symmetry The examiner should assess the horse for facial, or- bital, and globe symmetry. This may be best evaluated with the veterinarian standing in front of the horse at a distance to assess globe position, size, and ocular dis-comfort. In particular, the relative angulation of theupper eyelashes should be assessed. Lowering of theangle of the upper eyelashes is a subtle indicator of ocu-lar discomfort in the absence of overt blepharospasm orepiphora. 7Observe the face closely for signs of present or past tearing or other ocular discharge. Palpation of both orbits should be performed. Retropulsion of both globes is performed by pushingthe globe back into the orbit through closed eyelids.5,6 **Note: retropulsion should never be performed in a fragile globe with a corneal defect. It should be bilat- erally symmetrical and nonpainful. Retropulsion is also used to extrude the third eyelid and allow forclose examination of this structure2,5,6(see Adnexal section). Vision and Ocular Reflexes The veterinarian should note how the horse reacts to its surroundings.1With vision loss, especially chronic, horses may adapt and continue to perform. Thus, it is important to test ocular re flexes, including menace response, dazzle reflex, and pupillary light re flexes. In some cases, a maze test may be performed by covering one eye and having the horse navigate through obstacles. T h em e n a c er e s p o n s et e s t sc r a n i a ln e r v e sI I( o p t i c ) and VII (facial) and requires an intact visual and motor cortex. This is a learned cortical response in which a\"menacing gesture \"is performed with the observer 's hand and the horse sees this and reacts by blinking orwith an avoidance movement of the head.2,8Care should be taken to avoid stimulation of aural and tactilesenses (air movement or inadvertently touching vibris- sae). The menace response should be evaluated throughout the horse 'sv i s u a l eld in all quadrants (i.e., hand motions from cranial, perpendicular, and caudal t ot h ee y e ) .T h eh o r s e 'st o t a lv i s u a l eld extends almost 360\u00b0 (146\u00b0 of uniocular vision with 65\u00b0 of binocular vision anteriorly), with a small blind spot posteriorly.1 The dazzle re flex also tests cranial nerves II (optic) and VII (facial) and the retina. This is a subcorticalreflex and does not require cortical processing. The horse should blink when a focal bright light source is shone into the eye.2 It is important to ensure the palpebral re flex is intact and the horse is able to blink completely in order to adequately evaluate the menace response and dazzle re flex. The palpebral refl ex tests cranial nerves V (trigeminal) and VII (facial).2,6The periocu- lar area is touched, which stimulates the sensory por-tion of the trigeminal nerve and results in blinking via the facial nerve. Pupillary Light Reflexes (PLRs) Pupil size and symmetry should be evaluated using the focal light source.2The light should then be used to assess the pupillary light re flex in each eye. Light s h o n ei n t oo n ee y es h o u l dc a u s eb o t hp u p i l st oc o n -strict (direct and consensual PLRs). The PLR tests cranial nerves II (optic) and III (oculomotor).2,6 **Following the initial assessment as outlined above, the veterinarian may now administer sedation and re- gional nerve blocks as indicated. Regional Nerve Blocks The most common nerve block used in the equine ocularexamination is the auriculopalpebral nerve block, which targets the palpebral branch of the facial nerve (CNVII). 2,6The examiner injects 1 to 2 mL of lidocaine (or other local anesthetic) subcutaneously over the zygo-matic arch using a 25-gauge 5/8-inch needle. This blocksmotor function to the orbicularis oculi muscle for ;1t o 2 hours and facilitates ocular examination. This is espe-cially important in a fragile globe with a deep cornealulcer or laceration as it reduces the pressure necessary to open the eyelids. 2,6 Another common nerve block is the frontal nerve block, which targets the supraorbital branch of the tri- geminal nerve (CN V).2This branch provides sensory innervation to most of the central upper eyelid. It ismost easily blocked as it emerges from the supraorbitalforamen within the frontal bone. Topical corneal anesthetic such as proparacaine or tetracaine ( ;0.2 mL) may be instilled to provide cor- neal analgesia and facilitate ophthalmic examinationand corneal sampling when indicated. 4Short-term tis- sue desensitization (up to ;20 minutes) is achieved by applying the anesthetic ophthalmic solution onto thetarget surface. This may be accomplished using the broken-off hub of a 25-gauge needle attached to a small (1 or 3 mL) syringe as a spray device.4It isBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 181important to gently spray the solution, especially in fragile or compromised corneas, to decrease the risk of corneal perforation. Refer to appropriate texts for diagrams and addi- tional periocular nerve blocks for ophthalmic proce-dures or surgery. 2 Examination Components The ophthalmic exam should include evaluation of the following structures: periocular area, eyelids, thirdeyelid, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, vitreous, and fundus.2,6It is important to examine each structure in both eyes and avoid focusing directly on the lesion, as contributing factors may be missed. The examination sheet shown in Fig 1 may behelpful as a checklist. The veterinarian should performthe ophthalmic examination in an orderly repeatable manner each time. A preferred method is to begin at the front and progress to the back of the eye (ante-rior!posterior) while simultaneously moving from Fig. 1. Ophthalmic examination sheet, example (Hagyard Equine Medical Institute).BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 182 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSperipheral to axial.9Retroillumination is used to visu- alize the tapetal re flection through the pupil; a focal light source is held close to the observer' se y ea n d directed toward the horse 's eye at arm 'sl e n g t h .6,9This allows assessment of pupil size and symmetry and highlights any opacities impeding the re flection, including corneal scar, corneal blood vessels, cataract,pigment, and so on. Transillumination (focal illumina-tion) is used to sequentially examine all structures inthe anterior segment. 9A focal light source should be directed at the eye from many angles while the exam-iner also varies the viewing angle, permitting assess-ment of the eye from all 3 dimensions. 6,9Deeper structures are then examined using focal illumination, the slit-beam setting on the direct ophthalmoscope, and fundic examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy. Adnexa, Eyelids, and Conjunctiva The examiner may use a bright light source to provide direct illumination to inspect the adnexa, eyelids, and conjunctiva. Magni cation loupesaare inexpensive and very helpful in identifying lesions on intricate struc-tures. Varying degrees of magni cation and focal dis- tance are available. Any ocular discharge should benoted. The eyelid borders should be smooth and free of scars or regions of ulceration. Eyelid closure should be complete. 1The globe should be retropulsed to extrude the third eyelid for examination. The conjunctiva should be smooth and pink with no irregularities. Common defects to look for include tumors (squamouscell carcinoma, sarcoid, melanoma, etc.), with conjunctivitis. **The remainder of the ophthalmic examination is best performed in a dark or dimly lit area. Magni cation is helpful in examining the cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. 2 Cornea The cornea should be smooth and clear with a lus- trous tear lm. Start with diffuse focal direct illumi- nation and identify any abnormalities. Then change to the slit beam on a direct ophthalmoscope head tofurther evaluate corneal topography, thickness, depth of any previously identi ed lesions, and any areas of stromal loss. As with adnexa, magni cation is very benecial. Light directed perpendicular or diagonal to the cornea should help reveal opacities against the dark background of the iris/pupil interface.2 Anterior Chamber The anterior chamber should be optically clear.1Again start with diffuse focal direct illumination to look forany abnormalities or opacities within the anterior cham- ber. Then change to the slit beam on a direct ophthalmo- scope head to further evaluate clarity of the aqueoushumor and the iris/lens interface. It is very important tolook for aqueous flare, which represents protein 6cells in the anterior chamber and is an important indicator ofanterior uveitis. 2,5,6Aqueous flare can be detected byshining the focal light source directly on the cornea so it is a focused beam; the examiner looks perpendicular to the beam of light as it crosses through the anteriorchamber. The anterior chamber should be clear and not cloudy or murky. Use the slit beam or the smallest focal circular beam of light to focus the light directly onthe cornea. 6Typically, the light source is held close to the cornea ( ;5-10 mm) in order to focus the light. The examiner should view the light from the side (45 -90\u00b0) as the light courses from the cornea through the ante- rior chamber. Normal eyes will show the light beam hit- ting the corneal surface !a clear void in the anterior chamber !light hitting the anterior lens capsule and iris/lens interface !light coursing through the lens to the end at the posterior lens capsule.6A light beam visi- ble in the anterior chamber between the cornea and iris/lens interface (like a car head light beam in the fog) indi- cates the presence of aqueous flare and thus uveitis.6 Dark exam settings and magni cation are helpful. Iris Including Corpora Nigra The iris should be examined for tissue architecture, smooth topography, variations in pigmentation, or mass effect. The iris may vary in color; combinations of brown and blue irides (heterochromia iridis) are avariation of normal. These should be differentiated from regions of hyper- or hypopigmentation of the iris from past uveitis. The corpora nigra or granula iridica are normal that arise from the posterior pig- mented epithelium of the iris and dorsal and ventral pupillary margins.7Corpora nigra m a yh a v eaw i d ev a r i a t i o no fn o r m a li nt e r m s of shape and size. It is important to compare the cor- pora nigra between both eyes to look for symmetry.Atrophy, shrinkage, or coalescence of corpora nigra may be indicative of past uveitis. Corpora nigra may also become cystic and enlarged, which can result invisual impairment from partial blockage of the pupil orimpingement on the corneal endothelium causing cor- neal lesions. 7Iridal cysts may be present separate from the corpora nigra along the margin of the pupil or rarely free- floating in the anterior chamber.10Iris cysts arise from the posterior pigmented epithelium of theiris and may peek over the pupillary margin into theanterior chamber. It is impossible to predict which cysts are likely to enlarge. The examiner should ensure the pupil is mobile and look for any synechia (adhesions). Adhesions of the iris to the cornea are known as \"anterior synechia. \" 7 Synechia are usually indicative of past corneal ulcera-tion/rupture or uveitis. Anterior synechia should bedifferentiated from persistent pupillary are congenital. Persistent pupil- lary membranes (PPMs) typically originate at the iriscollarette, and anterior synechia typically originate from the pupillary margin. 11Adhesions of the iris to the lens are known as \"posterior synechia \"and gener- ally indicate previous uveitis.1Differentiating a of uveitis vs equine recurrent uveitis is gener-ally not possible with a single examination.BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 183Lens Whether or not to dilate the pupil is dependent on the nature of the exam. In order to view the lens in its en- tirety, pharmacologic dilation is required.5It should be noted in the report whether or not the pupils weredilated for the exam. Pupillary dilation may also reveal subtle posterior synechia, which as described above indicates past uveitis. The most commonly usedshort-acting mydriatic is tropicamide 1%. The lens is best examined initially with both direct illumination and retroillumination to identify lenticu-lar opacities (cataracts). Using direct illumination, the observer should look for cloudiness or white opacities within the lens. 5,7Retroillumination uses the re flec- tion of light from the back of the eye (tapetum or redreflex in a nontapetal horse) to highlight lenticular opacities. Retroillumination causes opacities toappear dark against a light background. 5The lens should then be examined with a slit beam, similar toother anterior segment structures listed above. Theexaminer should identify any opacities within the lensand then use the slit beam to further elucidate theirlocation within the lens. Lens position should also be evaluated. Lens luxation or subluxation is usually a consequence of trauma oruveitis. 7This can be identi ed with a slit beam examin- ing the iris -lens axis, which should be continuous. A \"dip\"or\"step \"in this slit beam at the iris -lens interface can be indicative of a lens subluxation or luxation. Posterior Segment \u2014Vitreous and Fundus Examination of the posterior segment should begin with direct focal illumination (transillumination).2The vitreous is a hydrogel that should be optically clear. The central vitreous is variably liqui ed in horses of all ages, with liquefaction and mobility of the vitreousincreasing with age.1,7With age and/or in flammation, condensations or occlusions (similar to \"floaters \"in humans) may become visible. If the vitreous is highlyliqueed, these inclusions may be quite mobile as they move with the vitreous during eye movements. Vitritis is in flammation of the vitreous and a part of posterior uveitis or panuveitis.6,12Inflammatory cells and debris may become suspended within the vit-reous hydrogel, along with brin, hemorrhage, and vitreal membranes. result in vitreoretinaldetachment. Although vitreal abnormalities can occurin the absence of anterior (posterior synechia, cata-ract, corpora nigra equine recurrent uveitis. 5,12 Murkiness or yellow-green discoloration of the vitreous may obscure detail of the fundus and is observed inuveitis.12 The horse 's fundus can be examined using both indirect and direct ophthalmoscopy. Ideally, both methods should be used as outlined below to examine the fundus through a dilated pupil. Indirect ophthal- moscopy requires a focal light source and a handheldlens (20 diopter or panretinal 2.2). This method givesthe best overall wide eld view of the fundus and is helpful in identifying lesions that may require closer ex- amination with the direct ophthalmoscope.1,5,12 Remember that the image obtained with indirect oph-thalmoscopy is upside-down and backward. Indirectophthalmoscopy gives the greatest eld of view to assess the entire fundus. 2,6The direct ophthalmoscope provides a very magni ed view of a small eld and should be used for detailed examination of the opticnerve, retinal blood vessels, and peripapillary region. 2,12 The author recommends indirect ophthalmoscopy always be performed to provide a broad screening view, as lesions can be missed if only direct ophthal-moscopy is used due to the narrow eld of view at high magni cation. An intermediate option for fundus examination is the PanOptic ophthalmoscope byWelch Allyn, which is also a direct ophthalmoscope that provides a eld of view 5 times larger than stand- ard direct ophthalmoscopy with less magni cation. 6,12 Many variations of normal exist for the equine fundus and can vary with coat and iris color. It is important todifferentiate these variations of normal from pathologic changes. The major retinal abnormalities to look for include retinal detachment/separation, chorioretinitis or chorioretinal scarring, and changes to the optic nervesuch as atrophy or in flammation. 5,12Fundic pathology may be recognized by looking for ophthalmoscopic indi-cators of fundic disease, 7,12which include the 8Butter fly lesions (peripapillary) 8Multifocal bullet-hole \u0081Retinal detachment, which may be partial or com- plete with tear (rhegmatogenous); with a tear, a \"veil \"of retina is seen over the optic nerve head \u0081Pale or small optic nerve head (optic nerve atrophy) \u0081Reddened/hyperemic or enlarged optic nerve head(inflamed optic nerve) \u0081Attenuation choroidal blood vessels 6white scleral show \u0081Mass or Interpretation of fundic lesions be quite chal- lenging regarding their clinical signi cance. Refer to textbooks and equine ophthalmology resourc- es, including manuscripts that have pertinent infor- mation and color images to aid the examiningveterinarian. 2,6,10,13 Fluorescein Stain Fluorescein stain should be performed on every eye with an ocular issue.2,6Stain may be applied by touching aBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 184 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSmoist stain strip to the conjunctival surface; care should be taken to avoid touching the strip to the corneal surfaceas this can result in a false positive. Alternatively, the strip tip may be placed in a syringe with eyewash and gently irrigated on the corneal surface through a needlehub. 2,6Corneal epithelium is hydrophobic and thus does not retain stain. Corneal stroma is hydrophilic and doesretain stain.6Descemet 'sm e m b r a n ed o e sn o tr e t a i n stain; thus, very deep stromal ulcers may have a clear,dark, nonstaining center indicative of a descemetocele.6 The nares should be examined following fluorescein stain application to help evaluate patency.2,6Passage of the stain to the nares should occur within 5 minutesbut may take up to 20 minutes.2Successful passage is denitive for a patent nasolacrimal duct. If fluorescein dye does not pass the nares and this is consistent withthe clinical problem, irrigation of the nasolacrimalduct may be performed as a diagnostic test and/ortreatment. 2,6A negative test may also be a variation of normal due to the large-volume capacity of theequine nasolacrimal duct if no clinical signs associatedwith nasolacrimal duct obstruction are present. 2 Summary T h ee q u i n eo p h t h a l m i ce x a m i n a t i o ns h o u l db ep e r -formed in a routine, systematic, and repeatable man-ner.

Introduction Respiratory examinations in adult horses are neces- sary assessments that can be conducted in the eld or in-clinic. Respiratory disease is nebulous in the adulthorse; it can be a comorbidity of other diseases, or itcan be a primary disease that is masked by other ail-ments (e.g., gastrointestinal system), and a thoroughexamination is invaluable to the practitioner. Often,respiratory abnormalities are identi ed by the observ- ant veterinarian during an examination for a differentpurpose. This review details the key components of athorough respiratory examination as well as speci c diagnostic procedures that can be conducted in an am-bulatory setting to further evaluate the respiratorysystem. Broadly, the practitioner should aim to local- ize the disease or abnormality (upper versus lower re- spiratory) and identify the type of disease (infectiousversus noninfectious) to inform further diagnosticsand treatment plans. 2. Signalment and History Signalment and patient history are used to direct andfocus the subsequent physical examination. Certainsignalments or histories may prioritize speci cd i a g - noses or drive speci c physical examination measures to evaluate the information provided. Many diseaseshave an increased incidence based on age (severe neu-trophilic asthma with older horses, viral pneumoniawith younger animals). Breed and use of the horsealso have strong disease associations. Travel historyand vaccination status are relevant for identifyingrisk of infectious diseases. Other causes of stress orimmunosuppression are also critical (e.g., recentsurgery or general anesthesia, medication history).Evaluation of the environment will also inform the ex-amination, including housing (e.g., pasture, stable),air quality (e.g., dust, ammonia, smoke exposure),feed quality (e.g., dusty or moldy hay), and housingdensity. Questions to the owner of a potential respira-tory case should at minimum include informationdetailed in Table 1. 3. Physical Exam The physical examination of the horse with eitherupper or lower respiratory disease is critical to direct-ing additional diagnostic tests and prioritizing differ-ential diagnoses. This review focuses on the speci cs of the respiratory system; however, an excellent gen-eral physical examination must be performed to com-pile a thorough and accurate differential list. Manydiseases of respiratory origin have systemic effects,while diseases of nonrespiratory origin may generaterespiratory clinical signs (Table 2). The respiratorysystem in the horse is robust, allowing for diseaseto progress substantially before causing clinicalsigns observed by the owner. 1 A thorough respiratory examination begins with ob- servation of the standing horse. Evaluate the carriage NOTES 186 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICEof the neck (at the level of the shoulder, below, or above) and head (in extension in cases of increased re- spiratory effort) of the horse. Observe the horse 's posture and elbow position as abducted elbows mayindicate pleural pain. Evaluate the horse 'sh e a df o r asymmetry and swelling (particularly of the frontaland maxillary sinuses and retropharyngeal lymphnodes). Percussion of the maxillary and frontal sinuses may elicit pain or a change in resonance. Evaluate both nares for flaring, equal and adequate airflow, odor, and evidence of nasal discharge. If nasal discharge is observed, de ne the quality (serous ver- sus mucoid versus purulent) and quantity of dis-charge. Palpate the larynx for atrophy and surgicalscars and note if a painful response or cough occur. Observe the respiratory rate and effort at rest and evaluate for evidence of a \"heave \"line. If the horse coughs voluntarily during the examination, evaluatethe cough for frequency, noise, and whether thehorse swallows following a cough (indicating itmay be productive). Auscultation in a thorough respiratory examination should cover the following locations at a minimum:trachea (proximal, middle, and distal thirds), Auscultation of the trachea should evalu-ate for turbulent air flow and sounds of increased mu- cus. The lung elds should be evaluated for altered bronchovesicular sounds, crackles, wheezes, pleural friction rubs, and the absence of lung sounds (nonaer- ated lung). The heart should be auscultated both forprimary cardiac disease and for decreased sound or muffling from pulmonary disease. Due to the robust capacity of the equine pulmonary system, subtle dis- ease can be dif cult to auscult. A rebreathing bag can be useful for mimicking the effect of a deep breath in human patients and can elicit a cough in predisposed horses. The bag must be large enough to allow theh o r s et ob r e a t h ed e e p l ya st h ee x a mp r o g r e s s e sb u tsmall enough to not spook the animal or require a pro-longed exam. Horses that are highly resistant to rebreathing bags may have chest pain or may be prone to hypoxia, and horses with airway irritationmay cough. Once the bag is removed, the lungs andtrachea should be auscultated rapidly. Horses with a history of clinical signs while in work may require evaluation at speed in order to detectabnormalities, particularly if minimal abnormalitiesare observed in the standing examination. Somehorses may make abnormal respiratory sounds ordemonstrate a poor respiratory recovery (e.g., pro- longed elevated respiratory rate, flared nostrils, pro- ductive cough) following lunging or jogging without tack. Other horses may need to be ridden under tackto elicit the clinical signs, particularly for disciplines where signi cant neck flexion is a component of the activity. The results of the physical examination should provide suf cient evidence for the practitioner to begin to localize the abnormalities (upper versuslower respiratory tract) and prioritize any additional diagnostic tests. Importantly, suspected cases ofTable 1.

Baseline bloodwork (complete blood count, serum chemistry, serum amyloid A) is often warranted, and in some cases, infectious disease assessment via nasal swab subjected to polymerase chain reaction testing may be indicated. Several clinical signs war- rant additional diagnostics routinely, while others may be justi ed with an initial treatment and reas- sessment in the event of treatment failure. 4. Endoscopy Excellent reviews of respiratory endoscopy tech- nique and equipment are available.2Briefly, an approximately 1.0- to 1.5-m endoscope with either direct or video-based visualization capabilities is required for standing evaluation. The use of seda- tion is guided by the differential diagnoses generated from the history and physical examination. When- ever possible, suspected cases of laryngeal disorders should be evaluated without sedation, or with mini- mal sedation, in order to avoid sedation-induced relaxation of laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles.3 The use of butorphanol is recommended for casesundergoing evaluation of the complete trachea to minimize coughing during the evaluation. A twitch can be useful for ensuring restraint of the horse and preventing damage to equipment or personnel. When performing endoscopy of the respiratory tract, thorough examination is vital as an abbrevi-ated evaluation can miss critical abnormalities. Furthermore, systematic and thorough examina- tion can build the practitioner 'se x p e r i e n c ei nt h e range of normal anatomy. Both nasomaxillaryapertures can be easily visualized at the caudal end of the middle the ven- tral and dorsal nasal conchae and can be inspected discharge arising the paranasal sinuses. The contralateral nasal passage, conchae, andaperture should be evaluated via a brief reentrance of the endoscope in the opposing nostril at the end of the exam. Upper airway evaluations should include the ethmoid turbinates (conchae), pharynx, larynx, and proximal trachea. When observing the larynx, it can be useful to rst observe the function through several breaths, then stimulate the horseto swallow, and again observe that the larynx returns to a normal resting posture. Dynamic en- doscopy in the eld or treadmill-based endoscopy are specialized procedures that are typically con-ducted, if warranted, following static evaluations. 4 T h eo p e n i n g st ot h eg u t t u r a lp o u c h e sv i at h ep h a r - ynx should be observed in all horses for evidence ofdischarge. Entrance into the guttural pouches can be facilitated through the use of a guidewire, and any horse with purulent guttural pouch discharge should be investigated further due to the high index of suspi- cion for strangles ( S. equi subsp. equi)i n f e c t i o n .Hemorrhagic discharge should be investigated due to the potential for guttural pouch mycosis. Lower airway endoscopy allows for visualization of the distal trachea and entrance to the intratho- racic airways. The trachea should be evaluated forthe presence of blood or exudate. Localized dis- charge may indicate the location of a pulmonary abscess. Direct aspiration of pooled tracheal fluid is possible via the endoscope; however, sample col-lection for bacterial culture is better attempted viaa percutaneous approach or via use of a guarded sterile catheter to avoid contamination from pha- ryngeal organisms. 5 5. Thoracic Ultrasound Thoracic ultrasound requires practitioner experience to obtain and interpret images but can be a quick and direct method to identify signi cant lesions in the equine pulmonary system. Thoracic ultrasound has largely replaced thoracic percussion in practice withthe rise of high-quality portable units. Copious isopro-pyl alcohol application to the areas of the horse that will be ultrasounded is necessary for transducer (probe) contact and acceptable image quality. Alternatively,horses can be clipped, and ultrasound gel can be usedif needed. The entire lung e l ds h o u l db es c a n n e di na systematic (dorsal to ventral and caudal to cranial orcranial to caudal) manner bilaterally. At minimum, theevaluation should span from intercostal space 3through 16 using the epaxial muscles as the dorsal bor-der and the costochondral junctions as the ventral bor- der. Excellent reviews are available of techniques for thoracic ultrasound in the horse. 6 Thoracic ultrasound can often con rm the differ- entials generated during physical examination.Suspected pneumonia or pleuropneumonia can be supported by increased ventral pleural fluid,floc- culant within be supported by pleural roughening in the caudo- dorsal lung eld, and nonspeci cm a s s e sc a ns u p - port neoplasia or equine multinodular pulmonarybrosis. 6. Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Transtracheal Wash Sample collection from the lower respiratory tract can be broadly divided between bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transtracheal wash (TTW). Bronchoalveolarlavage is most appropriate for cytologic diagnosis ofnoninfectious lower respiratory disease (e.g., exercise- induced pulmonary hemorrhage, asthma). Transtra- cheal wash is useful for characterization of infectiouslower respiratory disease, particularly of bacterial orfungal cause, by collection of fluid for culture and sen- sitivity. Both techniques can be performed with orwithout endoscopic guidance. The use of an endoscopeis highly dependent on the preference of theBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 188 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSveterinarian, the availability of equipment, and the number of respiratory procedures to be completed dur-ing the visit. Percutaneous TTW procedures and BAL procedures using BAL catheters should be performed prior to endoscopic evaluations to avoid contaminationby upper airway commensal organisms. Sedation is of-ten useful for these procedures (alpha 2 agonist ofchoice with butorphanol) for compliance of the horseand cough suppression. Transtracheal wash collection must be a sterile pro- cedure, either by a guarded sterile catheter throughthe endoscope biopsy channel or by percutaneoustranstracheal approach with a commercially avail-able TTW kit. A local anesthetic block is needed forthe percutaneous approach, and 100 mL of warmedsterile 0.9% saline divided into 2 aliquots is recom-mended for the infusion. Recovery attempt should bemade between each aliquot, and suf cient recovery may be obtained following the rst attempt. Previous history of antimicrobials should be used to inform theusefulness of TTW collection in a particular horse.Finally, the trachea is not a sterile environment, andculture results should be interpreted accordingly. Bronchoalveolar lavage is aided by the administra- tion of 20 to 60 mL of sterile 2% lidocaine solution tothe distal trachea to diminish the cough Bronchoalveolar lavage collection via a 3-m BAL tube(without endoscopic guidance) will most often collectsamples from the right dorsal lung eld. Passage of the BAL catheter is aided by positioning the horse 's head in extension. Similar to the TTW, endoscopicBAL collection requires use of a guarded catheter.Cases where the BAL sample will not be cultured, theendoscope has been disinfected and rinsed, and thesample collection is in a clean environment may notrequire the use of the guarded catheter for sample col-lection. Endoscopic guidance can direct sample col- lection to a speci c lung lobe if there are concerns of a localized lesion. Firm lodging of the BAL cathe- ter into the bronchus aids in the collection of washfluid. The recommended instilled fluid is 200 to 250 mL of warmed 0.9% saline instilled in 2 dividedaliquots of 100 to 125 mL each. Recovery attemptshould be made between each aliquot. Effort shouldbe directed to maximizing the collection of instilledsaline to at least greater than 50% to 75%. Samples collected for culture should be immediately placed preferentially in an appropriate culture trans-port system or a sterile nonadditive vial. Samples col-lected for cytology should be placed in ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainers for cellpreservation. In cases where speci c molecular diagnostic tests are required (e.g., equine gammaherpesvirus 5), the reference laboratory should be contacted for the preferred collection plan. 7. Conclusion Field-based diagnostic tools are available to support the results of a thorough physical examination in evaluat- ing the respiratory system and can help differentiate between upper and lower respiratory tract disease. If etiology remains elusive, referral for thoracic or upperairway radiographs may be considered. Respiratory dis-eases in the horse can have complex pathogeneses, and respiratory-based clinical signs may be present in dis- eases of other systems. For example, nasal dischargemay be present in cases of tooth-root abscessation, anda horse with pleural pain may present with \"colic. \" Primary respiratory diseases may have underlying ini-tiating factors that complicate the initial diagnosis,such as pneumonia in a horse with severe asthma orfollowing viral infection. Thought and preplanning of respiratory diagnostic procedures is critical to obtaining useful evaluations and samples. This review is not anexhaustive description of respiratory diseases in theadult horse; however, less common abnormalities are identi ed with the same thorough systematic examina- tion and use of diagnostic testing.

Introduction Colic is the most common emergency condition of the horse.1As clinical signs associated with nondescript abdominal pain may vary widely from mild intermit-tent pawing or flank watching to marked uncontrol- lable thrashing, the condition can be distressing forowners and sometimes veterinarians alike. Havingthe clinical acumen to tease through the informationto elucidate an underlying etiology, or at least cate-gory thereof, can improve patient outcomes and clientsatisfaction, as well as provide reassurance or in-creased linearity in the medical management versussurgical intervention decision-making algorithm. Athorough, yet concise, investigation of the patient' s history and clinical examination to supplement diag- nostic modalities may also facilitate diagnoses of non- gastrointestinal diseases. Some nongastrointestinaldiseases may mimic signs of colic; therefore, render-ing an accurate diagnosis may subsequently lead toappropriate case management. 2. History Assessment of the colicking horse begins with the sig-nalment of the patient and a thorough but concise his-tory. Often the history may be either condensed orperformed concurrently with the physical examina-tion and/or diagnostics as time is of the essence. Mainareas on which to focus include what clinical signsthe owner is noticing, the duration of those observedclinical signs, previously and/or recently administeredmedications and supplements, diet, deworming proto-cols, and dental history. Signalment and Presenting Complaint Signalment can be a helpful place to start to facilitatead enitive diagnosis. Examples of key signalment and etiology associations include young horses (wean-lings in ascarid olderhorses mares andlarge colon torsions. It is important to understandwhat the owner has been observing at home and how long those clinical signs have been noted. Sometimes owners can perceive certain clinical signs as colic whilean entirely different body system may be affected;examples of this would include exertional rhabdomyol-ysis (e.g., walking stif fly), pleuropneumonia (e.g., walk- ing with the elbows abducted), and genitourinaryissues (e.g., stretching out to urinate). Additionally,the speci c clinical signs the owner has noted can be particularly useful for the practitioner 's\"severity ba- rometer \"as simply mild intermittent inappetence might be managed with supportive care, whereaspatients exhibiting uncontrollable thrashing mayrequire immediate surgical intervention. Similarly,it is imperative to question the owner as to whatmedications and/or supplements they have adminis-tered, by what route they have done so, and howthese medications have affected the patient. This NOTES 190 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICEwill assist the practitioner in gauging the severity of the patient 's colic and facilitate documentation of potential treatment complications (e.g., clostridialmyositis from intramuscular flunixin meglumine administration). Administration flammatory drug (NSAID) is often inadvisable if the owner has already done so, particularly in the face of dehydration, which is common in horsesexhibiting signs of colic. Diet A brief investigation of the patient 's diet may also suggest certain etiologies. Feedstuffs or feedingpractices that have been associated with a speci c disease-causing colic include coastal Bermuda grass (especially free-choice access to round bales) leading to ileal impactions, alfalfa with resultant can-tharidin toxicosis equine gas-tric ulcer syndrome. Dentistry and Deworming An additional part of the abbreviated history should include inquiries into the client 's dental and deworm- ing history. It is well established that poor dentition can lead to impactions at various locations within the gastrointestinal tract. Endoparasitism, espe-cially ascarid impactions and emergence of encystedstrongyles, can be associated with clinical signs ofcolic. History is a key component of diagnosis of these disorders; without history, these diseases may not be diagnosed, leading to treatment failure andpoor client-patient outcomes. Additional Information Two nal points of consideration include whether the patient is a surgical candidate and if the patienthas insurance coverage. Important questions to askregarding insurance include type (e.g., colic surgery,major medical) and amount of insurance coverage. Additionally, the practitioner should inquire as to other noninsurance coverage that patient may havefor colic as it is becoming more commonplace for feedand supplement companies to offer some form of cov-erage. This information is often required for insur- ance claim reports as many insurance companies will inquire as to any additional coverage the patientmay have beyond that which the insurance companyprovides. 3. Physical Examination The baseline colic examination should include a dis- tance examination to gauge the patient 'sp a i nl e v e l , assessment of heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, auscultation of gastrointestinal borborygmi, andmucus membrane color and consistency. As the practi- tioner is driving up on the farm, walking up to the patient, or the patient is being brought into the clinic,the examiner should perform an assessment of thepatient 's overall pain level exempli ed by attempts tolay down, sweating, and abrasions/wounds that indi- cate that the patient has been aggressively rolling.First and foremost, the heart rate should be obtained;if the patient is tachycardic, all other history taking,assessment, and diagnostics should be postponed, and nasogastric intubation should be performed to facilitate gastric decompression and to help preventgastric rupture. With respect to gastrointestinal aus-cultation, at minimum, four quadrants (namelypaired right and left dorsal and ventral quadrants)should be auscultated; however, the author prefers a fth location to be auscultated for a minimum of 30 seconds on the cranioventral abdomen to assess for sand (which has been likened to the sound of \"waves crashing on a seashore \"). Assessment of the mucus membrane tackiness can also be an indicator of the level of hemoconcentration, whereas assessment of the color can suggest other pathological conditions(e.g., toxicity associated with colitis, strangulatinglesions, etc. and petechiation associated with throm-bocytopenia or anaplasmosis, etc.). Other relevantparts of the clinical examination, especially to rule out clinical syndromes that mimic colic associated with gastrointestinal disease, may include palpationof the muscles for evidence of rhabdomyolysis, assess-ment of pleural pain for pleuropneumonia, and visu-alization of jugular ll following venous occlusion for volume status evaluation. 4. Diagnostics While determining a de nitive diagnosis is ideal, it may not always be feasible. Furthermore, an exhaus-tive list of etiologies for colic in horses is not onlybeyond the scope of this review but also less clinically useful in an emergency situation. As such, the author prefers to attempt to categorize lesions identi ed dur- ing a clinical workup of the acute abdomen into (1)small intestinal, (2) large intestinal, and (3) other.Regardless of the underlying etiology or categoriza-tion, the diagnostic modalities employed will be simi- lar, yet it is the interpretation of these diagnostics that can facilitate achieving a de nitive diagnosis. The secondary goal beyond classifying the lesion assmall versus large intestinal should be to elucidatewhether the lesion is surgical in nature. This should be performed as early in the clinical presentation as possible and as prospectively as feasible. The previ-ously mentioned nasogastric intubation, which mayhave already been performed by this time due to theclinical presentation of the patient (e.g., tachycardia), is both diagnostic and therapeutic. The presence of gastric re flux may indicate either a primary or second- ary small intestinal lesion. As mentioned previously,gastric decompression is also important to avoid stom-ach rupture. Clinical Pathology Clinicopathological data can determine the severity of the colic episode, classify medical versus surgical lesions, and assist in monitoring the response of theBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 191patient to various therapies. A minimum database on a blood sample from the acute abdomen case shouldinclude a manual packed cell volume and total solids, as well as an L-lactate concentration. The value in these parameters is to assess the patient 'so v e r a l l hydration status (packed cell volume/total solids) andthe patient 's ability to perfuse their tissues (L-lactate), as well as to assist in the medical versus surgical deci- sion-making process (discussed later). Additional lab work that may be useful in assessing the colicking horse include blood gas analysis (either venous or arte- rial\u2014typically venous in an emergency triage situa- measurement of serum/plasma electrolytes (most preferably to include ionized calcium), a serum bio- chemical pro le (or components thereof \u2014renal param- eters, liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and proteindifferential), complete blood count, and peritoneal fluid analysis (discussed later). Blood Gas Analysis Most blood gas analyzers will include measurement of serum electrolytes, including ionized calcium. Someetiologies of colic can produce changes (e.g., hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to large vol-ume gastric re flux, metabolic acidosis due to colitis), which can be prognostic in nature or simply diagnosticof a change; correction of metabolic perturbations can reduce case fatality rate and/or make the patient a better anesthetic and surgical candidate. However, acomplete review of acid-base interpretation and cor- rection of abnormalities is beyond the scope of this review. Measurement of ionized calcium can be excep- tionally useful for the management of the colicking horse. Since calcium is required as part of the mecha-nism for smooth muscle contraction and ionized cal- cium is considered the biologically available or active fraction of total calcium, correction of hypocalcemia should be aggressive; a rule of thumb for calcium sup- plementation is 25 to 50 mL of 23% calcium gluconateor calcium borogluconate per liter of isotonic crystal- loids since oversupplementation of calcium is unlikely due to ef cient renal excretion of excessive calcium in an equine patient with otherwise appropriately func-tioning parathyroid and thyroid glands. Additionally,portable blood gas analyzers are widely available and can be used in the clinic, stall-side, and in an ambula- tory setting. Biochemical Profile The author reserves the biochemical pro le (or the components therein as aforementioned) for when azo-temia may be suspected, helping to elucidate a medi- cal versus surgical lesion (discussed later) and helping to rule in or out forms of colic or other etiologies that may mimic gastrointestinal disease. As will be dis- cussed in the treatment section of these proceedings,NSAIDs are one of the mainstays of analgesia for colic cases; however, it is widely recognized that NSAIDs are potentially nephrotoxic, especially in the face of dehydration. Therefore, if the practitioner feels as though it is clinically indicated, assessment of renalvalues is recommended. Muscle enzyme assessmentcan help determine if the patient is experiencing rhab-domyolysis, which may be the primary problem or sec- ondary to the colic episode. The reader will recall that elevations in muscle enzymes can occur simply sec- ondarily to some of the signs that horses exhibit as a result of abdominal pain, such as rolling; however, thepresence of rm musculature upon musculoskeletal palpation in conjunction with a stiff gait and elevatedmuscle enzymes in the absence of additional classic colic signs may be indicative of rhabdomyolysis as the primary medical issue. That said, the author rec-ommends (especially for liability purposes) for the workup and management to be exhaustive, particu- larly if the presenting complaint is colic. Muscle enzymes can also be helpful to elucidate a medical versus surgical lesion, which will be discussed more inlater sections. Evaluation of liver enzymes can also be useful for horses experiencing signs of colic. Horses with primary liver disease (e.g., hepatobiliary disease, cholelithiasis) may present as a colic; however, certain types of gastrointestinal lesions may also cause eleva-tions in liver enzymes, such as proximal enteritis 2 and large colon displacements, especially right dorsaldisplacements.3 Complete Blood Count Indications for a complete blood count would primar- ily include elevated rectal temperature (i.e., fever or hyperthermia) on presentation, the presence of diar- rhea, and/or the visualization of thickened or edema- tous intestinal walls on transabdominal ultrasound. In addition to rendering a proper diagnosis, the assessment of the patient' s leukogram is important for biosecurity, regardless of whether the patient is being assessed in the eld or the hospital. Changes in the patient' s white blood cell count when evaluated in conjunction with these clinical signs can be indicative of a potentially infectious and/or contagious pathogen.Primary differentials for the aforementioned abnor- malities would be enteritis, colitis, and enterocolitis, in which case the leukogram will most likely reveal leukopenia characterized by a neutropenia and/or a lymphopenia with or without immature neutrophils,depending on the underlying etiology and the stage at which the patient presents, and may be an indication for isolation. Abdominocentesis Thenal clinicopathological data set that may be use- ful is peritoneal fluid analysis. Abdominocentesis can b ep e r f o r m e di nb o t ht h eh o s p i t a la n d eld settings. Indications for abdominocentesis in horses with colicinclude a high degree of pain, ultrasonographic visual- ization of colonic vasculature in the right hemiabdo- men consistent with a right dorsal colon displacementor large colon volvulus, the presence of dilated loops of small intestine on transabdominal ultra- sound, thickened or edematous intestinal walls on transabdominal ultrasound, an increased quantity or abnormal echogenicity of peritoneal fluid onBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 192 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGStransabdominal ultrasound, presence of intra-abdom- inal masses on transabdominal ultrasound, suspicionof gastrointestinal tract rupture, and/or if the patient is insured. Preferably, the peritoneal fluid analysis would include a gross analysis, total nucleated cellcount and cytologic evaluation, L-lactate concentration, total solids, and glucose concentration. It is preferableto perform peritoneal fluid analysis concurrent with analysis of peripheral blood as a comparison betweenanalytes measured in the peritoneal fluid and periph- eral blood can improve accuracy of assessment.Additionally, the author recommends collecting perito-nealfluid when possible for additional testing if indi- cated, such as a red top tube for culture and sensitivitytesting. The normal appearance of peritoneal fluid should be clear and straw-colored such that the practi-tioner can \"read a newspaper through it. \"The more common abnormalities that can be observed on gross examination would be serosanguinous color change con- sistent with a strangulating or surgical lesion (the com-mon saying is \"red is dead\" )a n dt h ep r e s e n c eo ff e c a lo r feed material suggestive of a gastrointestinal tract rup-ture. The clinicopathological parameters of normal peri- toneal fluid values reported in the literature are widely variable; thus, the author uses <5,000 cells/ mLf o rt o t a l count, <2 mmol/L for L-lactate, and <2.0 g/dL for total solids, which is relatively common- p l a c ea m o n g s tt h ee q u i n ev e t e r i n a r yc o m m u n i t y .Anal analyte to consider for peritoneal fluid would be creatine kinase. A peritoneal fluid creatine kinase level of greater than or equal to 16 IU/L, particularly in thosecases where the peritoneal fluid L-lactate concentration is additionally elevated as previously described, is quitesensitive and speci c for a strangulating lesion. 4 Peritoneal fluid:blood ratio of lactate and glucose can provide valuable information. For L-lactate, the relative value should be less than twice the peripheral L-lactate, or the ratio of peritoneal fluid L-lactate to peripheral blood L-lactate should not be greater than1:1, as elevations in L-lactate greater than twice the peripheral L-lactate or elevated ratios have been asso-ciated with strangulating and/or surgical lesions in multiple research studies. Peritoneal fluid glucose con- centrations should roughly approximate those in thesystemic circulation, whereby decreased peritoneal fluid glucose concentrations, especially if less than half of peripheral blood concentrations, could be indicative of peritonitis. Additional Diagnostics Beyond clinicopathological data, other common diag-nostic modalities for use in the equine acute abdomenwould include ultrasound, rectal pal- pation, radiography. Ultrasound Transabdominal ultrasound is remarkably bene cial for use in the equine acute abdomen. A comprehen-sive overview of transabdominal ultrasonography is beyond the scope of this review; however, some key points will be outlined here. Ideally, if the patient isotherwise stable, the transabdominal ultrasound willbe performed in the same manner, starting in the s a m ep l a c e ,o nt h es a m es i d eo fb o d y ,i nt h ea b s e n c eof sedation (as alpha-2 agonists alter gastrointestinal motility) with each case. Ideally, a large curvilinear 2- to 5-MHz probe would be used. However, a 5- to10-MHz rectal probe may be used if it is the only available transducer. In the right hemiabdomen, the cecum and right ventral and dorsal colons should beexamined for mural thickening and edema. The duo-denum should be observed between the liver and the right dorsal colon for mural thickening and edema, as well as luminal distension and evidence of peristalsis.Colonic vasculature should not be visible in the right hemiabdomen on the lateral aspect of the right dorsal colon; this nding would be consistent with a right dorsal displacement of the large colon or a large colon volvulus. In the left hemiabdomen, the spleen should be observed adjacent to the left kidney, whereas thepresence of gas- lled bowel (in which sacculations are often visible) adjacent to the spleen that precludesvisualization of the left kidney is consistent with anephrosplenic entrapment (or left dorsal displace-ment). Normal segments of the small colon in the left paralumbar fossa should be observed. The greater curvature of the stomach should be observed adjacentto the spleen and corresponding splenic vein within normal anatomical limits with a normal radius of cur- vature. The left dorsal and ventral colons should alsobe to the right dorsal and ventral colons. The jejunum should be observed in the left inguinal region. The ventral abdomen shouldbe scanned for the presence and characterization ofperitoneal fluid. Aforementioned anatomic structures that would be visible with a rectal transducer includesmall intestinal inguinally, stomach size and shape,and colonic wall thickness and luminal content. Rectal Palpation Rectal palpation is also useful to assist in diagnosingvarious types of colic. Rectal tears are an uncommonand unfortunate complication associated with rectalpalpation and have the potential to lead to malprac- tice claims. As such, every effort should be made to prevent rectal tears when performing diagnosticrectal palpation. The author recommends that the patient be haltered, twitched, restrained in stocks, sedated with a combination of an alpha-2 agonist andan opioid (discussed later), administered a butylsco-polamine bromide, and have rectal mucosa locally anesthetized with a minimum of 60 mL of either 2% lidocaine or mepivacaine instilled through a red rub-ber catheter, while using an abundance of methylcel- lulose-based lubrication atop the practitioner 'sr e c t a l sleeve. Additionally, fecal material should be carefully removed and lubricant reapplied following each evac- uation prior to any attempt to perform a diagnostic evaluation. The author also suggests saving the evac-uated fecal material for fecal analysis if clinically indi-cated, which may include fecal flotation for parasites, fecal egg count, floating the feces in water in a rectalBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 193sleeve for sand, and/or fecal polymerase chain reaction test for infectious pathogens and their respective tox-ins. There are many methods for rectal palpation, but the author prefers a method whereby a clockwise approach is taken with the abdomen divided into a four-quadrant palpation window; outlined here is an overview of this method. When the abdomen is viewedin a caudocranial fashion, the examiner will fall off the pelvic brim and in the left ventral palpation win- dow, the small colon should be appreciated whereby the fecal balls should be easily distinguishable and somewhat indentable with the gently cupped palpa-tion hand. Extending cranially from this position, the pelvic flexure may be appreciated, but is not always felt depending on the length of the practitioner 'sa r m , t h es i z eo ft h eh o r s e ,a sw e l la st h ef e c a lc o n t e n t within the pelvic flexure. Rotating in a clockwise direction to the left dorsal palpation window, the cau- dal extent of the spleen should be palpated abaxial to t h ec a u d a lp o l eo ft h el e f tk i d n e y .T or e o r i e n tt h ee x - aminer, the palpation hand is cupped dorsally to nd a true median line that divides the palpation window in the left and right (the pulse within the terminal aorta can be a useful landmark for this purpose). Along the right side of the patient, the cecum should be appreciated with a consistent quantity of gas; when the medial band of the cecum is palpated, the cecum should not seem heavy and on ballottement should not appear to be excessively gas distended.Additionally, it is important to note that small intesti- nal loops, tight bands, and gas distension are all abnormal ndings on rectal palpation and should be noted and addressed appropriately. An additionalnding that could be appreciated is the urinary blad- der along ventral midline; depending on the quantity of urine within the bladder lumen, it may be appreci- ated and should not be confused for an abnormal nd- ing associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Abdominal Radiography Abdominal radiography is not currently widely avail- able to most private practitioners, particularly tothose in ambulatory practice; referral to either a uni- versity or specialty imaging center is often required.Notably, abdominal radiographs obtained with porta- ble units are of limited diagnostic value when evaluat- ing light-breed (or larger) adult horses and have been known to confound diagnoses; thus, it is inadvisable to attempt diagnosis with these units. The two pri- mary indications for abdominal radiographs include evaluation for the presence of sand (e.g., sand impac-tions) and enterolithiasis. Further Comments on Diagnostics At this point in the diagnostic workup, the practi- tioner should feel relatively comfortable delineating if the patient has a small or large intestinal lesion and if surgical intervention is warranted. However, in cases for which the cause remains idiopathic, the primary etiologies to consider include endoparasitism, equine gastric ulcer syndrome, and spasmodic colic (alongwith less common etiologies that will not be dis- cussed in this review); the only de nitive diagnostic procedure for equine gastric ulcer syndrome is a fullgastroscopic examination after an appropriate fast-ing period to allow visualization of the entire stom- ach with a flexible endoscope. Additionally, it is important to realize that spasmodic colic is a diagno- sis of exclusion; there is no de nitive diagnostic test for spasmodic colic. However, an empirical clinicalresponse to spasmolytic agents (more speci cally butylscopolamine bromide) may be supportive of a di- agnosis of spasmodic colic. Finally, the clinical assessments and diagnostics mentioned herein pos-sess signi cantly higher diagnostic sensitivity and specicity when performed in serial fashion, as opposed to interpretation of the values at a single time point or in parallel. Therefore, the practitioner should be encouraged to repeat all or part of the ex-amination and diagnostics as the clinical pictureevolves. 5. Case Management If a surgical lesion is identi ed and the patient is determined to be a surgical candidate, the colic teamshould initiate preparing for exploratory laparotomy,and the patient should be triaged accordingly to makethem the best anesthetic candidate possible consider-ing the clinical circumstances. The single most impor-tant indication for surgical intervention is unrelenting pain that is unresponsive to appropriate sedation and analgesia (even in the absence of other suggestive nd- ings on the colic examination). Nevertheless, only asmall percentage (approximately 1.4% -17.5%, and in the author 's experience it is toward the lower end of these values) of horses with colic require surgicalintervention. 5Regardless of the underlying cause of the patient' sa b d o m i n a lp a i n ,i ti si n d i c a t e dt ow i t h - hold feed until the patient is comfortable and passingfeces for an extended duration of time, which will varydepending on the setting, the patient, and the underly- ing medical issue. Nonsurgical (or postsurgical) man- agement of the acute abdomen case typically includessedation, analgesia, and fluid therapy. Sedation and Analgesia The mainstays of sedation are alpha-2 agonists, of which xylazine hydrochloride administered intravasc- ularly is often the preference. Many practitionerse l e c tt oa v o i dt h er o u t i n eu s eo fd e t o m i d i n eh y d r o -chloride due to its longer duration of action and ahigher propensity to mask more severe pain that may require surgical intervention. The author routinely administers 150 mg of xylazine hydrochloride to astandard 454- to 500-kg adult horse (approximately is commonplace tocoadminister butorphanol tartrate intravascularly with xylazine hydrochloride. The author normally administers 5 mg to a standard 454- to 500-kg adulthorse (approximately a 0.01 mg/kg dose); argue to avoid using opioids forBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 194 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSthose same reasons mentioned for avoiding the use of detomidine. Another class of medication commonly administered to patients with abdominal discomfort are parasympatholytic medications, namely N-butyls-copolammonium bromide administered intravascu-larly. Some practitioners avoid its use due to theconcern that abolition of smooth muscle contractionmight be counterproductive to the overall clinicalpicture; however, the author commonly administers100 mg to a standard 454- to 500-kg adult horse(approximately a 0.2 mg/kg dose) to not only facilitatethe rectal examination but also assess the likelihoodof spasmodic colic and as a temporary source of painrelief and is pleased with the results. An additionalclass of medications that can assist in the manage-ment of the equine acute abdomen is NSAIDs, ofwhich the primary drugs include meglumine, phenylbutazone, is an that flunixin is prefera- ble to phenylbutazone for soft tissue or visceral pain, whereas phenylbutazone is preferable for orthopedic pain. Thus, it is more commonplace to administer flu- nixin for management of the acute abdomen, which isgenerally administered at a 1.1 mg/kg dose intravasc-ularly. It is ill-advised to \"stack\" NSAIDs (meaning two ascoadministration of flunixin meglumine and phenyl- butazone) as doing so (especially in the face of dehy-dration) will increase the risks of negative side effectssuch as renal toxicity, right dorsal colitis, and gastriculceration. An additional medication within this drugc l a s si sd i p y r o n e . aDipyrone is currently marketed in the United States and carries a label for control offever. Dipyrone was previously available in theUnited States prior to its more recent release and wascommonly administered for analgesia. Historically,the drug was employed in human medicine for feverand visceral pain but was removed from the market due to agranulocytosis; however, it is still routinely used in human medicine for visceral pain in othercountries. There is a paucity of data, particularly inthe recent literature, describing dipyrone use inhorses for visceral pain. Furthermore, to the author 's knowledge, the complete mechanism of action ofdipyrone 's antinociceptive pathways in the horse has yet to be fully elucidated. The company under whichdipyrone is currently marketed also states that it tooshould not be stacked with other NSAIDs and/or corti-costeroids. Anecdotally, however, many practitionersare utilizing dipyrone for equine patients experiencings i g n so fc o l i ca tad o s eo f2 0t o3 0m g / k gi n t r a v a s c u l a r l yup to every 12 hours as needed for control of pain.Until adequate evidenced-based data exist to supportthis use, the author cannot recommend its use forhorses with colic. A nal drug frequently used for anal- gesia in the equine acute abdomen is cacy as a in horses has variably been called into question;also, the use of a loading dose prior to constant rateinfusion (CRI) remains controversial. It is important tonote that lidocaine has been used not only for analgesiabut also as a general anti-in flammatory and as a proki- netic. A full review of prokinetics for use in horses is beyond the scope of this review, yet the author feels it to be pertinent to provide background on the use of a 2% lidocaine CRI for analgesia as his experience has provided positive results. If a loading dose is adminis- tered, a dose of 1.3 mg/kg administered intravascularlyover 15 minutes should be used, followed by a CRI rate of 0.05 mg/kg/minute. Due to the risk of neurotoxicity, lidocaine should be administered as a CRI with other fluids, and the rate should be administered carefully. Fluid Therapy A complete review of fluid therapy is beyond the scope of this review; however, outlined herein are some gen-eral guidelines the author follows for the acute abdo- men. Fluid therapy is indicated in the presence of hemoconcentration or a palpable impaction on rectal examination and/or for those patients being preparedfor exploratory laparotomy. The two primary means by which to provide fluid therapy are enteral fluids and intravenous fluids; however, a third option of rec- tal administration of fluids has recently been vali- dated for use in horses and provides an intriguing and cost-effective means of fluid administration. 6 Enteral Fluid Therapy For horses with palpable colonic impactions on rectal examination, enteral fluids are the preferred fluid administration route as these have been shown to besuperior to intravenous fluids for hydrating colonic contents.7Contraindications for enteral fluid therapy include a strangulating small intestinal lesion, the presence of net gastric refl ux on nasogastric intuba- tion, intolerance of enteral upon administration of enteral fluids), and recumbency. Enteral fluid administration rates of 6 L every 2 to 4 hours in the 454- to 500-kg adult horse are generallysafe and well tolerated. As important as the rate of fluid administration is the composition of the adminis- tered fluid. Mineral oil has been previously recom- mended for enteral administration in equine patientswith colic. However, to the author 's knowledge, there is a paucity of scienti c literature supporting its use; moreover, the ability of mineral oil to hydrate impacted ingesta within the colonic lumen is far lessthan that of other enterally administered medica- tions. Additionally, mineral oil, if aspirated, induces severe and often fatal pneumonia. Last, mineral oil is considered by some practitioners to be contraindicated for surgical candidates and in some toxicities. 8Other medications administered per nasogastric tube as part of an enteral fluid therapy plan are electrolytes and magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate at 1 g/kgof bodyweight may be administered and is quite ef ca- cious;9however, the author recommends limiting this to a maximum of twice daily due to the propensity toinduce diarrhea and potential magnesium toxicosis.10 A variety of commercial electrolyte products arewidely available for use in horses. If a product is used that contains a separate package for dextrose, asBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 195many do, it is inadvisable to administer this portion of the product as it is not necessary, and the additionof excess glucose can be detrimental due to potential iatrogenic hyperglycemia and a subsequent hyperin- sulinemia. The electrolyte portion of these products should be administered according to the manufac- turer 's recommendations. Furthermore, there are a few different means by which to improvise CRI of enteral fluids using either a nasogastric tube or enteral feeding tube with a Christmas-tree connec-tor, carboy, and standard coil set. Intravenous Fluid Therapy Indications for intravenous fluid therapy include hemoconcentration, preparation for exploratory lapa-rotomy, intolerance of enteral fluids, and correction of electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, amongst others.For patients requiring intravenous fluid therapy due to moderate or marked hemoconcentration, 7.2% hypertonic saline is a very effective means by which to expand the intravascular volume and quickly improve cardiac output; 11however, it is important to note that hypertonic saline must always be followedwith polyionic isotonic crystalloids. A full review offluid types and fluid therapy is beyond the scope of this review. However, general guidelines the authoremploys for standard use of polyionic isotonic crystal- loids for the dehydrated acute abdomen follow the\"3P s \"of resuscitation \u2014namely pink, perky, and pee. Shock boluses of 30 mL/kg are administered until either (a) the patient 's mucus membranes are pink and moist; their mentation is bright, alert, and re-sponsive in the absence of signs of colic; and they are urinating normally or (b) a total of 90 mL/kg havebeen administered. Following emergency resuscita- tion, it is commonplace to administer polyionic iso- tonic crystalloids at approximately twice maintenance rate (4 mL/kg/h) for the rst 6 to 24 hours. Subsequent fluid therapy depends upon response to initial treat- ment. Moreover, it should be stated that intravenousand enteral fluid therapy can be used concurrently; this combination is a very rapid and effective meansby which to achieve both systemic and local enteral rehydration. Cecal Trocarization Anal intervention for medical management of the acute abdomen of which the practitioner should beaware is cecal trocarization. Cecal trocarization should be reserved for those patients who do not have a surgi- cal option and whose owners have been adequatelycounseled regarding the potential complications, which include focal abscessation, peritonitis, and hemorrhage. The main indication for cecal trocarization includes abdominal gas distension that is otherwise unable to be relieved in a nonsurgical candidate; this technique canbe especially useful for right dorsal displacements of the large colon and small colon impactions. The full methodology for performing the procedure is described elsewhere, 12but brie fly: The horse is restrained, sedated, and clipped and the skin asepticallyprepared in the right paralumbar fossa, and an ultrasound is performed on the area to ensure thesafety of the procedure (i.e., no other segments ofgastrointestinal viscera trapped between the baseof the cecum and the body wall) and to triangulatethe gas cap on the cecal base. Following subcutane-ous instillation of a local anesthetic lido-caine or mepivacaine), the cecum is then trocarizedat its base at an approximately 45\u00b0 angle to theskin with a standard 14-gauge 5.25-in over-the-needle intravenous catheter attached to a 30-inextension set of which the opposing end is sub-merged in water. Once the release of gas hasceased (as evidenced by gas bubbles no longerbeing visible in the cup of water), the trocar isremoved; the author also prefers to infuse a 3.3 mg/kg dose of gentamicin while the trocar is beingremoved to reduce risks of peritonitis andabscessation. 6. Conclusion While colic is a common condition presented to the equine practitioner, few patients undergo surgical intervention. Additionally, it can be distressing forowners and veterinarians, but being prepared andknowledgeable regarding both the workup and themanagement of the equine acute abdomen can facili-tate positive patient and client outcomes. Performingand interpreting diagnostics both quickly and compe-tently will facilitate rendering a proper diagnosisand subsequently appropriate management in atimely fashion.

Neurologic exam ndings are essential for neuroanatomic localization and serve as the basis for formulation of a differential list and diagnostic plan in horses presenting with neurologic abnormalities. Authors 'address: University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, Gainesville, FL e-mail: s.denotta@u fl.edu. *Corresponding 1. Introduction A complete neurologic examination can be compared to lameness evaluation \u2014a systematic approach involving an initial stationary examination followed by gait assess-ment (a sample examination form can be found in theAppendix). The only equipment needed is a transillumi-nator (or smartphone flashlight) and hemostat. The neuro exam is used to localize a lesion or lesions andserves as the basis for formulation of a differential listand diagnostic plan. Information regarding cranial nerveassessment, anatomic neurolocalization and ataxia grad-ing has been provided in Tables 1 -3, and an example Neuro Exam Checklist has been provided in Appendix I.In this discussion, all potential abnormal ndings are interpreted in the context of a neurologic examination.However, in a clinical setting, complete general physicaland lameness examinations should also be performed toassess possible involvement of other body systems. 2. Mentation and Behavior Assess level of consciousness or alertness on a contin-uous scale from normal (i.e., bright and alert) to co-matose. Progressive levels of obtundation are termedlethargy, stupor, semicoma, and coma. Abnormalitiesof behavior are termed dementia .B e h a v i o ri s assessed from history and general observation in thecourse of the examination. Typical abnormal behaviorsresulting from central nervous system disease includeself-mutilation, head pressing, compulsive walking (of-ten in a circle), yawning, aggression (including unpro-voked biting or kicking), timidity, loss of af nity of a foal for its dam, and loss of learned behaviors andskills. 3. Examination of the Head Head Orientation Evaluate the orientation of the head from directly in front. Asymmetric disease of the vestibular system(cranial nerve [CN] VIII, the headto tilt, whereas asymmetric cerebral disease maycause the head and neck to turn without tilting. Carefully blindfold the horse and observe the effect onhead position. Blindfolding removes visual input tohead position and exacerbates abnormalities causedby either vestibular or cerebral disease. Because of NOTES 198 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICEthe close proximity of cranial nerves VII and VIII, fa- cial paralysis is often seen in horses with vestibular disease. Offer feed or a treat to the horse and observethe way in which the horse moves its head inresponse. Coarse or ne head bobbing, especially intentional, indicates diffuse cerebellar dysfunction. Facial Expression, Sensation, and Muscle Symmetry Examine the head carefully for symmetry of facial expression, particularly with respect to the ears, eyes, and muzzle. With unilateral facial paralysis (CN VII),there is drooping of the ear and lower lip and immobil-ity, narrowing, and lengthening of the affected exter-nal nare. The muzzle is deviated away from theaffected side, and saliva may drool from the mouth. In some horses, there also is mild ptosis. Evaluate sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) and facial nerve motor function by testing \"flick\"reflexes on each side of the face. Each of thesereflexes requires intact trigeminal sensory branches, central connections in the hindbrain, as well as func- tioning facial nerves. To test these re flexes, touch in turn the commissure of the lips, the medial and lateralcanthi of the eye, the supraorbital fossa, and the ear.Appropriate responses are retraction of the commis-sure of the lip, blinking of the eye (medial and lateralcanthi and supraorbital fossa), and flick of the ear, respectively. It is helpful to have the handler cover theipsilateral eye during testing of the lip and ear.Further assess the sensory branches of the trigeminalnerve (CN V) by rmly poking the nasal septum. The n o r m a lr e s p o n s et ot h i sn o x i o u ss t i m u l u si sv i g o r o u smovement of the head away from the side of the stimu-lus. Compare the intensity of responses on each side. Trigeminal nerve dysfunction results in ipsilateral def- icits in both motor and/or sensation, while horses withunilateral forebrain disease may lose sensation to thecontralateral side of the face.Table 1.

Test from both temporal and nasal directions on each side. S t i m u l a t et h eh o r s ej u s tb e f o r ee a c hm e n a c eg e s t u r eb y tapping the skin below the eye. A normal menace response is blinking of the eye. T h em e n a c er e s p o n s ec a nb ei n t e r r u p t e da n y w h e r e in its pathway from the eye via the optic nerve (CN II) to the contralateral optic tract, diencephalon, internal capsule, and visual cortex. From the visual cortex, the menace response pathway continues to the facial nu- cleus and nerve (CN VII) on the side being tested prob-ably after passage through the ipsilateral cerebellum. Normal neonates and horses with cerebellar cortical disease may lack menace responses despite having normal vision. In these settings, vigorous threatening gestures toward the eye may cause evasive move-ments of the head without blinking of the eye. Pupil Size and Pupillary Light Reflex First, examine the eyes in neutral light conditions and determine whether or not the pupils are of equal size and if the diameter of each pupil is appropriate for the conditions. Unequal pupillary size is termed anisocoria , a constricted pupil , and a dilated pupil is myd- riatic. Next, examine the eyes in subdued or dim lights ot h a tt h ep u p i l sa r el a r g ee n o u g ht oe a s i l ya l l o w appreciation of refl ex constriction. Aim the light at the skin below one eye. Redirect the beam directly into the eye. This strong light should elicit both a dazzle reflex in the ipsilateral eye and pupillary light re flexes in both eyes. The dazzle response is an avoidance reaction to bright light. There is blinking, retraction of the eyeball, and movement of the head away from the light. A nor-mal pupillary light re flex is immediate equal constric- tion of the pupils of both eyes in response to lightdirected into one eye. If the direct (i.e., ipsilateral) pupil- lary light re flexes are normal on both sides, no further testing is necessary. If one is abnormal, then consen- sual (indirect) re flexes should be tested. To perform the consensual re flex, watch the pupil in one eye while an assistant shines the light into the opposite eye. Position and Movement of the Eyeballs While continuing to stand in front of the horse, observe the position and size of the pupils while the head is held level (i.e., a line through the center of each eyeball is parallel to the ground). While keeping the head level, lift the chin slowly. The eyeballs should remain station-ary while the chin moves upward; thus, the eyes rotate ventrally relative to the long axis of the head. In horses with vestibular disease (CN VIII), abnormal eye posi-tions are exaggerated by this maneuver. In horses with strabismus, the eyeball may be rotated medially or laterally, clockwise or counter- clockwise. If the pupils are in abnormal positions, try to position the head in such a way (usually by rota- tion) that the pupils are normally oriented relative tothe transverse axis of the head. For example, a horse with vestibular disease usually has ventral deviationof the eyeball on the side of the lesion and dorsal devi- a t i o no nt h eo p p o s i t es i d e .I nh o r s e sw i t hvestibular strabismus, eye position can be normalized relative to the axis of the head simply by rotating the head in the direction of the ventrally deviated eye. True stra-bismus is eye deviation that cannot be corrected by repositioning the head and usually re flects dysfunction of nerves to the extraocular muscles (i.e., oculomotor, trochlear, or abducens nerves [CNs III, IV, VI]). Move the horse 's head in a horizontal arc from side to side and observe the movements of the eyeballs.Signs of physiologic nystagmus should normally be eli- cited\u2014 namely, a series of horizontal movements of the eyeballs consisting of a rapid phase in the direction ofhead movement followed by a slow phase in the oppo- site direction. Each fast phase is accompanied by an eyelid blink. Physiologic nystagmus is normal andshould be distinguished movements charac- teristic of vestibular disease: spontaneous nystagmus, which occurs when the head is stationary and in aneutral position, and positional nystagmus, which only occurs when the head is moved to certain posi- tions. In horses with asymmetric vestibular disease, physiologic nystagmus often is abnormal or absent when the head is moved toward the side of the lesion. With peripheral vestibular disease, there often is spon- taneous horizontal or arc-shaped nystagmus with thefast phase directed away from the side of the lesion. In horses with involvement of the central components of the vestibular system, there may be horizontal orver- tical nystagmus. Assess abducens nerve (CN VI) function by per- forming a modied corneal reflex. Hold the eyelids closed and, through the eyelid, push the eyeball medi- ally. The normal response to this maneuver is retrac- tion of the eyeball. This re flex requires intact sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), central con- nections in the hindbrain, and motor bers of the abducens nerve (CN VI). Swallowing It is dif cult to assess competence for swallowing during a physical examination. On the basis of history and ob- servation, note whether feed, water, or saliva return through the nose, especially when the horse eats or drinks. Dysphagic horses often cough when eating ordrinking and may be initially misdiagnosed as chokes. Pass a nasogastric tube into the pharynx and assess effectiveness of swallowing movements as the horse attempts to move the tube into the esophagus. Involvement of the nucleus ambiguus in the hindbrainor peripheral parts of the glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and/or vagus (CN X) nerves can cause dysphagia. These nerves are particularly vulnerable to damage as theypass in folds of the guttural pouches. Tongue Pull the jaws slightly apart and observe the move- ments of the unrestrained tongue. With acuteBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 200 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSunilateral weakness, the tongue curls toward the unaffected side. Grasp the tongue from one side after inserting the hand through the interdental space.Note resistance of the tongue to being stretched andlook for atrophy and muscular fasciculations (CNXII). Gently pinch the side of the tongue with a hemo-stat and look for re flex retraction (CN V). Pull the tongue out one side of the mouth, release it, and look for retraction of the tongue back into the mouth. Innormal horses, one or two chewing movements occur as the tongue is quickly retracted. Delayed or absent retraction of the tongue back into the mouth canoccur with hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) dysfunction,neuromuscular weakness (especially botulism), orobtundation from cerebral disease. 4.

Neck pain revealed by palpation or re- luctance to turn laterally may follow any neck trauma but usually re flects arthritis of intervertebral joints. Press down rmly on each section of the thoracic and lumbar epaxial muscles to evaluate for back pain. Severe or rapidly developing muscle atrophy indi- cates denervation and is a localizing sign. Neurogenicmuscle atrophy is caused by damage to the lowermotor neuron in the ventral column of the gray mat-ter, nerve roots, or peripheral nerves supplying that muscle. Neurogenic atrophy of thoracic limb muscula- ture results from lesions C6 T2 cordsegments or roots, brachial plexus, or peripheralnerves, while atrophy of pelvic limb muscles re flects involvement of L3 to S2. Anesthesia of a strip of skinis caused by loss of the segmental sensory nerve, dor-sal nerve root, or connections in the spinal cord.Because sympathetic bers are distributed with spi- nal nerves, spontaneous sweating may occur over de-nervated skin. Cervicofacial Reflex Place the left index and middle ngers at the commis- sure of the left lip, and then strike the skin over the bra-chiocephalicus muscle with the closed tip of thehemostat. Begin at the cranial end of the neck andcontinue back to the shoulder. The expected response isfacial contraction, detected as retraction of the commis- sure of the lip, and contraction of the brachiocephalicus and cutaneous colli, observed as shrugging of theshoulder, lateral jerking of the head, and twitching ofthe skin of the neck. This re flex typically is reduced at the level of a cervical spinal cord lesion but is normal cranial and caudal to the lesion. Slap (Thoracolaryngeal) Test While standing on the left side, reach under the horse 's neck and hook the index and middle ngers of the left hand over the highest palpable point of the larynx \u2014the muscular process of the arytenoid. Have the handlermove the head slightly to the left of midline, and thengently strike the horse behind the withers several timeswith the palm of the right hand. The expected response is slight palpable movement (adduction) of the arytenoid in response to each slap. Repeat the procedure from theright side. Sensory input to this re flex is the sensory nerves and roots under the area that is slapped (approxi-mately T7 -T11). Central pathways are thought to cross to the other side at this level and pass rostrallyto the nucleus ambiguus in the white matter of thespinal cord, and then efferent bers pass out in the vagus nerve via the laryngeal nerve to in-nervate the contralateral laryngeal adductor muscles.Severe cervical spinal cord disease often affects thistest bilaterally, and the vagus and recurrent laryngealnerves may be affected at the or withinthe groove. Cutaneous Trunci Reflex (Panniculus) To elicit the panniculus re flex, use the thumb to rmly prod the lateral thoracic wall, beginning crani- ally just behind the shoulder and extending caudallyto the last intercostal space. Check every intercostalspace both ventrally and dorsally. For safety, rmly grasp the back of the mane with the left hand andface backward when testing the refl ex because horses that resent this test will try to kick the examiner.Repeat on both sides of the horse. A normal responseis twitching of the skin, with or without indication ofconscious perception of the stimulus. The re flex pathway is input from sensory thoracic nerves to the ipsilateral spinal cord, where it coursesrostrally via interneurons to end in the C8 and T1 via the nerve and the cutaneous trunci muscle.Interruption of this pathway in the spinal cord whitematter results in loss of the refl ex from approximately the point of the lesion caudally. A lesion of the sensorynerve will only affect the re flex within the same der- matome (skin strip), while loss of lateral thoracicnerve function ablates the entire ipsilateral re flex. Horses with botulism may display a generalized lossof panniculus re flex bilaterally. Back Reflexes Make sure that the pelvic limbs are positioned equally and squarely, and then stroke the closed tip of the hemostat caudally along the skin over the longissimusdorsi muscle, from mid-thorax caudally to the level ofthe tuber coxae. For safety, hold the back part of themane with the other hand. The expected response isBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 201brisk extension of the back and pelvis without disen- gagement of the stay apparatus of the pelvic limb, fol- lowed quickly by return to normal posture. Next,stroke the hemostat caudally along the skin over thegluteal muscles. This should elicit spinal flexion, fol- lowed by relaxation of the lumbar spine and pelvis, again without release of the patella from the medial femoral trochlear ridge. Common abnormal reactionsto these tests include (1) partial collapse in the pelviclimbs, (2) wobbling of the pelvis from side to side, and(3) no response, all of which may be observed in horseswith truncal and pelvic limb weakness and/or ataxia caused by spinal cord disease. Tail and Anus Assess tail strength by lifting (extending) the tail. Prod or pinch the skin adjacent to the anus and observe the anal contraction and tail-clamp re flexes. If these re flexes are abnormal or if the history sug- gests possible cauda equina syndrome, perform a rec- tal examination to assess rectal tone and bladder size and tone. Assess muscular symmetry of the tail andtest cutaneous sensation over the tail and caudalstructures. Anesthesia and are flexia of the tail, penis, and peri- neum and paralysis of the anus, rectum, bladder, and penis are signs of cauda equina syndrome. Lesions of the spinal cord or nerve roots caudal to the S2 spinalcord segment cause some or all of the signs of caudaequina syndrome. 5. Gait Evaluation Examination Have the handler walk the horse in straight lines while keeping the horse 's head and neck as straight as possible during walking. Follow directly behind the horse. From this vantage point, evaluate leg positionand stride symmetry. Also, watch for excessive (1)side-to-side (wobbling) movement of the pelvis, (2) up-and-down movement of the tuber coxae (pelvic roll), and (3) side-to-side rotation of an imaginary line from the tailhead to the tuber sacrale (pelvic yaw). Next,watch the gait from the side while walking in stridewith the pelvic and then thoracic limbs. Note any toedragging, knuckling, stride-length asymmetries, and abnormal protractive movements such as hyper flex- ion, stiffness (hypometria), or excessive range of move- ment (hypermetria). Often, these signs are mostobvious as the horse transitions from standing still towalking. Repeat this part of the examination with thehorse 's chin lifted and with the horse walking up and down a modest slope. These maneuvers exacerbatemost gait abnormalities, especially stiffness of the tho-racic limbs. Take extreme caution when walkingataxic horses up and down slopes as they are morelikely to stumble or fall on uneven ground. Back the horse briskly, observing for limb coordina- tion and willingness to move backward. Normalhorses should readily back in a straight line in two-beat fashion, with diagonal limb pairs moving in syn- chrony (e.g., left thoracic and right pelvic limbs). A horse with spinal cord disease may sag backward before moving and slide its hooves along the groundrather than picking them up and placing them. Take the horse in hand for the next part of the ex- amination. Hold the lead rope with the left hand and,by walking backward, lead the horse in counterclock-wise circles. It is very important that the horse isalways walking forward in these circles. Vary the di- ameter, making the circles alternately small andlarge. Carefully observe the motion of the right (out-side) pelvic limb by looking under the horse' st o r s o . This limb will often arc out widely on the outside ofthe circle (i.e., circumduction) in horses with spinalcord disease. In mirror-image fashion, lead the horsefrom the right side in clockwise circles. Next, pull the horse sideways in tight circles in ei- ther direction. To do this, position yourself slightlybehind the shoulder and walk backward while pull- ing the lead rope caudally and downward. The goal is to have the horse pivot around its center of gravity,with the forelimbs coming toward the examiner andthe hind limbs moving away. If done correctly in nor-mal horses, the opposite thoracic limb should cross infront of the supporting limb and the pelvic limbsshould move reciprocally, causing the horse to pivotaround a point midway between the thoracic and pel-vic limbs. Horses that are weak and ataxic tend tosag backward in the hindquarters before they startto move and then pivot the front part of the bodyaround one or both pelvic limbs. There is often alsointerference between or otherwise inappropriateplacement of thoracic limbs. Horses with caudal neckpain will often display reluctance or refusal to crossone forelimb over the other. Signs of limb weakness and ataxia suggest spi- nal cord (or, rarely, peripheral nerve) damage at orcranial to the affected limb. If there is obviousataxia and weakness in thoracic and pelvic limbs, there likely is at least one lesion in the spinal cordsomewhere between the front of the C1 and back ofthe T2 spinal cord segments. In cases where thesigns are caused by external compression of thecervical spinal cord (e.g., cervical vertebral stenoticmyelopathy), signs in the pelvic limbs are usuallyworse than those in the thoracic limbs. When, insuch cases, the pelvic limb signs are mild, thoraciclimbs may appear normal. In contrast, when tho-racic limbs are normal but there is moderate orsevere ataxia and weakness in the pelvic limbs,there likely is at least one lesion caudal to T2 andcranial to S3. If one or both thoracic limbs are abnormal in a horse that has normal pelvic-limb gait, the gray matter of the C6 to T2 spinal cordsegments (without white matter involvement), theroots or nerves of the brachial plexus, or the periph-eral nerves to the limbs are likely affected.Asymmetric lesions in the spinal cord cause signsthat are more severe on the side of the lesion.Occasionally, there are signs of weakness withoutBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 202 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSataxia (e.g., botulism, equine motor neuron disease) or peripheral vestibular disease, anesthesia often help to localize the spinal cord lesion. Tail Pull The tail-pull test is done both at rest and while the horse is walking in a straight line. With the horse standing squarely, take the tail and pull sideways with gradually increasing force. After initial slight movement in the direction of pull, normal horsesusually cannot be moved sideways, even with strong pressure. Next, pull sideways on the tail while the horse is walking in a straight line. Normal horses of450-kg bodyweight can only be moved slightly to the side. Perform the test in mirror-image fashion from the right side (i.e., with the horse being led from the right side). If a full-sized adult horse can easily be pulled sideways at rest, there is likely a lesion located ei- ther in the ventral gray matter or roots (L3 -L5) that form the femoral nerve or in the femoral nerve itself.The much more common nding is lack of resistance to tail pull only during walking and is often observed with ipsilateral spinal cord lesions affecting descend- ing upper motor neurons anywhere from C1 to S2.Hopping The hopping test evaluates both proprioceptive func- tion (spinocerebellar tracts, cerebellum) and limb-strength. From the left side, hold the halter with theleft hand. Pick up the left leg, and then push the headtoward the right side while leaning against the leftshoulder. Normal horses use the right limb to hopbriskly around a circle centered on the pelvic limbs.With limb weakness, the response may be delayed sothat the horse leans markedly before hopping or thelimb may buckle after landing.

Introduction Farriery in the horse is routinely executed for three broad reasons: protection, modi cation of traction, and therapy. The rst two categories can be irrespec- tive of a veterinarian 's skillset but the third requires a diagnosis. The activity by which a veterinarian elu-cidates a musculoskeletal or pedal pathology, com-bined with prescriptive therapeutic shoeing, can berepresented as equine podiatry. When dealing withthe structural enigma of the foot, a regional anatomi-cal diagnosis, and various farrier skillsets, pedaltreatments often become empirical and based onthe previous experience of the clinician or farrier. 1 Additionally, with the advent of many \"therapeutic \" shoe designs, styles, composites, and shapes, a preoc-cupation on the appliance rather than the reason forits application can be an inherent impediment to suc-cessful therapy. Veterinarians, who are not farriers,may be more comfortable with the diagnostic compo-nent of the process and can simplify the prescriptivecomponent by focusing on ve available mechanical modications. Understanding there are only a lim- ited number of mechanical adjustments that can bemade to the equine foot, one can develop a mechani-cal shoeing prescription that can be matched to an array of effective pedal appliances. 2Much has been said regarding structure and function in the digit as it relates to force, load, and motion.3,4,5Additionally, much has been said regarding shoeing managementas therapy for different diseases of the equinedigit. 6,7,8The purpose of this article is to simplify one 's approach to equine podiatry by focusing on the desired mechanical objectives and not the appliance.This approach can simplify prescriptive communica-tions on podiatry with the farrier. Spatial Geometry/Physics It is important to realize that the foot can be modi-ed in three directions: proximal/distal, medial/lat- eral, dorsal/palmar (or up and down, side to side,and front to back). Spatially, these and in varying NOTES 206 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICEvector combinations are the only directions the posi- tion of the digit can be altered. The foot in the horse is static, kinematic, and dynamic. It is static in the stance phase and moves secondary to forces applied from within. It is also sub- ject to outside external forces dictated by its structure and the physical laws of nature. To function properly,the foot of the horse must be in anatomic balance with itself, these external forces, and in equilibrium with its own physiology. An example of a disruption of thishomeostasis is laminitis; whereby, internal physiolog- ical equilibrium is compromised causing architectural structural failure resulting in disproportionate vectormovements of anatomy. This is an important concept to realize when dealing with high scale cases. If the normal constructs of the hoof wall/sole (epidermis) aredissociated with the internal structures (bone/der- mal), then a mechanical modi cation to the external structure will have limited ability to recover the inter- nal physiological equilibrium. Anatomy of the Digit The foot can be evaluated in near perfect symmetry in the median plane. In the transverse plane, the foot can be divided into dorsal and palmar/plantar compo-nents. The dorsal component consists of the rigidtubular capsule, dorsally and laterally, while the pal- mar/plantar component is made up of softer more elastic structures. This palmar/plantar makeup ishelpful to dissipate concussive energy through expan- sion while the dorsal component is essential in shear load bearing and force transduction. 5Within the hoof capsule, the foot is composed of dermal tissue which contains the vascular and nerve supply, 11 ligaments, 2 tendons, the digital cushion, a synovial joint, a bursaand 2 bones. In addition, the collateral cartilages attach within the foot but have wing-like extensions above the coronary groove.9 The hoof capsule is the epidermal extension of the skin separated by a junction called the coronet and is made up of three main parts: wall, sole, and frog each having different viscoelastic properties. Topographic-ally, the wall can be divided into toe, quarters, and heels. At the heel, the hoof wall is refl ected dorsally like a hook at an acute angle to form the bars. The sole forms most of the ventral surface of the foot and the j u n c t i o ni nw h i c ht h ew a l ll a m i n a ea n dt h es o l ee p i d e r - m i sm e e ti sc a l l e dt h e \"white line\" .T h ef r o gi sw e d g e shaped and is located in between the bars and com- pletes the sole of the foot. It is the epidermal covering of the digital cushion. Moving from external to internal past the tubular horn, the epidermal lamellae of the hoof meet with the dermal lamellae of PIII in an inter-digitating fash- ion to form a complex lamellar interface. This inter-face is continually remodeling to allow the horny wallto grow towards the ground surface past the station- ary distal phalanx. It also suspends the distal phalanx within the hoof capsule. There are many soft tissuestructures associated with the palmar/plantar portion of the foot, but this discussion will be limited to theanatomy of those areas most affected with pathology. Principally they are the deep digital flexor tendon synovial syno-vial membrane of the navicular bursa. 10A critical understanding of the form and function of these struc-tures and how they are affected by external manipula- tion is essential when developing a mechanical shoeing prescription. 2. Manipulation of the Digit With a general understanding of the functional anat-omy of the foot and given that mechanical changesc a nb em a d ei nt h r e es p a t i a lp l a n e s ,t h e r ea r e ve therapeutic alterations that we can either increase ordecrease. They are leverage, tension, pressure, protec-tion, and stabilization. Leverage Leverage is most often identi ed in horizontal spatial planes and evaluated from dorsal to palmar andmedial to lateral. In practice, one can either increaseor decrease leverage. It has a direct relationship withtension, but leverage is generally appreciated as thefoot begins to move. An example would be break-over. The static foot can 't appreciate the reduction in lever- age at its toe until it moves over it (Fig. 1). The thera- peutic application of leverage can be modi ed: 1) in the trim, 2) in placement of the shoe on the foot, or 3)in modi cation of the shoe itself. Examples of shoes that modify leverage include toe extensions, lateralextensions, rolled toes, rocker toes, square toes, half round, rail shoes, roller motion shoes, heel extensions, bar shoes, bumped stock, commercialized shoes like:Natural Balance and PLR ashoes or any appliance that increases or decreases leverage (Fig. 2). Fig. 1. A moving foot with reduced leverage at the toe depicting leverage attenuation in the placement and the modi cation of the shoe. Note the shoe is set back off the toe and rockered at the ground surface.BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 207Tension Tension is understood in relation to tensile anatomic structures. In practice the heels of the foot are often manipulated to alter tension. The deep digital flex or tendon is the anatomical structure to which most ofthe focus is given. Tension is generally manipulatedby heel height and one study indicates that each 1 degree decrease in heel height can change the tension in the DDFT by 4%. Conversely, elevating the heels decreases the tension in the DDFT. 11It should be noted that overzealous use of the foot as a mechanical tool can sometimes be harmful. As an example, wedg- ing the foot can potentially be harmful to the hoof cap- sule at the heels.12Wedging loads the heel structure and focuses pressure to them by reducing the loadsharing of the frog, bars and sole, and may be deleteri-ous in weak or underrun heels. Examples of shoes that modify tension include wedged shoes, wedge pads, Patten shoes, Ultimate cuffs, bmodied stock or material, and any device that raises or lowers theheels or alters toe depth (Fig. 3). Pressure Pressure is often synonymous with load or support and works by manipulating solar contact with the ground or the shoe. Pressure can be modi ed through trimming, shoeing, or arti cial materials placed on the foot. In cases of arti cial material, the density needs to be considered when adding pressure. The greater thedensity in an object, the more directly the ground force is transferred. Think of standing on a marble versusstanding on a sponge. The marble transfers pressure in a direct line while the sponge dissipates force, based on its structure. Most of the composite materials todayhave differing shore densities. A shore 40 material is softer than a shore 60 material which is less dense than aluminum or steel. Examples of appliances that alter pressure are heartbars, pour pads, impression materials, heel plate/ impression material combinations, lily pads, synthetic padded boots, frog plates, frog pads, beveled solar stock, or any other device that increases or decreases load (Fig. 4). Protection Protection is often considered in relationship to the sole of the foot, using devices that reduce the ground reac- tion force by inhibiting direct contact. Protection is usedto limit damage to sensitive, diseased, or compromised tissues and is directed toward epidermal, dermal, bony, or soft tissue structures in the foot. The mitigation ofpressure provides protection, but devices used speci - cally for protection can vary from those used for attenu-ating pressure. A simple form of protection might be the use of a pad to treat sole bruising. More complex forms of protection might include appliances thataddress pedal disease, or varying pathologies of the pal- mar foot. The application of devices like plastic pads, leather pads, pour pads, hospital plates, heel plates, onion heels, z-bars, bandages, therapeutic boots, topical sol- utions, or casts are focused at providing some type of protection to speci c areas in the equine foot (Fig. 5). Fig. 3. Various shoes that elevate the heels and reduce tension. Fig. 4. The shoes on the left increase pressure dependent on their material makeup. The shoes on the right reduce pressure by eliminating contact. Fig. 2. Various pedal appliances that have modi cations to reduce leverage at the toe.BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 208 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSStabilization Thenal force that can be attenuated in the foot is stabilization. Stabilization is simply adding some form of external coaptation to limit movement during loading and unloading of the digit. Various diseasepathologies will require stabilization as a form of ther-apy and can include quarter cracks, wall defects,shear lesions, cof nb o n eo ro t h e rf r a c t u r e sa n ds o m e cases of laminitis. Foals will often fracture their cof n bone and the utilization of various cuffs, clips, or castsare forms of stabilization. Stabilization of cracks maybe accomplished using wire apposition and materials such as berglass, kevlar, or acrylics. c,dShoe modi ca- t i o n ss u c ha st o e ,s i d e ,o rq u a r t e rc l i p sa r ef o r m so fstabilization, and the use of a foot cast provides rigid stabilization (Fig. 6). 3. Clinical Application Palmar Foot Pain As mentioned earlier, a combination of alterations in le- verage, tension, pressure, protection, and stabilization may be necessary to provide a therapeutic bene t. The example below re flects the thought combination applied in a case to all the mechanical potentials. A nine-year-old Quarter Horse gelding presents with a chronic history of palmar foot pain. The horse has crushed heels and under-run pedal conformation with minimal digital cushion, blocks to a palmar digi- tal nerve block, and is positive to testers across the heels. Radiographically the navicular bone is unre- markable, but there is noted pathology to the rim of the cof n bone likely secondary to compensated toe rst landing. Additionally, magnetic resonance reveals signi cant navicular bone edema (hyperinten- sity), and a linear DDFT core lesion (Fig. 7). Knowing there are capabilities to reduce tension in the DDFT with heel elevation, one might elect a wedge shoe. However, consequences of this action to the horse 's heel structure will have to be considered. One may, therefore, elect to unload the heels, whilemaintaining elevation and transfer pressure to the sole/frog, to limit compromising heel integrity. Thistransfer of pressure may elicit a negative consequence due to the underlying palmar pathologies in the Fig. 6. Various implementations of mechanical stabilization. The tongue depressor (in the lower left) is simply used as a spacer between the shoe and wall and is removed once the adhering material has set. Fig. 7. A horse presenting with an underrun heel, minimal dig-ital cushion, cof n bone rim fractures (arrows) and a linear tear in the lateral lobe of the deep digital flexor tendon (note the hyperintensity). Fig. 5. Various shoes that provide protection to the foot.BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 209navicular bone and deep flexor tendon. Patients with similar pathology are often positive to hoof testers across the frog and heel and are reluctant to materialpressure on the frog. Because of this, one may elect toprovide a more rigid and broad form of heel protectionto the palmar foot. To address the rim of the cof n bone, one may elect to relieve the inner web of theshoe and isolate any impression material to the backhalf of the sole to reduce pressure at the toe. Leverage can be reduced by rolling the toe, or setting the shoe back off the toe, which will additionally protect therim of the cof n bone, if a wide-web shoe is used. A consideration for stabilization with a rim cast could bemade. An example of a therapeutic shoe that couldmeet these criteria is given in Figure 8. The basic mechanical prescriptive plan that could be communicated to a farrier for application would be: 1)reduce tension in the DDFT, 2) redistribute pressurefrom the heels, 3) protect the rim of the cof n bone, 4) protect the palmar foot, and 5) reduce leverage at the toe. Several different appliances might work to achieve t h es a m eo b j e c t i v e s .T h eg o a li st oc o m m u n i c a t et h emechanics, allow farrier 's choice in material, and dis- cuss any potential consequences. Recognition of the im-portance of the trim to achieve some of the mechanicalobjectives should be considered, and further medicaltreatments and rehabilitation would obviously be im-portant for this case, as well. It is worth noting that without an accurate, quantita- tive, anatomical diagnosis the above case is dif cult to build a complete mechanical shoeing prescription but is understandably what practitioners deal with day-to-day. 4.

Dutton, DVM, DACVS Lameness examinations are a signi cant component of an equine practice and diagnostic tools are invalu- able in assessing and determining the cause of lameness. A thorough history and complete lameness ex- amination, as well as anesthetic blocks, are the cornerstones to successful lameness examination. Further diagnostic tools such as radiography and ultrasonography are the most common initial diagnostic tools used to help establish a speci c diagnosis and guide the practitioner in developing a therapeutic plan. Successful radiographic diagnosis is reliant on good radiographic equipment, proper technique, proper positioning, and complete radiographic studies. Knowledge of normal and abnormal radiographic anatomy is imperative for proper diagnosis. With the development of digital radiography, the quality of radiographs has signi cantly improved, but proper technique and proper positioning are necessary for diagnostic qual- ity radiographs. Author 's address: Texas Tech david.dutton@ttu.edu. \u00a92022 AAEP. 1. Radiographic Technique Regarding proper technique, there are some general rules of thumb to remember for equine radiography.One is to have the kilovoltage setting high enough tosupply enough energy to penetrate equine bone. As thebone and soft tissue thickness increases, subsequentlydensity, so will the supplied kilovoltage. For example,65 kV will be adequate to evaluate solar margin ofP3 vs 80 kV for the stifl e. For most equine limb radio- graphs, the kilovoltage will range from 65 to 90 kV.The second general rule of thumb is to have the short-est exposure time as possible, which will limit motionartifact. The third factor for consistent radiographictechniques is maintaining the established focal distance.A typical focal distance used in equine radiology is36 inches. Collimation on the area of interest will also increase radiographic quality as well as ensure betterradiation safety by decreasing scatter radiation. Placement of the radiographic plate close to the patient will limit magni cation artifact. Proper lm labeling is i m p o r t a n tf o rp a t i e n ti d e n t i cation for medical and legal purposes. Film labeling should include the own-er's name, patient 'sn a m e( o rh i p / i d e n t i cation number i nt h ec a s eo fs a l e s lms), veterinarian 'so rc l i n i c 's name taking the radiographs, radiographic acquisi- tion date, and the limb being radiographed. Placement of radiographic markers is also crucial for correct ana-tomical lesion localization, especially for surgical inter- vention. Radiographic markers are placed on the radiographic plate on the dorsal or lateral aspect of the NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 211BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICElimb when the radiograph is taken. This ensures the ra- diographic reviewer knows which aspect of the limb is lateral vs medial and is especially bene cial on the oblique views. In the case of radiographic oblique views, the marker is placed on the lateral aspect of the limb. 2. Radiographic Positioning Regarding proper radiographic positioning, rst ensure the patient is standing square on a flat and level sur- face. This is especially important in evaluating feet for balance. When evaluating feet for balance, both feet should be on equal height blocks with the horse stand-ing and positioned squarely. The height of the blocksshould be high enough that the center of the radio- graphic beam, where the laser pointer is centered, is at the solar margin of the third phalanx. For a dorsopal-mar view of the foot, the radiographic plate is positionedparallel to the heel bulbs and perpendicular to the ground surface. For the lateral view, the heel bulbs can also serve as a guide with the plate and generator beingperpendicular to the heel bulbs. For the rest of the joints radiographed in the horse, the general concept is the ra- diographic plate is held and maintained perpendicularto the radiographic generator. The center of the radio-graphic beam is aimed directly at the center of the bone or joint of interest and at an angle where the radio- graphic beam is parallel to the joint surface. In general,a minimum of 2 radiographic views at right anglesto each other (lateromedial and dorsopalmar/plantar views) may be taken for survey lms in the distal limb of the horse. This is the minimal views needed to assess a 3-dimensional structure in a 2-dimensional image.However, in the lame horse, a complete radiographic study should be performed of the area of interest. In the lower limb, this includes the oblique views but couldalso entail special projections unique to that bone or joint involved. 3. Radiographic Views Beyond the basics of patient positioning and projecting the radiographic beam, there are the speci cv i e w sa n d angles of radiographs for each area of interest. Several equine textbooks1,2along with journal articles on spe- cic anatomical locations can serve as useful guides for consultation of radiographic positions. The commonviews taken for a radiographic study can vary by the breed, age, discipline of use, and preference of the veteri- nary practitioner. Common basic radiographic views ofeach anatomical area of the horse in relation to lame-ness localization and clinical scenarios will be discussed. Distal Phalanx/Navicular Bone Region The most common area evaluated for lameness is the foot. Here are some scenarios and what radiographic views that would be warranted. Scenario 1: A horse is presented with a unilateral non-weightbearing limb lameness, with heat at thecoronary band, increased digital pulses, and is posi-tive to hoof testers across the toe. The most likelydiagnosis is a foot abscess, but no de nitive tracts are seen. Rather than randomly paring on the foot for an abscess, radiographic evaluation would be warranted, especially to rule out a P3 fracture. The basic radio-graphic views for a foot/distal phalanx study in thisscenario would include a lateromedial view, horizon-tal dorsopalmar view, and a 65-degree dorsoproximal-palmarodistal view of the solar margin. These viewsallow for evaluation of the foot for potential gas tractsseen with some abscesses, cof n bone fractures, kera- tomas, osteitis, as well as cof n joint osteoarthritis, subchondral bone cysts, and osteochondral fragments.Even when the cause of lameness is an obvious abscess,it is good practice to obtain these radiographic views torule out other underlying causes for the abscess and tohave a baseline set of radiographs if the problem pro-gresses. These 3 main basic views are also obtained incases of laminitis. The lateral view allows for evaluationof potential rotation, sinking, and dorsal laminar thick- ening. Some horses can sink medially as well, thus the reasoning for a dorsopalmar (DP) view. The so-lar margin view allows for evaluation of solar mar-gin fragmentation and osteitis of P3. Furtherradiographic evaluation in a laminitic case wouldinclude a venogram. Scenario 2: A horse is presented with a forelimb lameness, negative to hoof testers and blocks out to apalmar digital nerve block. A palmar digital nerve(PDN) block is not speci c to just blocking out the heels but regionalizes the lameness to the foot/pasternregion. The lateromedial (LM) and views dis-cussed above the navicularbone, including a collimated 60-degree dorsoproximal-palmarodistal oblique view and palmaroproximal-pal-marodistal oblique skyline view, would be the basicradiographs obtained in this case. Lateral and medial oblique views from a horizontal plane or from the 65- degree dorsoproximal-palmarodistal oblique view aretaken to further examine areas of interest in theregion of the phalanges, navicular bone, solar margin,and wings of the third phalanx. When radiographs ofthe navicular bone are taken, it is imperative toensure the foot/sulci of the frog are clean and any exfo-liating false sole or detached frog is pared away toavoid radiographic artifact. The addition of packingmaterial to ll in the voids of the sulci of the frog decreases artifact, improves radiographic detail, andavoids inadvertently suspecting a frog/solar artifactas a fracture. The addition synovial invaginations. Other causes of lameness that can block out to the foot involve the soft tissues of the footsuch as the deep digital flexor tendon, impar liga- ment, suspensory ligament Also, bone bruising/bone edemaand navicular bursitis can be causes of foot lameness.Further diagnostics such as ultrasound of the soft tissuesthat can be accessed can be performed, but completeevaluation is limited. Magnetic resonance imagingBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 212 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS( M R I )o rc o m p u t e dt o m o g r a p h y( C T )e v a l u a t i o no ft h e foot region is needed in more complex cases and for com-plete evaluation to obtain a nal de nitive diagnosis. Pastern/Fetlock/Metacarpus Horses in which the lameness blocks to an abaxial block would warrant radiographic evaluation of the pastern. Radiographic positions for the pastern include a lateromedial view, dorsoproximal-palmarodistal view (20 -35 degrees proximal to distal with the plate parallel to the pastern and the beam perpendicularto the pastern), dorsolateral-palmaromedial (DLPMO) and dorsomedial-palmarolateral oblique (DMPLO) views can vary depending on the speci ca r e ao fi n - terest. In general, 35- to 45-degree oblique views are standard for the pastern joint. Common radiographic abnormalities of the pastern region are high ring- bone (articular osteoarthritis, nonarticular), subchon-dral bone cysts, and fractures. Areas of exostosis, such as seen along the palmar aspect of P1, can be indica- tive of soft tissue involvement. Nonarticular bony changes and avulsion fragments can be indicative of soft tissue injuries, and further assessment of the asso-ciated tendon or ligament should be performed via ultrasonography or, in some cases, MRI or CT. Radiographs of the fetlock are taken in cases where the lameness is localized to the fetlock via clinical eval- uation, intra-articular anesthesia, and/or fetlock joint are 45 degrees. Proximal to distal oblique views are taken in cases of further evaluation of the proximal sesamoid bones and palmar eminences. Common sesamoiditis. As with other anatomical areas, signs of bone remodeling, peri- ostitis, and exostosis can be indicative of soft tissueinjuries and should be evaluated further via ultraso- nography. In lameness localized to the fetlock region, the suspensory branches, in particular, should be eval-uated for potential involvement as well. Radiographs of the metacarpal bones include a lateromedial view, dorsopalmar view, dorsolateral-palmaromedial view, dorsomedial-palmarolateral corticalfractures, splints, and splint fractures. The dorsopal- mar view also allows for evaluation of bony changes at the origin of the suspensory. Carpus/Radius Lameness localized to the carpus is usually diagnosed via examination, palpation of carpal effusion, and/or ori- gin of the lameness. Many lameness cases associated with the carpi will be more subtle in lameness severity.Radiographs of the carpus include a flexed lateromedial view, dorsopalmar view, dorsolateral-palmaromedialview, and dorsomedial-palmarolateral view. Especiallyin speed event horses, skyline views of the carpal bones are taken for evaluation for slab fractures, third carpal bone remodeling, and osteochondral fragments. Thedistal radius, proximal row of carpal bones, and of carpal bones are evaluated via dorsoproximal- dorsodistal radiographic views. The row of carpal bones evaluated is done by changing the radiographic angle.The distal radius is evaluated via 90-degree view, the proximal row of carpal bones via 60-degree view, and the distal row of carpal bones via a 30-degree view.Most radiographs of the carpi are taken to evaluate conformation, angular limb deformities, flexural limb deformities, physitis, osteochondral fragmentation, carpal slab fractures, and osteoarthritis. The radius can be evaluated via craniocaudal, lateral, craniolateral- caudomedial oblique, and craniomedial-caudolateraloblique views. Most radiographs of the radius are takenfor stress fractures and fractures of the radius. Elbow/Humerus/Shoulder Lameness and radiographic evaluation of the elbowto shoulder are less common. Usually, the lamenessassociated in this region is more pronounced and typ-ically presents with a shortened cranial phase of stride. In young horses, these areas are radiographed in conjunction with traumatic injuries or due to oste-ochondrosis. Lameness localization can be accom- plished with intra-articular blocks. Caution should be taken when blocking the elbow joint in that theradial nerve can be inadvertently anesthetized, lead-ing to several hours of radial nerve paresis. Common radiographic views of the elbow include a flexed mediolateral view and a craniocaudal view. A \"lat- eral \"view of the elbow is best taken in a 90-degree flexed position with the limb pulled cranially and the radiograph taken from a medial to lateral direction. The radius is parallel to the ground surface to achieve a 90-degree flexion position of the elbow. For the craniocaudal view, the plate needs to be slightly angled and pushed into the ribcage with the radiographic beam slightly angled medial to lateral from a true cranial to caudal position.Radiographic evaluation of the elbow is commonfor olecranon fractures, trauma, and osteoarthritis. Radiographs of the humerus are usually taken to evaluate traumatic injuries and evaluate for hum-eral fractures and fractures of the deltoid tuberos- ity. Radiographic views of the humerus include a mediolateral/lateromedial view and a proximocau-dal-distocranial view. The \"lateral \"view of the hu- merus can be accomplished either via a slightlycranial medial to lateral projection or a slightlycaudal lateral to medial projection. The lateral vs amedial projection is usually based on the case circum- stance, size of patient, and standing vs recumbentBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 213position. The caudocranial is best accomplished w i t hap r o x i m a lt od i s t a lb e a mp r o j e c t i o na t t e m p t - ing to align the plate parallel to the humerus andrequires a slight lateral to medial angulation of the x-ray generator. Shoulder radiographs are more challenging but can be accomplished with properradiographic positioning. Shoulder radiographs are an extended mediolateral view and a caudolateral- craniomedial view. For the \"lateral \"view, the radi- ograph is taken from a medial to lateral projection. The affected limb is pulled forward and elevated with the goal of overlapping the shoulder joint andthe trachea. Shoulder radiographs are typicallytaken for traumatic injuries, osteoarthritis, and osteochondrosis. Hocks/Stifles Lameness associated with the hocks is common in performance horses across all disciplines. Hocklameness is determined via examination and flex- ions and con rmed via intra-articular anesthesia. Radiographic hock view, dorsopalmar view, dorsolateral- palmaromedial view, and palmarolateral-dorsome- dial view. The lateromedial, dorsopalmar, and dor-solateral-palmaromedial views will have a slight proximal to distal projection to be parallel to the distal hock joints. The palmarolateral-dorsomedialview will have a distal to proximal projection toimprove evaluation of the distal hock joints. Another view occasionally taken is the flexed plan- taroproximal-plantarodistal view, which allows for evaluation of the tuber calcaneus and sustentacu- lum tali. Common radiographic evaluations of the hocks are taken for evaluation of incomplete ossi - cation of the tarsal bones, angular limb deform- ities, osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis, and tarsal slab fractures. Osteoarthritis is primarily associ-ated with the tarsometatarsal and distal intertar- sal joints (bone spavin). Osteochondritis are primarily in the tibiotarsal joint withthe distal intermediate ridge of the tibia being themost common site but can occur on the lateral trochlear ridge, medial trochlear ridge, and the medial and are seen distal to the medial trochlear ridge (dew drop) and, in general, are an incidental nd- ing. The tarsal skyline views are mostly taken for evaluation of the sustentaculum tali for fracture fragments, osteitis, and osteomyelitis usually asso- ciated with sepsis of the medial tarsal sheath. The sti fle is composed of 3 joints and lameness can originate from any of the joints. The lateral femorotibial joint is the least commonly affected. Conrmation of the sti flea n dw h i c hs p e c i c joint involved in the lameness is determined via intra-artic- ular anesthesia. Sti fle radiographs primarily consist of a lateromedial view, caudolateral-craniomedial oblique view, and caudocranial view. There are clinicianpreferred and specialized views of the sti flea s well, such a flexed lateromedial view and flexedcranioproximal-craniodistal view. Common abnormal osteoarthritis, dissecans femoral condyle. Skyline views (cranioproximal-craniodistal) of patella are needed for evaluation of patellar frac- tures and evaluation of the trochlear groove, espe- cially in miniature horses. The flexed lateromedial view allows for better assessment of the patella,proximal aspects of the trochlear ridges, and inser- tion of the cruciate ligaments. The flexed view is an option in horses not tolerating radiographic plate placement medially and not being able to position further proximally in the weight-bearing position. 4. Normal Radiographic Anatomy Knowledge of normal radiographic anatomy is im- perative in making a proper radiographic diagnosis and thus in being able to identify abnormal nd- ings. General radiographic evaluation will consistof assessing the surrounding soft tissue for radio- graphic signs of swelling, defects, opacities such as mineralization, or lucencies such as gas tracts. The soft tissue swelling can correlate with general soft tissue swelling such as seen with edema or celluli- tis, enlargement and thickening of tendons or liga- ments, or swelling around joints consistent with joint effusion. The cortex of the bone is evaluated for thickening, sclerosis, lysis, periosteal reaction, or endosteal reaction. The medullary cavity is assessed for trabecular pattern as well as sclerosisor lysis. The joint margins are evaluated for a smooth surface. Abnormalities at the joint margins can be periarticular periosteal reactions, bone lysis, enthesiophyte formation, osteophyte forma- tion, and osteochondral fragmentation. The joint space is evaluated for joint alignment, symmetry of the joint space, and thickness. A narrowed joint space is consistent with articular cartilage thin- ning and loss. A widened joint space is consistent with joint effusion. The subchondral bone is eval- uated cyst for-mation, and osteochondrosis. A 3-dimensional perspective of anatomy of the area radio- graphed is bene cial when evaluating a 2-dimen- sional radiograph to account for anatomical areasof bone overlap. In summary, a solid foundation of the skeletal anatomy of the bones and location of soft tissue attachments is crucial for successful ra- diographic interpretation of normal. There are available textbooks for reference that are useful for equine anatomy. 3,4 In closing, it should be noted that radiographs are just one component of a complete thoroughlameness examination. In some cases, the radio- graphs will provide a de nitive diagnosis of the inciting cause of the lameness, such as in advanced osteoarthritis, fractures, osteochondral fragments, etc. In other cases, the radiographic ndings will lead the practitioner to suspect soft tissueBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE 214 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSinvolvement as an inciting factor of the cause of lameness and ultrasonography of the soft tissuestructures are warranted. Typical radiographicchanges seen with soft tissue involvement caninclude exostosis, sclerosis, lysis, avulsion fragments of tendonous insertions. This highlights the impor- tance of knowing the anatomical locations of origin or insertion of the soft tissues. Thermography isalso a diagnostic tool being used to help gathermore clinical evidence to determine the incitingcause. Other times the radiographs are normal orinconclusive and other advanced modalities of diagnostic imagining are warranted, such as the use of nuclear scintigraphy, MRI, and CT. In othercases, radiographic changes are seen but do notnecessarily t with the clinical picture and further diagnostics are necessary to see the completepicture.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Tipton, DVM, DACVS-LA Author 's common and dif cult ailment facing most equine veterinarians. A large portion of equine patients are required to perform athletic maneuvers, which put extraordinary stress on the musculoskel- etal system, resulting in many potential injuries. Equine veterinarians are expected to accurately diag- nose these conditions and develop treatment plans allowing the horse to return to activity with the short- est convalescent period possible. An accurate diagno-sis can be particularly dif cult in the case of soft tissue injury. Intimate knowledge of regional anat-omy, ability to perform diagnostic anesthesia, and use of multiple imaging techniques (radiography and ultrasonography) are essential for lameness diagno- sis. It is the intention of this article to familiarize the general equine practitioner with ultrasonographyand its use in the diagnosis of commonly encountered soft tissue injuries in equine patients. Ultrasonography has been used in the equine patient for close to 40 years, and the technology hasbecome reliably used in the practice of equine medi- cine. Ultrasonography has become important due torelatively low cost, accessibility, and ease of use in ambulatory situations. 1However, obtaining diagn- ostic images and accurately interpreting ultrasono-graphic images requires an understanding of the interaction between the ultrasonographic waves and the tissue being examined, knowledge of the anat- omy being examined, and knowledge of the normalultrasonographic appearance of the tissue beingexamined. The quality of the equipment, preparationof the patient, and operator practice and pro ciency all determine the diagnostic quality of the images. 2,3 Equipment Ultrasound technology has developed rapidly over thelast few years, and the advent of more portable andaffordable ultrasound machines has made this modal-ity more available to practitioners than ever before.Diagnostic images can be obtained with most anyultrasound machine currently on the market; there-fore, there is no longer a need for a large console unitto produce high-quality diagnostic images. This hasenabled the ambulatory veterinarian to diagnose andtreat soft tissue injury in the eld. Patient Preparation Proper preparation of the patient cannot be over-looked when performing ultrasonography. The hairshould be clipped with a #40 clipper blade and all dirtand debris carefully removed from the skin surface.The area should be thoroughly cleaned with soap andwarm water and acoustic coupling gel applied to theskin. The presence of any debris such as hair, dirt, orskin wounds can adversely affect image quality andproduce artifacts rendering image interpretationmore dif cult. 3There are instances where the patient is unable to be clipped for one reason or another; inthese instances, isopropyl alcohol can be placed on the NOTES 216 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICEcleaned limb to facilitate contact between the probe and the patient. The ultrasonographer should get in a comfortable position to image the desired structure. If the patientor clinician is in an uncomfortable position, the examwill be rushed and image quality will suffer. Proper restraint and sedation are necessary for the patient t os t a n dl o n ge n o u g hf o rt h ee x a mt ob ep e r f o r m e d .Some patients resent the cleaning or placement ofalcohol on the limb, so care should be taken. Also,some patients resent the pressure of the probe being placed on the skin to obtain the image. Imaging Technique Although developing pro ciency with ultrasound requires practice, the technique can be easily devel- oped over time to obtain diagnostic quality images. Becoming familiar with adjusting the settings for optimal image quality is important and comes withrepeated use of the equipment. Knowing when andhow to adjust frequency, use a standoff, adjust gain,and adjust focal depth is important for obtaining the image. Placement of the probe on the skin and using the proper amount of force are also essential to image quality. In most instances, the probe should be ori-ented at a 90-degree angle from the structure beingi m a g e d ;t h i si sr e f e r r e dt oa sa no n - i n c i d e n c ei m a g e .There are certain instances when structures can be imaged with an off-incidence image (suspensory liga- ment). Also, obtaining weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing images is part of a complete ultrasonographicexamination. Common Soft Tissue Injuries 1. Superficial Digital Flexor Tendon (SDFT) Super cial digital flexor tendonitis is common among horses competing in speed events such as racing of all types. The SDFT is most commonly injured in themid-metacarpal/tarsal region and the classic lesion is a hypoechoic area within the center of the tendon (i.e.,a core lesion). In a study of cutting horses, it wasfound that SDFT lesions commonly occurred in the mid-metacarpal region, but at the lateral margin of the tendon. 4The ultrasonographic technique for diagnosis of SDFT lesions includes weight-bearing,on-incidence images. The use of a standoff pad is im-portant in imaging of the SDFT due to the very super-cial location of the tendon. When the tendon is imaged in a non-weight-bearing position, there can besome relaxation artifact noted on the images (Fig. 1). 2. Proximal Suspensory Ligament (PSL) The suspensory ligament is a very important cause of lameness in many different disciplines of horses. The suspensory apparatus is responsible for suspension ofthe metacarpo/metatarsophalangeal joint during lo-comotion and is commonly injured. The suspensoryligament presents a unique challenge for the ultraso-nographer due to the location of the origin of the liga-ment between the second and fourth metacarpal/metatarsal bones, as well as the presence of fat andmuscle bundles within the proximal portion of the lig-ament. A complete exam of the PSL includes weight-bearing, non-weight-bearing, on-incidence, and off- incidence images. Evaluation of the PSL includes determining the shape, size, and echogenicity of the ligament as well as the bone ligament interface at the origin. The nor-mal PSL has a rounded appearance with a medialand lateral bundle. Within each bundle, there is a fatand muscle bundle centrally located; these are easilyconfused with a lesion and so should be interpretedcarefully. The fat and muscle deposits within the PSLnecessitate the use of off-incidence images, and thereis a predictable echogenic pattern of the fat and mus-cle deposits that is different from the echogenic pat-tern of damaged or scar tissue within the ligament.The ability to differentiate scar or damaged tissuefrom normal tissue is paramount to an accurate diag-nosis. Using a combination of ndings (increased size, change in echogenic pattern, change in shape) assistswith making the diagnosis. Using both weight-bear-ing and non-weight-bearing exam of PSL is impor-tant. be moreeasily imaged, and imaged with a higher frequency,providing better resolution of Fig. 2. 3. Suspensory Branch (SB) Injury The suspensory branches are a continuation of the distal aspect of the suspensory ligament. The liga- ment splits into medial and lateral branches in thedistal one-third of the metacarpus/metatarsus. SBinjury is very common in many disciplines of horsesand relatively easily diagnosed. The SB is easily pal-pated, and injury can be suspected based on palpationof pain or increase in size on clinical exam as well asexacerbation of lameness with distal limb flexion tests. Ultrasound is used to con rm diagnosis. SB Fig. 1. The peripheral nature of the typical SDFT lesion in cut- ting horses as opposed to the classic centrally located core lesion seen in racing horses.BACK TO BASICS: FOUNDATIONAL CLINICAL SKILLS FOR EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 217injuries are common in both fore- and hindlimbs and appearance is similar in fore- and hindlimbs. An injured SB is generally increased in size and can have signi cant distortion of the normal shape. Centrally located hypoechogenic areas are common,as are hypoechogenic margins. Another commonnding in chronic SB desmitis is peri-ligamentous - brosis, noted as thickening of the tissue between the skin and SB. Evaluation of the bone -ligament inter- face at the insertion on the proximal sesamoid bonesis important as avulsion fractures and irregular bonemargins are very common with SB injuries and poten-tially negatively affect prognosis (Figs. 3 and 4). 4. Soft Tissue Injury of the Stifle The sti fle joint is a common place to nd multiple soft tissue injuries that are many times able to be diagnosed with ultrasound. Ultrasound exam of thestifle is important; the anatomy of the sti fled o e sn o t lend itself to imaging with magnetic resonance imag-ing in most cases. Many times, ultrasound is the onlynoninvasive soft tissue diagnostic imaging that canbe performed. The commonly injured soft tissuesinclude the commonlythe most of which can be imagedwith good ultrasonographic technique. Again, anexam in the non-weight-bearing position is requiredto image some of the soft tissues of the sti fle. Medial meniscal injuries are one of the more com- mon sti fle injuries diagnosed with the ultrasound. Only the cranial portion of the medial meniscus is visi-ble with the ultrasound exam; however, this is valua-ble information and should be performed in cases withmedial femorotibial joint effusion and nonspeci cr a d i - ographic ndings. When injured, common changes in the meniscus include loss of the normal triangularshape, prolapse of the ligament from its normal the body of the meniscus. Evaluation of hypoechoge-nicity of the medial meniscus should be interpretedcarefully because the normal meniscus has hypoechoiclinear bands or streaks. Massive joint effusion, syno-vial proliferation, and in flammatory in ltrate within synovial fluid often accompany abnormal ndings of the meniscus (Fig. 5). Imaging of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) is performed in the weight-bearing or non-weight-bear-ing patient with the ultrasound probe on the medialaspect of the stifl e .T h eM C Lc a nb ei m a g e di ni t s Fig. 3.

Joint effu-sion may or may not be present as a portion of theMCL is extracapsular and not within the medial fem-orotibial joint. Cranial ligament of the medial meniscus is more difcult to image and requires the patient to be non- weight-bearing. The ligament is imaged at the cra-nial medial aspect of the medial meniscus, and in- juries are normally noted as loss of normal ber alignment, which can extend into the cranial pole of the medial meniscus. A portion of the cranial cruci-ate ligament can be imaged with ultrasonography,but diagnosis of injury with ultrasound is technicallydemanding and not discussed further. Injury of thepatellar ligaments is much less common. Each of thepatellar ligaments is easily imaged from the distalpatella to the insertion on the tibial tuberosity. 2. Discussion The ability of the equine clinician to accurately diag- nose soft tissue injury is a requirement to perform lameness evaluation of the horse. The availability ofultrasound as a diagnostic tool has enabled practi-tioners to reliably assess the soft tissues and developdiagnosis and treatment plans. Although there is alearning curve with ultrasound technique, pro ciency can be achieved with practice. Many times, inabilityto obtain diagnostic images is due to improper patientpreparation or improper settings on the ultrasound.Becoming familiar with manipulation of frequency,depth, focal zone, and gain allows the ultrasonogra-pher to optimize the image during examination. Acareful and thorough examination is required of thestructure being imaged, and development of a sys-tematic approach to imaging will prevent missingpotential lesions.As the technology of ultrasound advances, becomes more affordable, and is portable, this imaging will become increasingly important to the general equinepractitioner. Point-of-care ultrasound is now avail-able and increasingly used. Veterinarians are nowrequired to become more comfortable with the tech-nology and techniques associated with ultrasoundimaging. Becoming comfortable with some of the techniques discussed previously (on- and off-incidence imaging,weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing examination)will increase the diagnostic ability of equine practi- tioners. The ability to accurately diagnose and treat patients on the farm at the time of exam not only pro-vides a higher quality of medicine for equine patientsbut also increases the pro tability of a veterinary practice.

Introduction Cataracts represent an important cause of blindness in horses. While feasible, equine cataract surgery out-comes are variable, and normal vision is an infre-quent postoperative result. Identi cation of breeds predisposed to congenital and juvenile cataract devel-opment may allow for future genetic investigations toidentify genetic variation contributing to cataractdevelopment. 2. Materials and Methods R e t r o s p e c t i v ec a s ei d e n t i cation of horses diagnosed with congenital or juvenile cataracts presented to anacademic referral hospital. Signalment, ophthalmicexamination ndings, and treatment measures were assessed. 3. Results Seventy horses with congenital or juvenile cataractswere identi ed. Fifty-six horses were affected bilater- ally and 14 unilaterally, for a total of 126 affectedeyes. American Quarter Horses, Andalusians, and Standardbreds were signi cantly overrepresented compared and ( P=0 . 0 1 1 /C01.0/C210/C05). Fifty- ve eyes (43.7%) received no treatment, 21 eyes (16.7%)received medical therapy, and 34 eyes (27.0%) weretreated with phacoemulsi cation without intraocular lens implantation. Eight horses were euthanized. Noeyes were restored with normal vision as all operatedeyes were left aphakic. Postoperative vision was pres-ent in 25/30 eyes for which follow-up was available. 4. Discussion The overrepresentation of certain breeds and frequentbilateral nature of congenital and juvenile cataracts issuggestive of an underlying genetic basis. Futuregenetic studies are warranted, and the identi cation of genetic variants associated with or causal for con-genital and juvenile cataracts should enable a betterunderstanding of this disease.

Introduction Monitoring insulin concentrations is critical for manag- ing insulation dysregulation (ID) in horses. The WRT, a stall-side assay utilizing whole blood, has recently become available. Method comparison between theWRT and a reference RIA is required to validate theWRT and assist veterinarians in interpreting results. 2. Materials and Methods Ninety-nine whole blood and plasma samples wereanalyzed in duplicate using the WRT and RIA,respectively. Insulin concentrations ranged from<20 to >100 mIU/mL. Assay sensitivity and speci- city were determined for insulin cut-offs used fordiagnosing ID, with bias between the assays wereevaluated. 3. Results Linear regression showed a slope of 1.005 and y-intercept of 3.502. The Spearman correlation (95% 0.85-0.94). The WRT concentrations averaged 10.39% higher theRIA, with mean bias of 3.74-3.84 mIU/mL for cut- offs of 45, 50, and 65 The WRT had sensi- tivities of 87% and speci of 93% at cut-offs of 45 and 50 mIU/mL and a sensitivity and speci city of 95% at 65 mIU/mL.

Equine spinal neurodegeneration has grass sickness, and Shivers. While clinical signsof equine motor neuron disease, equine grass sickness, a n dS h i v e r sa r ed i s t i n c t ,t h ep r o p r i o c e p t i v ea t a x i a observed with CVCM and eNAD/EDM are nearly iden- tical, and it is challenging to arrive at a de nitive ante- mortem diagnosis. While CVCM has classically beendened as a multifactorial or idiopathic disorder, 1 the spinal cord compression leads to a degenerative cer-vical myelopathy, 2thus classifying CVCM as a form of humans.3Infectious etiologies, present as spinal ataxias; however, accurate ante-mortem diagnostics tests are readily available for these diseases. The physical size of the horse precludes sensitive imag- ing techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, with the mainstay of diagnosis relying on radiography, myelography, and computed tomography. These imaging techniques are primarily to exclude CVCM; however, the poor sensitivity and presence of nonsigni cant back- ground lesions limit their utility. 4Additionally, there is no denitive diagnostic test for the second most common etiology of spinal ataxia, eNAD/EDM.5-7In Quarter Horses (QHs) and in (WBs), the pre-sentation of eNAD/EDM with QHs displaying an abnormally dull mentation and ataxia at a young age, while WBs often present with acute behavioral changes (aggression, spooking, etc.) and ataxia between 5 and NOTES 226 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE II: ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, ENDOCRINE DISEASE15 ciency has been de ni- tively associated with eNAD/EDM in the QHs9but not yet in the WBs. Thoroughbreds can fall into either cate- gory, manifesting clinical signs as youngsters or later in life. Thus, there may be subcategories of eNAD/EDMthat remain to be de ned. Currently, a presumptive di- agnosis of eNAD/EDM is based on clinical signs andexclusion of other causes of neurological disease. 5In human medicine, biomarker research has aided in thediagnosis of neurologic diseases. In particular, neuro la- ments are structural scaffolding proteins speci ct ot h e neuron that are essential for axonal growth. With axo-nal damage, neuro laments are accumulated into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, to a lesser extent, into the blood. Phosphorylated neuro lament heavy protein ( p N f H )i so n et y p eo fn e u r o lament that has speci city to the nervous system and is particularly resistant to proteases, making it an ideal biomarker. 10The goal for this \"how to \"session is to provide guidelines for how to interpret pNfH results in cases of equine neurologic disease. 2. Materials and Methods The goal of this study was to determine pNfH con- centrations, using a pNfH serum and CSF from neurologically normal control horses and horses with eNAD/EDM,CVCM, and Shivers. All samples evaluated in the study were from postmortem-con rmed cases of eNAD/EDM (n= 64) and CVCM ( n= 26). Five of the 9 Shivers cases were diagnosed at postmortem and the remaining 4 clin-ically phenotyped. Control samples ( n= 51) were col- lected prospectively from healthy research horses withnormal neurologic evaluations at the University of California, Davis Center for Equine Health. 11 Serum and CSF pNfH concentrations were com- pared among groups with a Kruskal-Wallis test fol- lowed by Dunn 's multiple comparisons test with adjustment of the pvalue for multiple testing. A non- linear univariate analysis using chi-square contin-gency tables was performed data from eNAD/ EDM, CVCM, and neurologically normal controlhorses to determine the association between disease status (eNAD/EDM yes/no) and the following binary variables: age ( 5 and > 5 years based on age distri- bution), sex (male or female), breed (QH or non-QH),CSF total protein ( <80 mg/dL or ( <6/ mLo r6/mL).Variables with p<0.2 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression model. The same univariate analyses were then per-formed for CVCM (yes/no) for the outcome variables, whereas serum and CSFpNfH concentrations were considered predictor varia-bles. Due to the small sample size, Shivers affected horses were excluded from the univariate and multi- variate analyses. Subsequently, interval likelihood ratios determi- nation was performed to choose the optimal serumand CSF cutoff point that maximized diagnosis ofeNAD/EDM and CVCM. Strength of associationbetween the chosen cutoff point and diagnosis ofeNAD/EDM and CVCM was determined by calculat-ing odd ratios using a 2 /C22 frequency table. Odds ratios <1 or > 1 and 95% con dence interval exclud- ing 1 and a corresponding p<0.05 were considered signicant. Sensitivity and speci city at the chosen cutoff point were also determined from the 2 /C22f r e - quency table. 3. Results Median and 95% con dence interval serum pNfH concentrations in control, CVCM, eNAD/EDM,and Shivers horses can be found in Table 1. CSFpNfH concentrations were signi cantly and eNAD/EDM 50% sensitivity and 86% speci city. 4. Discussion Until recently, the only way to de nitively diagnose eNAD/EDM was through postmortem histologic eval-uation of the brainstem and spinal cord. A biomarkertest for pNfH represents the rst diagnostic antemor- tem testing available for eNAD/EDM. Serum andCSF pNfH testing for eNAD/EDM has higher sensitiv-ity in horses <5 years of age as compared to older horses. This test may still be useful in older horses, Table 1. Median and 95% CI Serum and CSF pNfH Concentrations for Healthy Control Horses and Horses with CVCM, eNAD/EDM, and Shivers GroupSerum (ng/mL) CSF (ng/mL) Median 95% Median 95% (n = 51) 0.08 0.07/C00.15 1.26 1.06/C01.5 CVCM (n = 26) 0.07 0.07/C00.15 1.15/C029.9 eNAD/EDM (n = 64) 0.07 PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 227but this is an important caveat. Additionally, these increased pNfH values only occurred in non-WB eNAD/EDM cases. Values are only informative if ele-vated as a normal value (i.e., serum <1n g / m La n d / o r CSF<3 ng/mL) does not exclude disease. Of note, there were no samples of horses with EPM assessedin this study. Thus, serum and CSF pNfH resultsshould only be assessed once a horse is negative forinfectious disease testing (i.e., EPM, West Nile Virus,etc.). In conclusion, eNAD/EDM is very likely if serum pNF-H > 1 ng/mL (speci city 99%) in non-WB horses over 1 year of age, for which other causes of neuro-logic disease have been excluded. Neurologic diseasedue to either eNAD/EDM or CVCM is very likely if C S Fp N F - H>3n g / m L( s p e c i city 98% for eNAD/EDM or CVCM). Future studies are required to deter- mine how serum and CSF pNfH concentrationschange over time with neurologic disease to iden-tify the potential value in retesting horses with neurologic disease that have levels of pNfH below the limit of detection in serum and CSF.

Introduction Insulin dysregulation (ID) is the key feature of equine metabolic syndrome and can coexist with pi-tuitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). ID appears to be the driving factor and strongest pre- dictor of the development and reoccurring episodesof laminitis depends onthe ability to diagnose and control ID. ID is de ned as any combination of the following: basal (resting)hyperinsulinemia, postprandial hyperinsulinemia(to the oral sugar test [OST] or consumed feeds), ortissue insulin resistance. 1The most accepted and practical in- eld diagnostic tests for ID are meas- uring resting (basal) insulin and/or performingdynamic testing basal insulin values are 20 to 50 lU/mLbetter assess (RIA and Immulite 1000) and 30 to 75lU/mL (Immulite 2000 xpi), but for suscept cases, it is best to perform the OST.1Abnormal basal insulin values are > 50 lU/mL (RIA and Immulite 1000) and >7 5 lU/mL (Immulite 2000 xpi).1Abnormal OST insulin values are > 45 mU/mL (RIA) positive for 0.15 mL/kg test.1Factors affecting these diagnostic tests such as fed vs. fasted state of the animal, doseof corn syrup, etc. are often debated due to the knowl-edge base evolving as more research is conductedaround these subjects. Thus, the objectives of thisreview are to provide updates from recent researchon factors (fed vs. fasted state, dose and type of cornsyrup, seasonal changes, and effects of combinationtesting) affecting the OST when diagnosing ID. 2. OST -Fed vs. Fasted State Practicality and accurate diagnosis of ID are both im-portant considerations when developing diagnostic pro-tocols. The state of fed vs. fasted of the equid is animportant factor when diagnosing ID with the OST. To NOTES 232 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE II: ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, CATARACTS, AND ENDOCRINE DISEASEclarify here, when referring to fed vs. fasted states, the denition of \"fed\"describes an animal that has access to some kind of forage, whether it be pasture or hay,but typically no grain, or at the minimum grain is with-held 4 hours prior to testing. The \"fasted \"state refers to the animal being fasted at the minimum of 3 to 6 hoursbut oftentimes overnight with no access to grain or for-age of either pasture or hay. While fasting is no longerrecommended when assessing resting (basal) insulinconcentrations, fasting (3 -6 hours) has been recom- mended when performing the OST, even though fewstudies have been conducted to support this fasting rec-o m m e n d a t i o ni nI Dh o r s e s .As t u d yc o n d u c t e di nm e t a -bolically normal ponies has shown that fed vs. fastedstate does impact the insulin responses to the OST. This study evaluated ponies tested with the OST right off of pasture or after an overnight fast ;10 hours and showed that the fasted ponies had signi cantly higher insulin responses to the OST when compared to the fedstate ponies. 2However, these researchers conducted another study to investigate the fed vs. fasted state ofthe OST in distinguishing between previously laminiticvs. nonlaminitic ponies and found there was no differ-ence in insulin responses to the OST in different fastingconditions of the ponies. 3A very recent study has been conducted in ID horses that evaluated similar condi-tions of fed vs. fasted states in response to the OSTwith similar outcomes. 4R e s u l t sf r o mt h i ss t u d ys h o w e d that while ID horses sampled in a fasted state of3h o u r s h a d s i g n i cantly lower resting insulin concen- trations, no differences were found between fed vs.fasted states for insulin responses to the OST. 4In this study, investigators also evaluated these sameresponses in non-ID horses and found no differencein insulin responses to the OST in fed vs. fasted non-ID horses. 4These results are supported from two earlier studies that examined the effects of fed vs.fasted on OST responses in non-ID horses and foundno differences in insulin responses. 5-6Overall, these studies indicate that while there can be differences inthe fed vs. fasted state insulin responses to the OST inponies, this does not seem to be the case for horses. Regardless, fed vs. fasted state results should not be used interchangeably, and when monitoring ID statuso v e rt i m ei nt h es a m ea n i m a l ,o n es h o u l du s et h esame method of fed vs. fasted state. If the fed state isused for the OST, it is important to take into consider-ation the type of forage, and ideally the equid is main-tained on a low-nonstructural-carbohydrate forage att h et i m eo fs a m p l i n g .I tm a ya l s ob ew o r t h w h i l et oc o n -sider evaluating the insulin responses to feedstuffsas recent research has shown signi cant differen- ces in postprandial insulin responses of ID horsescompared to non-ID horses; this testing could alsohelp with management decisions. 7 3. OST -Dose and Type of Corn Syrup The OST is used to try and mimic or re flect the natu- ral, postprandial responses to various feedstuffs inhorses, which is useful to study and identify horseswith excessive responses of the entero-insular axis tooral sugar. Thus, Karo light corn syrup is used as the sugar challenge in the OST, and this brand formula- tion is composed of maltose and glucose. However,Karo is not available in all countries, and thus thetype of corn syrup and differences in composition canpotentially impact insulin results. A recent study eval-uated the insulin responses of horses receiving eitherKaro light corn syrup or Crown Lily white, a corn sy-rup available in Canada, and found no signi cant dif- ferences between insulin responses to the OST whenusing Karo or Crown corn syrups in horses. 6The dose of corn syrup to use in the OST is oftentimes question-able as to whether to use the low dose (0.15 mL/kg) orthe high dose (0.45 mL/kg) of corn syrup. Research in ponies has shown that when using the higher dose, stimulated insulin responses to the OST were betterable to distinguish between previously laminiticponies or nonlaminitic ponies, while they found no dif-ference in responses to the low dose of corn syrup. 3A recent study conducted in both non-ID and ID horsescomparing the low- vs. high-dose OST found no differ-ence in 60-minute insulin responses between the twodoses in either non-ID or ID horses. 4Thus, these results indicate that a low-dose OST at this time isappropriate for diagnosing ID in horses, but a high-dose OST may be useful when equivocal cases aredetected and being monitored. 4. OST -Season It is known that season impacts the hypothalamic-pi- tuitary-adrenal axis; thus, there is a need for sea- sonal hormone reference ranges, for example, foradrenocorticotropic hormone when diagnosing PPID;however, very little is known about the effects of sea-son on insulin responses to the OST. A recent studyperformed OSTs across seasons on a group of horsesfrom Finland and found no differences or seasonalpatterns in insulin responses to the OST; however,they found insulin dysregulation status variedthroughout the year. 8The authors indicated several limitations of this study that could have in fluenced the study results.8Even more recently, a study con- ducted in Kentucky evaluated the effects of seasonon insulin responses to the OST in ID and non-IDhorses over a 2-year period and found signi cant effects of season on insulin responses to the OST. 9 This study found that for non-ID horses, season hadno effect on basal or resting insulin concentrations,but it also found that OST insulin values were higherin the spring vs. summer. Further results from thisstudy showed that season affected both basal insulinand insulin responses to the OST in ID horses, withboth being higher in spring than fall and summer,and winter OST responses were higher than fall. 9In this study, horses changed their ID categorizationacross season, and relying only on basal insulin, IDstatus across seasons was con rmed only 21.1% to 63.6% of the time, while OST insulin responsesacross season con rmed ID 84.2% to ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, CATARACTS, AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 233time.9Therefore, regardless of seasonal changes, if the OST was used, ID diagnosis would be consistent. Season should be considered when monitoring horses across season when using the OST. 5. OST -Combination Testing Oftentimes, for practicality, concurrent testing for PPID and ID are of interest and valuable given both endocrine disorders can coexist. Thus, a protocol that combinesusing the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimula-tion test and the OST test is a practical means; however,until recently, it was not known if one test would impactresults of the other or vice versa. A recent study wasconducted to investigate these questions in a prospectiverandomized placebo-controlled, crossover 3 OST protocols: OST alone, TRH OST (TRH + OST), and placebo followed by OST(placebo + OST) in horses. 10The results of this study f o u n dn od i f f e r e n c ei ni n s u l i nr e s p o n s e st ot h eO S T when performing the TRH stimulation test prior to the OST.10Thus, a practical protocol for diagnosing PPID and ID can utilize the TRH stimulation testprior to the OST on the same day of testing and nothave an impact on the OST results. 6. Discussion In fed vs. fasted states, insulin responses to the OST c a nd i f f e r ,b u tm o r es oi np o n i e st h a nh o r s e s ;t h u s , results should not be used interchangeably. In monitor-ing ID status over time in the same animal, one shoulduse the same method of fed vs. fasted state. If the fedstate is used for the OST, it is important to take intoconsideration the type of forage, and ideally the equid ismaintained on a low-nonstructural-carbohydrate forageat the time of sampling. Recent research in horses indi- cates that a low-dose OST is appropriate for diagnosing ID, but a high-dose OST may be useful when equivocalcases are detected or in question. No differences ininsulin responses to the OST have been found whenusing Karo light corn syrup compared to Crown Lilywhite corn syrup. Season appears to impact insulinresponses; however, if the OST is used across sea-sons, the ID diagnosis is consistent. Regardless,one should be aware and consider season whenmonitoring and diagnosing ID. Concurrent testingusing the TRH stimulation prior to the OST does not seem to impact insulin responses and thus isa practical protocol to consider when endocrine screening for concurrent endocrine disorders of PPID and ID.

Harris, MA, VetMB, PhD, DipECVCN, MRCVS, RCVS Specialist Clinical Nutrition (equine) Whilst animals with insulin dysregulation are often obese, they can be lean and therefore the dietary goal may be weight maintenance, gain, or loss. As the dietary insulin response is variable, and all the nutritional triggers are unknown, it is advisable to monitor the individual 's response to their spe- cic diet if it is considered essential to induce only a low insulin response. For some individuals, very low starch and sugar intakes per meal (< 0.1 g/kg body weight/meal) may be required to elicit such a low response. Repeat monitoring is key. Author 's address: Waltham Petcare Science Institute, Freeby Lane, (ID) re flects the presence of 1 or more of the following: basal or fasting hyperinsulin- emia, tissue insulin resistance, exaggerated to ingested nonstructural carbohydrates(i.e., starch, simple sugars, and fructans), exag-gerated insulin response to intravenously provided sim-ple sugars. 1ID is recognized as the main consistent feature of the equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) withan associated increased risk of laminitis.2,3In addition, as equids age, there is a tendency for them to showexaggerated postprandial insulin responses, especiallyto high-starch-providing diets. 4,5Not all EMS animals or aged ID animals, however, are obese and thereforenutritional management of an ID animal needs to takeinto account various factors including body conditionscore (BCS), age, and pituitary pars intermedia dysfunc-tion (PPID) status as discussed by Galinelli et al. 6ID status is not necessarily consistent and thereforemonitoring and repeat testing is essential, especially inanimals at increased risk. Recent research has high-lighted the fact that dietary recommendations for IDanimals cannot be based on those for non-ID, 7and this r e v i e wa d d r e s s e st h i sf a c t o ra sw e l la so t h e rc o n s i d e r a -tions when feeding the ID animal. This review alsoaddresses the request from equine practitioners formore information regarding the feeding of animals withinsulin dysregulation. 8 2. General Principles The primary goal in the feeding management ofhorses and ponies with ID (obese or nonobese) isavoidance of nonstructural starch + WSC [water-soluble carbohydrates:simple sugars and fructans]) that may increase risk oflaminitis, either by exacerbation of hyperinsulin-aemia 9or possibly via disturbances to the hindgut microbial community that may trigger events that NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 235MEDICINE II: ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, CATARACTS, AND ENDOCRINE DISEASElead to laminitis. For lean animals, the objective may be weight maintenance or even weight gain using feeds and forages that do not promote an exaggerated insulin response. An essential goal in the obese insulin dysre-gulated animal is to promote weight loss primarilythrough restricting energy intake supported byincreased energy expenditure. 10Further work, how- ever, is needed with respect to insulin sensitizingagents/dietary supplements in the horse.11The general guidelines for feeding management of insulin resistanthorses are included below. 1.The removal of cereal grains and high/moderate NSC sweet/complementary feeds(i.e., feedstuffs rich in starch and/or sugars)from the diet. The starch contents of oats, bar-ley, and corn are approximately 45% to 55%,60% to 65%, and 65% to 75% of the dry matter(DM), respectively, and some sweet feeds can beup to 50% NSC on a DM basis. 2.Feeding multiple small low NSC meals.Today, many complementary feeds are availablewith a low or restricted NSC content (e.g., <15%- 20% NSC) on a DM basis and are fed with theaim of producing a low or low-moderate postpran-dial insulin response. For some ID animals, suchfeeds fed in several small meals may be suitableespecially for animals considered at a lower lami-nitis risk. However, recent work has suggestedthat severely ID animals can have exaggeratedinsulinemic responses even to small intakesof complementary feeds with a thresholdbetween 0.08 and 0.15 g NSC/kg body weight(BW)/meal. 7Unlike for non-ID animals, this means that feeding relatively small amounts ofeven restricted (15% -20% NSC on a DM basis) may provoke an augmented insulin response insuch ID animals. Based on this work at themoment, severely ID animals should be re-stricted to 0.1 g NSC/kg BW/meal if a very lowpostprandial insulin response is required inanimals at high risk for laminitis. In older ani-mals with age-associated increases in insulinr e s p o n s e st h a ta r en o tc o n s i d e r e da th i g hr i s kof laminitis, then based on Jacob et al, 5the levels could be increased to ;0.5 g NSC/kg BW/meal in most individuals. Practically, this means feeding even the forage balancer type of complementary feeds in multiplesmall meals a day to some severely ID animals. 3.Restricted or zero access to pasture. Pasture a c c e s sm a yh a v et ob er e s t r i c t e dt oh e l pw i t h weight management and to prevent increases in plasma insulin concentrations. It is well appre-ciated that pasture turnout, particularly at cer-tain times of the year, can increase the risk oflaminitis. 12,13Pasture DM intake can reach up to 40% of daily DM intake and around 1% BWin DM within 3 hours and up to 5% BW DM/d insome individuals.14Especially with cool season grasses, pasture NSC content can be 30+% on aDM basis in some places at certain times of day.Pasture plants other than grasses can also havehigh NSC contents. 15Even with moderate NSC content, if there is a plentiful supply of plant ma-terial, the overall NSC intake, even within a rela-tively short period of time, can be quite high in some individuals. Certain individuals as men- tioned above may be particularly sensitive to evenrelatively low NSC intakes. Practically, it means for some individual animals, access to pasture has to be prevented or highly restricted,especially at certain times of the year. Strategies such asthe use of track systems, strip grazing, grazing muz-zles, and rotational grazing may need to be considereddepending on individual circumstances, but monitor-ing is essential. 16-18It is important to note that compensatory intake can occur in animals left graz-ing/foraging once any grazing muzzle has beenremoved, which may increase the risk of laminitis. 16,19 4.A diet based on grass hay (or hay substi-tute) with low ( <10% -12% DM) NSC content. It has been recommended that the minimum for-age DM intake for horses should be 1.5% BW ona DM basis and that where possible the energy content of the forage being fed should be chosen to ensure such an intake can be provided. 14,20 However, for the obese ID animal, even lowenergy forage ( <8 MJ/KG DM) may need to be restricted (short term) even lower to 1.25 or even1% BW DM. 10For the ID animal, it is recom- mended for the forage to have a low ( <10% -12% on a DM basis) NSC content. It is not possible to determine the NSC content of for- age by eye, although warm season hays, for example,may \"naturally \"have a lower NSC content than cool season grasses, but other factors may need to be consid-ered when choosing such hays. 21For example, teff hay has been found to be a source of the prohibited sub-stance synephrine in some instances. If it is essentialthat the individual is fed a low NSC forage, then analy-sis is essential (wet chemistry recommended) and/ormonitoring the insulin response to feeding the speci c batch of forage (and repeating with new batches, whichshould be introduced gradually). The author recom-mends that hay rather than haylage is fed to ID ani-mals, not least because haylage may promote a greaterinsulin response for a given level of consumed NSC inID animals. 14,22 Practically, hay soaking can result in around 40% loss of WSC content and therefore is a useful adjunct tomanaging both overweight animals and those prone tolaminitis. However, especially with cool season grasses,W S Cl o s si sh i g h l yv a r i a b l ea n dn o tp r e d i c t a b l e . 23In addition, it is important to remember that DM is alsolost with soaking, as well as some soluble protein andMEDICINE II: ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, CATARACTS, AND ENDOCRINE DISEASE 236 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSa proportion of certain vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Therefore, it is necessary to allow for 20% loss of DM with soaking when calculating hay intakes and importantly provide an appropriate forage bal- ancer, especially when feeding soaked forage but alsoif feeding a forage-based diet or less than recom- mended intakes of the core complementary feed.14As the postprandial insulin response is very variable, and all the nutritional triggers are unknown, it is advisa- ble to monitor repeatedly the individual animal 's response to both complementary feed and forage if it isconsidered essential to induce only a low insulin response to their diet. 5.Feeding for maintenance of bodyweightand BCS. Although many ID animals may be obese, some lean animals can be ID, especiallyolder animals. However, weight gain will typi-cally exacerbate insulin resistance, so it is im- portant to avoid overfeeding, and if the equid is obese, then it is important to initiate a pro-gram of weight management with, whenever possible, increased exercise as this may help improve insulin sensitivity. 10,24Regular eval- uation of bodyweight and/or BCS is the bestway to assess the adequacy or otherwise ofenergy provision. If additional energy is required, then it is important that the feed- stuffs provided support a low postprandial in-sulin response. Feeds to consider (depending on clinical situation) include supplemental vegetable oil and/or feeding highly digestible ber sources (e.g., soaked unmolassed sugar beet; soya hulls) and/or a low-starch and sugar commercial forti ed complementary feed, which ideally has been shown to producein target animals a low postprandial glucose/insulin response. If vegetable oil is to be added to the existing low NSC forti ed ration (corn and soy oils are typically used), it needs to be fresh, nonrancid, and introduced gradually (starting around 30 -50 mL/500 kg horse once daily and increasing over 7 -21 days). Fecal qual- ity should be monitored and reassessment made ifthere is evidence of, for example, steatorrhea or issues with palatability. One standard cup (about 225 mL or 210 g) of vegetable oil provides ;7 MJ of digestible energy, and depending on energy requirements, \u00bd to 1 cup of oil can be fed once or twice daily (up to a maxi- mum of ;1 mL oil/1 kg bodyweight without specialist nutritional consideration). Supplemental antioxidant (1-2 IU vitamin E per 1 mL of added oil) should be provided. Calcium-supplemented stabilized rice bran(;20% fat) or commercial forti ed high vegetable fat/ oil low NSC diets are alternatives. 6.Exercise. Increasing free and/or structured exer- cise, based on veterinary advice, may help limitmuscle loss associated with calorie-restricted diets, and can have an anti-in flammatory effect, andeven at relatively low intensities and duration (e.g., working trot for 15 minutes) can promote improved insulin sensitivity. 24,25 Consideration should be given to increasing the num- ber, length, or intensity of exercise occasions, or chang- ing the type of structured activity (riding/lunging, etc.), as well prolonging free activity in the paddock. Tracksystems or similar may be a solution for some but con- sideration of land suitability and so forth is required. 3. Conclusion It is important when managing an ID animal to de- velop a targeted nutrition (and exercise) plan for that individual animal and its clinical needs that considers the available complementary feeds/forages as well asfacility/time, constraints of the owner/carer, and so on. Monitoring is essential, as is good communication between the veterinarian and the owner/carer.

Authors 'address: Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, 2015 SW 16th Avenue, Gainesville, FL 32608; e-mail: baucka@u Introduction Right dorsal colitis is a disease with high morbidity and variable response to treatment. Horses treatedwith phenylbutazone (PBZ) are at greatest risk.Objectives of this study were to characterize bicar-bonate (HCO 3-) secretion in equine colon ex vivo and to determine the effect of PBZ on this secretion. Materials and Methods Mucosa was collected from anesthetized horses(n = 10) to measure HCO 3-secretion ex vivo (pH Stat Method). The effect of PBZ on HCO 3-secretion was studied in 4 horses. Results Secretion of HCO 3-was considerably greater in the RDC ( P<.05) than the RVC and involved different transport mechanisms. The primary transporter ofHCO 3-in the RDC was consistent with cystic bro- sis regulator probably through inhibition of CFTR. Discussion As in other species, secretion of HCO 3-in the RDC could protect mucosa from injury caused by intensemicrobial production of short-chain fatty 3-and thereby cause right dor- sal colitis. Consequently, PBZ-induced right dorsalcolitis could be similar to cystic brosis in human and rodent models. These ndings reveal a poten- tial treatment for right dorsal colitis through die-tary or other methods of delivering buffer to theRDC.

Introduction For those graduating from a U.S. veterinary school in 2020, the mean reported debt for those with stu- dent loans was about $189,000. Forty-eight percent of those report debt above $200,000, with a growingnumber of graduates in the $300,000 and $400,000ranges. 1Student debt continues to grow at a rate faster than starting incomes. Disparities betweenstudent debt and starting income are particularlyproblematic for equine practitioners who report thelowest starting salaries, about $59,000 for 2020 grad- uates, 1where choosing an appropriate repayment strategy is imperative. This article will discuss how to analyze student loans and the assorted options available, including income-driven repayment (IDR) plans2and the as- sociated side effects of any student loan repaymentstrategy. The objectives are listed below: \u0081Know your student debt and repayment options\u0081Know the challenges and side effects of various repayment strategies \u0081Craft a student loan strategy to match your stu- dent debt to income ratio \u0081Think beyond student loans to nancial wellness 2. Solution For the individual borrower, the most important fac- tor for determining a student loan repayment strategyis their student debt to income ratio. The quickestw a yt oc a l c u l a t es t u d e n td e b tt oi n c o m er a t i oi st otake annual taxable income and divide it by the totalstudent debt balance. Student debt to income ratios less than one favor more traditional repayment methods and strategies.Student debt to income ratios greater than one favorIDR strategies. Most veterinarians fall into the latterscenario, particularly in the early years after school.Knowing how to navigate the options available can NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 245BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONERsignicantly reduce the nancial and mental distress of student loans. 3. Results Consider the case of a 2022 graduate veterinarian pursuing equine practice in Texas. The equine practi- tioner graduates with $200,000 of federal studentdebt with an average interest rate of 5.75%. She is single with a starting income of $60,000/year, increas- ing to $85,000 in year two, and $100,000 in yearthree. 4After year three, an increase of 3% per year will be applied. Her starting student debt to income ratio is 3.3, decreasing to about 2.3 in year two, and about 2 inyear three. With a student debt to income ratio consis- tently above one for the rst three years after gradua- tion, a federal IDR plan like Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) can help to minimize nancial risk, maximize cash flow, and often lower the total repayment cost. A st h en a m ei m p l i e s ,t h ep a y m e n ti saf u n c t i o no fincome, taxable income speci cally. As income goes up, the payment increases. If income goes down, the payment decreases. IDR requires proof of taxable income and family size at least annually. A variable payment structure can make interpret- ing IDR plans dif cult. Using a tool like the VINFoundation Student Debt Center and Student Loan Repayment Simulator can help to compare projected IDR costs vs. traditional time-driven plans. Figure 1 illustrates a comparison of repayment projections forthis case. 5 The advantage of IDR in the early years of repay- ment are the signi cantly reduced minimum monthly payments as compared to a time-driven plan. A lowermonthly payment increases cash flow to help the vet- erinarian build a nancial wellness plan, including an emergency fund, retirement plan, home down pay-ment, practice start-up/buy- in, etc. Student loan repayment flexibility is more important than reducing the total repayment cost. Sacri cing crit- ical areas of nancial wellness in favor of higher stu- dent loan payments can put the recent graduateveterinarian further behind. Reviewing the Loan Repayment Summary results in Fig 1, the minimum monthly payment due using an IDR plan like PAYE is$330/month as compared to a minimum payment of$2,195/month using a standard 10-year repaymentplan. Over the rst two years of repayment, PAYE will free up more than $40,000 in cash flow, and nearly $100,000 the rstve years of repayment. Working down the Loan Repayment Summary table in Figure 1, there is a forgiven balance projected with Fig. 1. Loan repayment summary table.BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER 246 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSPAYE and a slightly higher total cost as compared to the Standard 10-year repayment plan. Forgiveness isboth a feature and a side effect with IDR. Borrowerscan make payments based on their taxable income for a maximum number of years. If they reach the maxi- mum repayment period (20 years for PAYE) and stillhave a balance remaining, then the rest of the balanceis forgiven. Forgiven debt can be treated as taxableincome. If a borrower is projected to reach forgiveness,then a forgiveness savings plan is necessary to coverany anticipated tax due on forgiven debt. The VIN Foundation Student Loan Repayment Simulator has a Forgiveness Planning Module to helpveterinarians calculate the potential costs of the tax andhow to save for the expense. Figure 2 illustrates the for-giveness plan for the 2022 graduate veterinarian. With a projected tax rate of 30% on the forgiven stu- dent debt balance, this new graduate veterinarianmay owe $67,500 to the Internal Revenue Servicewhen she reaches forgiveness 20 years after startingrepayment in PAYE. In order to prepare for that expense, she can save $206/month in some combina- tion of accounts/investments that will return an aver-age of 3% per year. Doing so will provide enough tocover the tax and will also reduce her total projectedrepayment costs by about $18,000. Now her projectedPAYE repayment strategy is less than a standard 10-year plan.Figure 2 also shows an \"Effective Interest Rate \"of 1.36% per year. Although the stated interest rate for this simulation is 5.75%, with a total PAYE repay-ment cost of $254,272 over 20 years on $200,000 bor-rowed, she would pay $54,272 of interest over20 years of repayment, or an 1.36% effective interest per year for the duration of PAYE repayment. Also consider that a large portion will be paid in thefuture when her income will likely be higher, and thevalue of the dollars used to pay the loan will be lowerdue to the time-value of money. The effective interestrate can be particularly helpful for evaluating pri- vate loan re nance offers and time-driven repayment plans. 4. Discussion Veterinarians with student loans can choose from a va-riety of student loan repayment strategies. Choosing a strategy that minimizes risk, maximizes cash flow, and reduces total loan repayment costs is the goal. For mostrecent graduate veterinarians or any veterinarian with federal student loans and a student debt to income ratio greater than one, IDR can obtain that goal. However, IDR is not for everyone. The lower mo- nthly payments and potential forgiveness tax liabil-ity can result in a growing loan balance and future Fig. 2. Forgiveness planning module.BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 247stress that some borrowers avoid by choosing time- driven repayment strategies. Any repayment pathway can work. Knowing all the options available can help veterinarians navigateperiods of uncertainty or reach nancial goals regard- less of their student loan balance. There are pros and cons associated with any repay- ment strategy. Time-driven strategies are simpler butr e q u i r em o r ec a s h flow and increase repayment risk. IDR strategies are more complex but can increasecashflow and decrease repayment risk. The best strategies weigh the pros and cons, ideally applying numerical values and nancial principals to the decisions. Factors beyond student loan monthlypayments, interest rates, and total repayment costsalso come into play. Short and long-term tax andnancial planning can also play signi cant roles in a student loan repayment strategy. For example,aggressive student loan repayment strategies mayeliminate student loans faster, but they can alsoresult in higher taxes paid and postponement of shortand long-term savings. IDR strategies can promotelong-term savings and near-term wealth building thatcan decrease taxes as well as student loan repaymentcosts. However, the duration of repayment and poten-tial tax planning for student loan forgiveness are alsopart of IDR strategies. IDR can also become morecomplicated for married couples, particularly marriedcouples living in community property states. Oft-entimes, it can make nancial sense for married cou- ples to le their taxes separately when using an IDR plan because the student loan repayment savings aresignicantly greater than the tax savings realized by ling jointly. The tax code nancially incentivizes get- ting married, having children, and ling your tax returns jointly. Sometimes, the student loan repay-ment incentives can discourage marriage or encour- ageling separately from a spouse, while still havingchildren. The task is to see which combination of taxling status and income-driven repayment option will help the equine practitioner keep more of theirincome. A sound knowledge of student loan repayment options, tax incentives, and available resources can help to improve loan repayment success.

Introduction Student loan debt for veterinary graduates is a prob- lem that isn 't going away anytime soon. In fact, those veterinarians graduating in 2020 with educationaldebt had on average $188,853 in student debt.1This is over a 3-fold increase from those graduating 20 yearsago who had an average debt load of about $61,000.2 Unfortunately, starting salaries have not increased ata comparable rate. This has resulted in a debt-to-income ratio of 2.6 that far exceeds the 1.6 consideredreasonable for professionals. 1 Dave Ramsey is a name that has been around in thenancial advisory world since 1992. After recover- ing from his own series of catastrophic nancial mistakes, Dave Ramsey developed his money man-agement plan, The 7 Baby Steps, to help people savefor emergencies, pay off debt, and build wealth. Thegoal of his plan is to prevent others from experiencingthe same nancial loss he had by giving them the nec- essary tools to work toward nancial freedom. 3This plan involves asking participants to make drastic cutsto their spending, nd ways to increase their income,and strictly adhere to a budget for as long as it takes to pay off their debt. For a veterinarian with a highstudent debt load, this may take many years. Is his plan for everyone in every situation? No, not necessarily. Could it be for you? Yes, if you want it tobe. The Dave Ramsey plan works best for motivatedand willing participants. It 's hard to stay the course when you feel like you 're being forced to participate. You don 't have to be a recent graduate to start this program, although the sooner you start, the less inter- est you 'll have to pay in the long run. This program can also be completed by those that are single or in a partnership, and those with or without children. Only you can decide if it 'sr i g h tf o ry o u . This paper will focus on how to utilize Baby Steps 1 and 2 to pay off student debt. Baby Steps 3 to 7 focus on how to save and build wealth once you 've become debt free. Information regarding all 7 Baby Steps canbe found at https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps. Therst baby step of Dave Ramsey 'sp l a ni st oc r e - ate an emergency fund of $1000. Not a penny moreand not a penny less. The purpose of this fund is to NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 249BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONERcover unexpected life events, not to cover an overdrawn checking account or to fund a vacation. If your current savings account contains more than $1000, all surplus funds will be applied to your debt in Baby Step 2. Ifyou do not have $1000 in savings, you will contributeall additional income to the emergency fund until itreaches a total of $1000. 4 T h es e c o n db a b ys t e po ft h eD a v eR a m s e yp l a ni st o pay off all debt (except a mortgage on your home)using the debt snowball method. Using the snowballmethod means that you will focus any extra incomeon the smallest debt rst while paying the minimum payments on everything else. Once the smallest debtis paid off, you will take that payment and apply it tothe next smallest debt and so on until all debt is paidoff. 4The reason for using the snowball method versus starting with the high interest rate debt rst (also known as the avalanche method) is simple. The intentof the snowball method is to knock out numerous small debts upfront, activating our reward system and releasing dopamine \u2014one of our feel-good neuro- transmitter. Feeling good about what we 've done increases the likelihood of repeating this behavior,keeping us motivated to play the long game. 2 In the author 's experience (a 2011 graduate), all student loans were assigned the same interest rate.This may not be the case for all individuals. In thelast 15 years, xed interest rates for Federal Stafford Unsubsidized Loans have varied from as high as6.8% (2006 -2013) to as low as 2.75% (2020- 2021). 5If you have student loans with variable interest rates,paying them off utilizing the avalanche method mayresult in less interest paid over time. However, youmay not receive the same motivating psychologicalbenets discussed above. Baby Step 2 begins by making a list of all debt, including car loans, credit cards, student loans, and any other consumer debt from smallest to largest, regardless of interest rate. 4Sitting down and listing all of your debt can seem like a daunting task. Thetotal can add up very quickly, reaching a sum forwhich a payoff seems unattainable. But don 'tb ed i s - couraged. The only way to xt h ep r o b l e mi st oh a v ea clear understanding of what the issue looks like anddevelop actionable steps to rectify it. Once a list of debts has been made, take a look at how money is being spent. That means developing amonthly budget. 4A budget allows you to organize, track, and be accountable for your income and spend-ing habits. If you 're in partnership, working on a budget together enables you to decide if you 're able to l i v eo f fo n ep e r s o n 's income and apply the other 's income toward debt. Having a visual representa-tion of your money through your budget highlights where you 're overspending and where you can afford to cut back on your expenses. Spending $25 to $50 each time you go to the grocery store maynot seem like a lot until you see the sum of $500spent for one person 's needs. A helpful tip for stay- ing on budget is using the \"envelope method. \" This means that for different categories, such asgroceries and entertainment, the allotted monthly budget is held in an envelope in the form of cash. Onlyhaving cash on hand to spend, without the backup ofa credit card, makes you more mindful of your spend-ing. When it' s gone, you cannot spend more. Also, budgeting apps (such as GoodBudget, YNAB, and EveryDollar) can help you stay organized and on- track by enabling transactions to be entered at thetime of purchase or downloaded from your bank, alert-ing you to the remaining funds available, and compar-ing your spending habits from month to month. Paying off a large sum of debt often requires that y o um a k es o m ed r a s t i cc h a n g e st oi n c r e a s et h eo v e r a l l amount of money available to pay toward the balance. T h e r ea r et w ow a y st o nd additional money. First, take a look at your budget. Decreasing your overallmonthly expenditures will enable you to make themost of your current paycheck. Second, increase youroverall income by nding additional income sources. Below are suggestions for accomplishing both. Suggestions for ways to decrease overall monthly expenses are listed below: \u0081Ditch personal credit cards and go cash only. \u0081Utilize cash back from business credit cards to pay for personal items. \u0081Cut out cable services and utilize less expensivestreaming options. \u0081Reduce the cost of internet services (most pro-viders allow a yearly price reduction). \u0081Price shop for cell phone service. If you have per-mission to utilize your business phone for perso- nal use, consider canceling your personal phone. \u0081Buy used and if buying new, only do so if you cannd a sale or a coupon. \u0081Rent books, audiobooks, and movies for free atthe library. \u0081Find other cheap or free entertainment optionsin your local community. \u0081Pause or discontinue subscriptions and member-ships. \u0081Trade babysitting with another family. \u0081Make coffee and meals at home (no takeout oreating out). \u0081Make a grocery list or buy groceries online toreduce the likelihood of impulse buying. \u0081Contact credit card companies about waivingand/or lowering interest rates. \u0081Eliminate or reduce car payments by purchas- ing a less expensive vehicle. \u0081Pause retirement and savings investments. \u0081Downsize your home or rental unit. Options for increasing your overall income: \u0081Sell anything and everything you have no attachment to. If you haven 't used or worn it in the last year, sell it.BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER 250 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS\u0081Sell your home or other real estate assets. \u0081Become a practice owner. \u0081Increase overall pricing and collect all accounts receivable. \u0081For associates \u2014Secure compensation for 100% of the emergency fee and then offer to takeadditional emergency coverage or nd other ways to increase your overall production. \u0081Utilize employer tax-exempt student loan repay-ment contributions up to 2025. state-sponsored relief programs for veterinarians \u2014may offer up to $25,000/year. \u0081Work vaccine clinics or small animal emergencyshifts. \u0081Teach at a local college or technical school. \u0081Accept and seek out industry speaking or writ-ing opportunities. \u0081Take paid online surveys (both industry spon-sored and not). \u0081Pet sit or babysit. \u0081Turn your creative outlet into money by sellingon Etsy or the Facebook group Vetsy. 2. Summary Whether utilizing the method highlighted here or another option, making accelerated payments towardstudent debt is a commitment that requires unwaver-ing dedication and sacri ce. It invites you to look at things differently and consider where you placevalue. Connection with family, friends, animals, andnature may become more important than the thingsthat can be bought. You may develop a greater abilityto decipher what is truly needed versus what is sim-ply wanted in the fleeting moment. And most importantly, you will likely develop a rm under- standing of \"your why. \"What does paying off edu- cational debt mean for you? What life could you have if you were no longer in debt? Where are the places you could go, the things you could see, and the people you could meet if you weren 'tt i e dd o w n by your debt? Who could you help if you had more time and money to spare? The answers to these questions will help you stay on the course to nan- cial freedom.

Introduction Over the past 2 decades, fewer new graduates are entering equine private practice and nearly half havelet their American Association of Equine Practitioners(AAEP) membership lapse by the fth year after grad- uation, suggesting a departure from the sector. 1 According to the 2021 American Veterinary MedicalAssociation (AVMA) Report on the Economic State ofthe Veterinary Profession, educational debt averaged$188,853 for the 83% of 2020 graduates with debt,which may be a factor in the lack of retention in theeld. 2Due to many AAEP members nearing retire- ment, with 46% currently over the age of 50, theremay be a shortfall in veterinarians to care for ournation 'sh o r s e si nt h en e a rf u t u r ei fm o r ep r a c t i t i o n e r s cannot be attracted and retained. Finding ways toincrease equine practitioners 'total income may help with this goal. Practice ownership is one of the most reliable of ways to increase pay. Practice ownership generallysignicantly increases a veterinarian 'st o t a li n c o m e because on top of payment for work as a horse doctor,there is a payment for being a business owner \u2014his orher share of the pro ts. Most veterinary practices are quite pro table if reasonable business management practices are in place. Although most veterinarianshave little business education, there are a number ofavenues to increase acumen, including networkinggroups, business seminars, traditional business schoolclasses, and AAEP educational sessions. 2. Discussion Many years ago, most veterinary practices were smalland owned by the practitioners working in the rm. They typically saw all species of animals, with farmanimals taking priority, though a few practitionersconcentrated on pet animals or equines. When newassociates were hired, they were assessed for compati-bility and then, within a few years, offered partner-ship in the practice. There was a collegiality betweenpractices that was professional and expected. The ma-jority of veterinarians, especially those in large-ani-mal and equine practice, were male. In the presenttime, the majority of equine practices continue tobe small. According to the AVMA AAEP EquineEconomic Survey, 53% of equine practices in the NOTES 252 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONERUnited States have 2 full-time equivalent veterinar- ians or fewer.1 Beginning in the late 1990s, the pendulum began to swing to veterinary school classes having a ma-jority of female students. In 2019, the size of the nation' s active veterinary workforce was approxi- mately 116,000 members, of whom 63% were female,marking a 12% increase in women veterinarians over the previous decade. 3Some of these women were interested in equine practice and joined the profes-sion as associates. In about 2017, females became the majority in equine private practice (Fig. 1). They were and still are typically offered salaries lower than those offered to males. In the 2016 AVMA AAEP Equine Economic Impact Study, starting sal- aries in the equine veterinary eld lagged behind those offered in other types of private practice.AVMA respondents (almost exclusively working in companion animal practices) reported higher postin- ternship salaries than equine respondents on aver- age, except for male equine respondents who graduated in the period 2012 to 2016; these gradu- ates reported an average starting salary of $61,867 compared to AVMA males, who reported $61,810. In contrast, female equine respondents who graduated from 2012 to 2016 reported an average starting sal- ary of $51,109 compared to AVMA females, who reported $70,452. When considering these rst-year salaries offered to equine practitioners after a 1-yearinternship, there was a $10,000 difference between the males and females, with males earning $61,867 and women earning $51,109. 1This gender wage gap has not improved but instead appears to have wors-ened, according to the 2020 AVMA Senior Survey, which reported that the four male veterinary school graduates entering equine practice without an intern- ship were offered an average salary of $75,000, while the 26 females entering were offered a mean of $56,000.4 As the demographic changes to primarily female graduates occurred, equine practice owners increas-ingly declined to add associates as partners, some- times citing their belief that interest in ownership was no longer present among associates.5Several studies refute that perception. Results from a surveyreported at the 2016 AAEP Annual Convention statedthat 76% of associates working at group practices of 7 or more veterinarians were interested in ownership, and 84% of those working in group practices with 2 to 6 veterinarians felt likewise.5The 2016 AVMA AAEP Equine Economic Impact Study reported that abouthalf (50.4%) of respondents identifying as equine reliefveterinarians and associates (58.7% of males and48.0% of females) were interested in practice owner-ship, a number almost twice as high as the generalveterinary (21.7%) (primarily companion animal)respondent population (34.0% of males and 18.7% offemales). In addition to those that de nitely desired ownership, 18.7% of female and 12.7% of male AAEPrespondents were unsure if they wanted to buy sharesor obtain ownership. Additively, this represents71.4% of male and 66.7% of female respondents poten-tially seeking to be future equine practice owners.Among the AAEP sample, only 28.6% of malerespondents and 33.3% of female respondents stated they were not interested in buying shares or owner- ship of a practice. 1 In 2020, a study reported that nearly 25% of respondents at larger practices (>4 doctors) had leftthe equine space, the largest percentage among thedifferent practice sizes. In contrast, only about 10%of those in solo practices left the industry. 6Solo prac- tice allows veterinarians to unilaterally set theirown boundaries, create a practice culture in align-ment with their values, and make decisions abouthow the practice will evolve. Possibly a solo practiceowner feels more obligated to stay in practice due tothe feeling of obligation to their clients. One mightalso wonder if the larger practices that are experienc-ing more departures have more traditional work mod-els that fail to accommodate the needs of womenveterinarians. Because they often have different prior- ities than previous generations of veterinarians, mil- lennials may be choosing workplaces that t the lives they want, or opening their own practices, ratherthan trying to conform to old models. In order toretain equine practitioners in equine practice, maybepractice ownership is one of the answers. While many of the largest equine practices in the United States are selling to corporate consolidators ornational groups, it is good to remember that whenincluding all types of veterinary practices, whichmeans predominantly companion animal practices,large corporate groups currently represent less than25% of all practices in the United States. Data fromthe 2016 AVMA AAEP Equine Economic ImpactStudy reported that 53% of equine practices have 2full-time equivalent veterinarians or fewer, so the ma-jority are quite small. 1More than 3000 new veteri- nary practices opened between 2005 and 2017,according to US Census Bureau data, and the totalnumber of practices was estimated to be around32,000 in 2019, 3so clearly veterinarians continue to possess an entrepreneurial spirit. According to Frederic Ouedraogo, PhD, AVMA as- sistant director of economics, the percentage of privatepractitioners who are owners declined from 43% in Fig. 1. AVMA gender demographics of equine private practice 2013 to 2020.BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 2532007 to 33% in 2019. Practice ownership or co-owner- ship is associated with several bene ts, including higher lifetime earnings and improved work-lifebalance, he noted. \"It's important that we start as a profession to think about ways to promote and encour-age ownership,\" Dr. Ouedraogo said. \"One way to do Fig. 2. ABC equine pro t & loss statement.BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER 254 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSthat is to include business management or startup nance classes in our curriculum. Another way is to advocate for government support to new DVM gradu-ates who want to start a new business. It can be simi-lar to the loan repayment program or any otherincentives. \"Men currently make up the majority of private practice owners, but the percentage of womenowners is increasing, shifting from 29% of the total in2007 to 41% in 2019. By 2028, the majority of USpractice owners will be women, he said. 3 In equine practice, in the 2016 AVMA AAEP Equine Economic Impact Study, practice owners,numbering 334, accounted for 54.3% of the AAEPrespondents, with 60% of owners male and 40%female. Of the respondents who were practice own-ers, 49.7% were sole proprietors, 36.5% were a part-ner/shareholder in an S-Corp or C-Corp, and 13.8%were a partner in a Limited Liability Corporation(LLC) or other type of practice ownership structure. 1 Encouraging practice ownership in equine practice could help retain equine veterinarians. Average am-bulatory net income from operations before deprecia-tion and amortization was reported in 2020 as 13.5%. 7 The author commonly sees small ambulatory prac-tices with EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,Depreciation and Amortization) of 20% or more.While this ordinary pro tm a yb er e d u c e da f t e rp a y - ment of principal and interest on loan obligations, itcan still amount to a generous amount of additionalcompensation. Utilizing computed benchmarks for expenses for a small (2 doctors or fewer) equine ambulatory practice(author calculation from compilation of 1-2 DVM cli-entnancial records), one can visualize the potential nancial bene t of ownership (Fig. 2). With 2 doctors contributing to total practice revenue of $825,000, andCost of Professional Services (COPS) totaling 24.33% of revenue, a gross pro t of $624,250 remains. When all expenses including COPS ($619,925) are sub- tracted from income, this leaves $205,075 in EBITDA.After accounting for loan payments for a $60,000truck nanced over 60 months at 4% and a $100,000 equipment loan nanced over 120 months at 4%, there still remains $179,093 to be distributed to the ownersin accordance with their share of ownership in addi-tion to their salary for effort as veterinarians($100,000 each, based on 25% of their service revenueproduction). This totals $189,547 in compensation foreach of 2 partners in this practice if they each own50%. If this practice had just 1 owner and an associ-ate, rather than 2 partners, and each earned servicerevenue of $400,000 for the practice, the associatewould have total compensation of $100,000. The sole owner would have compensation of $100,000 + $179,093, or $279,093. If the sole owner of the prac-tice had no associate but instead utilized the 2 tech-nicians to increase his or her ef ciency and produced $800,000 single-handedly, the veterinarian wouldhave total compensation of more than $379,093($200,000 + $179,093), because expenses would bereduced due to less costs for licenses, memberships,continuing education, vehicle costs, professional liability insurance, and bene ts. Business owners earn so much more than employ- ees because the owners are taking risks in owning abusiness. While associates can go home at night with-out worrying whether the cash flow will be suf cient to meet payroll and other monthly obligations, orwhether the horse owner whose horse fell down while sedated will sue the business, or whether the recep- tionist is going to give her notice tomorrow, the prac- tice owner may lose sleep over these concerns. A practice owner could risk bankruptcy if the economy sinks into recession and he or she cannot then make loan payments. Business owners are willing to a s s u m et h e s eb u r d e n so fr i s kb e c a u s et h e yh a v et h e opportunity to make pro t, which can be substantial. One of the reasons corporate consolidators are sointerested in investing in veterinary practices is that they generally produce strong, consistent pro ts. However, practice ownership is not only about mon- etary gains. Owners can also grow their practices inthe direction of their vision for their careers and lives, make the decisions on services offered and the boun- daries set, and create a culture that is an expression of their values. They can limit their services to an area of interest, limit their growth to a select group of compatible clients, or limit their work hours to t their other priorities. Their practice is shaped by theirchoices, and they have control over how life as an equine veterinarian looks. Because the current paradigms of the equine veteri- nary profession are not compatible with attractingand retaining equine veterinarians, it is sensible that some are seeking to shape their futures through prac- tice ownership. Because of the differing priorities of the next generation of horse doctors, ownershipshares in existing practices may not be attractive unless these individuals have agency to make changes, have choices, and exert control over their professional lives. Consequently, if existing practice owners seeking a sale at retirement wish to engage associates as partners, it is the author' so p i n i o nt h a t this effort should occur early in the associate 's tenure, after 2 to 5 years of service that ensures compatible values, with the offer of a meaningful percentage of ownership and control. Minor pro t sharing will likely not be satisfactory to meet the more pressing needs ofyounger practitioners, who seek to shift the tradi- tional mores of equine practice. Embracing the change desired by new partners is important in attracting them to stay in existing practices. 3. Conclusion Whereas there are inherent risks and management tasks to attend to as a business owner, the advantages over employment as an associate are signi cant and far beyond the monetary. Practice ownership providesfreedom to pursue a professional as well as personal vision for one 's life, along with providing marked nancial bene ts.

Introduction For the past decade, declining numbers of veteri- nary graduates have accepted positions in equineprivate practice directly after graduation,1and about half no longer belong to the AAEP within 5years of their graduation.1Because companion ani- mal exclusive positions offer substantially higher salaries than equine positions,2these decisions could be related to graduates 'obligations to pay high educational debt, which averaged $188,853 for the 83% of 2020 graduates with debt, accordingto the 2021 AVMA Report on the Economic State ofthe Veterinary Profession. 2 In the 2016 AVMA AAEP Equine Economic Study, it was reported that about half of AAEPmember equine associate and relief veterinarianrespondents (58.7% of males and 48.0% of females)were interested in practice ownership, which was ahigher percentage than the number of AVMArespondents who reported desire for ownership inthe AVMA 2016 Census Study of the mostly com-panion animal membership, where 34.0% of malesand 18.7% of females indicated they were in themarket to become a practice owner. 1Whenexamining practice size, the 2016 AVMA AAEP Equine Economic Study reported that 52.8% of practices had 2 full-time equivalent veterinarians or less.1In 2020, a study reported that nearly 25% of respondents at larger practices (>4 doctors) had left or de nitely had decided to leave equine prac- tice compared to only about 10% of those respond-ents in solo practices who said the same.3Because desire for practice ownership appears to be higher among equine veterinarians than those in the com- panion animal sector, and those in small practices appear less likely to have left or to have de nitely decided to leave equine practice, to keep more equine practitioners in equine practice, maybe solo or small practice ownership is one of the answers. There are distinct nancial advantages to prac- tice ownership, as the owner has compensation that includes pro ts as well as salary for their efforts as a veterinarian. In addition, the ability to be the decision maker allows a veterinarian to build a career that matches their values, aspira- tions, and skillset. Being the owner of a practicemay allow the opportunity to achieve increased personal career satisfaction and nancial bene ts that make equine practice a more sustainable NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 257BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONERchoice for the individual. Although there are cer- tainly increased responsibilities with small busi- ness ownership, it is the authors 'opinion that the rewards far exceed the challenges. 2. Discussion While starting an ambulatory equine practice may not be as substantial an undertaking as launching a brick- and-mortar practice, lack of business knowledge mayprevent a veterinarian from proceeding with con dence. Seeking participation in a business education network-ing group can assist veterinarians in understandingpractice nances, marketing strategies, and other busi- ness management aspects. 4Alternatively, an experi- enced practice owner could provide business mentorshipto a less-experienced veterinarian to give back to the pro-fession and assist a new generation of equine doctors. An established equine practice owner might iden- tify a talented young veterinarian that is poised toleave equine practice and help them establish a pathto stay in the profession. That path could lead to prac-tice ownership. Such a path, taken by one of the authors (Guardia), is herein described. The mentor veterinarian would begin the process by helping the mentee to form a professional and personal vision, understand their core values, and articulate a practice mission. Next, the established practice owner would provide a list of necessarytasks to open the practice, such as researching thedemographics in the chosen practice area, estab- lishing a permanent address, naming the practice, and planning the service offerings. The establishedpractice owner then would add the \"Doing Business As,\"or DBA, to his or her pre-existing veterinary business. This new practice satellite might be many miles away from the parent practice. Additional items the mentor might assist the mentee with include setting up accounts at distribu-tors, laboratories, banks, and service providers such asGlobal Vet Link for federal and state health docu-ments. Also, advice might be given for practice creditcard applications, forming accounts with shippingrms, obtaining a DEA license, registering radiology equipment with the State Department of Health andSafety, obtaining dosimeter badges, and acquiring nec-essary equipment. To populate the new practice web-site and social media, the established practice ownermight recommend a professional photography session. The mentor might provide diagnostic equipment such as a digital radiography unit, an x-ray generator,and an ultrasound, as well as other necessary equip-ment, and create a payment plan for the new practiceto pay off these purchases over several years. A writ-ten agreement might be formalized to have the newpractice transferred to the mentee as a vested pur- chase over a certain number of years. The established practice owner might pay the mentee a base salary, ora percentage of gross pro t, whichever was greater. After the initial 12-month period, the vesting processcould allow a certain percentage per year ownershipshare with resultant pro t sharing. For example, in a 5-year vested purchase of 50% of the ownership of thepractice, in months 13 to 24, the mentee could receivea 10% net pro t share and hold 10% equity, followed Fig. 1. Financial results of mentor mentee vested purchase of practice over 5 years.BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER 258 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSby a 20% pro t share and 20% equity the following year, with a 50% ownership share being obtained by the end of the fth year. With this type of vested purchase agreement, at the end of the fth year, the mentee would own 5 0 %o ft h ep r a c t i c ea n dw o u l db eg i v e nt h eo p p o r - tunity to purchase the remaining 50% from the mentor. An independent practice evaluation wouldthen be performed to determine the current value o ft h ep r a c t i c ea tt h et i m eo ft h et r a n s i t i o n .B a s e d on that evaluation, a buy-out payment plan could be agreed upon. An amortized loan at a xed inter- est rate to be paid off over 10 years might be heldby the mentor for the purchase of the remaining 50% of the practice. If the practice location waschosen carefully where there was a strong demand for the services that the new practice was provid- ing and the need for an additional provider, and the mentee veterinarian was a motivated individ- ual, practice gross revenue might increase robustly each year. If the mentor invested $50,000 in used equipment to provide to the mentee, and the menteeprovided a practice vehicle, both would be materi- ally invested. If benchmark averages for practice expenses were achieved, 6t h em e n t e ew a sp a i da base salary of $60,000 or 25% of gross pro t, which- ever was higher, and the mentee did not utilizeemployees initially, a small net pro t could be real- ized in year 1 (Fig. 1). In this example, the mentormight have an investment in providing cash flow to pay the base salary initially until the revenuestream became stronger, but even in the rst year of this sample case, revenue would cover this byyear end. During the rst several years of the prac- tice, seasonality or irregularity of revenue production might create the need for cash flow supplementation, but a positive net income could be realized each yearin this illustration.3. Conclusion Whereas the nancial investment of a mentor might be important in providing equipment and cash flow to the new practice, the business guidance and the con dence that involvement of an established practitioner provides could be invaluable to the mentee. Established practiceowners who have the generosity and inclination toassist younger equine veterinarians in establishingpractices and reaping the bene ts of ownership can pro- vide an incentive for these practitioners to remain inequine practice and shape satisfying careers. Theseinvestors can realize a strong return on their invest-ment \u2014this return can be inspirational as well as nan- cial. For some, helping give a hand to those coming upbehind them may be more rewarding than the pro ts they earn in the arrangement.

Chalk, Jr., JD, CPA, CFP\u00ae Author 's address: 121 Countryside Southlake, TX 76092; e-mail: john@trinityportfolio.com. \u00a92022 AAEP. 1. Introduction Practice ownership is one of the best ways for veteri- narians to build wealth. Alongside practice ownership,there are other approaches and techniques availableto build wealth outside of one 's vocation. The diversi - cation of one' sa s s e t si saw o r t h w h i l ep u r s u i t .P e r i o d s of economic turbulence are inevitable and, as one 'sn e t worth grows, this pursuit of diversi cation becomes more and more fruitful. Many practice owners nd that virtually all of their wealth is locked up in theirpractice and, in turn, expose themselves to an avoid-able amount of risk. This presentation aims to provide simple steps one can take in the pursuit of a well-diversi ed net worth. Wealth accumulation does not require the expertise ofanancial services professional. While professional advice can certainly help, the objective is to highlight several practical methods that allow one to accumu- late and diversify collectively. Basics begin with spending less than you make, managing debt, and investing excess cash flow in a diverse manner. 2. Discussion Building wealth does not have to be a complicated pro-cess. There are actually some very simple rules tobuilding wealth. First, spend less than you make. Thisis easiest when score is kept around how much onespends, saves, and gives away. Virtually all moneythat leaves one 's possession can be put into one of these three categories. Second, debt management.Executed correctly, debt can help increase wealth; exe-cuted incorrectly, debt can become a major constrictorof cash flo w .T h i r d ,d i v e r s i cation. Diversifying invest- m e n t sa m o n gv a r i o u sa s s e tc l a s s e sw i l lh e l pa s s u r ec o n -tinued accumulation regardless of economic conditions. Keeping score is essential. Keeping score is simply the regular measurement of anything. In a game, it isthe score. If there is no score kept in a game, then noone knows whether they are winning or losing. Thesame is true in wealth accumulation. Scores should bekept in several areas so one can determine whetherwealth is accumulating or not. Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland is credited with saying, \"If you don 't know where you are going, any road will get you there. \"Keeping score will ensure one is on the right road and not just any road. The periodic record- ing of speci c amounts at the same time, year after year, will begin to tell a story. In time, this processwill help identify a signi cant aspect of one' snancial DNA. Unlike the human genome, altering one 'snan- cial DNA does not require a mutation. Rather, thealtering of one' snancial DNA is a gradual, consistent process of addressing one 's weaknesses and building on one' ss t r e n g t h s . 3. Spend/Save/Give \u0081Spend : Spending is one of the most common - nancial controversies within a family. Inevitably, in a typical couple, there is a \"spender \"and there is a \"saver. \"Unaddressed, these differing outlooks NOTES 260 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONERcan lead to con flicts regarding how much should be spent and how much should be saved. Most individuals that feel as though they are spendingtoo much do not adhere to a set saving or givinggoal. The reprioritization and implementation ofa habitual, systematic approach to both savingand giving tempers many of the controversiesthat arise from the act of spending. The authorhas found it is best to focus on saving and givingas the priority. Having a set goal for these twoitems and making them the priority ensures that spending no longer comes rst. \u0081Save : Saving is the cornerstone of building wealth outside of a practice. Simply put, saving is the act of allocating excess cash flow into wealth building resources. Typically, the rst place one should allocate earn- ings is into their quali ed plan(s). Quali ed plans are investment accounts with certain tax bene ts and are designed to provide investment vehicles for individuals to save for retirement. The most common examples of these accounts are Traditional IRA' s/401(k) 'sa n dR o t h IRA 's/401(k) 's. The difference between Traditional p l a n sa n dR o t hp l a n si st h et a x a t i o na tt h et i m eo fc o n -tribution and distribution. For Traditional plans, con-tributions are tax deductible but all distributions,including the tax deferred growth in the account, are fully taxable as ordinary income. Roth plans are the opposite of Traditional plans. For Roth retirementplans, contributions are not tax deductible and all dis- tributions, including the growth in the account, are tax exempt. For both Traditional and Roth plans,there are maximum amounts that can be contributedand those amounts typically change each year. As one's earnings increase, one 's contributions to their qualied plan(s) should increase until the maximum annual amount is reached. Once retirement accounts are suf ciently funded, net savings can and should be put to work in numer-o u sw a y s .O n ew a yc o u l db et oa c q u i r et h er e a le s t a t e where the practice is located. Most practice ownersend up owning the real estate where their practice is based. Over time, this asset can substantially increase their net worth and provide an additional source ofincome. Another method would be making contribu-tions to a non-quali ed investment account. Either of these investments can help both diversify wealthwhile adding to overall net worth. \u0081Give : giving is the third action one can take with their money. What causes one to give and in what amounts are aspects of one' s personal philosophy surrounding their wealth? Whether one choosesto give or not, that decision should be rooted int h ep u r p o s eo n eh a sf o rt h e i rm o n e y .K e e p i n gscore in this area is also very important. Overtime, a pattern of what percentage of cash in flows were given will emerge. This percentage can beadjusted over time, either up or down, depending on the giving philosophy. Giving decisions can alsoinvolve the entire family and provide bene ts far beyond charitable contributions. Debt Management Managing debt can increase wealth. Using newly received cash to repay the principal of debt increasesnet worth. As debt goes down, net worth (meaningfair market value of assets less total debt) goes up.This happens even if the fair market value of assetsremains constant. Generally, debt with the highest in- terest rate should be repaid rst. Not all debt negatively impacts wealth accumula- tion. There are times when debt is a valuable way to increase wealth. Over the last few years, interestrates have been historically low. If debt is used to ac-quire assets that appreciate at a rate higher than the interest being charged, net worth increases. For instance, the acquisition of your practice 'sr e a le s t a t e through the use of a loan is a common and typicallyprotable way to use debt. However, debt combined with economic uncertainty can create nancial pres- s u r ea st h ep a y m e n t sb e c o m ed u e . Like giving, everyone should have a philosophy around debt. When, why, and on what terms will oneborrow money are the important aspects of a debt phi-losophy. Remaining true to one 's philosophy will help ensure that debt is incurred for opportunities that are both affordable and pro table. Random, uncalculated additions of debt to one 's personal balance sheet is one of the most frequent bottle necks of growing one' sn e t worth. The elimination of debt places the focus on the repayment of the principal and interest associatedwith debt. This increases available cash flow and, therefore, increases the amount available to save. It is important to be intentional with freed up cash flow as money without a job evaporates. Adjusting to Economic Uncertainty Monitoring wealth is even more important duringtimes of economic uncertainty. Having a well-diversi-ed net worth shields oneself from the volatility of cap- ital markets, the swings of business cycles and otherexternal variables outside of one 's control. A common saying that rings true in asset management is that with uncertainty comes opportunity. Depending on the source of uncertainty, and using history as a guide,one can make adjustments to increase exposure tohistorically pro table asset classes. As a relevant example, during times of in flation, interest sensitive investments such as bonds typically underperform.Inflation reduces the value of a bond holder' sc o u p o n interest payment. The longer the maturity of the bond,the more pronounced the infl ation effect. This is because there are many more coupon interest pay- ments to come at further dates, which reduces the present value of those future payments even more.Conversely, equities and real estate have maintainedBUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 261notable performance through in flationary periods of record. Veterinary practices are also historically resil- ient during times of economic hardship. Costs associ-ated with construction and other products can comedown during times of recession and therefore, while itmay seem counterintuitive, recessions can be a goodtime to expand one 's practice. Summary/Action Items Building wealth outside of a veterinary practice requires a diligent, systematic, and organized approach. Having a clear plan requires the knowledge of both where one 's wealth stands today and where it is to go. Once a clear plan is created, consistently keeping score will con rm whether progress is being made or expose areas that need to be adjusted. Wealth growth and stewardship isa life-long process and, done well, will create a legacy that will provide bene ts for generations to come.

Grice, VMD, MBA Small primarily ambulatory rms make up the majority of equine practices. While larger practices are increasingly sold to corporate aggregators for high multiples, smaller practices mostly do not have this opportunity. Other options for harvesting the value of these businesses include mergers, partnerships, or sales to individuals.

Introduction Data from the 2016 AVMA AAEP Economic Impact Study show that over half (53%) of equine practices in the United States have two or less full-time equiva- lent veterinarians. Nearly two thirds have three orless. Ambulatory practices and ambulatory practiceswith a haul-in facility account for 36.5% and 35.4% ofequine veterinary businesses, respectively. 1 The pace of sales of equine practices to corporate aggregators has seemed to quicken over the last sev-eral years. These buyers are primarily interested inpractices that have gross revenue of at least $2 million,a dedicated facility, and at least three full-time veteri-narians. Only about a third of equine practices meetthese parameters. As a result, there are a large num-ber of practitioners with more limited exit strategies. Equine practitioners are often independent and entrepreneurial, leading them to want to be practiceowners in higher numbers than those in companionanimal practice. In the 2016 study noted above, 58.7%of male associates and 48.0% of female associates in equine practice reported they were interested in practice ownership compared to just 34.0% of men and 18.7% of women in companion animal practice. 1 This has undoubtedly contributed to the growth ofmultiple smaller practices, as some associates have left employment to start their own ventures. Retirement and retainment of equine practitioners from equine practice, combined with the decline in the numbers of new graduates entering the equine eld, has made traditional exit strategies more dif cult. In the past, retiring doctors often sold their practices totheir associates or brought them on as partners aftera few years of collegial work together. This modelbegan to shift in the last decade, with owners declin- ing to bring on partners, possibly preferring instead to reap higher pro ts from the work of a stable of associ- ates, as has been recommended by some businessmanagement groups. Other owners offered small numbers of shares for purchase by associates, with no decision-making capacity, which many found NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 263BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONERunappealing. When the time to retire arrived, some of these owners found their associates were not inter-ested in buying their practice. Some associates hadreached an age where buying in was less nancially attractive due to the shortened timeframe for returnsafter purchase debt was satis ed. Others had started families and were unwilling to take on additionalresponsibilities. In other cases, few to no associateswere left at the owners 'retirement time, as they had either accepted new positions in companion animalpractices offering shorter work hours, signi cantly higher pay, and no emergency duty or branched outon their own. Increasingly, some very small or solopractices have been unable to harvest their practiceasset and have simply closed their businesses. Planning ahead for a transition of ownership is important for all practices but especially vital forsmall practices. 2. Discussion Whether the owner is interested in selling his or her shares in a group practice, selling an entire practice outright, or merging with a colleague, the path beginswith nding a buyer/partner that is the \"right t\". Other steps include determining the fair value of thepractice(s), exploring tax implications of the sale, andmaking a smooth transition. There are also importantconsiderations with regard to the elements of part-ners 'operating agreements if adding partners. Right Fit An organization's values identify what the practice cares about most deeply and are the basis of the busi- ness 'brand identity. It is important that a prospec- tive partner 's or new practice owner 's personal values align with these. This is achieved by carefullygetting to know the buyer. When values alignmentoccurs, it is easier to understand one another 'sm o t i - vations, everyone will tend to do the right things forthe right reasons, and this common purpose andunderstanding will help the partners build a strongrelationship. Conversely, when values are out ofalignment, partners may nd that they are working towards different goals, with different intentions, and with different outcomes. This can damage work relationships, productivity, job satisfaction, pro t- ability, and practice brand identity. Only individualswhose values are in alignment with practice valueswill be successful partners. To uncover values, one should ask focused ques- tions that tease out the behaviors expected from thepotential partner in the future. These will generallymirror their values. For instance, as a seller, imaginethat honesty and integrity are two of the practice 's core values. One could ask: \"Describe a time when you felt ethically challenged. How did you go aboutidentifying and understanding the opposing points ofview? How did you deal effectively with the chal-lenge? What was the outcome? \"Or one might ask: \"Has there ever been a time when your beliefsclashed with someone else's at work? If so, how did you overcome these differences? \" T h ep r a c t i c ec u l t u r ep r o v i d e sab a c k g r o u n do f expectations for how team members will behave andwhat will be given highest importance. It is de ned as the values and behaviors that contribute to theunique social and psychological environment. Findinga buyer that is in alignment with practice values is one of the best ways to ensure continued success of the practice after the sale, because clients are expect-ing the practice culture and values to remain consist-ent. This is particularly important if the seller isproviding the nancing. Listen carefully for what is not said in addition to what is said. Value Planning for a transition of ownership ideally requires a3 -5 year timeline. If a sudden life-changing event forces a quick sale, commonly the transaction yields a lower value than if there was time for preparation.During that preparation phase, the nancial manage- ment of the practice needs to be modi ed to minimize personal expenses, create consistency, and maximizeprot. Because value is based on pro ts, adjustments to the nancials during the valuation process are necessary to make sure they re flect the true perform- ance of the practice. Tax strategies and practice man-agement can also have a large effect on nancial statements. Because of this, they rarely show true eco-n o m i cr e a l i t y .O w n e rd o c t o r s 'compensation for their effort as veterinarians often must be adjusted toindustry standards, as must rent/lease for an of ce or facility. If rent is excessive or inadequate, it is revisedto be 4 -6% of gross revenue. aAny personal expenses need to be removed in order to show true pro t. These changes insure fairness to both buyer and seller. Tax Considerations Because there are tax implications in any sale that may vary depending on how the sale is structured, an accountant should always be consulted by both buyerand seller. Seeking fairness and equal tax liability forboth parties is a good objective. Smooth Transition When a practice is sold, often the selling veterinarian stays for 3 -6 months to transfer the goodwill that he or she has just been paid for, helping with the intro- duction of the new veterinarian to existing clients and fostering the future success of the practice. Duringretirement of a partner, this same transition mayoccur with a newly added associate, if one has beenhired. When practices merge, having a client eventwhere all the veterinarians are introduced, and theirclinical interests are highlighted, can help with mak- ing the change exciting for the clients rather than something to dread. Keeping a positive, enthusiastictone during change can make it easier to accept by allparties, including those working inside the practices.BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER 264 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSOperating Agreements2 There are a number of events that could trigger a partner' s departure. Sometimes the agreement for purchase of the shares of the outgoing owner will dif- fer based on what event is causing the exit. For exam-ple, the formula for computing the price to be paidcould be different for a partner leaving the practice due to a disability compared to one selling due to dis- missal, with a discount on value placed on sharesowned by the individual whose conduct forced thesale. Triggering events may include the following: \u0081Death \u0081Disability (must be well-de ned) \u0081Departure (early retirement) \u0081Departure (retirement) \u0081Departure (aged out, if agreement forces sale at a particular age) \u0081Divorce (forced sale of shares prevents possibil-ity of non-veterinarian spouse being awarded the asset) \u0081Dismissed (violation of standards of conduct orpractice) \u0081Disquali cation (loss of license, etc.) \u0081Disaffection (no longer contributes to thebusiness) \u0081Deadlock/disagreement (fundamental impassewith no possible progress forward) \u0081Default (failure to meet payments for purchase of shares) Death of a partner is one of the most important rea- sons to have an operating agreement in place. If you were to die unexpectedly, what would happen to yourequity in your practice? Would your family or heirsreceive a fair price or be paid at all for your investment in the practice? How would the practice value be deter- mined? Would your family receive that value as a lumps u mo ro v e rt i m ew i t hap r o m i s s o r yn o t e ?I fp a i do v e raperiod of time, would the note be secured? What wouldhappen if the practice subsequently failed to producesufcient pro t to pay the note? These same questions could apply for the loss of one of your partners. Couldyou and your practice afford to pay the value of theirshares to their surviving family members? How quickly could you do this? Many practices choose to carry a life insurance policy on each partner payable to the practicein order to meet these obligations. The same concernscan surround a disability following injury or illness. When bringing on a partner, there are many ques- tions to be answered to document expectations. Awell-written operating agreement allows for smoothownership operations and transitions. Don 'tl e a v et h i s to chance! Selling Shares in a Group Practice When selling one 's shares in an existing practice, the valuation methodology and process is generallyspelled out in the operating agreement. A well-written operating agreement prevents each departure from being a separate negotiated transaction. Practices that do not have an operating agreement that memo-rializes \"how things work \"cannd themselves strug- gling when transitions of ownership occur. Shares can be sold back to the company ( \"inside \" sale) or directly to an individual ( \"outside \"sale). Often, operating agreements require that any buyerinto the company must be approved by all the exist-ing partners and may include other conditions of sale. Selling a Sole Owner Practice to Associates There are distinct advantages to associate buyers if they purchase an existing practice, but only if it has an excellent reputation, has strong practice brandidentity, appropriate nancial policies that insure good cash flow, and a well-trained engaged staff. There is no advantage to buyers if they are gaining cli-ents trained to pay sporadically, expecting non-urgentaccess to veterinarians at all times, and stubbornlybonded to the retiring seller. These practices oftenalso have high accounts receivable, staff loyal only tothe seller, and minimal policies and compliance.However, there can be opportunities in purchasing apractice such as this, if the purchase price re flects the difculty the purchaser will have in pivoting the prac- tice to new management. Many equine veterinarians working as associates long to be owners in order to put their ideas into thepractice, increase their nancial prospects, and be able to have more control over their careers. Becausethey want to be able to affect change, small percen-tages of ownership (2 -5%) are often not very effective in retaining associates in small practices. They under- stand these offers as a way to lock them into a practice without providing the aspects of ownership they reallydesire. Some business management experts recom-mend locking in associates in this way as minoritypartners and having operating agreements that com-pel them to later buy out the retiring owner(s) at theprevailing value at retirement. While this is a greatstrategy for the practice owners, it is does not havethe same effect for the minority shareholder. It is much better to offer meaningful partnership to associates once they have shown they can producerobust revenue and have compatible values.

As the profession became feminized,this way of passing on ownership of practices changed.Although studies have shown that 58.7% of male asso-ciates and 48.0% of female associates in equine prac- tice are interested in practice ownership, and an additional 1 in 7 are unsure, equine practice ownerspersist in believing that their associates don 't want to be owners. Perhaps what is really happening isthat the conditions necessary for a sale are not pres-ent -the right price, the right % of shares, and the right degree of possibility for meaningful changebrought about by a new partner.BUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 265If a sale to an associate or even two associates is desired, consider offering them partnership share per- centages equal to the other owners ve years before retirement. Be ready to lean into change and support it. Champion your new partners 'ideas and help them succeed.

Selling a Solo Practice For at least the last decade, solo practitioners havemade up nearly 40% of AAEP members. These veteri- narians have made their careers as sole proprietors for a variety of reasons, but most have prized the inde-pendence that working alone provides. One of the big-gest challenges that solo equine practitioners face is d e t e r m i n i n ga ne x i ts t r a t e g yw h e nt h e ya r er e a d yf o r retirement or an alternative career. Some options when retiring from solo practice include simply informing clients of the retirement and referring them to other local colleagues through a letter; identifying a local practice interested inacquiring the retiring veterinarian 's practice; selling the client list to a trusted colleague and actively sup-porting the transition of clients; or selling the practiceto a new solo owner. In the current environment, most veterinarians will not be interested in purchase of a solo practicebecause it does not offer an advantage to opening apractice of their own. Occasionally, a solo practice that can demonstrate that their clients will remain loyal to the new owner; has a well-rounded arsenal ofdiagnostic equipment; has strong policies and proce- dures; will retain existing staff members; and has shown a reliable and robust stream of pro te a c hy e a r can be sold. However, because the solo practitioner is the brand identity, unless they can step back and bring in the buyer as an associate to whom they canbond the clients for six months or so prior to the sale, the sale of a solo practice is generally very dif cult or impossible. Alternatively, these practices can often sell their client list as well as their used equipment. Client list sales are typically structured such that the purchaser pays a percentage of the revenue thatis earned from the seller 'sc l i e n t so v e rat h r e e - y e a r period. The rst year the buyer typically pays 15 -20% of the revenue earned that year from the seller 's cli- ents, with the second year dropping the percentagepaid on earned revenue by about a third (10 -13%), and the third year an additional third (5 -7%). This approach requires some trust and detailedrecordkeeping. The buyer is expected to print anaccounting of monies earned from the seller 'sp r e v i o u s clients at the end of each year, which usually meanslogging them into practice management software in a way that allows these reports to be generated. The payments can be made quarterly or annually.Sometimes there are clients that used both the seller and the buyer before the sale, so de ning what reve- nue will be counted is essential. With a client list sale, the seller sends a letter to clients stating that their records will be transferredto the buyer 's practice unless they request otherwise. As it is to the seller 'sb e n e t that their clients trans- fer to the new service provider, the seller typicallyalso expresses con dence in the new veterinarian and tries to help the doctor succeed by being avail- able to them for questions about clients or patients for a time after the sale. I ti si m p o r t a n tt oc o n s i d e rt h a te x i ts t r a t e g i e sf o r solo practitioners do not always need to rely on a prac- tice sale. Well-managed solo practices can produce robust pro ts that, if invested wisely on an ongoing basis, can yield excellent long-term gains. Some veter- inarians simply harvest as much money from their work as they can over the course of their career and then simply sell their equipment when they are readyto retire. As they age, some of these doctors begin to limit their practice to certain areas in which they have special competencies, and they reduce theirclient list to slow their growth and minimize the num-ber of hours they work. In these practices, the legacy of the veterinarian is kept in the memories of the cli- ents they served. Merging Practices Sometimes neighboring practices decide to merge toincrease economies of scale, share resources, and min- imize on call duties. When one of the practices has an owner or owners approaching retirement age, this canprovide an excellent way to transfer clients, ease into a slower work pace, and receive value for a practice in the future. Sometimes practices merge in order to bel a r g ee n o u g ht oa t t r a c tac o r p o r a t eb u y e r .O t h e r times, mergers provide a way for a group practice of younger veterinarians to consolidate nearby smallpractices as their owners near retirement, in order to have an orderly transfer of client loyalty. This often also appeals to retiring veterinarians who are con-cerned about good care for their clients. When merg- ing, owners must have compatible values, embrace flexibility, and believe that the pain of change will be exceeded by the positive gains. Stepping away from calling all the shots and having complete control can be dif cult for some people who have not been in a partnership in the past. Keeping the focus on the rea-sons for the merger can help. Mergers also require careful attention to details such as which practice 's software and price list will be used, whether the practice will have a new name, andhow the shares of the new company will be allocated. These details can sometimes be surprisingly hard to come to agreement on. Again, returning to the origi-nal objectives of the merger can help increase flexibil- ity. It is often best to have money exchange hands toBUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER 266 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS\"even up\" ownership amounts, so partners have equal shares. In determining ownership percentages in the new merged company, generally both practices are valued by the same professional, using identical assumptionsto make adjustments to the nancial statements, and then the shares in the new company are apportionedto the new owners accordingly. For instance, ifPractice A with two equal owners is valued at$500,000 and Practice B with three equal owners is valued at $1,000,000, the merged practice value of $1,500,000 will be apportioned B3 22.22%. (See Fig. 1) Mergers can be hard to manage, as veterinarians have lived with certain policies and procedures foryears and can resist change. Creating continuity andconsistency in merged practices is important but dif - cult. All parties must be flexible and driven to succeed in the merger. Redundancy may cause the need forstaff shrinkage, which can be a source of friction.Differing preferences for equipment or pharmaceuti-cals can also arise. The details are often where the dis-agreements pile up. Having compatible values andgood communication skills is essential in mergers. 3. Conclusion Although small practices make up the majority ofequine rms in the United States, transfers of owner- ship in these businesses can pose challenges thatrequire flexibility to overcome. Planning an exit strat- egy well in advance of retirement is often the bestw a yt oh a r v e s tt h eh i g h e s tv a l u ef r o mo n e 'sp r a c t i c easset. Partnership with an associate early in theircareer with a meaningful or equal portion of thepractice has the highest probability of success. Solopractice owners need to put pro t away for retire- ment through the years as they practice and workto sell their client list to a local colleague at thetime of their retirement if they are unable toattract an associate eager to be the buyer. Mergersmay provide a good solution to gleaning value froma small practice but require high levels of coopera- tion and collaboration. Most importantly, owners of small practices should be proactive in planning fort h ef u t u r eo ft h e i rb u s i n e s s .

Clark, DVM, MBA Author 's address: Avanti Equine Veterinary aclark@advantiequine.com. \u00a92022 AAEP. Selling an equine practice at full value is a relatively new opportunity for equine practice owners. Historically, equine practices have transacted at a discounted rate because these practices were not a liquid asset, as therewas virtually no marketplace in which to sell those prac-tices other than internal sales to associates. The discountfactor has been referred to as a marketability discount. The marketability discount arose because equine prac- tices were an illiquid asset with no ready pool of buyersfor the practices. Practice owners had to \"grow their own \"buyers from the associate pool. The full value of a practice was calculated using business valuation formu-las commonly used in all types of businesses, then a mar- ketability discount was applied to the true value to arrive at the price at which there was a willing \"home grown\" buyer and a willing practice owner seller. The discount rate was a subjective number, varying frompractice-to-practice to arrive at the maximum price the associate would pay and the minimum price the practice owner would accept. Practice owners sold the practice orparts of the practice to associate(s) at the discountedvalue, usually nancing the sale themselves and holding the practice as collateral. The buyer was gen- erally a long-term associate veterinarian in the prac- tice. Because for many years there was no non-associate marketplace for equine practices, associateveterinarians 'belief that \"an equine practice just isn 't worth that much \"has eroded even the dis- counted value of an equine practice. Associate veteri-narian disbelief in the economic value of an equinepractice has many origins and is a topic for anotherday. This resulted in many equine practitionerssimply continuing to work into their 70s and 80s and ultimately walking away from their practices.Recently, a new equine practice marketplace hasdeveloped in which corporate investors believe that a practice is worth more, not less, than historic val- uations, and those corporate investors have begunacquiring equine veterinary practice businesses atthose high valuations. Selling any asset requires awilling seller and a willing buyer. Tension in the mar-ketplace for equine practice sales results from having two groups of buyers: associate veterinarians and corporate buyers. These buyers have a signi cant difference of opinion regarding the value of an equinepractice. This dynamic creates a dif cult decision for some sellers of an equine practice. The seller mayhave a willing corporate buyer at market value and another willing associate veterinarian buyer at a dis- counted value, often deeply discounted. The seller isfaced with a decision having at least two components,nancial and non nancial, to become a willing seller. \u0081Thenancial component is whether to accept a higher price or lower price for the practice. \u0081The non- nancial component is much more complex and varies from seller to seller, often including legacy in the community and gener- ous \"familial \"feelings for the associate(s). To become a willing seller to one or the other of those buyers, the seller must fully understand the variables on which they are making one of the mostcritical decisions in their life. NOTES 268 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUILDING AND MANAGING WEALTH AS AN EQUINE PRACTITIONER1. What Is the Buyer of an Equine Practice Acquiring? A corporate buyer, as well as an associate buyer, is buying a stream of cash that the business will deliverto the buyer into the future. The unit of measure com- monly used to value that stream of cash is earningsbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization(EBITDA). The practice 's EBITDA is the basis of what is being sold to the buyer. The strategic goals ofmost corporate buyers are threefold: 1. To be the veterinary service provider of choice. 2. To be the employer of choice.3. To be the investment of choice. The strategic goals of most associate buyers are also threefold and very similar: 1. To be the veterinary service provider of choice.2. To have a higher income, i.e., investment of choice.3. To have control over their career and create their own practice culture that suits their spe- cic needs and values, i.e., employer of choice. The value of a practice is usually calculated as a multiple of the businesses 'EBITDA. The \"multiple \"in the equation is dependent upon the level of uncer- tainty that the stream of cash delivered by the busi- ness will grow over time. A seller can maximize thevaluation of their equine practice by decreasing theuncertainty of future delivery of that stream of cashto the buyer. The level of risk of future returns can substantially impact value. There are many factors which increase or decrease the level of uncertainty.A few of the common risk factors are listed below: 1. Client 's personal brand loyalty to the practice owner(s) rather than to the practice. 2. No successor lead veterinarian identi ed and trained. 3. Random pricing strategy that is not based on cost of providing a service. 4. Low collection at time of service. 5. Casual inventory management without rou- tine inventory counts and location tracking. 6. Non-compliant controlled substance program.7. Reliance on billing records rather than board of examiners compliant medical records. Whether or not an equine practice can be sold to a corporate entity and, if so, the valuation of the prac- tice depend on whether the business has been devel-oped and managed to minimize business uncertaintyin the future. The three primary objectives of the prac-tice ownership team contemplating sale to a corporate aggregator should be to maximize EBITDA, client loy- alty, and establish a veterinary successor as theleader of the veterinary team. Lowering those shouldprobably be the three primary objectives in managing a v e t e r i n a r yb u s i n e s sw h e t h e ro rn o ti ti sf o rs a l e . Another way to look at management to maximizereturn to the owner and value of the practice is toidentify and mitigate risks that impact cash flow, pro t- ability, and regulatory compliance consequences. 2. Maximizing EBITDA Think of an equine practice as a black box into which money and effort are the inputs and cash is the out- put. The cash output is EBITDA. The largest two expenses of an equine practice are drugs and medical supplies, and payroll. Managing these components to-ward ef ciency while not sacri cing excellence, should be the primary goal in managing the business. Therevenue and cash flow generated by the caseload of a practice is in fluenced by pricing, discounting, and col- lection policy. The higher the price, the lower the dis-counts, and the sooner money is collected, the moreEBITDA the practice can sell. A major obstacle to healthy EBITDA is the tendency of veterinarians to assume responsibility for subsidizing an expensivehobby of their clients. Client Loyalty Client loyalty must be to the practice, not to the indi- vidual veterinarian. Personal brand loyalty adds virtually no value to a buyer, while practice brand loy-alty has tremendous value. Clearly, a solo equinepractice 's client loyalty is loyalty to the veterinarian, minimizing value. However, several very valuable group equine practices have been formed by merging solo practices, creating brand loyalty, and buildingleadership. Opportunities for subsequent sale to cor-porate entities have followed. Successor Veterinary Leadership Historically, equine practice lead veterinarians have been the owners of the practice. Following the sale of an equine practice to a corporate buyer, the vet-erinarians of the practice will probably prefer to be led by another veterinarian rather than a lay per- son. Having successor lead veterinarian(s), a compen-sated position, in place prior to the sale minimizesuncertainty and increases the value of the practice. Summary There is no set formula for what the selling veterinar- ian(s) role will be post sale. Some sellers want to retire immediately. This can signi cantly reduce the value of the practice unless client loyalty to the practice and a strong successor lead veterinarian are in place. The usual path is for the selling veterinarian(s) to remainemployed as associate veterinarians with a leadershiprole for a few years. Some sellers expect to stay on asan associate with a leadership role for many years. The multiple used in the valuation of a veterinary practice will be proportionally higher in relation tothe success in establishing client loyalty and a succes-sor lead veterinarian(s). Whether or not an owner or owners sell to a corporate group, equine practices with clients loyal to the practice and strong prac-tice lead veterinarians are usually more pro table businesses, so fetch a higher price.

Corporate buyers are looking for EBIDTA,a culture of client loyalty, and veterinary leader-ship into the future.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction When sick foals, it is not unusual that sup- plemental nutrition is required. Mare 's milk is the best and most natural source of nutrition, but itmay be a challenge to maintain milk production inmares that are not being suckled and are beingmilked by hand. Mares must be milked frequentlydue to the small size of the cisternal compartment.Mares may be dif cult to milk by hand due to dis- comfort and failure to stimulate milk letdown.There are thoughts that mares let down milk in response to normal mothering behavior rather than tactile stimulation of the teat. Milk letdown may beimpaired when attempting to feed a recumbent foal.Hand milking can make the mare sore, and it maybe dif cult to milk the mare out completely. In- complete emptying of the udder at each milkingmay contribute to the decrease in milk productionseen in mares that are hand milked. The continuedfriction of the thumb and fore nger against the mare 's skin can result in tenderness and decreased compliance of the mare. Cleanliness is essential asbacteria from the milker 's skin can lead to mastitis. 2. Materials and Methods Milking Options Commercial milkersaare available that have a trigger operated vacuum pump and are designed to tt h eunique shape of the teat and udder. The pumps are not inexpensive and will wear out over time. They alsodo not withstand a few kicks by agitated mares. Smallstudies have suggested that milk yield is higher andmilking time is shorter in mares that are milked bymachine compared to hand milking. 1 If a commercial milker is not available, a 60-mL sy- ringe can easily be converted for use. The plungershould be backed up an inch, and the needle end ofthe syringe can be cut off with a saw. A vice can facili-tate this procedure. Tin snips are an easily availablealternative to a saw. After removal of the needle endof the syringe, the plunger should be removed andplaced in the barrel from the other direction. Thisleaves the smooth flange end that can be placed over the teat and against the udder (Fig. 1). Gentle pres-sure can then be applied, and the syringe will ll with milk. Avoid overzealous pressure and be careful to notpull the plunger out of the syringe and lose the milk.With this method, a mare can quickly and easily bemilked out. Volumes of 500 mL to 1 L should beobtained every 2 hours. Improve Milk Letdown Regardless of the method used, it is imperative to pre-pare the mare. Someone offering feed or allowing themare to nuzzle the foal can be helpful to achievemilk letdown. A warm compress should be appliedto the udder to both stimulate milk letdown and toremove smegma, dirt, and debris. After gently NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 271THERIOGENOLOGY - MAREcleaning, the mare can be milked. Metal bowls may frighten the mare due to the noise of the milk hittingthe bowl. It is imperative that if milking into a bowl,t h eo p e r a t o rb ea b l et om a i n t a i na rm hold on the con- t a i n e ra n db ea b l et om o v ew i t ht h em a r e .T h ec o m m e r -cial milker and syringe method allow the operator tonot lose the milk obtained if the mare moves during theprocedure. If particulate matter from the udder is foundin the milk, straining the milk through a 4 /C24g a u z ei s all that is necessary to remove debris. Feeding the Foal It is important that all equipment used to collect and store milk is cleaned thoroughly between uses. Foals can be fed through an indwelling stomach tube. Foalsthat suffer from neonatal maladjustment must be fedcarefully as they may not be tolerant of enteral nutri-tion. The tube should always be checked for refl ux before giving milk. Commercial feeding bags bcan be used, but 1-L fluid bags with an attached primary administration set can be adapted if alternatives arenot available. A slit can be made in the top of the bagto allow milk to be poured in, and the bag can be hungto administer milk to recumbent foals or can easily becarried if feeding ambulatory foals. It is best to start bygiving about 5% to 7% of body weight as milk the rst day divided into hourly feedings. The foal must bestanding or in sternal recumbency during and for at least 10 minutes after feeding. All milk must be admin- istered by gravity flow. If the foal tolerates enteral nutrition, then the amount of milk may be graduallyincreased. Ten percent of body weight as milk may begiven on days 2 and 3 and then increased to 15% to20% of body weight per day over the subsequent days.Most foals that require nutritional support show a pos-itive response in 1 to 2 days and resume suckling. Improving Milk Production Despite the best intentions, mares that are being milked for several days often experience decreasedmilk production. Care should be taken to make sure that adequate nutrition and water are pro- vided to support lactation. Inexperience of per-sonnel, stressful environment, overaggressivemilking, inadequate emptying of the udder, reducedfrequency of milking, and failure to mimic naturaludder stimulation may all contribute to the declinein milk production. Acepromazine maleate c(0.02 - 0.06mg/kg, IV or IM) may be administered as a tranquilizer to anxious mares and to take advantageof its prolactin promoting effects.2If milk production is falling, dopamine D2 receptor antagonists such asdomperidoned(1.1 mg/kg, orally, q 24 h for 4 days) or sulpiridee(1 mg/kg, IM, q 12 h) may be administered for their prolactin promoting effects. When available,sulpiride is felt to be the preferred drug for inductiono fl a c t a t i o ni nm a r e s . 3Occasionally, foal rejection may be encountered when a previously weak or recumbentfoal is strong enough to resume nursing. Keeping themare and foal in close proximity aids in maintainingthe maternal bond. Prior to returning the foal tonursing, all milk feeding should be stopped 4 hoursprior so that the foal is hungry. The administrationof prostaglandins can be a strong stimulant of mater-nal behavior. Dinoprost tromethamine f(0.05 mg/kg, IM) may be used, and the foal is carefully intro-duced to the mare in 20 minutes, usually during theperiod of mild sweating, restlessness, and softening oft h em a n u r es e e ni nt h em a r ea tp e a kp r o s t a g l a n d i nactivity. If maternal behavior such as licking, snif ng, and nickering to the foal is not seen within 10 to15 minutes of introduction of the foal, cloprostenolsodium g(0.001 mg/kg, IM) may IM) may be admin- istered to mares that become overly uncomfortable af-ter prostaglandin treatment.3 3. Results Using the methods described here have been success- ful in the author 's hospital for providing short-term nutritional support to recumbent or weak foals that tolerate enteral feeding. These methods facilitatenutritional support of the foal while maintaining lac-t a t i o ni nt h em a r es ot h ef o a lm a yb er e t u r n e dt oi t sdam once it has recovered. 4. Discussion It is not uncommon for a veterinarian to need to milk a mare to provide valuable nutrition to the foal. Milking may be necessary to provide valuable colos-trum to a weak or slow foal that has not suckledbefore gut closure occurs or during the treatment ofsick neonates that are too weak to suckle on theirown. While milk replacers can provide the necessarynutritional requirements, the author believes mare 's milk is superior for intestinal development and func-tion. Feeding mare 's milk appears to be tolerated better by foals and results in less digestive upsetthan milk replacer. Careful attention to milking Fig. 1.

The goals of this project were to 1) describe the quality of mare colostrum in the immediate postpar- tum period relative to mare parity and age, 2) evaluatethe relationship between colostrum quality at foalingand foal plasma IgG concentration at 12 hours of age,and 3) describe the depletion of IgG concentration inmammary fluid over a 48-hour period postpartum. 2. Materials and Methods Colostrum samples ( <0.5 mL) were collected from 229 mares immediately after foaling and applied to a Brixrefractometer to evaluate quality (Brix score, %).Quality assessment was compared between multipa-rous mares and maiden mares, as well as compared byage groups ( <10, 10- 14, 15 -19, and 20 years of age). The initial Brix score of the colostrum was subse-quently compared with the plasma IgG concentrationof foals at 12 hours of age as determined by a validatedimmunoturbidometric assay. Finally, the depletion ofIgG antibodies was determined in mammary fluid col- lected from a subset of 10 mares at de ned times over therst 48 hours postpartum by both assay and refractometry.The subset of selected from apopulation of 70 mares foaling in 2022. Data are pre-sented the mean 6standard The intra- assay coef for the refractometry assessment was 0.2%. 3. Results The average Brix score for the 229 colostrum samplescollected immediately after foaling was 27.1 64.8%. Samples from 91 mares were 30% (very good quality), 123 mares were 20% to 29% (good quality), 10 mares Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 278 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY -MAREwere 15% to 19% (fair quality), and 5 mares were 14% (poor quality). There was no statistical difference (p> 0.05) in colostrum quality between multipa- n=5 1 ) .T h e r ew a sa l s on od i f f e r - ence in colostrum quality between mare age groups(27.964.6,<10 The average plasma IgG concentration of foals born to mares with a colostrumBrix of the IgG concentration of foals born to 91). There was a strong r(98) = 0.97, p<.05, between the SRID IgG values and Brix refractometer scores for colostrumsamples collected mg/dL and 11.1 61.8%, respectively, at 12 and 626.1 6 232.0 mg/dL and 10.5 60.5%, respectively, at 24 hours postpartum. 4. Discussion Evaluation of colostrum using a Brix refractometer isa rapid and inexpensive technique to estimate quality,and results are correlated with IgG content as determined by assay. Foals born to mares withfair or poor-quality colostrum have lower plasma IgGconcentration than foals born to mares with good- or very good-quality colostrum. Mares with fair- or poor- quality colostrum can ed their foals supplemented with frozen-thawed colostrum and/or acolostrum substitute orally within the rst few hours after birth. Knowledge of colostrum quality is also im-portant when selecting mares from which to harvest co-lostrum for banking. Colostrum should be harvested assoon as possible in the postpartum period to optimizecolostrum quality as nursing by the foal results in rapidd e p l e t i o ni nI g G .I na d d i t i o n ,u n d e r s t a n d i n gw h e nc o -lostrum IgG concentrations decline to baseline levelscan be helpful in determining when to allow a foal con-sidered to be at risk of neonatal isoerythrolysis to nursefrom their dam.

Stout, MA, DVM, PhD, DACT* Equine ovum pick up is generally a safe procedure, but mares can display signs of pain and discomfort for up to 3 days after follicle aspiration. Authors 'addresses: Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Yalelaan 112, Utrecht, the Netherlands (Stout, Leemans, Claes); Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California-Davis, Davis, CA 95616 Aspiration of follicles to harvest oocytes for in vitro embryo production is a reproductive technique that isgrowing in popularity in clinical practice. To date,there is little data regarding the well-being of maresfollowing aspiration. The objective of this study was toinvestigate the frequency and severity of complicationsassociated with ovum pick up (OPU) and to identifyfactors infl uencing the well-being of mares after OPU in a clinical program. The authors hypothesized thatdifferent degrees of pain and discomfort occur after OPU, and they could be associated with mare factors. 2. Materials and Methods Data were collected between 2019 and 2021 from 913 OPU procedures using a client survey to record bodytemperature, appetite, attitude, scraping, and lyingdown in the 3 days after OPU. Only Warmblood andArabian mares were included in the study. 3. Results No fatal complications were observed. Some form ofdiscomfort (fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, lyingdown, or scraping) was observed in 24% of mares theday after OPU, decreasing to 10% and 3% on days 2and 3, respectively. Furthermore, young ( p= 0.02) and competing ( p<0.001) mares were more likely to show signs of discomfort than older mares and broodmares. 4. Discussion These results indicate that, in experienced hands,OPU is a safe procedure associated with minor post-procedure discomfort, but they also highlight theimportance of adequate post-OPU pain managementprotocols, especially in young, competing mares.

Introduction With the current advances in assisted reproductive techniques (ART) such as postmortem gamete retrievaland in vitro embryo production (IVP), a new possibilityarises for obtaining postmortem progeny. However, theeffect of euthanasia agents on the outcome of IVP isunknown. In this study, the presence of pentobarbital a as the most common euthanasia solution, in the follicu-larfluid (FF) of mares after euthanasia was assessed. 2. Materials and Methods Follicular fluid (n = 20) from mares after euthanasia, FF (n =10) from mares after ovariectomy (negativecontrol), and serum from mares after euthanasia (pos-itive control; n = 5) were collected immediately or ;24 hrs after euthanasia. The follicles were aspirated andstored at /C020\u00b0C. Samples were extracted and the con- centration of pentobarbital was measured by gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry. 3. Results Pentobarbital concentration averaged 147 mg/L inserum samples, while it was not detected in thenegative controls. In all FF samples pentobarbitalwas detected with an average concentration of56.5 mg/L.

Discussion Based on the results, ovariectomy under general non-barbiturate anesthesia before euthanasia isthe recommended practice to avoid the potentialeffects of pentobarbital on oocytes. A future studyto evaluate the effect of the detected concentrationof pentobarbital on oocyte developmental compe-tence is warranted.

Despite lower endometrial edema scores in late fall, the lack of difference for other parameters, suchas interval to ovulation and percent of successful inductions between early and late suggest response to GnRH-agonist this time of year. Authors 'address: University of Illinois, is a popular to ovu- lation due to its ef cacy of ;90% over spring and summer in older and young mares;1however, its fall efcacy is debated. Scoring endometrial edema can indicate a follicle 's readiness to ovulate 48 h post GnRH;2however, anecdotally it is suggested that edema score decreases in the fall, rendering apoor GnRH-response. This study aimed to assessovulatory response to deslorelin in the fall. 2. Material and Methods Mares (n = 22) having a pre-ovulatory follicle receiveddeslorelina(1.8 mg/mare, IM). Ovulation was con rmedby ultrasonography performed 24, 36 h post inductionand repeated at 2 h-intervals. Progesterone concen-trations were determined with chemiluminescence. b Dinoprostc(7.5 mg/mare, IM) was administered 8 d post-ovulation. Cycles were repeated 5 times and grouped as early (n = 55) and late fall (n = 45).Parametric data was analyzed with mixed models,ANOVA, Tukey 's test, and Pearson 's correlation and non-parametric data with Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher 's, and Dunn 's tests. d 3. Results and Discussion Deslorelin effectively induced ovulation in 90% of cycles,with similar intervals from induction to ovulation inearly (40.6 60.4 h) and late (41.2 60.5 h) fall (P = 0.55) Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 284 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY - MAREand to those reported similar early and late fall (P>0.05). The percentage of ovulations occurring during typical intervals used for timed-breeding (36-48 h: 91 vs 95%; 38-44 h: 60 vs61%) were similar between early and late fall, respectively (P >0.05). Follicle size at induction tended to be smaller in early (36.4 60.4 mm) than late (37.460.4 mm) fall (P = 0.07). Edema scores varied with time relative to ovulation (P <0.001) and were lower in late fall (P = 0.01). Progesterone concentrations varied with time from induction (P <0.001) but not between early and late fall when comparing speci ct i m e points from induction (P = 0.73).

Introduction Obesity increases propensity for metabolic pathologies and reproductive failure. This study hypothesized thatmare obesity causes mitochondrial dysfunction of ovar-ian follicle cells and optimal dietary nutrient intake canmitigate these effects and improve insulin regulation. 2. Materials and Methods Light-horse mares were grouped: Normal Weight (NW,n = 6, 17.861.8 yr, BCS [body condition score] 5.7 60.3), Obese (OB, n = 7, 18.661.5 yr, BCS 7.7 60.2), and Obese Diet Supplemented (OBD, n = 7, 18.161.3 7.7 60.2). Daily and for 6 wk before follicular sampling, NW were fed hay (grass/alfalfa) at ;2% body weight; OB and OBD were free-fed hay and 3 kg corn/oats, with OBD also receiving diet supplements (vita-mins, trace minerals, amino acids, antioxidants, n-3PUFA, probiotics a, and metabolic support proprietaryblendb). Cellular with micro- sensor (oocytes) or high-resolution respirometer (granu-losa cells). Insulin dysregulation was determined byfasting insulin and an oral sugar test at 12 wk. 3. Results and Discussion Oocyte oxygen consumption (aerobic metabolism) washigher (p <0.05) for OB than NW, with OBD in between both. Measurements of impaired mitochondrial functionin granulosa cells (reactive oxygen species produc-tion and outer membrane damage) were higher in OBthan NW, but OBD was either not different than othergroups or similar to NW. Basal fasting insulin washigher in OB than NW and OBD. More OB demon-strated insulin dysregulation after the oral sugar testthan NW or OBD (p <0.1). Dietary supple- mentation attenuated effects of obesity on cellular mito-chondrial function and improved insulin regulation.

In a survey on the use of PPS inAustralia, the respondents reported they used PPS for prophylaxis and treatment of OA despite the lim- ited evidence available. 3 PPS may provide a disease-modifying effect in the management of OA. In vitro PPS resulted in aconcentration-related stimulated proteoglycan syn- thesis in chondrocyte monolayers.4In vitro shows there is a dose-related inhibition of stromelysin.5While there is direct inhibition of degradation effects, there are also direct anabolic effects.6,7Chondrocyte uptake of PPS can stimu- late production of matrix proteins and also has anti-in flammatory and brinolytic effects.7In a rat model, PPS may preserve proteoglycan within car- tilage matrix.8Studies have con rmed that intra- muscular dosing of PPS in the horse can achieveconcentrations of PPS in the synovial fluid that can result in an effect on synoviocyte metabolism, stim-ulate proteoglycan synthesis, and reduce metallo- proteinase activity. 9In the osteochondral fragment model, PPS was shown to reduce cartilage brilla- tion and increase chondroitin sulfate (CS 846) epi-tope concentrations in the synovial fluid of treated horses compared with saline-treated controls. 2 NOTES 290 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATIONPPS is approved for use in Australiaband is cur- rently being provided by compounding pharmacies in the United States for veterinary use.

Methods The study was a multicentered study conducted at 12veterinary practices in the United States. Each evalu-able site contributed at least 2 evaluable cases per treat-ment group. This study was approved by the requiredInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee commit-tees. Within 5 days prior to study day (SD) 0, the inves-tigator reviewed the study requirements and inclusi- on/exclusion criteria (Table 1) with the owner andobtained informed consent. Horses were maintained by their owners on their current diets and housing. Owners were given a daily diary to maintain during thestudy period and comment on whether appetite and drinking habits were considered normal or abnormal. Radiographs of the affected joint were obtained pre- treatment for the purpose of inclusion and on SD 28 to verify there were no unexpected changes. The horse 's weight was measured at enrollment by weight tape using the heart girth circumference and body length to calculate the weight. 10The investigational product (IVP) was PPS formulated as a 25% injectable sterile solution. cOnce-weekly injec- tions PPS on SD 0, 7 ( 62d a y s ) , 1 4( 62 days), and 21 ( 62 days) were administered. A 0.9% saline solution was used as a control product (CP),with a volume calculated to be equal to the IVP vol- ume. The IVP/CP was administered by intramuscular Table 1.

This protocolwas used to enable the assessment of injection sites.The treatment dispenser had access to previous visitsto determine location. Any concomitant treatmentduring the study period was documented in the studyrecords. Physical Examinations The investigator performed a physical examination and then a lameness score based on the AAEP Lameness Scale11pretreatment on SD 0, SD 7 ( 62d a y s ) , S D 1 4 (62d a y s ) ,S D2 1( 62d a y s ) ,S D2 8( 62 days), and any unplanned visits. Injection site observations were per-formed by the investigator pretreatment on SD 0, SD 7(62d a y s ) , S D 1 4 ( 62d a y s ) , a n d S D 2 1 ( 62d a y s ) t o conrm the site was normal prior to injection (full neck assessed). Approximately 3 hours postinjection(615 minutes), the investigator observed the injection sites. Following treatment, the owner was asked to re-cord an injection site observation in the days betweenvisits. On SD 28, the investigator made a full assess-ment of the neck to con rm that all injection site obser- vations had resolved. Injection site observations wereobtained at unplanned visits if deemed appropriate bythe investigator. In addition to injection site observa-tions, owners were asked to maintain a daily diary re-cord on the general, appetite, and drinking habits andif the horse was considered normal/abnormal for the pe-riod of time between each visit. Owners were instructedto report any potential adverse events (AEs) to the in-vestigator. A follow-up phone call to the owner tookplace on SD 38 ( 62d a y s ) . Clinicopathology Blood and serum samples were collected for clinical pathology (complete blood count and serum chemistry with brinogen) on SD 0 (pretreatment), SD 14 (pre- treatment), SD 28, and any unplanned visits ifindicated in response to an AE. Blood and serumsamples were collected for prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) analy- ses pretreatment and then 3 hours post-treatment(61 5m i n u t e s )o nS D0 ,S D1 4( 62d a y s ) ,a n dS D2 1 (62 days). All clinicopathologic analyses were per- formed at a single reference laboratory. d Outcome Assessment At enrollment, the investigator identi ed a single limb with lameness due to OA with radiographic evi- dence to support the diagnosis. This limb was then fol- lowed in each subsequent lameness evaluations andused in the assessment of treatment effect. The end-point for ef cacy was the improvement in lameness score at SD 28. SD 28 lameness scores were comparedto SD 0 lameness scores. Animals with an improve-ment of at least 1 category in the SD 28 lamenessscore as compared to the SD 0 lameness score wereconsidered a treatment \"success\" ;o t h e r w i s e ,t h ea n i - mal would be classi ed as a \"failure. \"Should an animal have been withdrawn from the study for per- ceived inef c a c yo rf a i l u r et oi m p r o v e ,o ra ta n yt i m e for treatment-related reasons, they would have beenclassi ed as a failure. The success rate of the IVP treated group was then compared to the negative con- trol group to determine overall treatment effect. Any horses removed from the study for treatment-related reasons were considered treatment failures. Horses that did not complete all study visits due to treat- ment-related reasons are included in the effectivenessanalysis as treatment failures. In addition, horses that completed all or any of the interim visits but did not complete the follow-up (Day 38 62) phone call visits were included in the effectiveness analysis anddeemed as a success or failure based on the lastevaluation. Adverse Events For this study, an AE was de ned as any unfavorable and unintended observation in a horse that occurred any time following administration of the IVP or CP, whether or not it was considered product related. AnyAE that occurred during the study was reported to the investigator, who recorded the AE and any associ- ated concomitant medication administered. Data Analysis The study was a negatively controlled, randomized, blinded eld ef cacy study. The investigator doing the physical examinations and lameness examinationsand the owner/agent were blinded. The treatment ad- ministrator could not be blinded because of differences in color and packaging of the control and treatment materials. Treatment administration data and mate-rials were securely maintained by the treatment dministrator. Each animal was randomized in presen- tation order using randomization generated by the SAS statistical package also used for analysis. eEach study site utilized a separate randomization. Animals were blocked in groups of 4 in a 2:2 IVP to CP ratio. Masking was achieved by separation of function and access to treatment records. The individual horse was evaluated as the experimental unit. Descriptive statistics (number of observations, mean, standarddeviation, minimum, and maximum (or number of observations, median, and frequency counts for bino- mial data) were generated for all variables at all vis- its. All hypotheses were tested at a two-sided 0.05 level of signi cance. Effectiveness was determined by the results obtained on Day 28. Animals having major protocol deviations were not included in the effective- ness evaluation. The lameness scores from Day 28 were compared to the lameness scores at Day 0, and an animal was classi ed as a success if there was an improvement of at least one category in the Day 28 lameness scores; otherwise, the animal was classi ed as a failure. Animals withdrawn from the study forperceived inef cacy or failure to improve, or at any time for treatment-related reasons, were classi ed asSPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATION 292 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSa failure.

The model included terms for the effects \"treatment, \"\"day, \"and \"treatment by day \" interaction as xed effects, as well as \"animal within treatment and site, \"\"site, \"and \"treatment by site \" interaction as random effects. Statistical analysis wasperformed on a per-protocol (PP) population set (com- parison of treatment groups that includes only thosecases that completed the treatment originally allocated without major deviation). This population takes into consideration all protocol deviations that would be con- sidered to impact the results and conclusions drawn from this case data. Statistical analysis was also per- formed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) population set. This population reports the ef cacy for all cases on the study regardless of any protocol deviations. This popu-lation set is included as it gives an indication of the trueeld situation and how the product would perform once it comes to market. The ITT population will beused for safety summary and analyses. Body systems were evaluated using categorical observations (normal/ abnormal). Injection site and physical examination data were evaluated with descriptive statistics. No hy- pothesis testing was conducted on these variables. 3. Results Enrollment included 237 horses of multiple breeds including Appaloosa, Arabian, Belgian, Crossbred, Dutch Warmblood, Friesian, Grade, Hanoverian, Miniature Horse, Morgan, Oldenburg, Other, Paint Horse, Percheron, Quarter Horse, Saddlebred, Standardbred, Tennessee Walking Horse, and Thoroughbred from 3 to 32 years of age. There were 82 females, 151 castrated males, and 4 intact males ranging from 153 to 904 kg. Outcome Assessment A total of 237 horses were randomized to either the CP (n=1 1 7 ) o r I V P ( n= 120), the ITT population. Of these, 113 CP and 106 IVP horses were included in the PP population. Horses excluded from the PP popu- lation included cases with major protocol deviations (16) and sites that enrolled less than 2 cases in one of the treatment groups (2). No horses were eliminated for severe adverse events. Table 2 provides a sum- mary of the assessment of treatment success based on the primary outcome variable. Treatment success rate in the PP population was signi cantly higher in the IVP group (58.92%) as compared to the CP group(36.29%) on Day 28. Similarly, for the ITT population,treatment success rate was signi cantly higher in the IVP group (59.19%) as compared to the CP group(36.98%) on Day 28. The distribution of joints treated for the IVP and CP are presented in Table 3. The treatment by day interaction was statistically signicant for conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bili- rubin, total bilirubin, protein, phils, and white blood cells (WBC) (Table 4). Nowithin-day treatment effects were detected for conju- gated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin, or total biliru- bin. WBC values onSD 28 were signi cantly lower in the PPS treated group as compared to the saline control ( p<0.05). In addition to the signi cant interactions between treat- ment and day described above, the main effect oftreatment was signi cant for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH; p=0 . 0 2 2 0 a n d p= 0.0229, respectively). Descriptive statistics were performed on the PT and aPTT. It wasnoted that the predosing PTT means were marginally and consistently lower than the reference range beforetreatment was given for both treatment groups and at all time points. Post-treatment mean values in the sa- l i n ec o n t r o lg r o u pw e r ec o m p a r a b l et ob a s e l i n em e a n values, but the PPS had increased; however, they were still within the acceptable reference range. Descriptive statistics of categorical observations of body systems, heart rate, respiration rate, and tem- perature resulted in no difference noted between the treatment groups. A small percentage of PPS treatedhorses exhibited an injection site reaction approxi- mately 3 hours post-treatment (maximum number on any given study day: edema/swelling 11 [9.17%], heat 1 [0.87%], pain 4 [3.33%], and redness 1 [0.87%]). As with the investigator 's assessment of injection sites, the animals 'owners reported that a small percentage of individual horses exhibited an abnormal injectionsite reaction; the PPS-treated group had 13.33% of cases compared to the saline treated group, which was 2.56%. The minimum duration (days) of observa-tion was that a reaction was observed the same day but had resolved by the next day (i.e., reaction lasting only a matter of hours), and the maximum duration was 5 days, reported for PPS-treated horses. Adverse Events No serious adverse events were reported during the study period. The majority of nonserious AEs reported were considered to be transient and did not require treatment, with the vast majority of AEs being typicalof the population under treatment. 4. Discussion The objective of this study was to generate pivotal data to evaluate the eld safety and effectiveness of PPS when injected intramuscularly once weekly for 4 weeks. The study demonstrated a signi cantly higher success rate in the PPS-treated group (58.92%)compared to the saline group (36.29%) on SD 28 (p= 0.0419). The administration of PPS was wellSPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 293tolerated with no serious AEs reported. Injection site reactions were observed in relatively few animals,and the maximum duration was 5 days. The treat-ment by day interaction was statistically signi cant, but no within day showed no statistically signi cant difference for each analyte for each study day; there-fore, these ndings were considered spurious changes in the horses over time. The treatment by day interac-tion was statistically signi cant for globulin, total protein, neutrophils, and WBC. The means were sig-nicantly lower in the PPS-treated group compared to t h es a l i n eg r o u p .I ts h o u l db en o t e dt h a tt h e r ew e r e4cases that reported an AE of systemic infection includ-ing increases in these variables (3 PPS, 1 saline case).There is not a singular explanation why PPS-treatedhorses would have less systemic in flammation. A potential effect of decreased joint in flammation lead- ing to lower systemic indicators of in flammation is possible. The treatment by day effect was signi cant for BUN and MCH. The means for both the BUN andMCH values were signi cantly higher in the PPS- treated group compared to the saline group. One AEwas recorded for elevated BUN for a PPS-treatedcase; otherwise, there were no consistent abnormal-ities of BUN noted. PPS has thrombolytic properties via mechanisms similar to heparin, acting on the intrinsic coagulationpathway. 12Heparin utilizes antithrombin use ofantithrombin III. Lipids and thrombi have beenreported to be present in the microvasculature ofsubchondral bone in joints with osteoarthritis, caus-ing osteonecrosis and pain. 13Even though the antico- agulant effects of PPS are signi cantly lower than heparin and it is cleared from plasma concentrationsrelatively quickly, it has been reported to improveblood flow in subchondral bone and reduce joint inflammation in animal model studies. 12,13In this study, at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg given systemically, PPSdid not cause any adverse events such as hemor-rhage or pain at injection site, thrombocytopenia,etc. PT/aPTT and brinogen levels are used to evaluate potential complications associated with anticoagulantproducts such as PPS. Pre- and postdosing meanvalues for PT levels were within reference range.Predosing mean values for aPTT were marginally andconsistently lower than the reference ranges in boththe PPS and saline groups. Different reagents and assay con gurations in fluence sensitivity, and this may explain why all predosing values were lower than the reference range. Post-treatment mean valueswere increased for the PPS-treated group but werestill within the reference range. There were 5 AEsreported for an increase of aPTT (all PPS-treatedhorses) and 1 AE reported to document prolongedaPTT (PPS-treated horse). These were consideredAEs based on the clinicopathologic data, not clinicalsymptoms. T h e r ew e r en or e p o r t e ds e r i o u sA E si nt h es t u d y ,a n d most AEs were considered transient and did not requiretreatment. The AEs reported by owners during theTable 3.

However, there were mar-ginally more AEs per subject noted in the PPS-treatedgroup compared to the saline-treated group. However, many AEs recorded in the PPS group had the relation- ship to treatment recorded as \"unlikely. \" In this study, 58.92% of the horses treated with PPS improved at least one grade of lameness. WhenPPS was evaluated in the osteochondral fragmentmodel, there was not a signi cant difference in lame- ness between control horses and horses treated withPPS. 2There were, however, indications of disease- modifying effects including decreased cartilage bril- lation. While the methodology of these two studies isquite different, the ndings of both studies are very relevant. In this study, enrollment criteria requiredradiographic evidence of OA. While this helps createa more homogenous study group, it does select formore advanced cases where subtle disease-modifyingeffects may not be evident. The improvement ofalmost 60% of the cases enrolled in this study is nota-ble because of the more advanced nature of casesbeing enrolled. Ultimate clinical use may be moreeffective earlier in the disease process. Where PPS isapproved for use, a survey of veterinarians indicated PPS had a higher ef cacy as a prophylactic drug than for treatment OA. respondents per- ceived PPS had moderate treatment ef cacy. This would suggest that the methodology of this study found a signi cant outcome in a challenging model of treating advanced OA with radiographic evidence ofdegeneration.5. Conclusion Pentosan polysulfate sodium administered at 3.0 mg/ kg intramuscularly once a week for 4 weeks is a safe and effective therapy for osteoarthritis in horses.

Author 's address: Colorado State University, 300 West Drake Road, Fort Collins, CO 80523; one of the most common causes of lameness and decreased per-formance in athletic horses. The disease is commonlyreferred to as proximal suspensory desmitis or desm-opathy, both of which indicate injury to the ligament.However, the disease process is much more complex and typically involves pathologic change to not only the ligament but also the bony origin, connective pal-mar/plantar fascia, and/or the nerve that innervatesthe region, the deep branch of the lateral plantarnerve. For the purposes of this discussion, PSD willrefer to the pathologic changes that involve the liga-ment as well as the surrounding tissues. This paperaims to discuss various options available to treat PSDand will review the scienti c literature for these treat- ment options when available. Treating PSD can be broken down in a variety of ways. One is to categorize treatments by purpose,such as treatments aimed to mitigate pain versustreatments designed to aid in tissue healing. Anotherway would be to group treatments by the tissue typeit is targeting, such as treatments targeting the liga-ment versus the bone versus the nerve. Ultimately, itis most important to identify which tissues areinvolved and design an individualized treatment planaccordingly. 2. Methods to Manage PSD Pain Management There has been a somewhat recent movement to change the terminology from proximal suspensorydesmitis todesmopathy in order to remove in flamma- tion from the description of the disease. While it istrue that the disease process is degenerative and oftennot primarily in flammatory in nature (at least not in the chronic phase when most horses present), itshould not be misconstrued as not being a painful con-dition. Despite the lack of pronounced in flammatory cells present in histopathology, anti-in flammatories are an important part of treating PSD clinicallyas they can decrease lameness. In acute cases, theauthor tends to treat with phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kgfor 3 to 5 days) prior to switching to rocoxib for lon- ger-term administration (57 mg q 24 PO), often untilsignicant improvement or resolution of clinical signs. Additionally, topical nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATIONdrugs (NSAIDs; 1% diclofenac cream) can be applied over the affected area, although it is questionable ifthe product can penetrate far enough to reach the sus- pensory ligament that lies several centimeters deep to the palmar/plantar skin surface. Although it has notbeen studied for PSD, 1% diclofenac cream, aapplied twice daily over the affected joint, was shown todecrease lameness in horses with experimentally induced carpal joint osteoarthritis.1 Cryotherapy is a useful pain management tool but is logistically dif cult unless one has access to a soak- ing boot as the majority of muck tubs and/or 5-gallon utility buckets are not tall enough to reach the proxi-mal aspect of the suspensory ligament, especially in ahindlimb. Submerging the limb in ice water is an effective way to cool deeper tissues, 2and there are commercially available soaking boots that are useful for this purpose. Commercially available pressurizedcold therapy bootsbhave also been shown to effec- tively cool deeper tissues and are a good choice for\"icing \"the proximal suspensory region. In the acute phase, icing for 20 to 25 minutes twice daily is helpfulin reducing pain. This should be implemented for atleast the rst 48 to 72 hours, and if the client is able, it can be continued for 10 to 14 days. Additionally, inthe chronic phase and/or during rehabilitation, cryo- therapy can help mitigate pain following exercise, in which case cryotherapy can be reduced to a single 20-to 25-minute session following exercise or followingmore rigorous exercise.Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy In the author 's practice, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is a cornerstone of treating PSD. Treatment (performed with an electrohydraulic- focused ESWT unit) typically consists of 800 to 1000 pulses with a 20-mm or 35-mm trode on energy E6 (0.15 mJ/mm2) performed every 7 to 14 days for a total of 3 treatments. Forelimb pulses are applied from a palmaromedial, palmar, and palmarolateral direction, but in the hindlimb, it is recommended to administer the pulses from a plantar and plantaromedial direc-tion. This is due to the fact that the size and place- ment of the fourth metatarsal bone precludes shockwaves from reaching the proximal suspensory ligament from a lateral approach (Fig. 1). Considering shockwave exerts the most effect at tissue interfaces,cases where there is pathologic change at the bone-lig- ament interface may be particularly good candidates for this treatment. Therst report of ESWT was in 2000 in a study of 30 horses with chronic (> 3 months) PSD. Horses were treated with 2000 pneumatic generated radial shock- waves at 0.16 mJ/mm 2energy every 2 to 4 weeks for 3 treatments.3Immediately following the rst treat- ment, 11 of the 30 horses were sound, and immedi-ately following the third treatment, 24 (80%) were sound. However, at the 6-month follow-up, only 16 horses remained sound, and 18 (60%) had resumedfull work. Crowe et al. also investigated the use of ra- dial shockwave (2000 impulses; 3 treatments spaced 2 weeks apart) in sport horses with chronic PSD andreported that 53% of 20 forelimb cases and 41% of 43 hindlimb cases were in full work at the 6-month fol- low-up. 4Lischer et al. provided longer follow-up in horses that were treated with a series of 3 focusedESWT treatments at 3-week intervals (2000 electro-hydraulic 2).5Of 34 forelimb cases, 21 (62%) had returned to full work at 6 months, but only 56% were in full work at 1 year. In hindlimb cases, 41% of 22 horses were in full work at 6 months compared to only 18% that were in full work at 1 year. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that ESWT appears to have better short-term versus long-term success. Unfortunately, none of the studies cited above were case controlled, which highlights the importance of the L\u00f6ffeld et al. study that compared horses that underwent radial pressure wave therapy to horsesthat were treated conservatively with rest and local inltration of corticosteroids.6Of 31 horses that underwent ESWT, 22 (71%) resumed full work at6 months compared to only 50% of 30 horses that were managed conservatively. Finally, a recent study in Western Performance horses ( n= 96) compared treatment with ESWT to treatment with platelet-rich plasma (PRP).7Horses were treated with either 800 unit, 20-mm probe, E6: 0.15 mJ/ mm2) or with injection of 3 to 6 mL of leukocyte-poor PRP into and around the suspensory ligament origin. Fig. 1. A cross-section of the proximal metatarsal region; lat- eral is to the right. Note the plantar extension of the fourth metatarsal bone (MT IV); this anatomic construction precludes access to the suspensory ligament with ultrasound or shockwave from a lateral approach. The asterisk marks the location of the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve. SDFT, 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSAt initial follow-up on day 4, horses in the ESWT group showed a mean improvement in lameness of 47% compared to a mean improvement of 33% in thePRP group. At 6 months, there were no differences in work level between the two groups, and at 1 year, 75% (18 of 24) of PRP-treated horses and 82% of (28 of 34)ESWT-treated horses were in full work. In this study, there was a trend for horses with more mild ultra- sound changes to respond better to ESWT and horseswith more severe ultrasound changes to respond bet- ter to PRP. In both treatment groups, the results at 1 year are superior to the majority of other studiesand may indicate that Western Performance horses have a better prognosis compared to other disciplines, such as English sport horses. Biologics There are multiple formulations and types of biologicp r o d u c t sa v a i l a b l ef o ru s ei ns o f tt i s s u ei n j u r i e s ,including PSD. Biologic products provide a varying array of growth factors and therefore may improve the quality of tissue repair. At the author 's institution, the most common biologic products used to treat PSD are PRP or bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Finances often dictate the selection asPRP is approximately one tenth the cost of MSCs. The primary indication for biologics is cases that have damage to the ligament, particularly if there is adened area of ber loss or disruption that allows for direct injection of a biologic product. In many cases, aseries of ESWT will be started, and if the results areunsatisfactory by the third treatment, an ultrasound- guided injection of PRP can be performed. It may be useful to apply the third shockwave immediately fol-lowing the PRP injection as ESWT can increase therelease of growth factors from platelets. 8 Stem cells have a distinct advantage over other bio- logics in the diversity of administration. In caseswhere there is enough ligament ber disruption to allow for direct injection, this would be the obvious choice. But in many cases of PSD, there is no distinct core lesion in which to inject biologics; in such cases,regional IV perfusion or intra-arterial injection with MSCs is an excellent choice. In many cases MSCs are delivered via multiple routes and/or repeated (typi-cally once monthly) as required. When used for intra- lesional injection, the author prefers to use ;20 million MSCs qs to 3 to 4 mL in Lactated Ringer 'ss o - lution as appropriate for the size of the lesion. Forintra-arterial and regional intravenous administra- tion, 30 million MSCs qs to 20 to 30 mL in LactatedRinger' s solution are used. Considering how frequently biologics are used to treat PSD, there is surprisingly little scienti c research to go along with it. The use of autologousbone marrow to treat chronic PSD was rst reported in 2001; of 100 sport horses, 84% were sound and92% were in full work 6 months after treatment. 9 Autologous bone marrow has also been used to treatacute forelimb suspensory body and branch lesions in racehorses.10Average time to return to racing was12 to 14 months, and 9 of 13 (69%) Standardbredsand 12 of 17 (71%) Thoroughbreds had 5 or more starts following treatment. Although this study pro-vides longer-term outcomes than most of the other studies that only followed horses to 6 months, the results may not be directly applicable as treatmentwas directed at the suspensory body and branches, rather than the proximal aspect, which carries a worse prognosis. A recent study examined the use of a combined allo- genic PRP (100 -150 million platelets) and peripheral bone MSC (2 -3 million MSCs) injectate to treat proxi- mal suspensory or suspensory branch desmopathy. 11 Of the 68 English sport horses in the study, 57 (84%) were competing at their previous level at 1 year, and 56 (82%) were still in full work and competition at2 years. The majority of these cases, however, were suspensory branch injuries rather than PSD. A meta- analysis from the same study found that stem-cell-treated groups had a signi cantly lower reinjury rate (18%) compared to other more conventional treat-ments (44%). When used by itself, the results of intralesional PRP are similar to the reports of bone marrow aspi- rate and/or MSCs, at least in the short term. 12 Twenty sport horses with acute forelimb PSD were treated with intralesional PRP q 2 weeks, as requiredfor near resolution of the lesion on ultrasound. Of t h e s e ,1 6( 8 0 % )w e r ea b l et or e t u r nt of u l lw o r k1 2t o 24 weeks after their last treatment. Finally, there hasbeen one study of 271 horses treated with a single injection of autologous conditioned serum (5 mL dif- fused to the palmar/plantar cortex of the proximalmetacarpal/tarsal bone at the suspensory ligament or- igin). 13Of 127 forelimb cases, 85% of unilateral cases and 82% of bilateral cases were sound 1 month after resuming full training. Of 144 hindlimb cases, 78% of unilateral and 71% of bilateral cases had maintained soundness for at least 30 days of full training. Longer-term follow-up was not presented. Unfortunately, the majority of studies discussed lack a control group and lack follow-up longer than 6 months. There appears tobe a pattern of better short-term and poorer long-term outcome regardless of treatment. Of the many biologic choices available, MSCs may provide the best oppor-tunity for improved long-term prognosis; however, more controlled studies over longer periods of time are needed. Surgery For hindlimb PSD, surgery is a common treatment.Surgery can involve a neurectomy (of the deep branchof the lateral plantar nerve), fasciotomy (of the plan- tar fascia), desmoplasty, and/or osteostixis. In the author 's experience, surgery is often not required for successful long-term management of PSD as the ma- jority of horses can be managed medically. However, for many practitioners, surgery is one of the primaryandrst treatment options. The largest report of surgical outcome comes from Dyson et al. reported on 155 horses that underwentSPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 299hindlimb neurectomy and fasciotomy.14The horses were grouped into 3 groups, with Group 1 having only PSD, Group 2 having PSD but also very straight hockconformation (hock angle 150\u00b0) sion of the fetlock angle 130\u00b0), and Group 3 having PSD and another concurrent issue (e. g., sacroiliac pain). Using return to the previous level of function for greater than 1 year as the outcomemeasurement, 70% (64/92) of the Group 1 horses were successful compared to none of Group 2 horses (0/5) and only 44% (23/52) of the Group 3 horses. The reha-bilitation protocol entailed 2 weeks of stall rest fol- lowed by 6 weeks of ridden walk exercise prior to gradual return to full exercise if soundness allowed. An important take home from this study is that not only did the 5 Group 2 horses fail to improve, but theyalso worsened based on ultrasound evaluation. The authors concluded that horses with excessively straight hindlimb and/or dropped fetlock conforma-tion (Fig. 2) are not good candidates for neurectomy and fasciotomy surgery. Some surgeons prefer to spare the nerve and only perform a fasciotomy, with the theory that decompres- sion alone will yield a satisfactory outcome. In a study of 27 horses with chronic (1 -12 months) PSD that underwent desmoplasty (fenestration of the ligamentlesion to the depth of the underlying plantar cortex of MTIII) and fasciotomy surgery, 23 (85%) were able toreturn to full work 5 to 18 months following surgery. 15 Osteostixis, in which 3 to 6 small holes (2 mm) aredrilled into the palmar/plantar cortex of MCIII/MTIII,does not seem to improve outcome as only 17 of 29 sport horses returned to competition at 6 months post- surgery. 16In an experimental study, horses treatedwith microfracture (and ligament splitting) did not show a signi cant difference in lameness through the 210-day study.17 Conversely, there are surgeries that only involve neurectomy. A tibial neurectomy was performed in 8horses, of which 6 (75%) were able to return to full athletic function for at least 2 years following sur- gery.18In the forelimb, limited but promising studies exist on excision of the deep branch of the lateral pal- mar nerve (DBLPaN). In an experimental study, 8 horses with collagenase-induced PSL in forelim- bs were sound 2 weeks after neurectomy of the DBLPaN.19In a case series of 4 horses with chronic forelimb PSD that failed medical management (con- sisting of 3 radial shockwave treatments at 2-week intervals, local injection of 10 mg triamcinolone, andincreasing exercise over 12 weeks), all were sound at 6 weeks and at 1 year following neurectomy of the DBLPaN.20Last, Bathe reported on the outcome of 26 horses that underwent neurectomy of the DBLPaN.21 Thirteen of 16 (81%) were in full work at 1 year and 8of 12 (67%) were in full work at 2 years following surgery. Bisphosphonates Although there is no literature reporting on the ef - cacy of bisphosphonate therapy in treating PSD spe- cically, the mechanism of action for this class of drugs lends promise for cases with involvement of the bony origin. Bisphosphonates are widely used in humans to combat osteoclast-mediated osseous resorption and more recently have been recognized as having anti-in flammatory effects as well.22,23In horses, there are only a few studies that investigated the ef cacy of bisphosphonates for treating navicular disease, distal hock joint osteoarthritis, and thoraco-lumbar back osteoarthritis.24-26The author routinely uses bisphosphonates in cases of PSD that involve the osseous origin of the suspensory ligament. Examples include sclerosis, osseous resorption, enthesophyte formation, and/or \"bone marrow edema\" of mal palmar/plantar aspect of the third metacarpal/ tarsal bone (Fig. 3). Two FDA-approved bisphospho- nates are available for use in horses (tiludronatecand clodronated). In adult horses, the author typically treats with a single dose of clodronated(1.8 mg/kg, not to exceed 900 mg IM, split into 3 injections sites). Safety data for both bisphosphonates demonstrate that an increase in serum kidney values can occur; there- fore, assessing blood urea nitrogen and creatinine prior to administration is advisable. Additionally, thesemedications should not be given in conjunction with NSAIDs as there may be an additive load on the renal system. Corticosteroid Injection Neuropathy of the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve (DBLPN) is a common component of the PSD disease \"complex. \"This is likely due to fact that PSD, particularly in hindlimbs, is a compartment-like syn-drome that could lead to compressive damage of the Fig. 2. Picture demonstrating a horse with excessively straight hindlimb conformation. Horses with this conformation are not good candidates for neurectomy fasciotomy surgery.SPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATION 300 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSDBLPN. In fact, in a study of 16 horses that under- went unilateral or bilateral DBPLN neurectomy, all DBLPN nerves excised from lame limbs showed histo- pathologic changes consistent with nerve compres- sion.27Therefore, cases of chronic PSD likely involve some degree of neuritis, and for this reason, directinjection of an anti-in flammatory may be indicated. Dyson opines that local injection of corticosteroids (with 4 to 6 weeks of onset) may decrease the compart- ment-like syndrome.28However, in the acute stage, there may also be more acute soft tissue injury, inwhich case local injection of corticosteroids may be contraindicate due to the potential for corticosteroidsto retard soft tissue healing. The author has had very good outcomes treating with focal in ltration of corti- costeroids (3 -6m g t r i a m c i n o l o n e q s t o ;4-5m L i n sterile saline) in cases where there is little to no liga- mentous change and/or in more chronic cases. Shoeing By design, the suspensory apparatus \"suspends \"the fetlock, which, if left to gravity, would hyper flex and sink to the ground. While not to that extreme, injury of the proximal aspect of the suspensory ligament leaves the normal biomechanics of the suspensorycompromised. It is well established that increasing the height of the heel will unload the deep digital flexor tendon and increase load on the super cial digi- talflexor tendon and the suspensory ligament. By the same theory, some practitioners chose to preferen-tially load the deep digital flexor tendon by lowering the heel of the shoe, theoretically lessening the loadon the suspensory apparatus, as is the case with the Denoix suspensory shoe. eThis author aims for good hoof pastern alignment and adequate palmar/plantar solar margin angles but does not intentionally lower the heels. Fetlock \"support \"is provided with a shoe that extends more palmar/plantar than normal withuse of an extended heel egg bar shoe, extended branch shoe, or even a shtail shoe (Fig. 4) in extreme cases. Rehabilitation One of the most central components in managing PSD involves a period of rest and controlled exercise, though the speci cs of such programs vary widely among practitioners. Gillis29provided one of the more detailed protocols for rehabilitation of soft tissueinjuries many years ago that generally outlined 30 minutes of hand walking a day for the rst 2 months and then increasing to 40 to 60 minutes ofwalk. For all but severe injuries, in the fourth and fth months, horses are walked under saddle for 30 and then 45 to 60 minutes daily, respectively. At 6 months, trot is typically introduced in increments of 5 minutes every other week for 4 weeks, followed by an addition of 5 minutes of canter every other week. The majority of horses would return to full flat work at 8 months and competition in 10 months. 29In the PSD literature, the majority of authors initiallyrestrict horses to box rest plus walking for 203,11,13to 60 minutes4,30daily. Trot is added as soon as 4 weeks by some11,13and 6, 8, and 12 weeks by others,3,4,30 with return to full exercise occurring anywhere from 312,21to 6 to 9 months.9,10,31Postsurgery rehabilita- tion typically consists of a period of strict stall rest for2 to 4 weeks before resuming trot work 4 to 8 weeks after surgery.14,17,20,21 Fig. 4.

This author typically employs hand walking (20 minutes daily) throughout the initial treatment period ( ;4 weeks), followed by increasing amounts of walking under saddle,increasing by 5 minutes of walk per week. Once the horse has achieved at least 30 minutes of walking under saddle, trot is introduced in 2.5- to 5-minute intervals per week, depending on the severity, with canter being added only once the horse has reached 20 minutes of trot work. Clients are generally advisedthat the horse will not return to full work for at least 6m o n t h sa n d ,i ns o m ec a s e s ,u pt oay e a r .O t h e rc o n - siderations for the controlled exercise program include working on level, flat, consistent surfaces, with the amount of exercise decreased by ;25% if the footing conditions are different than what the horse is accus- tomed to. For example, for horses that are walking for 30 minutes on rm footing but are then abruptly required to walk in deeper sand footing, it may be ad-visable to decrease walking to 22 to 25 minutes until the horse reconditions to the different footing over several weeks. There are many other techniques that are oft- en incorporated into a PSD rehabilitation plan. Unfortunately, many therapeutic modalities are mar- keted directly to the owner, often with unsubstanti- ated claims. However, two recent studies have shown signicant improvement in horses with suspensory branch lesions that were treated with high-powerlaser (once daily for 2 to 4 weeks). 32,33If a laser unit is available to the owner, the author prescribes its usedaily in acute cases or, in chronic cases, once daily for 3 days and then 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Simple, inexpensive techniques should also not be overlooked. Walking over ground poles, for example, can be employed later in the under-saddle walking portion of the program to increase proprioception and begin toexpose the suspensory ligament to varied range of motion and forces. Proprioceptive balance pads (which may be more appropriate after resolution of acute injury) and core strengthening exercises are incorpo- rated into many rehabilitation programs though are not necessarily speci ct oP S D . 3. Conclusion Proximal suspensory disease is a complicated and complex disease that involves the proximal aspect of the suspensory ligament, its osseous origin, the DBLPaN/DBLPN, and/or the connective fascia. The wide range of tissue types and pathology involved in PSD is likely to explain the wide variety of treat- ments that are employed to manage the disease. As studies demonstrate, hindlimb PSD is harder to manage and carries a poorer long-term prognosis than forelimb PSD. However, with the combinationof shockwave, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, shoeing, and rehabilita- tion considerations, most cases can be successfully managed without surgical intervention. However,surgery carries a good prognosis that is at least equivalent to management with shockwave and/or biologics and is also a valid treatment option. The author has managed hundreds of cases of PSD, mostly in English performance horses, with a successrate similar to those reported in the literature, which underscores the variety of ways that PSD can be managed in performance horses.

Introduction Blood flow restriction (BFR) has become a key reha- bilitative tool for human orthopedic conditions, but safety validation for use in the horse is lacking. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine if BFR exposure resulted in biomechanical gait de ciencies and 2) to investigate intra- and inter-horse limb occlu-sion pressure (LOP) differences. 2. Materials and Methods Daily forelimb BFR exposure was performed in fourhorses over a 56-day study period with clinicalexaminations and objective gait analysis performedon study days 0, 28 and 56. Daily LOP values weredetermined by Doppler evaluation to deliver 80%vascular occlusion while at a walk. 3. Results Signi cant differences in kinematic and kinetic gait parameters over time were not appreciated. Signi-cant differences between mean LOP values between horses and forelimbs were observed. Mean LOP andstandard deviation across all readings was 189.1 +/ /C0 22.2 mm Hg. 4. Discussion Results indicate that BFR exposure did not negatively impact the normal biomechanical gait parametersassessed in four horses and all BFR sessions werewell tolerated. Clinically apparent complicationsrelated to BFR such as forelimb lameness, thrombo-sis, or dermatitis were not appreciated. This data sug-gests that occlusion pressures of 75-151 mm Hg wouldlikely simulate a range of 50-80% vascular occlusionin horses, but inherent physiologic variation warrants incorporation of individual pressures for optimized BFR application.

Authors ' addresses: University of Kentucky, 108 Gluck Equine Research Center, Lexington, KY 40546(Partridge, Adam, Parker, Johnson, Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids are commonly used t oc o m b a tt h es e q u e l a eo fj o i n td i s e a s ei ne q u i n ea t h -letes resulting from the high-intensity nature of theirdisciplines. These therapeutic drugs have long been apopular choice to treat joints given they are highlypotent and effective medications used to control painand in flammation. There is concern, however, that the long-lasting effects of corticosteroids may maskclinical signs associated with underlying musculoskel-etal injuries, leading to their exacerbation duringexercise and competition. Importantly, in the contextof Thoroughbred racing, underlying musculoskeletalinjuries put the safety of the horse and rider at risksince most catastrophic injuries occur when under-lying pathology is present. With recent work by multi-ple groups examining the messenger RNA (mRNA)response to exercise and injury in horses, it is neces-sary to better understand the residual effects that IA corticosteroids may have on mRNA expression, as well as other in flammatory parameters, in horses. 2. Materials and Methods Five mixed-breed, 2-year-old horses were utilized forthis study, and all IA injections were conducted14 days apart. One radiocarpal joint was asepticallyinjected randomly with 9 mg of either betamethasoneor triamcinolone acetonide (TA). Two weeks followingtreatment, horses were injected with 1 mg (1,000 ng) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) diluted in 1 mL of sterile Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 308 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATIONsaline. Following treatment, horses were crossed-over and treated with the other drug followed by a subse-quent LPS injection at the same 14 day intervals. Additional injections with saline-only or LPS-only were conducted as negative and positive controls,respectively. Blood samples were collected at multipletime points for RNA isolation and qPCR expressionanalysis, as well as cortisol determination, serumamyloid A (SAA) quanti cation, complete blood cell counts, and blood biochemistry analysis. Addi-tionally, lameness was subjectively scored andrecorded at the same time points. Two-way repeatedmeasures analysis of variance was used to analyzeall data with p<0.05 considered signi cant. 3. Results At 14 days post-treatment, horses treated with tri- amcinolone acetonide had evidence of a residual anti-in flammatory effect based on IL-6 and PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase-1) expression. Additionally, TA treated horses experienced less severe and signi - cantly shorter periods of lameness, as well as lower peak SAA and serum cortisol concentrations, com- pared to times when the joints were not treated. Similar residual treatment effects with betametha-sone were not noted, except for differences in IL-6 expression. Intra-articular injection with either beta-methasone or TA was noted to have a profound effecton serum cortisol concentrations, with cortisol exhib-iting signi cant suppression 48 hours (betame- thasone) and 120 hours (TA) post-treatment. 4. Discussion Despite utilizing a model for acute synovitis that is more severe than those previously reported by others, ndings from this study suggest that the commonly corticosteroid, triamcinolone acetonide, retains signicant anti-in flammatory effects at least 14 days af- ter administration. Within the context of racing andcompetition requirements, these ndings suggest that current guidelines may be insuf cient if the regulatory concern is residual anti-infl ammatory effects following treatment. Furthermore, ndings from this project dem- onstrate that the administration of intra-articular corti- costeroids are not without risk, as evidenced by the signicant and prolonged suppression of serum cortisol concentration, and, as such, the bene ts of their adminis- tration should be weighed against those risks.

Introduction The intricate balance and equilibrium that exists in the interconnectedness of the digital structures of thehealthy foot can be thrown out of synchronicity byinjury, disease, genetic factors, overload, environ-ment, and/or human interference, resulting in a cas-cading series of events in fluenced by body weight and the action of the deep digital flexor tendon, causing altered growth patterns and hoof capsule distortion. 1-3 It has been described that approximately two-thirds ofhorses have mismatched feet where usually one is flat and the other one is upright.4Contrary to popular belief, the upright or club foot is not a foot problem; itis a muscle problem that manifests in the foot. It is the result of signi cantly increased tension on the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) due to hypercontraction of the deep digital flexor muscle bers that results in hyper flexion of the cof nj o i n t .3,5,6Unlike laminitis, the laminae antagonist is healthy. It is the tendon pull that is abnormally strong, creating an imbalancein the suspension system of the third phalanx. Thoughthe cause is different from laminitis, many of theeffects are similar: unrelenting contraction thatincreases palmar angle (PA), which causes vascularcompromise in areas of the foot that receive abnor-mal compressive forces. 7Sole corium compression inhibits papillae function, which compromisesadequate sole growth underneath the apex of thethird phalanx. This routinely leads to rapid remodel-ing of the palmar rim (load induced lesions) andremodeling along the face of the cof n bone. 3,8Thebending and compressive forces can also create a toe fla r ei nt h eh o r nw a l l .T h ee x c e s sh e e li st h er e s u l to f suspension of the posterior aspect of the bone, whichallows for uninhibited heel growth. This lack of inter-nal load results in narrow heels, recessed frog, andthick digital cushion. 2,9,10This is grossly evidenced by observing the foot, where it is common to see highheels, growth rings wider at the heels than at the toe,and a toe flare. 3The club foot syndrome is a condition that is managed rather than treated, and like lamini- tis, the optimum approach is dependent on multiple factors. It is important to remember that while a clubfoot can be healthy, it will still be a club and require a different management protocol. Therefore, attempting to eliminate it by making the exterior of the foot \"look \" normal does not change the fact that the condition isstill present. Once the heel has been removed with trimming, instead of resting on the ground, the heel remains slightly off the ground with load being trans-ferred to the toe. 3,7Attempting to make a club foot look normal is highly counterproductive, as the forcesthat created it in the rst place are often increased.7 2. Materials and Methods There is scarce information in the veterinary litera- ture regarding the management of a mature horse with a club foot. Farriery to maintain or improve theclub foot is often empirical and based on past experi-ence. To apply the appropriate farriery, understanding the proposed mechanism leading to this conformation is very valuable. Traditional farriery management for NOTES 310 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATIONupright or club feet has been directed at trimming the heels to shift the load caudally and at reducing break- over, but the amount of heel to remove can be dif cult to determine.3,10Often, the addition of heel elevation following the trim is necessary to compensate for theshortening of the musculotendinous unit. It has beendescribed that the degree of wedge that is applied oftenmimics the amount of heel removed, which can be asubjective approach, and clear information as to itseffectiveness unloading the toe and promoting even hoof growth is not readily available. 10When dealing with upright or low-grade club feet, the author has found that the mechanical advantages provided by therocker or banana shoe are very valuable to counteractthe abnormal forces acting upon these feet. 8,11The mar- ket has several options of shoes that provide built-inmechanics (rocker or banana shape) on the ground sur-face, while the foot surface remains flat. This approach will provide a certain amount of relief of the tension of the DDFT by providing a reduced breakover, but it is still a flat shoe. Working as a veterinarian with an em- phasis in equine podiatry, the author has the opportu-nity to radiograph the feet of patients on a regularbasis, and it has been repeatedly observed that eitherwith a flat shoe (even if it has mechanics on the ground surface) or with the traditional methods of dealing withupright/club feet, it is common to nd that the distance between the apex of the cof nb o n ea n dt h es h o ei sl e s s than the distance between the wings of the cof nb o n e (posterior area) and the shoe, thus creating uneven loaddistribution over the sole (Fig. 1). Also it is common tond longer breakover distances (toe ahead of the apexof third phalanx), especially if the shoeing is tted to the toe and if the shoe does not provide suf cient mechanics on the ground surface. The leverage caused by the longer breakover is one of the principal causes of hoof distortions. 7 As a consequence, and aided by the increased pull of the DDFT that characterizes this condition, therewill be a constant uneven blood perfusion to the solar corium, where less blood reaches the toe in compari- son to the heels, giving the heels the elements to haveincreased growth, thus promoting the clubby charac-teristics of these feet. 7,8,10 As explained before, if the management approach is based on lowering the heels, trying to make thefoot look \"normal \"or to match the other foot as it has been suggested by some literature,12it will cre- ate an increased tension on the DDFT, which will increase the pulling forces over the cof n bone obliterating the blood perfusion over the toe area, creating a negative vicious cycle where the horsehas less toe growth and more heel growth.9,10Many times, these horses will not put their heels downafter trimming, because of the pain caused by thepull of the tendon (soft tissue strain, solar coriumcompression, lamellar stretching and pressure over the navicular bone). In order to remove the excess heels yet avoid the complications previously des-cribed, it is fundamental to compensate what was removed by using a wedge 5,10or, in this case, an \"air wedge \"provided by the rocker or banana shoe (Figs. 2 and 3).8,13 Fig. 1. A club foot shod flat. It is evident how the distance between the apex of the third phalanx and the shoe is less than the distance between the posterior area of the third phalanx and the shoe creating a positive capsular palmar angle which in this case promotes uneven load distribution over the sole.

When dealing with upright feet, the mechanics in the foot should beachieved by trimming the heels, rolling them backf r o mt h ew i d e s tp a r to ft h ef o o tt ot h ew i d e s tp a r to fthe frog instead doing it flat and all the way from the toe (how it is commonly taught). The use of radio-graphic guidance is very helpful, as it is possible tomark the trim by applying radiopaque paste on themedial heel and checking with a radiograph to con-rm if it matches the palmar rim of the bone, like in Figure 2. Putting the mechanics (rocker shape) intothe shoe in order to properly match the trim should bea methodical procedure. Rocker Jigs (metal plate withconcave bend) seem to be the most appropriate tool toforge the rocker shape into the shoe, but there areother, more accessible ways like cams 1 3/8 in. apartor even the step of the anvil. The rocker is forged,starting at the heel of the shoe and working the ham-mer toward the toe one branch at a time. 14It is ideal to obtain an evenly distributed concave bend thatmatches the trim and avoid a \"V\"shape in the shoe, which can make the foot sit flat in one of the sides, especially toward the end of the shoeing cycle (Fig. 3B). The author has experienced that the rocker shoe, which has also been referred to as self-adjustingpalmar angle shoe, if applied correctly, allows the horse to \"rock \"forward, thus relieving the tension of the DDFT, while achieving a desired distal bony col-umn alignment. 8,11,13The secret to success in this pro- tocol is in the application. The trim needs to matchthe shoe, and the belly or support of the shoe has to be Fig. 4. The center of rotation (blue line) of the foot is located and how this should coincide with the \"belly \"or support of the rocker shoe. Fig. 3. A, Placement of the rocker shoe to match the trim and create a 0 capsular PA which will provide an even load distribution over the sole. B, Mechanics of the rocker shoe are achieved by creating an even concave shape with the support close to the center of the shoe.SPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATION 312 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSunderneath the center of rotation (COR) of the foot, for the horse to maximize the ability to utilize themechanics while presenting even, robust hoof growth.The COR is the point of convergence of the loadingforces of the horse 's bodyweight upon the foot, and it is found by drawing a vertical line from the center ofthe lateral condyle of the distal middle phalanx to theground. This can be explained by basic biomechanics and the fact that a concave uniform belly that sits underneath the center of rotation makes both theflexor and extensor moment arms achieve an equilib- rium, and with the absence of resistance that theshape of the shoe provides, the \"self-adjusting\" bene- ts are made possible (Fig. 4). Another crucial aspect of the banana shoe with this proposed application is that the breakover point willbe located right underneath the apex of P3, guaran- teeing no leverage over the hoof laminae, and providing a biomechanically ef cient breakover process while avoiding the formation of a toe flare. If properly applied, the horse will stand comfortablymanaging the mechanics without any tendency torock forward or backward (Fig. 5). 3. Results In summary, it is the author 's experience that the rocker shoe applied on an upright foot trimmed tomatch the mechanics of the shoe will provide agood possibility to obtain a uniformly distributedblood perfusion to the sole, which will promoteeven sole growth and protect the foot from negativebiomechanical forces that can affect its health. The goals of this application are to obtain the desir- able bene ts of a 0 capsular PA while maintaining a positive ground PA and to place the belly or sup-port of the shoe underneath the center of rotationwith the breakover point underneath the apex of P3. Upon achieving these parameters, it has beennoted that the horses can adjust their PA to onewhere they seem to be comfortable and decreasethe pulling forces of the DDFT (Figs. 6 and 7). Theauthor has yet to experience considerable problemsrelated to instability of the foot and rocking backduring the stance phase of the stride with thisapplication, and the consensus among several clini-cians consulted, who have vast experience with theuse of this approach, is the same. It has also beendescribed as advantageous for the performance ofsport horses, but correct timing and application Fig. 5.

Monitoring the precision in which the desired parameters are achieved through radio- logical control with pre-, intra-, and postshoeing radi-o g r a p h si so fg r e a tv a l u et os e tt h i n g su pf o rt h e desired outcome, while being able to provide radiolog- ical follow up throughout several shoeing cycles is the best way of knowing if these efforts are proving to be successful or not, and to have the opportunity to make the necessary adjustments in a timely manner (Fig. 8). 4. Discussion Although the use of the rocker or banana shoe is not a new therapeutic shoeing technique, in the latter years, it has been more regularly used by a greater number of clinicians who have found value in it. For those familiar with the procedure, it has proven to be a very valuable tool to manage upright or low-gradeclub feet, as it appears to give a greater biomechani- cal advantage when compared to other approaches that have been described. With the use of this tech- nique, long-term maintenance and soundness has been provided to many horses and is believed to be something that should be more widely considered in regular practice. The cons to this approach are thatit requires a certain degree of skill in its application and it is somewhat out of the ordinary, which may lead to some skepticism by those who do not fully understand the principles behind it and who have not experienced its bene tsrsthand. Also, on many occasions, the use of radiographs as part of the pro-cess is important to check if the application isproviding the parameters required to obtain the desired results. Nonetheless, once a certain level of skilland familiarity has been achieved, the use of this tech-nique with low-grade mechanics is not radiographicallydependent. In the majority of cases, this therapeuticapproach may need to be utilized for the rest of the patient 's life, as the club foot is not a condition that will normally resolve.

Introduction The welfare of horses engaged in equestrian sport is currently in the spotlight after the Tokyo Olympicsand the subsequent dropping of riding from theOlympic modern pentathlon; 1the debate about 3 or 4 in an Olympic team, in particular for showjumping andeventing;2the recent unsuccessful litigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) against aDutch dressage rider for excessive of the neck); 3the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale 's (FEI) suspension of a Brazilian dres- sage rider for abusing his daughter 'sp o n y ;4the FEI 's suspension of an American showjumper for the useof electric spurs;5the rapping allegations against a German showjumper;6and the suspension of a trainer, former world class event rider, by the British Horse-racing Authority for beating a horse during a cross-country training session. 7There has never been a greater need for the equine industry to act proactivelyto protect the future of equestrian sports. The Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) was developed as a tool to facilitate the identi cation ofmusculoskeletal pain in ridden sports horses (dres- sage, showjumping, and eventing) when performingdressage-type movements. 8It comprises 24 behaviors (Table 1), the majority of which are at least 10 timesmore likely to be seen in a horse with musculoskelet-al pain than in a nonlame horse. The median RHpE score of nonlame horses was 2/24 (range = 0 -6), whereas lame horses had a median RHpE score of 9/24 (range = 4- 14). 8An RHpE score of 8/24 indi- cates the presence of pain, althoughsome lame horses have an RHpE score <8/24.8-11 The substantial reduction in RHpE scores observedafter abolition of lameness using diagnostic anesthe- sia indicates a causal relationship between these behaviors and pain.9,12Other factors with a positive association with the RHpE score are tight tree pointsof the saddle compared with a correctly tting sad- dle,11the rider sitting on the caudal one third of the saddle rather than in the middle of the saddle,11and rider weight as a proportion of the horse 'sb o d y weight.13For accurate application and interpretation of the RHpE, horses should be evaluated working for 5to 10 minutes after appropriate warm-up.8,14The horse NOTES 316 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATIONshould perform walk, trot, and canter around the pe- riphery of the arena and in circles of 20 m and 10 m di-ameter to include repeated transitions and the horse 's full repertoire of work (for example, canter pirouettesfor a Grand Prix dressage horse). 14A trained observer demonstrated excellent repeat- ability of the application of the RHpE when assessing video recordings of 9 anonymized horses evaluated in random order on two occasions.8Excellent agree- ment was achieved when a different trained observerTable 1.

It may also be useful to add comments such as tail swishing only occurred in synchrony with spur cues or increased head behind vertical in canter. In addition, comments about gaits provide further information, such as lame right fore 2/8 in right half-pass or canter lacks suspension.SPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 317applied the RHpE to 20 horses in real time or by assessment of video recordings.15Nontrained observ- ers (n= 10) of different professional backgrounds were able to differentiate between nonlame and lame horses based on application of the RHpE to videorecordings. 12Equine veterinarians (n = 10) of variable experience were, after preliminary video-based train- ing, able to differentiate between horses with low- grade lameness and nonlame horses assessed in realtime using the RHpE. 15When comparing the 10 equine veterinarians and an experienced observer,there was also excellent consistency in overall agree-ment for total RHpE scores among raters (intraclasscorrelation coef cient = 0.97, p<0.001), and for exact agreement between individual observers, there wasgood to moderate agreement (intraclass correlationcoefcient = 0.7, p<0.001). Rider skill cannot mask the behavioral signs of musculoskeletal pain. 16Forty horses were ridden by the normal rider of each horse and a single skilled pro- fessional rider in random order, performing a standar-dized dressage-type test of 8.5 minutes' duration. Rider skill altered gait quality, with overall higher gait quality scores for the professional rider. The pro- fessional rider had a variable in fluence on the pres- ence or absence of lameness and gait abnormalities in canter. However, there was no signi cant difference in the mean RHpE scores when ridden by the normal rider compared with the professional rider, althought h e r ew e r es o m ed i f f e r e n c e si nt h eb e h a v i o r se x h i b i t e d by the horses. Studies in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have shown that at least 50% of the sports horse and leisure horse populations show lame- ness6abnormalities of canter, especially when rid- den. 17-20The welfare of sports horses is under increasing scrutiny as the social license to compete with horses is debated widely.21-25Several studies have investigated the relationship between RHpEscores and the performance of sports horses.26-30The aim of this review is to summarize these studies and to comment on their clinical relevance to the sports horse veterinary practitioner, who is the ultimate guardianof sports horse welfare. 2. 5-Star 3-Day Events Pilot data were acquired at the Burghley ConcoursComplet Internationale (CCI) 4-star (now 5-star) eventin 2018. 26A convenience sample of 35 horses, compet- ing in consecutive order on the second day of dressage, were each assessed for a minimum of 10 minutes dur- ing trot and canter in the late stages of warm-up. TheRHpE was applied by a trained observer. Cross-coun-try performance was obtained from the competition website; horses were classi ed as completing, elimi- nated, or retired. The median RHpE score for 27 non- lame horses was 2/24 (interquartile range [IQR] = 0 -3; range = 0 -4). The median RHpE score for 8 horses with gait abnormalities (lameness or abnormalities ofcanter) was 7.5/24 (IQR = 4- 8; range = 3- 9). The RHpE score was 8/24 in only 4 horses. Thirty-four horses started cross-country, of which 35% were elimi-nated or retired. The proportion of horses failing tocomplete was signi cantly higher for those with RHpE scores 7/24 compared with scores <7/24. Of 28 horses with an RHpE score <7/24, 8 (29%) were elimi- nated or retired. Of 6 horses with an RHpE score7/24, 4 (67%) were eliminated or retired. The pilot study highlighted that in a cohort of highly trained event horses competing at 5-star level,it may be useful to use a slightly lower total RHpEscore as an indicator of possible in fluence on perform- ance, rather than the score of 8/24, previously iden- tied as a reliable score for differentiating sports horses competing at a variety of levels, from unaf li- ated to elite, with and without musculoskeletalpain. 8,9,11,12 Additional data were acquired for all starters (n= 137) warming up for the dressage phase of two CCI 5-star events (Badminton May 2019, n=7 0 ; Burghley September 2019, n= 67).27Episodic, mild ( grade 2/8)31forelimb an RHpE score 8/24. The median score for horses with neither lameness nor abnormalities ofcanter was 3/24 (range = 0 -9), compared with a median score of 5/24 (range = 1 -9) for horses with gait abnormalities. Horses with lameness orabnormalities of canter had a signi cantly higher RHpE score compared with other horses. There was a moderate correlation between the RHpE scores for individual horses that competed atboth events. The overall frequency of occurrence of each of the behaviors comprising the RHpE is sum- marized in Table 2. There was a moderate positive cor-relation between dressage penalty scores (the meanvalue for the 3 judges [the Ground Jury]) and theRHpE score. The proportion of horses failing to com-plete the cross-country phase was higher for horseswith an RHpE score 7(n= 10/17; 59%) an RHpE score <7(n= 39/117; 33%). There was a strong trend toward a higher RHpE scorefor horses that did not complete (median = 4) com-pared with those that did complete (median = 3) thecross-country phase. There was a higher RHpE scorefor horses that retired during the cross-countryphase compared with those that completed but nodifference between eliminations and retirements.There was no relationship between the RHpE score and total showjumping penalties. There was a signif- icant weak correlation 0 ) . horses with higher RHpE scores had higher dressage penalties and lower overall nish pla- ces. Combining the data from the pilot study andthe main study ( n= 172), 63% of horses with an RHpE score 7/24 failed to complete cross-country,SPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATION 318 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGScompared with 31% with a score <7/24. This suggests that musculoskeletal pain may be a contributory fac- tor for elimination (because of a horse or rider fall, 4 cumulative refusals, or 3 refusals at a single fence) or retirement in the cross-country phase. 3. British Eventing 90, 100, and Novice 1-Day Events British Eventing (BE) 1-day events comprise dressage, showjumping, and cross-country phases, with the maxi- mum height of cross-country fences being 0.90 m, 1.0 m, and 1.10 m for BE 90, 100, and Novice classes, respec- tively. The RHpE was applied by a single trained ob- server to 1010 competition starters (841 horses and 708 riders) during the dressage phase at a convenience sam- ple of BE 90 ( n= 204 starters), BE 100 ( n= 450 starters), and Novice ( n= 356 starters) 1-day events in 2021 and compared with performance.28BE 90 competitors were exclusively amateur riders, including a small proportionof children 12 years of age, whereas BE 100 and Novice participants were amateur or professionalriders, including Olympic, World, and European Championships competitors. Overall, there was a low frequency of occurrence of overt lameness (8.6%) of variable degree ( grade 4/8), 31but poor hindlimb impulsion and engagement were observed in 38.1% of competition starts, andcanter was abnormal in the majority (61.0%). The overall median RHpE score was 4/24 (IQR = 2 -6; range = 0 -12). The median RHpE score was higher (5/24; IQR = 3 -7; range = 0- 12) for BE 90 competitors, compared with BE 100 (median = 4/24; IQR = 2- 5; range = 0 -12) and Novice (median = 3.5/24; IQR = 2-5; range = 0- 11). There were signi cant differences in the total RHpE scores between BE 90 and both BE100 ( p<0.001) and Novice ( p<0.001) levels but not between BE 100 and Novice levels. This was associ- ated with a higher and impulsion(48.0%), and stumbling (12.9%) in BE 90 starters com- pared with BE 100 and Novice. The frequency of occurrence of each behavior of the RHpE is summar-ized in Table 1. There were moderate positive correlations between RHpE scores and dressage penalty scores. There wereweak positive correlations between RHpE scores and nal placings. In showjumping, 1.7% of starters were eliminated or retired, compared with 9.8% of cross- country starters. Horse or rider falls occurred in 2.6%of cross-country starts. Horses placed rst, second, or third in each section had lower RHpE scores (medi-an = 2/24, IQR = 1 -4; range = 0- 8) than other horses that nished (median = 4/24; IQR = 2- 6; range =Table 2.

The proportion of horses placed rst to third with an RHpE score 8w a sl o w - est (2%), followed by those with lower nish placings (9.9%), and was highest for those that failed to com- plete (11.3%). It was concluded that RHpE scores were associated with dressage and cross-country per-formances and with nal placings for horses that com- pleted at each level of competition, despite variabilityin rider skill levels. RHpE scores were higher at BE90 level compared with BE 100 and Novice in associa-tion with a higher frequency of occurrence of gait abnormalities. 4. Grand Prix Dressage Competitions World Cup Grand Prix Dressage The aim of the rst study was to apply the RHpE to elite dressage horses competing at World Cup Grand Prix qualifying competitions ( n=7 )o r nals (n = 2) from 2018 to 2020.29It was hypothesized that this should be a group of horses with a low incidence of musculoskeletal pain and thus RHpE scores would be consistently <8/24. Additional objectives were to compare RHpE scores with judges 'percentage scores (the mean score for 5 judges at qualifying competitions and 7 judges atnals) and to compare these and other observations con- cerning gait with the guidelines for judging FEI dres- sage.32The RHpE was applied by a trained observer to video recordings of 150 competitors at 9 venues. Freehand notes described additional observations. Three horses were eliminated because of forelimb lameness ( n= 1) or blood in the mouth ( n=2 ) . O f 1 4 7 competitors that completed the test, transient mild(grade 2/8)31forelimb lameness was seen in 14 (9.5%) in extended trot, half-pass, or passage; 17 com-petitors (11.6%) showed unilateral or bilateral hind-limb toe drag in passage or extended trot. Nine competitors (6.1%) exhibited variable spatial and tem- poral separation of the hindlimbs in sequence flying changes. The median RHpE score for completed tests was 3 (IQR = 1 -4; range = 0 -7). There was a moderate negative correlation between the RHpE scores and the judges 'percentage scores. The median RHpE score for the top ranked 5 competitors at each venuewas 2 (range = 0 -6), compared with the overall me- dian score of 3 (range = 0 -7). Mouth open with sepa- ration of the teeth for 10 seconds (68%), head behind vertical 10\u00b0 for 10 seconds (67%), an intense stare for 5 seconds (30%), and repeated tail swishing (29%) were the most frequent RHpE behav-iors (Table 2).Deviations from FEI guidelines were most frequent in passage, piaffe, canter flying changes, canter pirou- ettes, and trot. \"The majority of competitors (61.9%, n= 91) showed gait abnormalities in passage and/or piaffe. T h em o s tf r e q u e n tm o d i cation of passage was the almost simultaneous placement of the hindlimbs to the ground. There were numerous variable modi ca- tions of piaffe as horses attempted to redistribute load. Canter flying changes (one time and/or two times) were incorrect, characterized by swinging excessivelyfrom side to side, missed changes, being croup high, orrepeated close temporal and spatial placement of thehindlimbs in 30 competitors (20.4%). Canter pirouettes were abnormal in 18 competitors (12.2%), usually characterized by close temporal placement of the hin-dlimbs and often associated with the head being con- siderably behind a vertical position. The most frequent errors in \"halt-immobility-rein back 5 steps-collected trot \"were halt not at marker (n = 25; 17.1%), halt not square ( n= 52; 35.6%), rein back mouth open of the teeth ( n= 48; head behind n= 34; 23.3%).

The RHpE was applied to video recordings of Grand Prix dressage tests at an international event forinvited riders (Event A, n= 38) and the British Dressage Grand Prix National Championships (Event B, n= 26) in 2020. The frequency of gait abnormalities in trot andcanter, each of the 24 behaviors of the RHpE, and the correctness of movements according to FEI Guidelines were compared between World Cup competitors andcompetitors at Events A and B. The median RHpE scores were 4 (IQR = 3 -6; range = 0 -8) and 6 (IQR = 4 -7; range = 1 -9), for Events A and B, respectively, both higher ( p=0 . 0 0 1 1 and p= 0.0000) than World Cup competitors 'scores. Median RHpE scores were also higher in horses competing at Event B compared with Event A (p= 0.0267).

There was no of cial judging at Event A. At Event B, there was a moderate negative correlation between the mean of the 5 dressage judges' percentage scores and the RHpE scores. It was concluded that in elite and sub-elite Grand Prix dressage competitions, there is an associationbetween RHpE scores and performance, with higherRHpE scores correlated with lower percentage marks. T h eR H p Es c o r e sw e r eh i g h e rf o rt h es u b - e l i t eh o r s e s compared with the elite horses associated with ahigher frequency of occurrence of gait abnormalities. 5. Discussion At upper-level international 3-day events and Grand Prix dressage and at lower levels of competition, there were signi cant associations between RHpE scores and performance. The median RHpE scores were lowest, with a smaller score range at the highest level of competi-tion, particularly for those horses that showed no evi-dence of musculoskeletal discomfort (Table 3). Atlower levels of competition, there was a higher fre- quency of occurrence of lameness and/or abnormal- ities of canter compared with the elite dressage andevent horses. At elite levels of both dressage andeventing, the lameness that was observed was low grade ( 2/8) 31and intermittent, often only being observed in more demanding move- ments (e.g., half-pass). However, in lower-level event-ing, particularly at BE 90 level, lameness was often more consistently apparent and more severe ( 4/8).31 Although judges at any level can advise that a horse is withdrawn or undergoes veterinary inspection at a1-day or 3-day event before being allowed to start the cross-country phase, in practice, this infrequently occurs. Such inspections can be misleading because atsuch assessments, horses are only evaluated moving in hand, and a large proportion of horses that appearlame when ridden do not show lameness in hand. 11,17 The rules and their interpretation vary somewhat between disciplines. For FEI dressage competitions, the judge at C (usually the President of the Ground Jury) can eliminate a horse showing \"marked \"lameness, and no appeal is allowed.33Under FEI rules for 3-day events, \"The Ground Jury, in consultation with the Veterinary Delegate, has the right and the duty to elimi-nate any Horse which, in their opinion, is lame or isuntt oc o n t i n u e . ...Riding a lame horse constitutes abuse.\" 34Under BE rules, \"If the judge considers the h o r s et ob em a r k e d l yl a m eh es h o u l ds t o pt h et e s ta n dconsult with the BE Steward and the VeterinaryOfcer. At the discretion of the BE Steward following such consultation, the combination may be eliminatedor allowed to complete the test and any unevenness ofpace penalised appropriately. \" 35 The median RHpE scores across disciplines and lev- els of competition provide evidence that many horses are competing comfortably, and thus, in general, these studies support the social license for the use of sportshorses in competition. This is of increasing impor-tance, highlighted by recent litigation in which ahigh-pro le European dressage rider was unsuccess- fully accused of horse abuse by PETA 3and by a call for equestrian sports to be removed from the Olympic Games.36However, the current studies do demon- strate that clearly a proportion of horses are compet- ing despite musculoskeletal discomfort, and there arecogent arguments for appropriate clinical investiga-tion to determine the source(s) of pain and to developboth treatment and management plans. Reduction inpain may result in improvement in both performance and equine welfare. There are many potential causal factors of discomfort including primary musculoskel-etal pain, pain induced by the tack, the rider 'sw e i g h t distribution, and the way cues are applied by a rider.The reason(s) in any particular horse could only bedetermined by careful clinical assessment by a groupof suitably quali ed professionals. However, this requires that the presence of a potential problem isrecognized by the team producing the horse and thatappropriate advice is sought. Further education ofTable 3.

The evaluation of thequality of the gaits and transitions, combined withapplication of the RHpE, may facilitate earlier detec- tion of problems. It is important to recognize that abnormalities of canter are often pain related, despitethe absence of overt lameness. 37,38 The overall performance of both event horses and dressage horses re flects their training, how they are pre- sented by their riders, rider strength, the method ofapplication of cues, tness, neuromuscular coordination, misinterpretation of cues by the horse, external stres-sors, and freedom from discomfort. Given the high fre-quency of occurrence of the head being behind a verticalposition 10\u00b0 throughout a large proportion of the test in horses competing in both dressage and eventing (Table 2; Figs. 1A -D), irrespective of level, it seems likely that this to some extent re flects training, but it does not necessarily indicate the practice of rollkur. 39Thebiomechanical effects of the head positioned 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 behind the vertical on the long-term function of the restof the body and musculoskeletal health have not beeninvestigated scienti cally, but there are persuasive argu- ments against it based on repeated clinical observa- tions. 40-42This head and neck position is likely to compromise engagement of the muscles of the thoracic sling and the abdominal \"core \"muscles and to limit movement of the thoracolumbosacral region and hind-limb impulsion and engagement. These are all factors that may predispose to the development of musculoskel- etal discomfort. Improved awareness among riders,trainers, and veterinarians about how training methodscan in fluence movement patterns, muscle development, and risk of injury is required. However, the higher frequency of occurrence of \"head behind vertical \"in sub-elite dressage horses, compared with elite dressage horses, that was associ-ated with a higher frequency of pain-related gaitabnormalities indicates a likely role of pain in somehorses. This is also supported by the observation that\"head behind vertical \"increased in movements that required a greater degree of collection, compared withless demanding movements, and was often associatedwith other behaviors of the RHpE (Fig. 2). 27,29,30 Fig. 1.

Despite these behaviors being clear contraventions of the aims of dressage, horses display- ing such behaviors were frequently awarded averagemarks of 6/10 (satisfactory) or 7/10 (fairly good). 33 Further education of dressage judges is required to raiseawareness of these and other behaviors and their poten- tial signi cance. Tail swishing that occurred only in syn- chrony with spur cues applied to Grand Prix dressage horses was not included as a positive RHpE behavior but was observed in 36% of competitors at elite level.29 There is considerable current debate about the types of nosebands used in competition and the way in whichthey are tted, including tightness, their contribution to oral pain, and the ability or otherwise of nosebands to limit mouth opening, and this is discussed else- where.28,29The veterinary profession needs to be aware of these issues but more importantly needs to addressthe question of why there is such a high frequency of occurrence of mouth opening in sports horses, mostparticularly in Grand Prix dressage horses. Mouth opening may be related to oral lesions, 43,44the size and type of the bit relative to the shape and size of thehorse 's oral cavity and tongue,45,46movement of the rider' sh a n d s ,47or excessive rein tension48,49or may be a nonspeci cr e s p o n s et om u s c u l o s k e l e t a lp a i n .8,9 There are many factors that may in fluence cross- country jumping performance, including the dif culty of the course, the terrain, the footing, the weather condi-tions, the skill, tness, and strength of the rider, the ath- letic ability of the horse and its experience, tness andfreedom from pain, and also the horse 's training to follow the rider 'sc u e s .25The eventing studies from all levels indicate that musculoskeletal pain may be in flu- ential in the performance of some horses given the asso- ciation between RHpE scores and failure to completethe cross-country phase.26-28Veterinarians need to advise riders that suboptimal performance may re flect discomfort. Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that theinfluence of endorphins and adrenaline may allow a horse to jump satisfactorily despite musculoskeletalpain, 50,51particularly if the size of the fences is well within the horse 's athletic capabilities. It is also the role of a veterinarian to advise a client that the ability of ahorse to jump well, despite performing poorly in dres-sage-type work, does not preclude the presence of mus-culoskeletal pain. T h e s es t u d i e sp r o v i d ee v i d e n c et h a tt h e r ei sar e l a - tionship between reduced performance and musculo-skeletal pain. Therefore, if veterinarians are performing regular clinical assessments of clients 'horses, it may also be worthwhile to review the recent performance re- cord together with the rider and trainer and compare itwith previous performances. A reduction in perform-ance may be indicative of an underlying problem, thecause of which needs identifying. The importance of thequality of previous performances has also been high-lighted by the introduction of the EquiRating 'sH o r s e Form Index, developed in conjunction with the FEI. 52 At CCI 3-star to 5-star levels of eventing, it has beenshown that recent previous cross-country jumping per-formances can be used to predict the likelihood of afuture cross-country performance without jumpingpenalties. The reviewed studies had some limitations. The RHpE was applied by single observer who could notbe blinded to horse and rider identity, and therefore there was the potential for bias. Moreover, the ob- server could not be blinded to the presence or absenceof gait abnormalities. However, the performances ofhorses could not be predicted, and all statistical analy-ses were performed completely independently andinvolved large data sets, including all competitors atindividual competitions, supporting the validity of theresults. The circumstances under which horses wereevaluated were variable. The 3-day event horses wereassessed during warm-up for the dressage phase andwere therefore not performing a set pattern of move-ments, at speci cm a r k e r s ,w i t h i nt h ec o n nes of an arena. However, the majority of riders performedmost of the movements included in the test. The eventhorse studies were performed in real time, whereasthe Grand Prix dressage horses were assessed usingvideo recordings. A good correlation between RHpE scores for the same horses assessed in real time and in video recordings acquired from the same perspec-tive was previously observed. 15When dressage tests were assessed in real time, the observer was restrictedto a single position relative to the arena, within 1 to 3m of the MC corner, 28whereas ideally horses should also be assessed from a different perspective (e.g., theHC corner).14The video recordings of the dressage Fig. 2. A 5-star 3-day event competitor exhibiting head behind the ver- tical10\u00b0, an intense stare, and mouth opening with separation of the teeth. Note the reduced rein tension. The Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram score was 6/24. The horse was withdrawn at the nal horse inspection.SPORTS MEDICINE, LAMENESS, AND REHABILITATION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 323horses were acquired in a standardized way for com- mercial release, and this also resulted in an inability toview horses from all perspectives. However, within each study, all horses were assessed similarly. The event horse studies were performed in variable weather conditions, and strong wind, if present, pre- vented accurate determination of tail position. Thefooting was variable for the 1-day event study, and long grass prevented evaluation of hindlimb toe drag at some venues. A behavior was only determined to have occurred if it was unequivocally present. Excessive white \"froth\" around the lips prevented assessment of mouth opening with separation of the t e e t hi nas m a l lp r o p o r t i o no fW o r l dC u pG r a n dP r i xdressage horses. The FEI has since banned the use of \"any type of white substance around the horse 'sm o u t h to imitate foaming (like 'marshmallow fluff, 'shaving cream, etc.); this is considered cheating and against horse welfare as it can hide lip injuries. \" 33The reason for the change of rule seems odd because small amounts of blood are highlighted by white froth; however, the rule should make it easier for a judge to assess \"the accep- tance of the bit, without any tension or resistance. \"32,33 There were additional lessons from some observa- tions made in these studies that may be of bene tt o riders and the performance of their horses. In thewarm-up for the dressage phase at 3-day events, it was noted that some riders of horses that appeared uncom- fortable in canter repeatedly performed flying changes that progressively deteriorated in quality, probablyreflecting increasing musculoskeletal discomfort and in some instances the development of con flict behavior. 53 The warm-up at this level is not a place for training,and it seems preferable to avoid movements that are likely to cause or enhance discomfort. When developing treatment and management plans for horses with underlying musculoskeletal problems, veterinarians could become more involved in planning warm-upstrategies in association with the rider and trainer. Rein back was performed poorly at all levels, which is likely to re flect either con flict behavior or poor or inad- equate training, which could be improved, with result-ant increase in marks. Inaccuracies in test riding(for example, a halt not at the prescribed marker) had the potential to lose marks unnecessarily. The relationship between quality of competition performance and RHpE scores highlights the value of r i d d e ne x e r c i s ew h e na s s e s s i n gah o r s e 'sm u s c u l o s k e l - etal health. This applies not only to routine veterinary assessments but also to prepurchase examinations. Application of the RHpE may highlight the likely presence of underlying problems that may become ampli ed by a change in management and training. 6. Conclusions These studies indicate a relationship between RHpE scores and performance and illustrate how knowledge of the RHpE and its application are potentially valua- ble for a sports horse veterinarian. These studies can be used to raise awareness among riders and trainersabout the in fluence of musculoskeletal pain on per- formance. Through regular monitoring of horses dur- ing ridden exercise, using the RHpE and critically evaluating gaits, early interventions may result in increased performance and potentially increase thecompetitive longevity of sports horses. These studies provide equine veterinarians with some objective evi- dence to counter the claims of those who suggest thathorse sports are cruel and to proactively protect the social license to compete.

Materials and Methods Five horses were trained to walk and trot on a treadmillwearing long-reining equipment (with additional rein-tension devices) and 28 re flective optical tracking markers. Subjective assessment of horse movement wasdetermined without rein-tension (free walk and trot)and when the horses were \"worked into the bit \"(long- reined walk and trot) and preferred side. Continuousrein-force data from both sides were collected over ;60sfrom each trial. Movement was recorded using a twelve-camera optical motion capture system. One randomlyassigned TMJ was subsequently injected with lipopoly-saccharide and the treadmill tests repeated by an inves-tigator blinded to treatment side. A second, identicalassessment was performed ten days later with the oppo-site TMJ being the target of intervention. 3. Results All horses showing reduced rein-tension on the in flamed side post-injection but no effect on any kinematic varia-bles was determined. 4. Discussion TMJ in flammation resulted in subjective and objective changes in response to rein-input without horses beingclassically, visibly, lame.

Focusing on three key expenses along with developing revenue growth is crucial to be able to monitor and proactively manage a business by keeping score. Authors 'addresses: 121 Countryside Court, Suite 140, Southlake, TX are many factors that in fluence practice pro t- ability. This presentation explores the challenges of running a successful equine practice in an ever-chang- ing market with labor shortages and in flationary times. Benchmark comparisons, market forces, cost(expense) management, pricing and fees, revenuegrowth, and keeping score are critical areas investi- gated to improve practice value and sustainability. The objective is to share real-life experiences andprovide solutions using case examples illustratingthe impact of market forces and the implications ofpractice expenses and revenue on the bottom line, protability. 2. Discussion Rising prices (in flation) and a tight labor market are key issues that are facing everyone. Private equityaggregation of equine practices and a changing work- force are impacting the marketplace. To be successfuland sustainable, take a closer look at operationalexpenses, revenue streams, and how they in fluence the value of the business. This deep dive into the busi- ness provides solutions and tactics to improve nan- cial health. The presentation details, case examples,and benchmark metrics in the slide deck will be pro-v i d e da f t e rt h ep r e s e n t a t i o n .T h ec o r ed i s c u s s i o nfocuses on the three key items of revenue, expenses,and keeping score and how changes in one or moreareas in fluence the practice overall nancial health. Practice Revenue \u0081Services: The old saying \"focus on what you are good at and love doing \"holds true in most suc- cessful businesses. In equine practice, examine market and competition. This means asking questions of customers and potential clients \u2014 what is needed and what is missing? Internally, a breakeven analysis is suggested to examine thenancial impact of a new service and assess the pricing structure. This approach is also NOTES 328 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: PROFITABILITYused for current services in an effort to evaluate protability and where marketing dollars are best used. \u0081Fee Structure: Costs increase at variable rates over time. In times of high in flation, the dollar does not go as far. As operational costs increase,keep pace by adjusting fees to protect your margin(protability). There are three key components to fees: price, volume, and market tolerance. Severalapproaches to adjusting fees and the impact of timing those fee changes will be presented in the program. \u0081Impact of Growth on Value: It is easy to assumethat as a practice grows, it becomes more valua- ble, and while that is generally true, it is impor- tant that a practice is growing correctly. Forinstance, if pro t margins are not maintained as a practice grows, the value of the practicecould be hurt. Growth \"at any cost \"is not healthy growth. During periods of rapid growthlike the industry has seen over the last fewyears, practice owners should closely watch practice pro tability to make sure that percent- age of revenue that translates into earningsstays consistent. By keeping score on a consist- ent basis, a practice owner will know what atypical pro tability percentage is for the prac- tice and individual services, and that pro tabil- ity percentage should be maintained, even in times of rapid growth or in times of contraction.Practice Expenses Monitoring and controlling expenses are key to pro t- ability in turbulent and prosperous times. In an equine practice, cost of professional services and people costs are the two biggest categories of expenses. The benchmarks presented later in this paper establish the general guidelines for what per- centage of revenue these two primary expense cate-gories should represent. \u0081Labor: There are generally three categories of the cost of labor: doctor compensation, lay staff compensation, and bene ts. Overall total labor costs, including all three of these categories, are typically somewhere between 40% and 50% oftotal revenue. Doctor compensation (excluding benets) is typically 20% to 25%, lay staff com- pensation (excluding bene ts) is typically 15% to 20%, and the remaining total cost of labor is for employee bene ts. Typically, employee ben- ets range from 5% to 10% of total revenue. \u0081Cost of Professional Services: Total cost of pro- fessional services typically is approximately 27% of total revenue. The biggest portion ofcost of professional services is the cost of drugsand supplies, which is typically about 20% of total revenue. The remaining 7% of revenue that is cost of professional services comes fromlab costs, eld service costs, and other items associated with the provision of professionalservices. Fig. 1.

In a game, it is the score. If there is no score kept in a game, then no one knows whetherthey are winning or losing. The same is true in business; it is important to keep score in several areas to know whether the business is winning orlosing. Each member of a practice team can help keep score in individual areas of responsibility. In order for the score to be meaningful, it shouldbe measured regularly. When regularly compar- ing one result to another result (measured at a later time), trends will become apparent in thepractice, and judging whether or not progress is being made in that particular area will be possi- ble. A few examples are included below. /C14Number of new clients attained last month versus this month /C14Total revenue of the practice this month ver-sus the same month last year /C14Total patients seen this month versus same month last year /C14Average invoice amount per doctor /C14Average days accounts receivable /C14Inventory turnover /C14Budget comparisons and performance \u0081Value of Benchmarks: Benchmarks are usedto compare one practice to other practices orgroups of practices.

This paper seeks to identify the many variables affecting cost of goods sold, how they directly affect protability, and how they can be managed simply for signi cant results. Author 's address: AAEP. 1. Laying the Groundwork Inventory is among the highest expenses of a veterinary practice. Logically, it follows that the management ormismanagement of inventory greatly impacts the pro t- ability of the business. All practice owners aspire to maximize pro ts. Most w o u l dl i k et om a n a g ei n v e n t o r ym o r ep r o a c t i v e l y ,b u tfew know where to start. The easiest way is to spendless on inventory purchased to stock the practice.Reining in spending is a small portion of the inventorymanagement strategies that can free up cash flow, increase margins, and improve overall practice value. Whatever inventory-related goals have been identi- ed in a practice, benchmarks should be selected to measure progress toward those goals. These metricsshould be constant because while the evolution of in-ventory policy over time is inevitable, consistent base-line benchmarks will help evaluate improvement nomatter how many times the drawing board is revisited. Cost of goods sold (COGS) is one of the most common metrics used to nd the pulse of inventory. It is important to understand that while COGS is tech-nically a dollar amount, it is applicable to a wideraudience to discuss it as a percentage of either produc- tion or gross revenue. If calculated as a percentage of gross revenue, accounts receivable factors into theequation. Percentage of production can be a more consistent meter because some business models fluc- tuate in their accounts receivable throughout the year. Regardless, discussing COGS as a percentage of production or revenue allows a practice to compare apples to apples, whether it is a $5,000,000 practice or a $15,000,000 practice. Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, a working denition that de n e sC O G Sa st h ep e r c e n t a g eo f gross revenue spent on drugs and supplies will beused. It is a simple equation, but the complex reality is that COGS is in fluenced by everything that hap- pens with inventory \u2014from as early as before the pur- chase, when pricing is negotiated, to after the point ofsale, when payment is collected. Factors affecting COGS can be sorted into two cate- gories: purchasing and inventory management. Purchasing is an inclusive term blanketing every element of the procurement process. Before a pur- chase is made, the cost is set. A window of opportunity for negotiation exists around the price set by most NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 331BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: PROFITABILITYsuppliers. Beyond the monetary cost of inventory are logistical variables, such as time spent on the ordering process and the method of placing orders. Inventory management includes, but is not limited to, organization and storage, data entry and record keeping, systems of counting and tracking inventory,calculating turnover, setting minimum and maximum stock levels, determining appropriate sales plans and discounting, and billing and collecting. To illustrate the COGS equation, consider this example of a practice with $500,000 revenue and$150,000 drug and supply cost: $150,000 drug and supply cost/$500,000 revenue \u00bc 30% COGS For every dollar of revenue generated, this practice spends $0.30 on inventory. Industry average is 20.33%,and so the journey begins for this practice to nd ways to reduce the COGS. a COGS will be one metric this practice can use over time to evaluate whether efforts at improving pur-chasing and inventory control are fruitful, but the practice might select two or three others to focus on at a more micro level. Some metrics that exist within the previously mentioned categories of COGS-in fluencing factors include: \u0081Purchasing: mark-ups, discounts, rebates, rebate exclusions, volume commitments \u0081Stock levels: days to turnover, minimums, \u0081Shrink: dollar value of expired medications,percentage of inventory wasted, dollar value orpercentage of missed billing \u0081Discounting: dollar value of discounts \u0081Accounts receivable: days to collection For maximum improvement to COGS, each side of the equation must be scrutinized. Both cost and reve- nue components have ground-level starting points that will establish the foundation upon which to add additional savvy and cost-saving inventory manage-ment tactics. 2. Buying Better E f f o r t st or e d u c eC O G Sb y \"buying better \"include understanding and negotiating for better purchasingagreements and discerning whether available purchas- ing tools align with the goals of the practice. A simple lack of understanding of purchasing agreements can leave a lot of money on the table.Unfortunately, purchasing agreements are often complex and largely untransparent by design. Forthe scope of this conversation, further discussion about purchasing agreements will focus on those between a veterinary practice and a distributor; contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other vendors have additional nuances. To betterunderstand distributor agreements, it is necessary to rst understand some important terms. Cost-plus pricing is determined by adding a per- centage mark-up to the seller 'sc o s t \u2014in this case, the distributor' s cost to stock and sell the product. Cost- plus pricing is the foundation of any distributor pric- ing agreement. The de nition of cost is complex and ultimately a moving target as some vendors include labor, logistics, and other overhead costs, while othersstrictly de ne cost as their own purchase price. Still, it is an important benchmark to use when comparing pricing agreements across distributors. The pricing of some products is set by the manufac- turer, and from a practice owner 's point of view, man- ufacturer-set pricing is unaffected by the cost-plus structure. For pricing left to the discretion of the distributor rather than the manufacturer, cost-plus pricing comes into play. This variability can be observed in private label generic and consumable products, such asgeneric flunixin and brown gauze, and in the products that cross over from the human market, such as sulfa-methoxazole tablets. While most animal health prod- u c t ss e eap r i c ei n c r e a s eo n c eay e a r ,h u m a nd r u g s are extremely volatile in pricing, changing frequentlythroughout the year and sometimes from day to day. Rebates are a percentage of sales paid back to the buyer, typically in exchange for purchasing a pre-agreed-upon volume of product. Rebates can repre- sent signi cant net savings beyond the invoice price. One advantage of rebates paid after the initial pur- chase rather than as an up-front discount at the timeof sale is that the savings can be reserved entirelyfor the practice, rather than passed on to the client when sales plans are calculated from the invoice price. Be advised, however, that it is critical to ask which, if any, products are excluded from a rebate or rebatedat a different level. It should never be assumed thatall products are rebated equally or rebated at all. Terms are also negotiable. Standard payment terms are 30 days from the end of a billing cycle.Extended payment terms are common for largeorders, such as at the annual AAEP convention wherethey are often referred to as delayed billing. What isnot commonly known is that extended payment terms can be negotiated for everyday orders as well. With appropriate stock levels and turnover, extended pay-ment terms offer a larger window to buy what isneeded and use, bill, and collect payment before pay-ing the vendor, effectively using the vendor 's money. While this does not directly impact COGS, the advan-tages to the cash flow of a business maximizing pay- ment terms should not be overlooked. Cost is not limited to the scal realm. Cost may come in the form of inef ciencies in management or other holes in the purchasing process. It is important to discern whether the shiny, well-marketed tech options truly optimize ef ciency and savings or simply provide one at the cost of the other. All tools comeBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: PROFITABILITY 332 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSwith a cost, some higher than others, and all should be carefully vetted. For example, it is becoming more commonplace for inventory software to tout the convenience of integra- tion with a distributor 'sw e b s i t e .T h i sm a ys o u n d attractive, but if purchasing decisions are based solely on this integration, it is possible that the increased convenience will pigeonhole the practice into purchas- ing from a source that is not necessarily in the best - nancial interest of the business. An alternative innovation worth considering is Vetcove (vetcove.com). Developed by the sons of anequine veterinarian, this free service streamlinesordering ef ciency by syncing with supplier websites through the clinics 'vendor accounts, displaying real- time pricing and availability across all synced suppli- ers while highlighting pricing variability. To revisit the previously illustrated equation, re- member the practice that started with a 30% COGS. In focusing on the drug and supply cost side of the COGS equation, this practice became more pro cient in the language of purchasing agreements and was able to negotiate for a better cost-plus mark-up and additional rebates with a black-and-white under- standing of which purchases are rebate eligible andwhich are not. The practice was also able to gain extended payment terms on everyday orders, not just once a year at AAEP, thereby improving cash flow. Through utilization of Vetcove, the practice realized they were leaving money on the table by ordering solely from the distributor that integrated with their inventory software and decided to nd other ways to increase ef ciency that were not at the expense of their carefully negotiated savings. As a result of these changes, the practice was able to reduce their drug costs by over 5%, reducing the amount spent on drugs and supplies from $150,000 to $142,000. This savings translated to a 2.8% improve-ment in COGS, enabling this practice to retain $8,000 that was previously spent on procurement. $142,000 drug and supply cost/$500,000 reve- nue = 28.4% COGS Prudent review of pricing agreements and purchas- ing tools are simple blueprints that can be easilyadapted by any veterinary business. Further efforts to improve purchasing practices include the implemen-tation of protocols that utilize real practice data to bal- ance ef ciency, stock levels, and cash flow. There are rational purposes behind these methods. Collecting usage data, such as turnover, and then putting that data to use to align order frequency and volume with negotiated payment terms is the apex of purchasing efciency. These strategies begin to bleed into the in- ventory management side of the COGS equation. 3. Controlling Inventory The previous example illustrated how lowering inven- tory expenses can have a positive effect on COGS. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for mismanage- ment of inventory and the resultant impact onrevenue to negate any money saved in the procure- ment process. Shrink has arguably the largest impacton revenue, but many practices lack the inventorytracking standard operating procedures necessary toput a true value on wastage, expired medications, and missed billing. Without such concrete data, few prac- tices are able to make a change for the better. In order to answer questions about shrink with any certainty, a practice must rst be able to track its in- ventory. Traceability requires a clearly de ned system of moving inventory through the business. The goal is to illuminate the path inventory follows from pur- chase to sale, allowing the habits that impact COGSto be highlighted and tweaked as necessary to reachdesired goals. For all the tangible places inventory goes, transac- tions must be mirrored, ideally in an inventory soft- ware that supports multiple inventory locations. The goal is for 100% of the movement of tracked inventoryto be recorded as purchases, transfers, sales, oradjustments. To identify missed billing, in particular,transfers are key. Inventory locations are fundamental to inventory control. A system of primary and secondary locationsis recommended, with the central pharmacy desig-n a t e da st h ep r i m a r y ,a n ds e c o n d a r yl o c a t i o n st omatch all ancillary locations outside the pharmacy.Inventory moves into the pharmacy as purchases and out of the pharmacy as transfers. Inventory moves into secondary locations as transfers and out as sales. As much as possible, locations are dedicated to peo- ple rather than trucks, areas, or rooms. To under-stand the rationale behind this logistical convention,consider one question: If inventory is transferred to a \"hospital \"location within a multidoctor practice, who is responsible for that inventory when multiple veteri- narians have in-patients in their care? Where trace-ability is lost, so is accountability. The pharmacy is the heart of inventory control within a practice, and it is from here that all changes must originate. If putting a true, reliable value on shrink is a practice priority, it may be necessary toclose or limit pharmacy access. This can initially be oneo ft h em o s td i s r u p t i v ec h a n g e st ot h ei n v e n t o r yp r o t o -cols within a practice, but the hard truth is that the more disruptive it is, the more it is probably needed. An open pharmacy is more convenient because staff can take whatever is needed, whenever they need it. If, however, the entire staff is not religious about re-cording what is taken and where it goes, inventorybecomes untraceable in its r s tm o v eo f ft h ep h a r - macy shelf. On the other hand, providing the extra measure of traceability paves the way for greater accountability,which consciously leads to greater billing awareness,boosted production, and increased revenue \u2014and when these results are not initially materialized, there is a trail to follow inventory to its dead end and troubleshoot the habits and behaviors that lead to missed billing anddrugs left to expire in obscure locations.BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: PROFITABILITY AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 333Other bene ts of closing the pharmacy include greater awareness of stock levels for reordering pur- poses, better control and usage of short-dated products, and reduced incidence of expired medications. Change is hard, and culture is the key to success. Communicate the purpose and goal behind anychange before implementation. When the team under- stands the \"why, \"it facilitates compliance and cooper- ation. Listen to the concerns that will inevitably beexpressed because everyone that touches inventory views the issue through their own lens and may raise a valid concern that has not yet been considered. Get started on the best possible foot, but do not be afraid to go back to the drawing board if a change does notmove the practice closer to its goals. To further develop the previous COGS equation, af- ter its previously described measures to improve pur-chasing costs, this practice made concentrated efforts to effect change on the revenue side of the COGS equa- tion. It began by establishing a system of inventory locations identi ed within the physical infrastructure of the business and mirrored in the practice manage-ment software. This design facilitated a clean, trace- able system of inventory movement, ensuring all inventory leaving the pharmacy would be accounted for and making staff more mindful, which resulted in a greater percentage of inventory purchased and trans- ferred also being billed. Cumulatively, these effortsresulted in a revenue increase of 10%, or $50,000. $142,000 drug and supply cost/$550,000 revenue \u00bc 25.8% COGS When compared with the original equation, this rep- resents a 4.2% improvement in COGS, which translates to $58,000 in the bank rather than left on the table, handed off as free product, or thrown in the trash.4. Conclusion These innovations are just the springboard fromwhich to further improve inventory systems within a veterinary business. There is no one-size- ts-all approach, but there are a great number of fun- damental methodologies that can be tailored to any practice. For example, mapping inventory locations and clos- ing the pharmacy provide the foundation on which tobuild a checks-and-balances system of counting high- volume drugs and supplies. That data can be paired with reliable records of inventory transactions to cal- culate turnover and set minimums and maximums customized to the practice or report revenue-related information on areas like discounting and missed billing. Broad-stroke improvements like these create addi- tional opportunities to nesse inventory at an increas- ingly micro level, but rst steps must be simple, m a n a g e a b l e ,a n d ,m o s ti m p o r t a n t l y ,p a r to fac o o p e r a -tive, forward-thinking culture.

Introduction Lameness is a clinical sign.1,2There are many diseases or dysfunctions that cause horses to display lameness, but the base reason is pain during weight bearing. Toaccommodate pain, the horse, using various mecha- nisms, loads the limb with less vertical force. Amplitude of lameness is inversely proportional to vertical limbforce. Measuring ground reaction force is easy for single strides. But lameness is notoriously variable from stride to stride 3,4a n dm u s tb em e a s u r e do v e rm a n ys t r i d e s . Acceleration is a proxy measurement for force, and it can be measured continuously with body-mounted iner- tial sensors (BMIS).5-7 Decreased downward vertical acceleration of the torso is the direct cause of smaller ground reaction forces dur- ing the rst half of stance, and decreased upward accel- eration of the torso is the direct result of smaller ground reaction forces during the second half of stance.8,9All of the information necessary to detect and localize thecause of lameness can be ascertained by close analysisof the vertical movement of the torso. Detection of lame- ness is a simple measurement problem. Determination of the importance of lameness and localization of thecause of lameness are more complex problems. Why, then, if lameness detection and measurement is simple in concept, is it sometimes so dif cult in practice? Consider weighing a flea. The concept is simple, but the task is dif cult, unless you have a very sensitive and pre- cise scale. In a similar vein, subjective evaluation oflameness by simple observation of the horse in motion atthe trot is the most common method of lameness detec- tion, but the spatial and temporal resolution of thehuman eye is limited. Small differences in vertical torso movement resulting from unequal loading of limbs are not reliably detected. Methods of objective measurementwith higher spatial and temporal resolution than the na- ked human eye will therefore be more sensitive and reli- able for detecting lameness. Line-of-site measurementtechniques, like video capture or computer-assisted kine- matic analysis of gait, can offer high temporal resolution, but unless the horse is contained within a limited eld of view, like on a treadmill, both suffer from limited spatialresolution. BMIS, with both high sampling frequencyand wireless transmission of measurement, so the horse can be evaluated anywhere at any time, is the most prac- tical objective technique suitable for routine clinical use. Objective measurement of lameness is unbiased. It removes doubt and difference of opinion. Objective mea- surement creates a quantitative record to be stored, archived, and studied. It makes comparisons between dates more accurate; it can help decipher the complex relationship between primary, compensatory, and sec-ondary lameness; and most importantly, it creates an objective database that can be searched and analyzed for patterns that may be clinically useful. 2. Analysis of Forelimb Lameness by Measuring Vertical Head Movement T h eh e a di sa t t a c h e dt ot h et o r s oo nal o n gl e v e r arm parallel to midline. Vertical head movement NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 335INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIESmimics vertical torso movement. The head 'sl a r g e mass makes it an effective counterweight that can be used to adjust vertical torso movement to unload p a i n f u ll i m b s .I ti ss u c ha ne f f e c t i v ec o u n t e r w e i g h tthat its vertical movement in lameness dominatesall other movement adjustments by the horse toreduce weight-bearing forelimb pain. There are 2 principle causes of vertical head movement in the trotting horse. The rst is that the head simply follows the down and up motion ofthe torso as the horse is trotting. This is the natu-ral, normal, and expected vertical head trajectoryin a horse without lameness. The second is that thehead moves more upward, or less downward, withpain during weight bearing. Total vertical move-ment trajectory of the head is a summation of boththese causes. Closer inspection of this model ofhead movement suggests that the shape of the tra-jectory provides information on timing of forelimb lameness, that is, whether the pain is greatest in therst or second half of stance. Knowing this could provide useful clinical information. If the pain of lameness peaks in the rst half of stance, neck muscles reduce force of weight bearingby restricting the fall of the head. The head falls lessduring the stance phase of the lame limb so that thehead height from the ground is higher than that dur-ing the stance phase of the sound limb, creating a dif-ference in minimum head height. If the start of thestride is de ned as the beginning of right forelimb stance, the rst minimum as the minimum head height during right forelimb stance, and the secondminimum during left forelimb stance, then a horsewith a right forelimb impact-type lameness will havea positive difference in minimum head height (DiffM i n[ h e a d ]=+ ) .W i t hl a m e n e s si nt h e rst half of stance, the horse usually also thrusts its head upwardright before impact of the lame limb. If, by de nition, therst maximum head height occurs right before right forelimb impact and the second right beforeleft forelimb impact, then horses with a right fore-limb impact-type lameness will also have a posi-tive difference in maximum head height (Diff Max[head] = +). If, on the other hand, the pain of lameness peaks in the second half of stance, neck muscle activity reducesforce on the limb by raising the head during push off.By de ning the starting point of the stride to be impact of the right forelimb, a horse with a right fore-limb push-off-type lameness will have a higher headheight both during a positive Diff Min (head) and af-ter a negative Diff Max (head) right forelimb stance.Similarly, a horse with a left forelimb push-off-type lameness will have a negative Diff Min (head) and a positive Diff Max (head). Table 1 indicates the signs of Diff Min and Diff Max (head) for the various types of forelimb lameness. The Q TMdisplays forelimb lameness in a plot (Fig. 1) with the x- a x i sa sD i f fM a x( h e a d )a n dt h e y-axis as Diff Min (head).

Analysis of Hindlimb Lameness by Measuring Vertical Movement of the Pelvis Vertical pelvic movement due to hindlimb weight-bear- i n gp a i ni ss i m p l e rt oe x p l a i nt h a nv e r t i c a lm o v e m e n t of the head due to forelimb pain. The biomechanics ofvertical pelvic movement are modeled as a bouncing ball. Reduction of force on the painful hindlimb is accomplished either by reducing the fall of the pelvisduring hindlimb impact, by reducing the rise of the pel- vis during hindlimb push off, or by both. If the rst half of hindlimb stance is painful, the pelvis falls less so that its lowest height will be higher from the ground than if there was no hindlimb pain in the rst half of stance. This results in a difference of minimum pelvic height between right and left hindlimb stance (Diff Min [pelvis]). Positive Diff Min (pelvis) indicates hindlimb of stance, or lameness, andnegative Diff Min (pelvis) indicates left hindlimb begin- ning of stance, or impact, lameness. If pain is in the second half of stance, the horse will push off the affected hindlimb with less force, moving the pelvis up less. This results in a difference in maxi- mum pelvic height between push off of the right hind and left hindlimbs, which is measured as Diff Max(pelvis). Positive Diff Max (pelvis) indicates right hindlimb end of stance, or push off, lameness, and negative Diff Max (pelvis) indicates left hindlimbpush-off lameness. Because the causes of Diff Min (pelvis) and Diff Max (pelvis) are different, they are separate measures and are not simply combined tocreate a single overall hindlimb lameness measure. Although one aspect (impact, push off) may be greater than the other, many horses with hindlimb lameness, unless the lameness is very mild, display components of both types of hindlimb lameness. The Q TMdisplays left and right hindlimb impact and push off (Fig. 2). Each type of de ciency is color coded, with red lines directed up indicating de ciency of push off and green lines projecting down showing de ciency of impact. The amplitude of each red line above the hori-zontal is the Diff Max (pelvis) for that stride. The am-plitude of each green line below the horizontal is the Diff Min (pelvis) for that stride. Mean Diff Max (pel- vis) and Diff Min (pelvis) are calculated and displayedover all strides. Estimated thresholds of Diff Min (pel- vis) and Diff Max (pelvis), determined by comparison to subjective evaluation of 3 experienced equine clini-cians, between sound and lame states are 63 mm. 3,4 4. Compensatory and Secondary Lameness Patterns in an Apparent Multilimb Lameness An apparent multilimb lameness may originate from different causes. Compensatory movement in the other half of the body, in an attempt to shift force of weight bearing off the affected limb, is the most com- mon. A compensatory lameness is, in a sense, a falselameness as a limb that appears lame has no focus of pain but appears lame only because of the compensa- tory shifting of weight to the other end of the body.Another cause of multilimb lameness is secondary lameness, or a truly painful cause in a previously nor- mal limb, due to overloading of that limb over time. It is possible but unlikely for a horse to develop two dif-ferent primary sources of lameness in separate limbssimultaneously. Extensive trauma, congenital condi-tions, old age, and long-term intensive exercise maybe exceptions. Compensatory lameness should be reversed with the elimination of the primary lame- ness. Blocking out a secondary lameness, anticipatingthat whole and possible multiple structures in thelimb would be overloaded, should be more dif cult. The pattern of compensatory vertical head and pel- vic movement is well studied. Compensatory lame-ness patterns have been de ned as the \"law of sides, \" with 2 principles: 1) In an apparent simultaneous ipsi- lateral (for example, right forelimb and right hind- limb) lameness, the most likely limb with pain is thehindlimb, and 2) in an apparent simultaneous contra-lateral lameness, the most likely limb with pain is theforelimb. Recent evidence suggests that there shouldbe a modern clari cation of this old law of sides. The ipsilateral principal of the old law of sides has been con rmed by experimental evidence. When a horse has pain in a hindlimb, it will shift weight for-ward. Increased force of weight bearing on the simul-taneously landing contralateral forelimb results inincreased downward movement of the head. When Fig. 2. Right hindlimb push-off and impact-type lameness. Positive Diff Diff Min (pelvis).INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 337the horse lands on the opposite forelimb, ipsilateral to the painful hindlimb, the head will fall to a normal height. But this is higher than when the contralateral forelimb is in stance. Following the \"low on sound \" rule of head movement in forelimb lameness, thisgives the appearance of an ipsilateral forelimb lame-ness (Fig. 3). Sometimes, the apparent asymmetric head movement is more easily seen than the asym- metric vertical pelvic movement caused by the pri- mary hindlimb lameness. Some horses compensate greatly, lameness canbe easily mistaken for forelimb lameness. However, further studies have found that this rst principle of the law of sides is only true when the type of hindlimblameness is only or primarily lack of push off. When the character of hindlimb lameness is only lack ofimpact, then there is an approximately equal chance that the source of primary lameness is in the forelimb as in the character as decrease impact (an ipsi-impact pattern) is an exception to the rst principle of the law of sides. A more modern and correct ipsilateral principle of the law of sides would state, \"Horses with a CFHL in which there is an ipsilateral hindlimb lameness thatis mostly lack of push off usually indicates primary hindlimb lameness. \" The second part of the old law of sides has been only partially con rmed. When a horse has pain in a hindlimb, it will sometimes shift weight rearward.The horse will land with greater force on the simulta- neously landing contralateral hindlimb, and the pelvis will fall more than normal. When the horse lands with normal force on the opposite diagonal, when theopposite normal forelimb and the ipsilateral hindlimbare weight bearing, the pelvis will fall a normal amount, which may be less than when the compensat- ing hindlimb is weight bearing. This will give the appearance of an ipsilateral impact-type hindlimb lameness, with differences in the minimum heights ofthe pelvis between right and left. If this were the only, more common, or strongest effect, then horses with apparent ipsilateral lameness would be dif cult to de- cipher, as in fact they are (see above). However, fortui-tously, a second, more common, and usually moredramatic effect is also seen. A horse with a primary forelimb lameness will tend to push off the simultane- ously weight-bearing contralateral hindlimb with less force than usual, causing the pelvis to rise less. This gives the appearance of a push-off-type lameness inthe contralateral hindlimb (Fig. 4). So, the second part of the old law of sides is only partially true. Confusion of a hindlimb lameness for a true forelimb lameness, however, is not so likely since, in most horses, the primary forelimb lameness will need to be quite strong before the asymmetric vertical pelvic movement is seen. A more modern version of the sec-ond, or contralateral, principle of the law of sides would state, \"Horses with a CFHL in which there is a contralateral hindlimb lameness that is mostly lack ofpush off usually indicates primary forelimb lameness. There may also be an ipsilateral hindlimb lack ofimpact. \" The increased sensitivity of BMIS for measuring head and pelvic movement asymmetry protects againstmaking the wrong determination of primary lameness in the compensatory lameness situation. Knowing the law of sides is helpful for clinical decision-making. Fig. 3. Primary left hindlimb lameness / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSecondary lameness is much harder to study, and objective evidence for the most common patterns of sec- ondary lameness is anecdotal. With decreased weight bearing on a painful forelimb, the most likely locationof overload leading to secondary lameness will be uphigher in the affected forelimb (if the primary lamenessis distal), in the opposite forelimb, and last, in the oppo-site hindlimb. It is uncommon, perhaps with the excep- tion of Standardbred pacers, for an ipsilateral hindlimb to be overloaded and to develop secondary hindlimblameness. One the other hand, with decreased weightbearing on a painful hindlimb, a horse seems to beequally likely to overload and develop secondary lame- ness in either the contralateral forelimb or in the oppo- site hindlimb. It is uncommon, perhaps again with theexception of Standardbred pacers, for an ipsilateral fore-limb to be overloaded and develop a secondary forelimblameness. Secondary forelimb lameness is almost always contralateral. Knowing the compensatory and secondary forelimb and hindlimb lameness patterns can be helpful in g- uring out the most likely source of primary lameness in a CFHL case. Sometimes, for example, a hindlimbpattern of movement may be the exact opposite of thatexpected with a forelimb lameness measurement. This could be the rst hint that one is actually dealing with a bilateral forelimb lameness. 5. Lunging Veterinarians frequently lunge horses during pre- purchase and lameness evaluations. It is thought that some lameness may not be seen when horses are trot- ting in a straight line. The relative forces on the rightand left limbs, and the force distribution within eachlimb, are different when a horse is traveling in a circle. Higher compressive forces are experienced on the outer half of the limb on the inside of the circle and on the inside half of the limb on the outside of the circle, and vice versa with tensile forces. The horse 's body can be quite tilted to the inside of the lunging circle, depending both on the horse and on the size of the circle. This induces a normal asym- metric head and pelvic movement that can interfere with using vertical motion of the head and vertical motion of the pelvis to detect lameness. Thresholds for asymmetry of head and pelvic movement between sus- pect sound and lame states do not exist for the lunging horse. The horse-to-horse variation on amplitude of asymmetric vertical head and pelvic movement during t h el u n g ei st o ol a r g et oe n a b l ee s t a b l i s h m e n to ft h r e s h - olds between lame and not lame as in the straight-line evaluation. It is common for normal horses to lunge in one direc- tion differently than in the other direction. Last, andmost importantly, the patterns of vertical torso move- ment asymmetry seen in normal horses are heavily de-pendent upon ground surface characteristics. 10 However, in general, certain patterns of vertical head and pelvic motion can be expected on hard or softground, and deviations from these expected patterns can be used to increase the strength of evidence of lameness.10On soft ground, the horse will move its head up more when pushing off the outside forelimb,giving the appearance of an outside forelimb push-off- type lameness. The outside hindlimb will sink down into the surface when pushing off and the pelvis will raise less, and the pelvis will fall less when weight bearing on the inside hindlimb. These ndings combine Fig. 4. Primary left forelimb right AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 339to make it appear like the horse has an outside hind- limb push-off-type lameness and an inside hindlimbimpact-type lameness. When this pattern is seen(Fig. 5), or any part of this pattern, caution should beused before proclaiming evidence of lameness. By contrast, if the horse is lunging on very hard ground, the head will move down less on the insideforelimb, thus giving the appearance of an inside fore-limb impact lameness. Also, the pelvis will fall less andrise less on the inside hindlimb, thus giving the horsethe appearance of inside hindlimb impact-type andpush-off-type lameness. When this pattern is seen(Fig. 6), or any part of this pattern, caution should beused before proclaiming evidence of lameness. Adding lunging to the lameness evaluation protocol increases the complexity of the lameness evaluation,especially when different surfaces are used for straight-line and lunging evaluations. Unless a horse is trainedto lunge, it is fruitless to try to gain information bylunging the horse. Highly variable observations anddata distract from correct determination of lameness.Even with horses that are trained to lunge, they will commonly show handedness and lunge in one direction differently that the other. Horses may display lamenessat the lunge that is not shown in the straight, but it isvery uncommon for horses with a clearly seen lamenessin the straight to not also show this lameness at thelunge. All these observations suggest that using lungingfor workup of lameness may not be necessary, and mayactually be distracting in some cases, when the lame-ness is easily seen (or measured) in the straight-linetrot. Lunging should be reserved for horses that aretrained to lunge and for presentations in which lame- ness is not seen or measured at the straight trot. Despite these ndings, it remains good procedure to lunge horses in lameness evaluations, if not only to have the data to study later. However, if the lameness is seen or measured easily in the straight line and it isd e c i d e dt ob l o c kt h eh o r s et ot r yt ol o c a t et h el a m e n e s swithin the limb, it is most prudent to restrict evalua- tions to only trotting the horse in a straight line to assess the block. Because of the more complex pat-terns of asymmetry seen when horses are lunging, it is more challenging to accurately measure changes in lameness amplitude before and after blocking whilethe horse is lunging. When the lameness is only seen or measured when the horse is lunging, then, of course, the effect of blocking is measured with thehorse lunging in the direction that most displays the lameness. 6. Lameness Evaluation Under Saddle Some believe that putting the horse under saddle with a rider will invariably make the lameness appear worse. Putting the horse under saddle with a riderincreases weight on the limbs, causes increased back extension, and exacerbates discomfort with any poor saddle t. However, there are also good reasons why putting a horse under saddle makes the appearance of lameness more dif cult to detect. Horses that are well trained when ridden are more under the control of the rider. Good horses that are well trained and willing can easily mask even moderate-grade lame- ness. Also, some horses are more excited under Fig. 5. Normal asymmetric head and pelvic vertical movement when lunging on soft surfaces. RF, right fore; RH, right hind; 340 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsaddle, with the increase in adrenaline masking pain and the exhibition of lameness. The effect of the rider on measurement of lameness has been studied using BMIS attached to both the horse and the rider. Movement in sound horses was measured before and after induction of lameness and in horses with natural lameness conditions. Appearance of lameness was dependent on the rider 's activity. Appearance of lameness also depends on whether the horse was being ridden in a circle, the size of the circle, and the surface characteristics on which the horse was being ridden. Circle size, surface characteristics, and rider activity combine to affect vertical head and pelvicmovement, with the effects sometimes additive, making a false lameness appear (or an existing lameness appear more severe), and sometimes subtractive,masking a true lameness (or making an existing lameness appear less severe). When the rider was sitting at the trot, the results were quite variable. About one third of the horseslooked the same as trotting in a straight line without the rider, about one third seemed to be less lame withthe rider, and about one third seemed to be more lame with the rider. However, with the rider posting on the outside limb, it was common for the horse to appear to b el a m e ro nt h eo p p o s i t es i d e ,b o t hi nt h ef o r e l i m ba n d in the hindlimb, with the most dramatic effect asdecreased push off of the opposite hindlimb. When the rider is posting on the outside limb, they are rising in the saddle and shifting weight forward when the inside forelimb is on the ground. If the horse had a true inside forelimb lameness, this could exacerbatethe expression of lameness. Also, the rider is fallinginto the saddle when the inside hindlimb is pushingoff. The downward motion of the rider and upwardmotion of the pelvis oppose each other, and the pelvisrises less than it normally would, giving the appear-ance of lack of inside hindlimb push off. Although evaluation for lameness under saddle is more complicated because of rider activity, certainlywhen lameness is not being measured when not undersaddle, then evaluation of lameness under saddlebecomes necessary. Another indication is in cases inwhich the lameness being measured when not undersaddle is different from what is described by theowner or trainer (or referring veterinarian). Whenowners preface their request for lameness evaluationwith a historical description that the lameness is notseen or felt unless the horse is under saddle, it is usu-a l l yag o o di d e at ot r yt op e r f o r mt h ee v a l u a t i o nu n d e rsaddle. 7. Other Observations of Lameness as Measured with Inertial Sensors Evaluating for Lameness at the Walk, Canter, and/or Gallop Most practitioners would agree that lameness is easier t os e ei nat r o t t i n gh o r s ec o m p a r e dt oo t h e rg a i t s .T h e r e are a few \"lameness \"conditions that are more easily seen at the walk, like brotic myopathy, ruptured pero- neous tertius, upward xation of the patella, and string- halt. These are erroneously thought to be primarilyswinging limb lamenesses but are indeed more easilyseen at the walk. Some also claim that a weight-bearing Fig. 6. Normal asymmetric head and pelvic vertical movement when lunging on hard surfaces. RF, right fore; RH, right AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 341lameness may be more apparent when the horse is walking, but this is only because when the horse is walking, the asymmetric motion falls within the normaltemporal resolution of the naked human eye. The lame- ness may be easier to see at the walk than the trot, but this does not mean that the lameness would be easier tomeasure at the walk than the trot. Also, almost always, the lameness, when compared to the canter and gallop gaits, is easier to see at the trot. 11This has usually been explained as a consequence of the rather easy task ofidentifying asymmetry in an otherwise very symmetri- cal expected movement. This is de nitely true, but this is not the only reason. When a horse transitions from trot to canter or gallop, within the range of speeds com- patible for this transition, forces on the limbs decrease. Thus, it is logical to also assume that the lameness willbe less perceived or felt by the horse when it breaks into t h ec a n t e ro rg a l l o p . 11Also, options for redistributing load to spare the painful limb that are available to the horse at the trot are not so available to the horse at the canter or gallop. At transition speeds, horses with lameness will prefer to canter, especially on the non-lame limb lead. Preference for cantering or gallopingon a particular lead may be informative for establish- ing the existence of lameness as a clinical sign, but specic motion parameters that are sensitive for detec- tion of lameness (like asymmetric vertical head and pelvic motion for the trot) have yet to be objectively identi ed for the canter or gallop. After gradually inducing pain on the bottom of the foot in horses, lame- ness was measured at a slow trot in a straight line before it was measured at either the canter or gallop.Detection of lameness at the trot in a straight line wasmore sensitive at picking up lameness than at the canter or gallop. 11This may not be applicable to pain in the limb that occurs only during the swing phase of the stride. However, attempts to create lameness iso- l a t e do n l yt ot h es w i n gp h a s eo ft h es t r i d eh a v en o t been successful, and the existence of pure swinginglimb lameness without pain during the weight-bearing phase of the stride has not been objectively determined to exist. Stabilizing the Lameness Before the availability of BMIS, it was not recognizedthat lameness was frequently not displayed by the horse clearly (above thresholds) and consistently (with low variability) when rst examined. Clinical impression over the years has shown this to be quitecommon. Using horses with natural or induced lame- ness, and in following horses in the clinic with known lameness conditions as part of routine assessment ofimprovement, one may frequently have the opportu- nity to evaluate horses with lameness multiple times on multiple days. Horses with known lameness condi-tions, diagnosed by previous full lameness workups, often either do not show the strongest lameness in the previously identi ed limb, or the lameness is not of the previously identi ed amplitude. When using sim- ple, subjective evaluation, there is a tendency to either not notice this or just shrug it off. It is not dif cult toraise awareness to the mistakes that can be made int h ee v a l u a t i o no fr e s p o n s et ob l o c k si fl a m e n e s s changes spontaneously like this. However, lameness can be \"stabilized \"by simply trotting the horse back and forth a few times or lung- ing (if the horse lunges) it in both directions for a few minutes. A standard method of lameness evaluationwith BMIS starts off with trotting the horse in a straight line. Then, the horse is lunged and another straight-line trial is collected. If the straight-linelameness is not stable, that is, if the lameness is not in the same limb, at the approximate same amplitude, and at an acceptable consistency (standard deviationsnot too much higher than the average), one should keep collecting trials until they are consistent (time permitting), have an assistant or the owner exercisethe horse more (freeing oneself up to evaluate another patient), or accept the fate that the source of lameness may have to be found some other way (limb palpation,imaging, etc.). Sometimes, the complete limb and torso evaluation stabilizes the lameness, possibly due to limb manipulation. It is not ef cient to block the horse to try to discover the foci of lameness if the lameness is not stabilized. It is usually a waste of time. Some would ask if this would not, in some cases, warm the horse out of the lameness, making it undisco-verable. This may occur, but if the horse warms out of the lameness in such a short time, with this limitedamount of exercise, then it probably is not clinically important. Understanding and taking this into consid- eration will go a long way to ameliorate some of theheadaches and mistakes of interpreting objective mea- surement to evaluate blocks in horses with lameness. Figure 7 is an example of an unstable lameness. This rst trial (left) was collected immediately before the second (right). The lame limbs are consistent, buttheir amplitudes are not. If the horse had been blocked immediately after Trial 1, either in the left forelimb orright hindlimb, it would have appeared that the horse improved because of the block. The real improvement occurred spontaneously. Some horses measure with high variability of lame- ness, especially in the forelimbs, because they are not trotting consistently and their adrenaline level is high and pain is masked. A small amount of sedation awill usually help, and this has been shown to be inconse- quential to the display of lameness. Lameness is often displayed stronger with mild sedation. If one encounters a horse that does not stabilize its lameness, or one that displays lameness of different type (impact/push off), in different limbs, or of wide variation of amplitude in different limbs, neurologicdysfunction should be more strongly considered. Using Body-Mounted Inertial Sensors to Assess Response to Blocking Assessing response to block as a decrease in lameness from baseline is relatively straightforward using BMIS.A positive response to block is based upon nding a change in the measurement of lameness that is outsidethe 95% con dence interval for repeatability for theINNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIES 342 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSlameness measurement variables, 68.5 mm for VS and63 mm for Diff Min (pelvis) and Diff Max (pelvis). An increase or decrease in these values within the 95% condence intervals may be signi cant, but assessment should be repeated. It is important to compare the trial after block to the trial collected immediately before that block when 1) the user switches from blocking one limb toanother limb, 2) more than 1 limb was blocked at the same time, and 3) the lameness increased signi - cantly after the previous blocks. It is not uncommon for a block to increase the amplitude of lameness in alimb, especially with the most distal limb blockswhen the focus of lameness is more proximal in thelimb being blocked. This is an indication that the limb being blocked is the primary source of pain. If blocking a limb, starting low and progressing proxi-mally, and an apparent small decrease in lamenesswith each block is achieved is evidence for blocking asecondarily lame limb. There are a signi cant num- ber of false positives (horse is better after block butthe block should not have desensitized the site oflameness) and false negatives (horse seems no betterbut the block should have desensitized the site oflameness) blocks. The full effect of the block some-times takes much longer than a few minutes, and somewhat paradoxically, sometimes blocks were off quicker than expected. BMIS and Big Data The Q with Lameness Locator has been available to vet-erinarians for 15 years, and there are now over 450 unitsin use around the world. Every year, there are new devel-opments and improvements in hardware and software that make the veterinarian experience more seamless and easier to use. In the author 's (the University of Missouri) use alone, data on thousands of clinical caseshave been collected. Hundreds of thousands more caseshave been evaluated by other equine clinics around theworld. Practitioners have only recently begun to take advantage of these numbers, matching up lameness measurement parameters with blocking and imagingndings and with clinical data on nal diagnosis. Theauthor has introduced in this presentation only a few of the things that have been learned over the years of clini-cal importance: the variability of lunging, the effects of surface on lunging results, the effect of the rider and their activity on lameness measurement, the need to stabilizethe lameness before blocking, the meaning of increasinglameness after blocking, etc. It has been recently learnedthat CFHL is measured frequently but that nding a pri- mary cause of lameness in both a forelimb and a hind-limb is not common, that the law of sides is generallytrue but not perfect, that ipsi-impact patterns are just aslikely to be primary forelimb or primary hindlimb lame- ness, and that ipsi-push-off patterns are most likely pri- mary hindlimb lameness problems. 11It has also been learned that hindlimb impact patterns more likely indi-cate cause of lameness in foot, pastern, joint that navicular disease is a common cause of forelimblameness in ipsi-impact patterns but rarely the cause of lameness in ipsi-push-off patterns with a primary fore- limb cause of lameness. Critics of using BMIS to objec-tively measure lameness in horses, arguing that it is justtoo dif cult and time-consuming, that it reduces the im- portance of a dif cultly acquired skill of visually recogniz- ing lameness, or that it is too de cient to provide clinically useful information, none of which is true in theauthor 's opinion, are missing the most important point. Measuring and recording data is the rst and most criti- cal step in studying or investigating anything.

What Is measurement unit (IMU) is a wearable de- vice that is a type of inertial sensor. An IMU is com-posed of a triaxial accelerometer, a triaxial gyroscope,and a magnetometer, and the combination of these indi-vidual components can provide information on kine-matics, or motion, of a horse or speci c body segments of a horse. The accelerometer provides measurementsof accelerations in three planes (cranial-caudal, medial-lateral, and proximal-distal); this is translatio-nalmotion (Fig. 1). These accelerations can be integrated todetermine velocity and positional data. The gyroscopesprovide angular velocity in three planes (Fig. 1), whichcan be integrated to provide angular orientation or dif-ferentiated to provide angular acceleration. Thus, the output of the IMU can determine both linear and angu- lar kinematics of the horse or a segment of the horse.Additionally, fusion of the accelerometer and gyroscopesignals can provide information on heading, and addingin the magnetometer signal aligns the sensor with thereference plane of the Earth. 2. How Is an IMU Different from an Inertial Sensor? An inertial measurement unit is a type of inertial sen-sor. Inertial sensors can be composed of the individualcomponents of an IMU. For example, an accelerome-ter and a gyroscope are also types of inertial sensors.The most commonly used inertial sensor system, 1 uni-axial gyroscope.An into a single unit(i.e., the accelerometer and gyroscope are within onesensor box; Fig. 2). 3. What IMU Systems Are Available for Use in Horses? There are currently 3 IMU systems that research: XSens MTW,bGaitSmart Pegasus,c and EquiMoves.dThe XSens\u00aeMTW intensely researched since the early 2000s.1,2These IMU sensor units contain a triaxial accelerometer ( 6 18g)a n dt r i a x i a lg y r o s c o p e( 61200 degrees/second). While data have been collected from IMUs attached tothe distal limbs just above the level of the metacarpo/metatarsophalangeal joint using the XSens \u00aesystem,3 most of the published work has been from body-mounted sensors (poll, withers, thoracolumbar spine,and pelvis). The use of a second commercially avail-able IMU system, Pegasus \u00ae, was reported in the mid- 2010s.4,5The IMUs of this uniaxial 61200 degrees/second gyroscopes. The IMU sensors in this system havebeen placed on the limbs of the horse at the level ofthe distal tibia and midmetatarsus or midmetacarpusand have been able to provide information on limbmovement. 4The third IMU system that is commer- cially available is the EquiMoves\u00aesystem.6This sys- tem is composed of two triaxial accelerometers: a low-grange at 616gand a high- grange at 6400g.T h e NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 345INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIESgyroscope within this system is 62000 degrees/sec- ond. This system has been used to collect kinematic data on both the body of the horse and the limbs. Another IMU system that has been evaluated to a lim- ited extent in horses is the smartphone.7-10There are numerous apps on smartphones that allow collection ofdata from the accelerometers and gyroscopes containedwithin these devices. The ranges of acceleration andangular velocity vary somewhat with smartphones,but as an example, the iPhone \u00ae6ehas a616gacceler- ometer degrees/second gyroscope. 4. Limitations of IMUs While IMUs have the ability to determine both trans- lational and angular motions, they are also complex devices with a number of limitations. First, there arelimitations with the measurement ranges of bothaccelerometers and gyroscopes when it comes to both the location of the IMU on the horse and the gait andspeed at which the horse will be traveling. This is most important for limb-mounted sensors because of t h eh i g hr a t eo fc h a n g ei nm o t i o na tt h ed i s t a la s p e c tof the limb, that is, the foot. For the walk and regulartrot, both the acceleration and the rate of angularmotion are within the range that can be captured with currently available IMUs. However, at faster gaits (gallop or trotting at high speed), the accelera-tion ranges of the hoof during both flight and landing are higher than some of the accelerometers withincommercially available IMUs. (6 400g)i s high enough to capture those accelerations. The other component to consider is the gyroscope, which meas-ures rate of angular orientation (angular velocity).The current range limit is 62000 degrees/second, which again is appropriate for walk and regular trotspeeds but is likely not suf cient for higher-velocity gaits. A previously validated IMU system contained a620000 degrees/second gyroscope, but that system is not currently marketed and had other flaws in its sen- sor design, including motion of the individual compo-nents within the device box. 11 A second limitation of the IMU also involves the gyroscope. When the gyroscope is collecting data for alonger period of time (as short as a few minutes), it undergoes a process called drift (Fig. 3). There are a number of algorithms that can be utilized in post-processing that can address this problem. Calibratingthe gyroscope and collecting short durations of dataare also useful in preventing data alterations from drift. A third limitation of the IMU is one that is encoun- tered with wearable sensors. That is the attachment Fig. 1.

Rotation around the vertical axis (white arrow) is internal-external rotation (yaw). Rotation around the cra- nial-caudal axis (red arrow) is abduction/adduction (roll). Rotation around the medial-lateral axis (yellow arrow) is flexion-extension (pitch). Fig. 2.

If the IMU is not snuggly mounted to the horse, it will not provide true readings, that is, therewill be background noise. This can be a problem nomatter where the sensor is mounted on the horse(body, hoof, or limb). 5. How Have IMUs Been Used in Horses? Currently, the use of IMUs has been mostly in the research eld. However, the EquiMoves\u00aesystem is marketed for clinical use in Europe. There is a hugeamount of research data that have been collected from horses using IMUs, with IMUs mounted on both the body and limbs. IMUs have also been used to col-lect kinematic information at multiple gaits from the walk to the gallop. The ability of an IMU to collect useful kinematic data depends on its attachmentmethod, the speci cations of the components, and the gait at which the horse is moving, as previouslydiscussed. Body-Mounted IMUs The earliest research with IMUs involved mountingthem on the body of the horse as early units were wiredand had lower acceleration and gyroscopic ranges. 1,2 They have been mounted on the poll, tuber sacrale, tubercoxae, and thoracolumbar spine. Because the LamenessLocator \u00aesystem is a well-known and commonly used in- ertial sensor system, IMUs have been used in the samelocations (poll and tuber sacrale) and to determine thesame variables as the Lameness Locator \u00ae.12The tuber c o x a eh a v eb e e na n o t h e rl o c a t i o nf o rp l a c e m e n to fI M U sas this is an anatomic region that is often used for sub-jective visual assessment of lameness. 13,14Vertical dis- placement (calculated using the accelerometers) hasbeen a commonly evaluated variable and has been usedto assess symmetry in right- versus left-sided motion. Rotational data (calculated from gyroscopes) have also been evaluated with sensors placed on the axial skeletonat sites sacrale). 15-17Thoracolumbar-mounted sensors have been attached to the skin at these sites, which has allowed for saddle placement over them. In one recent study, the rotational motion of the thoracolumbosacral region was investigated in a group of elite dressagehorses both in hand and being ridden at a sitting trot.17 T h e s er e s u l t sw e r ea b l et oc a p t u r ed i f f e r e n c e si nb a c k motion that occurred between these two conditions. Theeffect of saddle t on thoracolumbar motion during rid- den work has also been investigated using IMUs.16Both of these investigations were able to provide informationon back motion underneath the saddle, which would nothave been possible using other currently validatedmotion analysis techniques. Another study examinedthe effects of local anesthesia to eliminate lameness on thoracolumbar kinematics, which provided additional support to the interconnection of lameness and backpain in horses. 15 Limb-Mounted IMUs IMUs have also been mounted on the limbs of horses but to a lesser extent compared to the axial skeleton. There are likely several reasons why limb sensors have beeninvestigated to a lesser extent. First, early IMU systemswere wired and required the sensors to be directly to amain data-logging device. Second, the components of theIMUs were of lower ranges, limiting their use on thelimbs. Last, as these devices have been investigated asobjective lameness tools, it was logical to examine theregions of the horse that are commonly assessed subjec- tively (i.e., the head and pelvis). Currently, the angular motions of limb segments have been the primary areaof investigation using IMUs. Because of the limitationsof some of the components within the currently avail-able IMUs, these devices have been primarily used atthe level of the metacarpus/metatarsus or proximallimb. Placement of sensors at the metacarpus and dis-tal tibia has allowed the range of motion of the tarsusto be evaluated. 18The displacement and rotation of the foot has also been determined using a hoof-mounted IMU.11,19Limb protraction and retraction angles have also been measured at the trot using metacar- pal- or metatarsal-mounted sensors.5,18,20Limb- mounted IMUs have also been used to determinehoof-on and hoof-off events, which can be used tod e t e r m i n es t a n c ea n ds w i n gp h a s e so fs t r i d e . 3,21 The information obtained from the limb-mountedsensors may prove useful for investigation of lame-ness as well as to understand limb movements inthe elite athlete. 6. IMUs Versus Other Kinematic Systems Currently available IMUs, such as the Pegasus\u00ae, XSens\u00ae,a n dE q u i M o v e s\u00aesystems, have been vali- dated to the gold standard of kinematics, optical kine-matics,1,4,6and both systems were found to have good accuracy. As the Lameness Locator\u00aesystem has become widely utilized around the world, a study was performedto compare this system to the XSens \u00aesystem in the calculation of commonly assessed variables used in theLameness Locator \u00aesystem.12R e s u l t sf r o mt h i sw o r k demonstrated that there were small differences inthe variables calculated by each system; however, theauthors felt that this should not affect the amount oflameness detected with each system. While not yet Fig. 3. Angular orientation around the vertical axis (yaw) from an IMU mounted on the surcingle of a standing horse, which demonstrates drift that occurs from the gyroscopic sensor.INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 347investigated, it is likely that the Pegasus\u00aeand EquiMoves\u00aesystems would provide similar variable calculations as the XSens\u00aesystem and the Lameness Locator\u00ae. 7. Clinical Use of IMUs Until recently, IMUs have largely been utilized in a research setting. There have been several main rea- sons for their limited clinical use. First, the technol-ogy, both hardware and processing algorithms, had tobe tested and validated. Second, an equine-speci cs y s - tem had to be developed as the rst intensively investi- gated IMU system (XSens \u00ae) was designed for use in people and did not have equine-speci cs o f t w a r e .N o w , equine-speci c systems are being designed and are being used clinically mostly within the EuropeanUnion (Pegasus \u00ae,E q u i M o v e s\u00ae). These and other simi- lar systems are likely to become more commerciallyavailable more globally in the next few years. 8. Conclusions IMUs are sophisticated motion analysis devices that can provide both translational and rotational kinemat- ics of both the axial skeleton and limbs in horses.These sensors have already been used intensively inresearch settings to better understand the motions ofhorses during both ridden and unridden exercise. Assensor technology improves as has already begun tooccur, it is likely that these devices will be able to pro-vide more kinematic information about distal limbmotion, including the interaction of the hoof with theground at high speeds. It is likely that these deviceswill provide a better understanding of equine motion,both for lameness and general gait analysis.Additionally, these systems are becoming morecommercially available for clinical use, which willadd another objective gait analysis tool for equinepractitioners.

Introduction The Q with Lameness Locator has been available to veterinarians for 15 years, and there are now 450units in use around the world. Every year, there arenew developments and improvements in hardwareand software that make the veterinarian 's experi- ence easier. At the University of Missouri alone, data on thousands of clinical cases have been collected. Hundreds of thousands more cases have been eval-uated by other equine clinics around the world. Onlyrecently have practitioners begun to take advantageof these numbers, matching up lameness measure-ment parameters with blocking and imaging ndings and with clinical data on nal diagnosis. 2. Comparison of Results for Body-Mounted Inertial Sensor Assessment with Final LamenessDetermination in 1,224 Equids 1 Body-mounted inertial sensors (BMIS) are now being used to objectively evaluate lameness inhorses around the world. In quadrupeds, lameness,as a clinical sign (not a disease), can be found tooriginate with an abnormality in a single limb, itcan be bilateral but con ned to either end of the body (i.e., forelimbs or hindlimbs exclusively), or itcan involve a combination of (one or more) forelimbsand hindlimbs. Simultaneous, combined lamenessin a forelimb and hindlimb (CFHL) been fur-ther subdivided into compensatory and secondarylameness. Compensatory lameness develops at the op- posite end of the body from the primary lameness; it is nonpathological, presumably appears simultaneouslywith primary lameness, and is expected to disappearwith the resolution of primary lameness. Conversely,secondary lameness is probably associated with pain.It may not be detected until after primary lameness isfound and will continue following the resolution of pri-mary lameness, and both forelimbs or both hindlimbs can be involved at the same time. Compensatory lameness in horses has been well studied with kine-matics, 2,3force-measuring treadmills,4,5and BMIS sys- tems,6,7whereas secondary lameness is a logically suspected but less studied concept supported by clinicalopinion.8 Compensatory lameness patterns generally follow what has been referred to as the sagittal and diagonal compensatory movement principles,2also described as the law of sides.9The sagittal compensatory move- principle states that ipsilateral CFHL usuallyindicates primary hindlimb lameness. The diagonal compensatory movement principle states that contra- lateral CFHL usually indicates primary forelimb lameness. In contrast, secondary lameness patternsattributable to overloading are generally considered to be contralateral only and to occur at the same end or opposite ends of the body. It has been shown that prevalence of forelimb-only lameness, hind-limb-only lameness, and CFHL in equids as measured by a BMIS system when trotting NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 349INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIESin a straight line is associated with location of the cause of lameness. This information is helpful to vet-erinarians planning their lameness work ups. 1. A horse with CFHL where the forelimb and hindlimb lameness is ipsilateral and the hind-limb lameness is both lack of impact and lackof pushoff. This pattern had a high (86.6%)positive diagnostic rate. The primary problemis most likely in the hindlimb; 86.4% had theprimary problem in the hindlimb (Fig 1). 2. A horse with CFHL where the forelimb and hind- limb lameness is ipsilateral and the hindlimblameness is only lack of pushoff. This patternhad a moderate (62.0%) positive diagnostic rate.T h ep r i m a r yp r o b l e mi sm o r el i k e l yt ob ei nt h ehindlimb; 86.3% had the primary problem in thehindlimb (Fig 2). It is preferable to see the prior 2 patterns (1 and 2). They have a high to moderately high positivediagnostic rate, and the good bet is that the primaryproblem is in the hindlimb. 3. A horse with CFHL where the forelimb and hindlimb lameness is ipsilateral but the hind-limb lameness is only lack of impact. Thispattern had a high (77.9%) positive diagnosticrate, but the primary problem is almost aslikely to be in the forelimb (45.2%) as in thehindlimb (33.9%) as in both (11.3%). isconsidered a dif cult pattern as more informa- tion is needed to decide which limb to look ator block rst (Fig 3). 4. A horse with CFHL where the hindlimb lame- ness is ipsilateral lack of pushoff and contra-lateral lack of impact. This pattern did not(thankfully) occur very frequently (only 4% ofall CFHL cases). Horses with this patternwere just as likely to have the primary causeof lameness in the forelimb (20%), in thehindlimb (35%), in both the forelimb and the Fig. 1. Right forelimb with combined right hindlimb impact and pushoff CFHL. Fig. 2. Right forelimb with only right hindlimb pushoff CFHL.INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIES 350 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGShindlimb (25%), or not within the limbs (20%). This is considered a dif cult pattern as the pri- mary cause of lameness could just as likely bein the forelimb only, in the hindlimb only, inboth the forelimb and hindlimb, or not in thelimbs (Fig 4). 5. A horse with CFHL with forelimb and contralateral hindlimb lameness of pushoff and lack of impact. Thispattern has a moderately high (70.6%) posi-tive diagnostic rate. The primary problem is more likely to be in a forelimb; 78.6% of the cases had a primary cause of lameness in aforelimb (Fig 5). 6. A horse with forelimb and contralateral hindlimb lameness pattern has a moder-ately high (69.6%) positive diagnostic rate.The primary problem is most likely to be in aforelimb; 90.6% of the cases had a primarycause of lameness in a forelimb (Fig 6). It is preferable to see the prior two patterns (5 and 6). They have a high to moderately high positive diag-nostic rate, and the good bet is that the primary prob-lem is in the forelimb. 7. A horse with forelimb lameness and contralateral hindlimb lameness that isonly lack of impact. Even though the majorityof these cases had the primary cause of lame-ness in a forelimb (86.1%), this pattern had alow de nitive diagnostic rate (54.5%). The only explanation for this is primary forelimb lame-ness with secondary hindlimb lameness, orvice versa. There is no known compensatorypattern that explains this CFHL (Fig 7). 8. Last, a horse with CFHL with forelimb lame- ness, contralateral hindlimb lameness that is 3. Right forelimb with only right hindlimb impact CFHL. Fig. 4. Right forelimb with right hindlimb pushoff and left hindlimb impact CFHL.INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 2022 351lack of pushoff, and ipsilateral hindlimb lame- ness that is lack of impact. This pattern was notvery common, comprising only about 7% of all cases. About two thirds of these cases had the primary cause of lameness in the forelimb andabout one third in the hindlimb. The simplest ex- planation for the CFHL is primary forelimb lameness hind-limb lack of pushoff and ipsilateral hindlimb lack of impact. An alternative explanation for this pattern is primary hindlimb lameness (lack ofpushoff) and secondary contralateral forelimb and hindlimb lameness (Fig 8). Most CFHL patterns seen during the initial straight-line trotting evaluation are easily explained by compensatory movement principles, and thisknowledge is useful for localization of primary limb lameness in many cases. However, CFHL patterns in which hindlimb lameness is only of the impact typesuggest that the diagnostic process will be moredifcult. 3. Ipsi-Impact vs. Ipsi-Pushoff In a second \"big lameness and ip-silateral hindlimb lameness that is only lack of impact). These 2 patterns correspond to patterns 2 and 3 above. As was found earlier (see above), pattern2 cases were more likely to have a primary hindlimblameness, and those with pattern 3 were just as likelyto have primary forelimb as primary hindlimb causeof lameness. However, interestingly, if the cause oflameness was found in a forelimb, it was more likely to be navicular disease in ipsi-impact cases and more likely to be in the foot for ipsi-pushoff cases comparedto ipsi-impact cases. Alternatively, if the cause oflameness was found in a hindlimb, it was more likely Fig. 5. Right forelimb with left hindlimb impact and pushoff CFHL. Fig. 6. Right forelimb with only left hindlimb pushoff CFHL.INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIES 352 2022 / Vol. AAEP PROCEEDINGSto be foot, pastern, or distal tarsal joint for ipsi- impact vs. ipsi-pushoff cases and more likely to betendon, ligament, or high-motion joint (fetlock, tibio-tarsal, sti fle) for ipsi-pushoff cases compared to ipsi- impact cases. 4. Conclusion Additional studies, for example, comparing contra- impact to contra-pushoff, or more simply, hind-limb- only lameness that is mostly lack of pushoff vs. hind-limb-only lameness that is mostly lack of impact, arecurrently being investigated. This type of informationwill be valuable to practitioners for planning speci c steps in some lameness evaluations, for example, whichlimb to block rst or even which block to perform rst.

Introduction Reduction of catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries in Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses is a top priority of the TBracing industry world-wide. Pre-existing musculoskeletalabnormalities are present in many of the horses that ex-perience catastrophic injuries. Early detection of gaitabnormalities associated with these conditions using sub-jective examinations is problematic. An objective, non-invasive and accurate screening protocol is needed tohelp identify subclinical musculoskeletal pathology in TBracehorses. This study aimed to determine if wearable bi-ometric sensors can detect subtle and otherwise unrecog-nizable gait abnormalities in galloping TB racehorses. 2. Materials and Methods StrideSAFE\u00aeGPS-accelerometer devices were placed in the saddlecloths of 131 TB racehorses competing at theSaratoga Race Course between July 25 and September6, 2021. Acceleration was recorded in 3 dimensionsthroughout the races. Horse recordings were used to cre-ate acceleration curves for individual horses that werecompared with mean reference acceleration curves ofelite sound TB racehorses. Horses with accelerationcurves that were within 2 standard deviations (SD) of the reference mean were classi ed as green. Horses with acceleration curves that were between 2 and 2.9 SD from the reference mean were classi ed as yellow. Horses with acceleration curves of 3 SD or greater fromthe reference mean were classi ed as red. High-speed exercise records for these 3 groups of horses wereobtained for a 4-month period following their analyzedrace. Seven high-speed exercise variables were com-pared, using descriptive statistics and the Independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis test (p 0.05). 3. Results The age distribution of the horses in this study wasconsistent with the general horse population of New Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 355INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIESYork TB racetracks and there was no signi cant dif- ference in the mean age distribution among the horses with red, yellow, and green alert classi cations. In the 4-month follow-up period following the analyzedraces, with a red alert classi cation took signif- icantly longer to resume racing than horses with ei- ther a yellow or a green alert classi cation. Horses with a red alert classi cation raced fewer times after the analyzed race than the horses with a green alert classi cation. Horses with a red alert classi cation completed fewer number of high-speed furlong events (ofcial timed workouts and races) after the analyzed race than horses with a green alert classi cation. 4. Discussion StrideSAFE\u00aewearable biometric sensors were able to reliably detect subtle gait abnormalities in gallopingTB racehorses. There was no association between age and the nding of subtle gait abnormalities in this study population. Horses with subtle gait abnormal-ities in their analyzed race were unable to resumetraining and racing to a degree that was directly pro- portional to their deviation from reference meanacceleration curves of sound elite racehorses. Since lameness is a gait abnormality, and musculoskeletalinjury is the most common cause of time lost from training and racing of TB racehorses, it is likely that the subtle gait abnormalities recorded in the red alerthorses in this study were an indication of subclinicallameness. StrideSAFE \u00aewearable biometric sensors show great promise as a practical screening tool todetect subtle gait abnormalities before overt clinicalsigns of lameness are evident.

Traditionally, this has involved a careful clinical examination of the horse at rest, then proceed- ing to examination of the horse moving to visually assess lameness or asymmetry. Additional techniques such as flexion tests or examination of the horse in a circle, on different surfaces, or under saddle can pro- vide further useful information. Much of the above relies upon the skill and experience of the individual practitioner and is therefore subjective. The search for a more objective approach to the subject has resulted in the development of commercially available objective gait analysis (OGA) systems. These systems typically employ either inertial motion sensors that must beattached to the horse (kinematic analysis) or motion capture of re flective markers (also attached to the horse) by multiple cameras. As a sports medicine clinician, the author has been looking at these systems with keen interest for some time. However, either the extra time and work associ-ated with tting sensors to a lameness case or the pro- hibitive cost of a multicamera system for a smallerpractice have ultimately made the acquisition of an OGA system unattractive. This presentation describes how a novel, commercially available, sensor-free OGA smartphone application acan address these issues. It achieves this by providing objective data to complementthe clinical judgment of the busy practitioner using only their smartphone. The app has been developed by arti cial intelligence engineers, veterinary researchers, and clinicians among the veterinary faculty at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. It has beenvalidated1against a recognized \"gold standard \"multi- camera motion capture system.bIn contrast to the system against which it was validated and others cur- rently commercially available, it dispenses with having to attach motion sensors or re flective markers to the horse. These are replaced by an algorithm that reads the symmetry of the horse 'sg a i td i r e c t l yf r o ma n a l y s i s of video of the horse moving, using deep neural net- works. The video is collected and processed via this app that is downloaded to the veterinarian 's smartphone. The app then produces easily interpreted information in the format set out in the two examples below (Fig. 1). This facilitates easy and direct integration of the app into the daily routine of the busy equine practitioner. 2. Materials and Methods The OGA app provides data to the clinician using only a camera stand and a smartphone. The smartphone (with the app downloaded) is secured on a stable plat- form just above eye level and centered on the area where the horse trots up in hand (Fig. 2). Video re-cording is started within the app, and the horse trots in hand away from and back toward the smartphone. For a typical trot-up length of 100 -130 feet, trotting NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 357INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIESthe horse away and back twice will collect suf cient data to return reliable results. Given that this is a common starting point for many clinicians, it repre-sents no extra work beyond pressing record on thesmartphone app. The video is then uploaded and proc-essed by the bespoke algorithm, and a result isreturned within approximately 5 minutes. It providesdata on the affected limb(s) using a simple color-coded Fig. 1. Two examples of information produced by the OGA app. Fig. 2.

The turn-around time allows almost real-time objective data tobe made available. It also lends itself to the sequentialanalysis of a horse where diagnostic analgesia isemployed to localize the lameness, a common sce-nario. Typically, one can examine a horse, upload thevideo for analysis, perform diagnostic analgesia, andhave the results back and be ready to use the appagain to assess the outcome. This is particularly help-ful in the case of a low-grade lameness or where diag-nostic analgesia improves but does not completelyresolve a lameness. 3. Results This app has become part of the daily routine of 3 of the 4 clinicians in the author 's practice. Case-based examples of the application in practice are presented as follows: Case 1: 2011 Irish Sport Horse Showjumper History This mare had a forelimb lameness of 4 months dura- tion, which started the day after a competition. She had been managed with restricted exercise duringthat period, and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) jointhad been medicated historically by another clinician.The lameness was reportedly unchanged during thatperiod, showing no signi cant improvement. Resting Exam A mild effusion was present in the left fore DIP joint. Moving Exam A mild (grade 1/5) left foreleg lameness was present in both a straight line and in a circle on both rm and soft surfaces. A palmar digital nerve block abolished the lameness, with the information provided by theapp corroborating that view (Fig. 3). This was helpfulin con rming the clinical impression in this case given the relatively subtle visual nature of the lameness. The app provides a color-based interpretation of the lameness in a summary page. The degree of lameness decreases from red, through orange, yellow, gray, andthen to green, where no asymmetry is present. This can be helpful in discussion with clients as it is visu- ally simple and generally well received. There is alsomore in-depth data within the app relating to each limb, each stride analyzed by the app, and whether the lameness is characterized more as an impact orpush-off lameness. Note in this case that the lameness is characterized as orange, improving to gray follow- ing the block. Imaging A small osteophyte was present on the palmaroproxi- mal aspect of the navicular bone. However, this wasconsidered insuf cient to account for the lameness. Given the duration of the lameness and the lack of response to rest and medication of the DIP joint, the mare was referred for advanced imaging in the form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This demon-strated the presence of a DIP joint collateral ligament injury (Fig. 4). Case 2: 2018 National Hunt Thoroughbred Racehorse History This lly went lame in front some 3 weeks prior to presentation. She had a short period of rest, came sound, resumed exercise, and went lame again. Resting Exam No localizing signs. Moving Exam A moderate (grade 2/5) left foreleg lameness was pres- ent. A combined low 2-point and abaxial sesamoidnerve block did not alter the lameness. A subcarpal nerve block abolished the lameness. The clinicalimpression at this time was that a very subtle right foreleg lameness was now present. This was corrobo- rated by the data provided by the app, increasing cli-nician con dence in the view that the lameness was bilateral in this case (Fig. 5). Imaging Ultrasound examination demonstrated ndings con- sistent with proximal suspensory desmitis in both forelimbs. In addition, a small avulsion was present in the left fore proximal cannon (Fig. 6). This lly was subject to restricted exercise for 6 weeks, at which time she was sound. She resumedan increasing plane of exercise and returned to train- ing uneventfully. Case 3: 13-Year-Old Irish Sport Horse 3-Day Eventer This horse was long listed for selection to competeat the European Championships 2022, Herning, Denmark. While ongoing monitoring of thesehorses is a regular feature of their management Fig. 4.

This was deemed not clinically relevant at this time (Fig. 7). The second assessment was still clinically satisfac- tory, although the OGA app now showed the involve-ment of subtle (gray) ndings in two limbs (Fig. 8).The third assessment was less satisfactory, where the forelimb lameness was now becoming clinically apparent and the OGA app was showing an increasein the frequency of lamer steps in the right foreleg,albeit it still ranked it \"gray\" overall (Fig. 9). This combined clinical and OGA app nding prompted further investigation, which resulted in treat-ment of the right fore (DIP joint) and left hind (tarsome-tatarsal) joints. This resulted in a satisfactory pictureat the most recent assessment day (Fig. 10). Fig. 5. Continued. Fig. 6. A and B, Ultrasound images showing proximal suspensory desmitis in the left forelimb. C, Small avulsion present in the left fore proximal cannon.INNOVATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGIES 362 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSThis ability to build up an objective ongoing picture within the OGA app is an interesting aspect of it. Additional functionality (Fig. 11) has just been addedto the app to allow the owner to video the horse athome as follows: The video is taken by the owner, after which it automatically uploads to the horse 'sle on the veter- inarian 's app. The new data is available only to the veterinarian for interpretation. This, therefore, aids ongoing monitoring of an athlete. In addition, this functionality would seem to lend itself well to follow- up assessment of response to treatment in a patientwhere the initial examination included analysis withthe OGA app. 4. Discussion OGA has been a strangely divisive issue within the profession. Proponents of it have sought to demon- strate that it is superior to the clinician.2This has led to some colleagues viewing it as a threat. Opponentshave pushed back against this view, pointing out thatit is not without its drawbacks and limitations. 3,4The author favors the view that the information providedby any OGA system is exactly that \u2014a piece of infor- mation to be interpreted by the clinician. As a general- ization, the more useful information that is available when progressing a lameness case, the more likely an accurate diagnosis will be achieved. OGA should be viewed through this lens, as a complementary tool sim-ilar perhaps to x-ray, ultrasound, or MRI. It is the author 's experience that this application represents a reliable, inexpensive, user-friendly,sensor-free method of collecting objective gait measure- ments for the busy practitioner. It has become inte- grated into this practice because it provides additional, rapidly available, easily accessed information. There is no requirement to attach sensors or re flective markers to the horse, nor to pair these to a tablet or laptop toaccess the data as is the case with other systems. It can therefore be used as easily in ambulatory practice as it can in a clinic setting. It can be particularly useful in the investigation of subtle or multilimb lamenesses, particularly where regional anesthesia is employed to localize the lameness. Additionally, it allows the collec- tion of a database of information over a period of time on an equine athlete. This facilitates ongoing objective monitoring of a horse over a prolonged period, which Fig. 7. The OGA app showing a subtle left (gray) hindlimb lameness. Fig. 8.

Clients like the concept and the way theresults are presented in a simple, color-coded fashion. In summary, this app ts well into practice routine because it is easy to use and provides useful additional information without adding extra work to an alreadybusy schedule.

Peripheral receptors transduce pain stimuli and relay this centrally through synap- ses in the spinal cord, medulla, hindbrain, thalamus, and cortex.

Introduction Pain is de ned as \"an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. \"1It involves a physiological sensation with an associatedbehavioral response to that sensation. Pain is some-what unique in that diverse stimuli can elicit a com-plex multifaceted response, in contrast to moreconventional sensations that are less varied in their generation and response. A thorough under- standing of the incitement and generation of a painresponse is necessary to formulate a rationale andcomprehensive therapeutic plan. 2. Components of Pain Transduction and Signaling The perception of pain can be divided into three mainstages: pain stimulus, signal transmission from theperiphery to the dorsal horn via the peripheral nerv-ous system (PNS), and transmission of signals to thethalamus and regions of the cortex via the centralnervous system (CNS). Both ascending and descend-ing pathways are present.Peripheral Pain can be considered a protective mechanism thatallows the animal to both detect and respond to injuryor threats to its survival. The skin is the site of themajority of the damage sensing mechanisms, beingthe boundary between the animal and the externalenvironment. There are multiple nerve bers involved in the transmission of pain. 2Sensory (afferent) neurons are classi ed into three main groups (A, B, and C) based on function, axon diameter, and the velocity of a con-ducted impulse. Group A Group A nerve bers are myelinated. They can be fur- ther subdivided into A a,Ab,Ag,a n dA dwith differ- ent sets of characteristics each. These bers generally terminate in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Type A aincludes both Type Ia and Ib sensory bers from muscle spindle endings and Golgi tendon organs. They are involved in proprioceptive function. NOTES 366 2022 / Vol. 68 receptors. Type A gincludes bers from the stretch receptors. Type A dincludes thermal and mechanical noci- ceptor afferent bers.3,4T h e ya r er e s p o n s i v et os h o r t - duration, sharp-pain stimuli. A dbers are the small- est diameter myelinated nerves and have a relativelyfast conduction velocity. Group B Group B nerve bers are preganglionic myelinated nerve bers with midrange conduction velocities. They include bers of the autonomous nervous system and general visceral afferent system. Group C Group C nerve bers are unmyelinated small-diame- terbers with relatively slow conduction velocities. This group nerve bers at the dorsal roots and postganglionic bers of the autonomous nervous system. All these bers are mainly nociceptive in func- tion, carrying sensory information and assembling the majority of the afferent nociceptive information thatthen enters the spinal cord. C bers terminate in the gray matter of the spinal cord. 3 Cber nociceptors are activated by thermal, me- chanical, and chemical stimuli. Activation can beachieved from poorly localized stimuli, which includesburning sensation of the skin. Pain intensi cation may occur due to \"wind up \"whereby constant (same intensity) repeated stimulation of the C bers can induce a dramatically increased magnitude and dura-tion of response after the stimulus has ceased. Once activated, the receptor stimulus at nerve ter- minals is transmitted by both A dand C bers along peripheral nerves to the spinal cord. Modulated syn-apses subsequently relay the signal, allowing itsascent to the higher levels of the CNS to reach con-sciousness and produce an appropriate behavioralresponse. In this manner, peripheral damage can besensed by the animal. Nociception begins at the termi-nal end of pain sensitive neurons, which project fromthe spinal cord to the periphery. 3 The A dand C bers have a wide range of receptors on their terminals. Transient receptor potential cation channel subtypes each activate in the presence of dif- ferent stimuli including mechanical, heat, cold, andtoxins.4A transient, local action potential is generated in response to appropriate receptor binding with theresultant action potential either up- or downregulatedby the actions of receptors and ligands at the periph-eral nerve endings. The signal is ampli ed via regen- erative sodium channels and inhibited by recruitmentof potassium channels. C-ber conduction is slower than A- ber conduction. The C bers are responsible for sustained burning sen- sations and pain that may be experienced after remov-ing a noxious stimulus. A subgroup of C bers is only active under speci c conditions and can be categorizedinto either mechanosensitive or mechanoinsensitive nociceptors. The mechanoinsensitive nociceptors ( r e f e r r e dt oa ss i l e n t )a r es on a m e dd u et ot h e i rl a c ko fresponse following mechanical or electrical stimuli. 5 Comparatively, the A dbers conduct impulses faster and transmit sharp or intense pain sensations. Central The transmission of pain is dependent on the balanceof the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the somato- sensory system. Once delivered to the level of the CNS, a number of regions are involved including the spinalcord, the brainstem (midbrain, medulla oblongata, and the pons), and the cortical regions (cerebral cortex). The dorsal horn of the spinal cord integrates inputs entering the spinal cord. These inputs include the pri- mary afferent neurons and the local interneuron net- works. Descending signals are also contained within this region. Within the ascending system, primaryafferent nociceptors transmit noxious stimuli to pro- jection neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. A number of these projection neurons subsequentlyrelay this information proximally to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex along the spinothalamic tract. This transmits the intensity and location of the nox-ious stimulus. The spinothalamic tract is within the white matter of the spinal cord. It is composed of two parts. The lat-eral spinothalamic tract is involved in transmission ofpain and temperature sensation. The ventral spino- thalamic tract carries information related to touch andrm pressure. Other projection neurons contribute to the pain expe- rience via contacting the cingulate and insular cortices via connections in the parabrachial nucleus and the amygdala. This ascending information accesses theneurons the periaqueductal and rostral ventral medulla (RVM) within the midbrain to contact the descending feedback systems to regulate the outputfrom the spinal cord and modulate pain. 4The funda- mental function of the PAG is to integrate informationobtained from higher centers of the brain (hypothala-mus, amygdala, and frontal lobe) and ascending noci- ceptive inputs from the dorsal horn. This nociceptive information from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord isregulated by the PAG via the projection neurons to the RVM and dorsolateral pontine tegmentum. The RVM is able to both inhibit and facilitate noci- ceptive input. Inhibition is achieved through low- intensity electrical stimulation or low concentrations of stimulatory neurotransmitters. The endogenous opioid and cannabinoid such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepineph- rine, are pathways. Pain ampli cation via the RVM has been implicated in the development of central sensitization and secondary hyperalgesia. 6,7Disordered descending influences from the brainstem on nociceptive affer- ent information may contribute to abnormal painperception in both functional pain disorders and neuropathic pain.8PAIN MANAGEMENT: DIFFERENT MODALITIES AAEP 2022 3673. Neuropathic Pain Neuropathic pain may be described as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of disease affecting the soma- tosensory nervous system. \"9Following nerve injury, changes in the sensory transmission of pain occur. The expression of neurotransmitters, changed pres- ence of neuromodulators, altered receptors, changes in ion channels, and altered structural proteins have been described.9 Following nerve injury, physiological changes can occur. An increase in sodium ion channels at the siteof injury and along the axon results in foci of hypersen- sitivity. Also, the development of a1-noradrenergic receptors in both affected as well as unaffected neurons in the vicinity of damage occurs. This mechanism ena- bles the sympathetic nervous system (via noradrener- gic neurons) to have an excitatory and therefore amplifying effect on pain-transmitting neurons. Following injury, afferent pain neurons may also affect descending analgesic pathways that inhibit pain. The inhibitory neurons themselves become inhibited, accentuating the sensation of pain. The den- sity of both gamma-aminobutyric acid and opioid receptors may be reduced following injury to an affer-ent pain neuron. 10Hypertrophy and activation of glial cells may occur following injury to neurons, and the resulting activation leads the dorsal horn microglia to produce proin of nerves lead to hyperexcitability. Damaged Schwann cells, dorsal horn proin flammatory mediators includ- ing the interleukins and tumor necrosis factor a.T h e s e contribute to regional activation of sensory bers.12 Neuropathic pain may be induced by degenerative lumbosacral lesions, injuries, Visceral Pain Visceral pain is often poorly localized in contrast to so- matic pain (pain related to skin, tissue, or muscles). Visceral pain is associated with mechanical stimulisuch as stretching of the mesentery or visceral capsu- les, ischemia (with resulting hypoxia and regional lac- tic acid formation), or chemical or thermal stimulus. In contrast to somatic pain, visceral pain displays no distinction between A dand C bers.13Visceral pain is also coupled with tonic increases in somaticmuscle tone. Strong autonomic responses are gener- ated including changes in heart rate and blood pressure. 14Within the spinal cord, the dorsal col- umns tract in trans-mitting nociceptive signals from viscera. 155. Summary Pain is complex in generation, transduction, percep- tion, and response. Animals vary in actions when suf-fering pain, this being a factor of individual toleranceand whether the pain is acute and unexpected orchronic with some degree of accommodation for therepeated stimulus. Multiple levels and components ofthe neurological system are involved in the physiologyof pain, these being subject to the effects of other bodysystems and events.

The science of pain management continues to evolve with the development of insight into the physiology ofpain. Opioids have been available since the early 1800s,and most of the current medications used in this classare opiates or derivatives of opium. Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs were introduced to the market in 1 8 9 7b yF e l i xH o f f m a ni nt h ef o r mo fa s p i r i n , aand phenylbutazonebwas introduced in the 1950s. Gabapentincwas approved for use in 1993, and tramadold(an analog of codeinee)w a ss y n t h e s i z e d in 1962. 1. Opioids An opioid is any compound that works at opioid recep- tors. are naturally codeine are examples). Morphine is the classic opioid, structured as a benzenering with a phenolic hydroxyl group at position 3 andan alcohol hydroxyl group at position 6. Changes in this structure can result in ethers and esters (exam- ples are codeine and heroin g), and these changes result in differences in analgesic potency or antagonisticproperties. There are three varieties of opioid receptorsin the body: mu, kappa, and delta. The receptor typedetermines the physiologic response when an opioid isbound. chomimetic and dysphoric effects are speci c responses to the binding of different receptors. Thedensity of receptors in different locations in the brain and body varies between species. 1 Opioids produce their effect by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and body after administration. Binding activates the receptor, releas- ing a G (guanine nucleotide) protein in the cell mem- brane. This protein diffuses with the membrane untilit reaches its target, an enzyme or ion channel. Whenactivated by an opioid, the receptors on presynapticterminals of C and A delta sensory nerve bers indi- rectly inhibit voltage-dependent calcium channels.This process blocks the release of pain neurotrans-mitters such as glutamate, substance P, and calcitoningene-related peptide analgesia. Opioids and opioids activate presynaptic receptors on the 's gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons. The inhibition of GABA results in the release of dopamine, which produces intensepleasure in humans. 2 Pure mu agonists (morphine, methadone,hand fen- tanyli) are used commonly equine practice setting. Butorphanoljis an agonist (kappa)/antagonist (mu) analgesic used commonly in ambulatory and refer- ral practice. Intravenous administration of opioids in horses results in analgesia and excitation. Combining morphine, methadone, or butorphanol with an 68 / 2022 369PAIN MANAGEMENT: DIFFERENT MODALITIESadrenergic agonist is recommended to avoid some nega- tive effects. The duration of analgesia is dependent on the route of administration. Tramadol is not a standard opioid, although it is an analog of codeine. This medication has partial mu re- ceptor activity, works centrally on GABA receptors, and has activity involving control of catecholamines and serotonin. Intravenous dosing has produced undergoing castration.3 2. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Tissue trauma results in the release of cell membrane phospholipids. These phospholipids are converted into arachidonic acid that travels through one of two path- ways: the lipoxygenase pathway or the cyclooxygen- ase pathway. The lipoxygenase pathway produces leukotrienes; the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway produces in or dins (COX-1 or COX-2 enzymes catalyze the change).COX-1 is present in most normal tissues and maintains homeostasis: maintenance of gastric mucosa, platelet aggregation, and renal blood flow. COX-2 is inducible and synthesized in the face of in flammation or carcino- genesis. The resulting prostaglandins mediate in flam- mation, pain, fever, headache, vascular permeability,miosis, and the disruption of the blood-aqueous barrier. arachidonic acid inflammatory drugs interrupt COX-1 and -2 enzymes; medication formulations have variation in selectivityfor one over the other. 3. Pregabalin and Gabapentin Pregabalinkand gabapentin (1-[aminomethyl]cyclo- hexane acetic acid) are anti-epileptic agents that are structurally similar to GABA, but neither has activ- ity in the GABA neuronal system. Both medications have potent anticonvulsive effects and are recognized as having potential for treatment of neuropathic con- ditions in humans. Although their mechanism of action is not completely understood, activity at volt- age-activated calcium channels of the postsynaptic dorsal horn of the spinal cord interrupts the process that leads to the experience of a neuropathic pain sensation. These medications differ in their speed of absorption through the intestinal tract and their bioavailability. Gabapentin has limited research to show ef cacy as a stand-alone analgesic in horses.4 Pregabalin has been shown to produce plasma con-centrations in horses within the therapeutic rangefor humans when dosed intragastrically every 8 hours at 4 mg/kg. There is no research discussing effectiveness as an analgesic in horses.5 4. Conclusion Like people, every animal responds differently to an- algesic administration. A common mistake made by practitioners is giving up on a medication because they had a negative or lack of effect in a patient. Inaddition, there are several options in some classes ofmedications; if one option is not producing a positive effect, it is worth trying another version within the same drug class.

Introduction Options are limited when considering conventional medications available for a practitioner dealing with a painful performance horse. The governing organiza- tion or federation of a competitive discipline dictateswhat medications are allowed or what blood levels are legal if the horse intends to continue competing. The benet of these medication limitations is protecting horses from injuries masked by analgesic drugs orprocedures. The deleterious effects are the prohibition of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approv- ed drugs commonly used for sport-related discomfortand injuries. Nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are banned from international competition, but homeopathic medications or herbal formulas that are not FDA approved are allowed. This aspect of vet- erinary medicine can be controversial regarding ethics and acting in the best interest of the patients.Too of- ten, client demands to continue competing with a horse because of potential money to be won, money to be made in sales, or clients 'expectations result in inappropriate use of medications and poor decision-making for the owner 's sake. It is important to under- stand the available medications and doses allowed bytwo of the largest competition governing organizati-ons (United States Equestrian Federation [USEF] and Federation Equestre Internationale [FEI]).Un- fortunately, science has not always been a paramount consideration in the formulation of dictated regula- tions regarding medications and therapies. The rst step in dealing with pain is recognizing it as such.Often, horses present for examination due to poorperformance that has been considered a behavioral problem. When the horse suddenly becomes \"girthy, \" starts bucking, or refuses to jump, the rst step for many is to give calming medications or methocarba-mol. When those options do not alter the behavior, thehorse is usually treated for ulcers or is examined witha gastroscope to ascertain the presence of glandularor nonglandular gastric ulceration. If that does notprovide the answer, lameness or discomfort (orthope-dic, visceral) is considered. Some owners will buy anew saddle before having their horse examined by aveterinarian. Most often, these behavioral changes are due to discomfort. 2. Selecting Medications and Treatments Pain management should start with a thorough physi- cal exam, palpation of muscles and limbs, and evalua-tion of movement in hand and under saddle ifappropriate. Understanding the patient at that pointallows you to make a therapeutic plan. Nonsteroidalanti-in flammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be con- sidered rst when seeking a medication option. Phenylbutazone a,flunixin meglumineb,a n d rocoxibc are the most commonly used. Unfortunately, somehorses have sensitivities to this class of drug, or thecompetition governing body has regulations that pre-vent their use. Butorphanol dis the only opioid com- monly used in sports medicine practice and shouldonly be considered when dealing with gastric emer-g e n c i e so ra sa na d j u n c tt os e d a t i o n .A l t e r n a t i v emedication options include gabapentin e, detomidinef, NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 371PAIN MANAGEMENT: DIFFERENT MODALITIESSaraping,T r a u m e e lh,Z e e li, and Arnicaj.A c t i v e l yc o m - peting horses are limited in medication options or de- pendent on timing due to required withdrawal times and potential for positive blood tests. Therapeuticoptions like acupuncture, massage, and chiropracticmanipulation are useful for maintaining performanceand treating pain in horses. Additional options includephysiotherapy, magnet therapy, laser therapy, electri-cal stimulation, and ultrasound.Unfortunately, thereis a de ciency in research to back many of these modalities. The existing research is often limited toevaluating a single modality with results that are dif - cult to interpret. Shockwave is a useful tool for manyperformance-related injuries and conditions, but theUSEF has regulations that limit use at least 12 hoursprior to competition (if treating the back and sacroiliacarea) and 3 days prior for any treatment involving thelimbs. FEI regulations restrict the use of shockwavewithin 5 days of competition for any part of the body.Gabapentin should be considered in unusual cases with a neuropathic pain component. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, ac-tivity at voltage-activated calcium channels can mini-mize hyperexcitability in nerves responsible forburning and shooting pain. Research, however, hasnot shown signi cant improvement in lameness scores using this medication. 1From the author 'sp e r s o n a l experience, the medication is useful as an adjunct incases involving a neuropathic component. Recom-mended dosing can range between 2.5 and 40 mg/kgorally twice a day. Withdrawal time from the competi-tion is a minimum of 14 days after using this medica-tion. If horses are also receiving other medications, theauthor suggests adding an additional 7 days beforereturning to competition. Sarapin is an extract fromthe pitcher plant, Sarraceniaceae, useful for neuro-pathic pain. It has anti-in flammatory and nerve-quiet- ing properties. This medication is useful for \"veggie blocks \"for horses that are \"footsore\" from working and walking on different surfaces at shows. These blocksare performed at the location of an abaxial block. Thisis performed using 2.5 mL Sarapin (or Traumeel orZeel) per site, sometimes combined with 0.5 mg dexa-methasone k(if the horse is not currently receiving dexamethasone during competition). Sterile prepara-tion of the injection site with chlorhexidine and alco-hol prior to injection and a light bandage over thearea postinjection can aid in Traumeel, Zeel, andArnica have anti-infl ammatory properties that are particularly valuable for horses sensitive to NSAIDsor actively competing where NSAIDs cannot beused. Traumeel is not legal for USEF-governed com-petition because of the inclusion of Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade). Oddly, it is legal for interna-tional (FEI) competition. FDA standards do not gov-ern homeopathic medications. It is dif cult to know who to trust as a source when purchasing these prod-ucts. Word of mouth or online reviews are importantwhen searching for options. Injectable Traumeel,Zeel, and Arnica are sourced as 2.2-mL or 5-mLindividual dose ampules. Most adult horses can receive 10 mL intravenously once or twice daily as an adjunct or alternative to NSAIDs. There are oral Traumeel tablets (that can be purchased at most human pharmacies), and the dosing is typically 10 tabs orally once or twice a day. Oddly, there is no actual dose label on these medications. 3. Alternative Options Acupuncture originated in China about 5000 years ago, with the fundamental principles dating 3000 years before that. Needles were originally made ofstone and eventually replaced with metal around 110 B.C. The theory involved in acupuncture is that ani- mals have meridians or lines through which qi (pro- nounced \"chee \")o re n e r g yfl ow circulates through, enabling normal physiological function. Disease proc-esses or in flammation alter or stop the flow of qi. Therefore, introducing a needle in points along thesemeridians opens the energy flow and the release of endorphins, serotonin, norepinephrine, or gamma- aminobutyric acid. Acupuncture is not limited to nee- dle placement. There are many techniques used to stimulate points and meridians: massage or acupres- sure along the meridians; the burning of moxa (an herb that burns at high temperature) over points or the application of the burning herb on the ends of needles to warm the needles; hemoacupuncture, orsimply pricking acupuncture points and allowing bleeding; the injection of blood, saline, or B-12 at acu- puncture points for longer stimulation; and the place- ment of implants at points (gold beads or surgical staples). There are multiple peer-reviewed studies published describing acupuncture for equine care. A study in 2005 describes the successful use of electroa-cupuncture for chronic thoracolumbar pain. 2There are many uses for acupuncture, but, like any treat-ment modality, it does not work for every patient. Veterinary chiropractic manipulation started in the early 1900s and was semi-formalized in the late 1980s through accepted training programs. The American Veterinary Chiropractic Association is the primary or- ganization in the United States that oversees training in veterinary chiropractic principles and techniques.This treatment modality must be performed by a li- censed veterinarian or by a licensed human chiroprac- tor under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian (regulations vary in every state). The concept behind chiropractic is the manipulation of joints and soft tis- sues through mobilization, manipulation, and adjust- ment. Massage is the rubbing or kneading of musclesand soft tissues to aid in circulation and relaxation. There are several veterinary massage courses, includ- ing the Chinese version called Tui-na. Massage and physiotherapy are modalities that can be performed by veterinarians and paraprofessionals (technicians, assistants, and therapists) and are not limited to li- censed veterinarians (although again, in some states,this modality can only be performed under the super- vision of a licensed veterinarian). Physiotherapy isPAIN MANAGEMENT: DIFFERENT MODALITIES 372 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSperformed in collaboration with veterinarians to treat injuries or movement dysfunction and combines tech-niques like mobilization, stretching, massage, and electrotherapy. Often, a treatment plan is developed speci cally for each patient, including exercises to be performed at the farm between treatments. 4. Summary Pain management in the performance horse involvescommunication with the trainer, rider, groom, andhorse owner. Decision-making must be based onwhat is best for the horse, not the humans, whilekeeping in mind regulations in place by competitiongoverning bodies. There is not a single treatment mo-dality that is perfect and that will work for everypatient. Therefore, combining physical therapieswith appropriately dosed medications, supplements,or diet changes produces the best outcome.

Introduction Analysis of historical breeding records can be an im- portant source of information about a stallion 'sp a s t fertility and reproductive ef ciency. Additionally, in- formation gleaned from breeding records facilitatesformulation of targeted recommendations for the stal-lion 's future breeding management. In the absence of commercial software, the only way to pull informationout of historical records is to analyze the informationby hand. For stallions with larger books, the processis time-consuming, but not dif cult, and generally the information gained is well worth the effort. This pre-sentation will explain one method for manual reviewof stallion breeding records and will describe how touse the resulting information to formulate recommen- dations for future breeding management targeted at improving future reproductive ef ciency. 2. Materials and Methods The goal was to calculate the following end-of-yearvalues: seasonal pregnancy rate (SPR; number mares pregnant/number of estrous cycles bred) and, alternatively,cycles per pregnant (CPP), which is the inverse ofPCPR (number of estrous cycles bred/number ofmares pregnant); rst cycle pregnancy rate (FCPR; number of mares pregnant on rst cycle bred/number of mares pregnant); pregnancy loss rate (number ofmares diagnosed pregnant that failed to produce a live foal/number of mares diagnosed pregnant); and breedings per cycle (number of breedings/number of estrous cycles). SPR is an important indicator of a stallion 's fertility but alone may not re flect reproductive ef ciency. For example, assuming that management is similar, and that mares are of similar fertility, a stallion that achieves an SPR of 80% with an average PCPR of80% would be considered more fertile than a stallionthat achieves an SPR of 80% with an average PCPRof 50%. The second stallion is achieving the high SPRby breeding mares over multiple cycles, while the rst stallion is achieving the same SPR in a much more ef- cient manner. In this regard, PCPR (CPP) and FCPR are considered more sensitive indicators of reproductive ef ciency and are important to include when performing a detailed retrospective analysis. 1 With a bit of additional work, it is also possible to calculate (1) breeding success based on number of cov-ers (breedings) per day, (2) breeding success based on number of days of sexual rest prior to breeding, (3) breeding success based on order of breeding (forThoroughbred [TB] stallions breeding by naturalcover), and (4) breeding success by month. 2These val- ues are important when making recommendations onwhether decreasing or increasing book size is likely to be helpful or detrimental to future fertility and for identifying unique events that might have caused atransient decrease in fertility. NOTES 374 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY - STALLIONThe most important \"material \"required to analyze breeding records is a detailed breeding history for at least the previous breeding season and ideally forseveral past breeding seasons. These data are usu- ally supplied by the stallion 's farm and should include the name of each mare bred, the date(s) that each mare was bred, and whether that breeding resulted in pregnancy or not. Ideally, one should also attempt to determine whether each mare produced alive foal from a successful breeding. In the case of TBstallions breeding by natural cover, it is also helpful to obtain information on the order that mares were bred on a given day. Larger commercial farms oftenhave access to computerized software that can easilyprint out all or most of these data. Table 1 is a c- tional, one-page example of how the raw informationis typically provided. When these data are obtainedfor the entire breeding season, one can readily calcu- late SPR, PCPR (CPP), and FCPR. If live foal num- bers are also provided, then pregnancy loss rate isalso easy to calculate. Some commercial softwareprograms provide these data automatically. Using the above data as a limited example, it can be readily seen that, over this part of the breeding season, 15mares were bred with 13 pregnant. SPR (for the lim-ited season shown in this example) = 13/15 = 87%. By reviewing the dates that each mare was bred, o n ec a nd e t e r m i n et h a t4m a r e s( S u p e r F a s t ,A n g e l , Longwood, and Bridget) were bred multiple timesover single estrous cycles (denoted by the red bars),a n d5m a r e sw e r eb r e do v e rm u l t i p l ee s t r o u sc y c l e s(Angel, Fancy, InAPinch, Longwood, and Bridget).From this, it can be seen that 13 pregnancies resultedfrom 20 cycles. PCPR = 13/20 = 65% (alternatively, CPP = 20/13 = 1.54). Average breedings per cycle can also be calculated. While this number is not a re flection of a stallion 's fertility, it is a valuable indicator of the efciency of mare management. In the above example, 26 breedings occurred over 20 estrous cycles = 26/20 = 1.3. Some suggested values for these indices arelisted in Table 2. Certainly, these are important numbers, but with some additional effort, more detailed informa-tion can be extracted. The printouts provided bymost farms are typically not in a format fromw h i c hi ti se a s yt oe x t r a c ti n f o r m a t i o no nn u m b e r of mares bred per day and number of days of sexual rest prior to each breeding. However, these datacan be manually reformatted to allow for easier evaluation. To do this, print out a blank calendar that covers the months when the stallion wasactively breeding, with each month illustrated onan individual page. Then, using the farm-provided records, enter each mare 'sn a m eo nt h ed a t e ( s )t h a t the mare was bred, followed by an \"O\"if that breed- ing resulted in an open diagnosis or a \"P\"if that breeding resulted in a diagnosis of pregnancy. The\"O\"or\"P\"should only be entered for the last breed- ing of a given cycle. For TB stallions breeding by natural cover, enter the order in which each mare Table 1.

Fig 1 shows a sample of the March breedinglog for the data shown in Table 1. From these manually entered data, it is possible to calculate breeding success based on number ofcovers (breedings) per day, breeding success based on number of days of sexual rest prior to breeding, and breeding success by month. In this simpleexample, the pregnancy rate when one mare isbred per day is 50% (Angel open following March 1breeding, pregnant following March 21 breeding);the pregnancy rate when 2 mares are bred per dayis 100% (Cutie and Fancy on March 6, InAPinch and Esmerelda on March 8). April 'sb r e e d i n go n March 19 is not counted in this calculation since it was the rst of two breedings that occurred on the same estrous cycle. Breeding success based onnumber of days of sexual rest prior to breeding canalso be calculated, although it is of little value in this example since so few mares were bred in March. This value becomes much more meaningfulfor stallions with larger books. When a suf cient number of mares are bred, this manual analysistakes quite a bit of time but results in highly rele-vant information about the stallion 's past perform- ance, allowing for more targeted recommendations for future breeding management. 3. Results The following examples illustrate how the data can be applied to interpret a stallion 's past breeding perform- ance and to formulate targeted recommendations for improving future reproductive ef ciency. Example Stallion 1 Therst example is a 5-year-old TB stallion that stood rst year at stud. The managing farm had the impression that the horse was not as fertile as otherson the farm but ended the season well. The syndicateis now asking if book can be further increased nextyear.Interpretation \u0081SPR good, PCPR low (CPP high), FCPR low, pregnancy loss normal, breedings per cycle a lit- tle high. \u0081Number of covers per day (up to 4) does notappear to affect PCPR. \u0081Number of days of sexual rest prior to breeding (0 or 1) does not appear to affect PCPR. Too few mares in the 2 days and > 2 days categories to interpret. \u0081PCPR did not change throughout the breedingseason (February -June). Too few mares in July to interpret. Conclusions Adding more mares would not be expected to further reduce reproductive performance since this stallion' s PCPR does not change with days of sexual rest or based on the number of mares bred/day. However, ift h ed e c i s i o ni sm a d et oi n c r e a s eb o o ks i z e ,a s s u m ea naverage of 2 cycles per pregnancy per mare.

He has good testicular size. Interpretation SPR is good but was achieved despite marginal repro- ductive ef ciency. Interpretation Reproductive ef ciency (fertility) is better when 2 to 3 mares are bred per day versus 1 mare per day. Interpretation Reproductive ef ciency (fertility) is better when the stallion has 0 or 1 day of sexual rest. Longer periods of sexual rest are associated with a decrease infertility. Interpretation Reproductive ef ciency (fertility) appreciably improved in April, May, and June versus February and March. This improvement occurred immediatelyfollowing resolution of right hind limb lameness af- ter hospitalization. Improvement is also coincident with increase in covers per day and covers per week and a decrease in number of days off betweenbreedings. Conclusions Sperm accumulation could be a factor for this stal- lion as the horse appears to be more reproductively efcient when more mares are bred and with fewer days of sexual rest. Alternatively, or in addition,reproductive ef ciency improved following resolu- tion of hind Was stallion ejaculat-ing consistently while lameness was present? Recommendations Semen evaluation during the off season while at sex- ual rest and after appropriate \"clean out \"collections to determine if sperm accumulation is a factor. Collect dismount sample after all natural covers to con rm that ejaculation is occurring. 4. Discussion Analysis of breeding records is an often-overlooked component of fertility evaluation that can add sig- nicant data to a case investigation. Numerical data, as shown in the examples above, often go along way to help stallion owners and managersunderstand why certain recommendations aremade and, in many cases, increase compliance withveterinary recommendations. Although the mostmeaningful data are calculated when book size(mare sample size) is larger, even the records ofstallions with smaller books can yield importantinformation.

Introduction Cryopreserving epididymal sperm often represent the last opportunity to preserve the breeding potential upon castration or sudden death. Epididymal sperm recovery is performed via RF or SF of sperm into an extender. However, these techniques are not typically applied in combination unless RF results in poor yield. This study aimed to assess the yield and cryo- preservation of epididymal sperm harvested via RF followed by SF. 2. Materials and Methods Epididymides from fteen stallions aging from 2- to 15-years-old were harvested. Each epididymis was subjected to RF with 10 mL of freezing extenderaand then sliced in 1-2 mm pieces, covered with 10 mL ofthe freezing extender. Then the slices were kept at room temperature for 15 min for completion of the SF technique. The recovered sperm after eachtechnique was evaluated separately for volume, con-centration, and total sperm count and then frozen. Inaddition, pre-freezing and post-freezing total motility(TM) and progressive motility (PM) evaluatedwith CASA. bSperm membrane integrity (SMI) and high mitochondrial membrane potential (HMMP)were assessed after freezing with Zombie Greencand Mitotracker Deep-Reddstaining via flow cytometrye.1 Data analyses were carried out via mixed model inR.fSigni cance was set at P <0.05. 3. Results and Discussion The total sperm recovered by RF was 8.3 62.0/C2109 and by SF was 3.0 60.8/C2109. The sperm concentra- tion after RF was 693 686.4/C2106/mL and 417 690 /C2106/mL after SF. The TM, PM, SMI, and HMMP were similar for both techniques before and afterfreezing (P > 0.05).

Introduction Cooled-shipped semen is the primary method used by the horse industry to breed mares. Unfortunately, somestallions have inadequate cooling ability. Therefore,there is a critical need to develop alternative methods toprocess semen from such stallions. This study aimed toassess semen parameters and fertility of cooled-storedstallion semen processed and re-extend in 3 extenders. 2. Materials and Methods Cooled-stored semen of 21 stallions classi ed as good coolers (GCs, n = 8), bad coolers (BCs, n = 6), or subfertile (n = 7) had the supernatant removed by SpermFiltera (SF) or centrifugation (600 /C2g/10 min). The resultingpellets from either method were resuspended in either skim milk- based (SKM),bSKM containing pentoxifyl- line (SKM-P),cor an egg yolk -based (EY)dextender. The control consisted of cooled semen with no further proc-essing. Sperm motility parameters, plasma membraneintegrity (PMI), and mitochondrial membrane potential(HMMP) were assessed in all samples. In addition,semen from 9 stallions with a bad cooling ability (4- 8 ejaculates) was used to breed 66 cycles of 18 mares (con-trol, n = 22; SF-SM-P, n = 16; or SF-EY, n = 28 cycles). 3. Results and Discussion Sperm motility was increased ( P<.05) in all samples with resuspended EY compared with the control, SKM, Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 384 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY - STALLIONand semen centrifuged and resuspended in by SF and in wassimilar EY and SKM-P in BC and subfertile stal- lions. Semen processed by SF had superior PMI thancentrifuged semen ( P<.05). In SF-EY (68%) mares inseminated with the con-trol (14%; P<.05). In conclusion, sperm parameters and fertility of poor cooled-transported semen can beenhanced by removing the supernatant by SF andsperm resuspension with EY or SKM-P.

Introduction Development of the reproductive tract of horses and other mammalian species follows a speci c order of events, beginning with establishment of chromo- somal sex, followed by establishment of gonadal sex, development of the internal genitalia, and nally de- velopment of the external genitalia.1The phrase dis- orders of sexual development (DSD) is currentlyused anatomic sex. with a DSD may present as a normal phenotypic female or male, or the externalgenitalia may be ambiguous, with various degrees ofmasculinization. 3In addition, chromosomal abnor- malities and disorders of sexual development may beassociated with reduced fertility or infertility.3,4 The goals of this review are to provide a brief over- view of normal development of the reproductive tractand describe a clinical approach on how to investigateand diagnose DSDs in horses utilizing a series of clini-cal cases.2. Normal Development of the Reproductive Tract Chromosomal or genetic sex is determined at the timeof fertilization and is dependent on the sex chromosomeconstitution of the spermatozoon (Fig. 1). Establishment of gonadal sex, or differentiation of the bipotential pre- cursor tissue of the fetal genital ridge into either malegonads (testes) or female gonads (ovaries), is initiated bythe presence or absence of the sex-determining region ofthe Y chromosome. 1Testes develop in the presence of a containing a SRY region ( Srygene) activation of male-speci c genes ( S o x 9 ,F g f 9 ,P g d s ,A m h ). In contrast, ovaries de- velop in the absence of an SRY region and associatedgenes. Male and female embryos both have 2 sets of primordial internal reproductive duct systems.1The Wolfa nd u c ti st h ee m b r y o n i cp r e c u r s o rt om a l ei n - ternal genitalia that eventually develops into the epi-didymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. TheM\u00fcllerian duct is the embryonic precursor to femaleinternal genitalia that eventually develops into the NOTES 386 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY - STALLIONoviduct, uterus, cervix, and cranial vagina. Normal development of the internal genitalia follows differen-t i a t i o no ft h eg o n a d s .I nt h em a l e ,t e s t o s t e r o n ep r o -duced by Leydig cells of the testes stimulatesdevelopment of the Wolf an duct, and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone produced by Sertoli cells causesregression of the M\u00fcllerian duct system. In the female, in the absence of testosterone and AMH, the Wolfan duct fails to develop, and the M\u00fcllerian duct continues to develop into the normal female reproduc-tive tract. Embryonic tissues in the perineal region are bipoten- tial and can develop into either male or female ana-tomic structures. 1The external genitalia will develop into a female form (i.e., clitoris, vulva, vestibule, andcaudal vagina) unless there is active intervention initi-ated by production of gonadal hormones to direct devel-opment into male structures (i.e., penis and scrotum).Testosterone produced by Leydig cells of the fetal testisis converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by theenzyme 5 a-reductase in peripheral tissues. DHT binds to the androgen receptor (AR) in peripheral tissue andinitiates formation of the penis and scrotum in males.In the absence of testosterone, 5 a- r e d u c t a s e ,D H T ,o ra functional AR, the external genitalia develop into a clit-o r i s ,v u l v a ,v e s t i b u l e ,a n dc a u d a lv a g i n a . 3. Clinical Presentation and Evaluation Horses with a chromosomal abnormality or disorder of sexual development may present for a routine pre- breeding reproductive evaluation, or evaluation ofsmall size or stature, lack of vigor, masculine behavior,failure to show estrus, failure to cycle, reduced fertil-ity, infertility, embryonic loss, or ambiguous externalgenitalia. 5-7Disorders of sexual development may go undetected in a young horse until a reproductive ex-amination is eventually performed. The initial diag-nostic evaluation should include acquisition of acomplete and accurate medical and reproductive his-tory, behavioral assessment (if possible), general physi-cal examination (including an oral examination),examination of the external genitalia, and transrectalpalpation and ultrasound examination (Table 1). 8 Additional diagnostic procedures that may be indicatedbased on the results of the initial evaluation include vaginal speculum examination, endocrine analysis, ex- ploratory laparoscopy, and other tests. Ultimately, adenitive diagnosis is made by chromosomal analysis (karyotype), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysiso ft h ep r e s e n c eo ra b s e n c eo ft h eSry gene, and histo- pathological evaluation of gonadal tissue. 4. Chromosomal Issues and Disorders of Sexual Development in Horses The normal karyotype of the mare and stallion is 64,XX and 64,XY, respectively. Estimates of the prevalence of sex chromosome disorders in the general population ofhorses range from 1.5% to 5.5%.9-11Parada and co- workers12reported a cytogenetic survey of 244 problem mares in which 4% of all mares and 12.8% of sterilemares had chromosome aberrations. A cytogeneticanalysis of 766 horses with congenital abnormalities, Fig. 1. Development of the reproductive tract (adapted from Meyers-Wallen VN. J Reprod Fert 1993;47:441 -452).THERIOGENOLOGY / Vol. 68 / 2022 387disorders of sexual development and/or reproductive problems noted that 28% of problem horses had karyo- type abnormalities.5The most common chromosomal abnormality in horses is 63,X monosomy and its mosaic most frequent abnormalities have also been reported in horses.5,6 Laboratories in the United States that perform kar- yotyping of equine samples are listed below. \u0081Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, 664 Raymond Stotzer Pkwy, VICI University, College Station, TX 77843-4458 https://vetmed.tamu.edu/molecular-cytogenetics \u0081Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, Old Davis Road, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Calif- ornia -Davis, Davis, CA 95616 https://vgl.ucdavis.edu 5. Clinical Cases \u2014Disorders of Sexual Development Assessment of clinical cases of DSD in horses pro- vides an opportunity to highlight a pathway to aclinical diagnosis. The diagnostic strategy should begin by acquisition of a thorough medical and repro- ductive history, followed by a general physical exami- nation and a reproductive evaluation. A list of differential diagnoses can then be formulated. Subsequently, additional diagnostic tests are per- formed to rule in or out speci c conditions and ulti- mately lead to a nal diagnosis. Case 1. 63,X Monosomy A 5-year-old Quarter Horse mare was evaluated in early March as a potential breeding candidate. The m a r eh a db e e no w n e db yt h es a m ep e r s o ns i n c eb i r t h and had never been bred. Physical examination revealed that the mare was small to medium in size and was in good body condition. The perineum was normal for a mare, with no abnormalities noted. Transrectal palpation revealed a small oval structure adjacent to the tip of each uterine horn and the uterus was noted to be small and flaccid. Ultrasound exami- nation con rmed that the ovaries were small ( ;1.5 cm in diameter) and each contained several small follicles. A vaginal speculum examination revealed a normal vaginal vault and a normal external cervical os. The cervix was closed, pale, dry, and located low on the cra- nial vaginal wall. A hymen was present at the vestibu- lar-vaginal junction and was disrupted during initialTable 1.

Hormone analysis indicated that of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone(AMH), inhibin, progesterone, and estrone sulfatewere all low, whereas testosterone concentration wasslightly above the normal range for mares (Table 2). Differential diagnoses included a young prepuber- tal mare, an older mare with ovarian senescence, amare in winter anestrus, exogenous hormone (i.e., pars intermedia dysfunction, and a chromosomal abnor-mality. In this case, the mare was a young adult andhad never been administered any type of exogenoushormones. The relatively young age suggested thatpituitary pars intermedia dysfunction was unlikely, as the condition is usually associated with older mares. However, the initial examination was per-formed in early March, a time when seasonal anes-trus could result in small inactive ovaries.Consequently, it was recommended that the mare bere-examined during the physiologic breeding season.A recheck in mid-April revealed that the ovaries were still small and inactive. A blood sample was subsequently collected and submitted for karyotypeanalysis. Chromosomal analysis con rmed a diagno- sis of 63,X monosomy (Fig. 2). The mare was subse-quently retired as a potential broodmare. Clinical Comments 63,X monosomy and its mosaic forms (63,X/64,XX and 63,X/64,XY, etc.) are the most common chromosomalabnormality of mares. 3,5-7,14,15Approximately 31% to 51% mares with or go- nadal dysgenesis have a 63,X karyotype.5,7,13Affected mares may be small in stature, with small hypoplasticovaries, often with minimal follicular activity, a smallflaccid uterus and a normal vagina, vulva, and clitoris. A majority of 63,X mares are infertile, but 63,X mosaic mares have been reported to produce foals. 16 Case 2. 64,XY SRY-Negative DSD A 7-year-old Quarter Horse mare was referred in May for a reproductive evaluation. The owner indicated that they had never seen the mare in heat. Physical ex- amination revealed that the mare was in good bodycondition, the vulva and clitoris were normal, and a small mammary gland, consistent with that of a maiden mare, was noted. Transrectal ultrasound ex-amination revealed very small gonads (1.5 cm in length), devoid of any visible follicles, adjacent to the tip of each uterine horn. A speculum examinationrevealed a normal vaginal vault and a normal external cervical os. Hysteroscopy showed a normal uterine l u m e nw i t hu t e r o t u b u l a rj u n c t i o n sv i s i b l ea tt h et i po feach uterine horn. Hormone analysis revealed low con- centrations of all ovarian hormones (Table 3). A chromosomal abnormality was considered the most likely cause of the inactive ovaries and failure to exhibit heat, since the mare was 7 years old, had never received hormone therapy, and the examination Fig. 2.

A blood sample sub- mitted for chromosomal analysis revealed a 64,XYkaryotype and a PCR test con rmed the absence of the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome(SRY) (Fig. 3). The gonads were removed by laparo-scopic surgery and histologic analysis indicated that the gonads were devoid of any normal ovarian or tes- ticular structures. Clinical Comment Horses with 64,XY SRY-negative DSD have female external genitalia, a vagina, flaccid uterus, along with small, dysgenic gonads. 6The condition is caused by deletion of the SRY region of the Y chromosome. Absence of the SRY regionresults in failure of the undifferentiated fetal gonadto develop into testes, and in the absence of testicularhormones (testosterone and AMH), the internal genita- lia and external genitalia develop into typical female structures. The phenotype resembles that of 63,Xmonosomy and the Monorchid mare was for stal- lion-like behavior and an elevated serum testosterone level. Differential diagnoses included a granulosa- theca cell tumor, pregnancy, disorder of sexual devel- opment, estrus, and anabolic steroid administration.Oral examination revealed erupting canines, the sizeof which were consistent with that of a mare. Externalgenitalia consisted of a normal vulva and clitoris. A mammary gland with 2 small bilaterally symmetric teats was noted. Transrectal ultrasound revealed astructure in the right abdomen consistent with themorphologic appearance of a testicle. No gonadalstructure was identi ed on the left side. A vaginal speculum examination revealed a short, \"blind-ended\" vaginal vault, with no cervix. Hormone analysisrevealed that anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, testosterone,and estrone sulfate concentrations were above theupper limit of the laboratory reference ranges for a nonpregnant mare (Table 4). Cytogenetic analysis of a blood sample revealed a 64,XY karyotype, and PCRassay con rmed presence of the PCR analysis on a 64,XY SRY-negative DSD phenotypic mare.

The pathophysiology is hypothesized to be a mutation of the androgen receptor gene. 6An alternative cause may be inadequate conver- sion of testosterone to DHT by the enzyme 5 a- reductase. In the clinical case, only 1 testis was detected in the abdomen and monorchidism was con rmed by the decrease in testosterone and AMH concentrations andthe elimination of male behavior following surgical re- moval of the single gonad. The presence of ectopic ad- renal cortical tissue within the testis was unexpectedbut has been reported previously in testes and ovariesof horses and other species. 18 Case 4. 64,XX SRY-Negative DSD A Friesian-cross phenotypic male horse was referredfor a reproductive evaluation. The horse was pur-chased as a gelding, but the medical and surgicalhistory were unknown. Genotyping for parentage test- ing indicated that the horse had 2 X chromosomes (64,XX). Oral examination revealed a pair of largemale-type canines. The sheath appeared slightlyedematous, and the opening was oriented somewhatventrally and appeared to be folded in on itself.Prominent teats were noted on the lateral aspects oft h es h e a t h( F i g .5 ) .T h e r ew a sn oe v i d e n c eo fas c r o - tum, no evidence of testes, and no visual or palpable evidence of a surgical castration scar. The penis wasgently extended from the sheath and appeared smallerthan expected, but had a glans penis, urethral process,and urethral fossa. The perineum had a tissue running ventrally from the anus alongthe midline toward the sheath. Transrectal palpationand ultrasound examination failed to detect any evi- dence of gonads or other reproductive structures. Serum concentration of testosterone (11.1 pg/mL) waswithin the normal range of a gelding (< 50 pg/mL) and AMH concentration was below the limit of detection ofthe assay (< 0.1 ng/mL). Chromosomal analysis of a blood sample con rmed that the horse had a karyo- type of 64,XX, and a PCR test for the Y-linked Sry gene was negative, consistent with the absence of a Ychromosome. Clinical Comment A 64,XX SRY-negative karyotype in horses with an enlarged clitoris, ambiguous genitalia, male-like behavior, or a relatively normal male phenotype hasbeen reported previously, 5,19,20but is the least com- mon of the 4 DSD conditions described in this report.The molecular cause(s) for the condition are unknown. 6. Summary An understanding of the anatomic and endocrine events associated with normal development of the male and female reproductive tract is key to understanding thepathogenesis of disorders of sexual development. Theexternal genitalia of horses with a DSD may appear asfemale, male, or may be ambiguous. Behavior exhibitedby affected horses ranges from anestrus to stallion-likeand is dependent on the predominant steroid hormone(if any) produced by the gonads. The de nitive diagno- sis of a DSD is a chromosome analysis and determina-tion of the presence or absence of the Srygene. The number of clinical cases of DSD in horses is likelyunderestimated and many cases remain undetectedunless abnormal behavior, ambiguous genitalia, orother issues are present. Mares with a history of subfer-tility, infertility, or repeated embryonic loss may have achromosomal abnormality and warrant further investi-gation. 21-23A few chromosomal abnormalities, such as balanced translocations, can be hereditary and passedfrom a carrier to their offspring, while other abnor-malities may result in early embryonic loss andsubfertility. 5,24 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Authors 'addresses: Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital, PO Box 12070, Lexington, KY 40580-2070 (Schnobrich); Gluck Research Center, 1400 and presenting author. Introduction The initial invasive aspects of equine placentation at approximately 30 days of gestation include the formation of endometrial cups that secrete equine chorionic gonad-otropin (eCG). This accessory corpora lutea and pro-longed suppression of estrus. Hence, pregnancy loss afterthe development of endometrial cups often leads to theinability to breed mares back for the remainder of thebreeding season. To date, no treatment has been foundeffective in the early reduction/elimination of endome-trial cups following pregnancy loss. Endometrial cupsare naturally degraded by effector lymphocytes between100 and 150 of gestation. Immunomodulators suchas mycobacterium cell wall fraction (MCWF) have beenshown to increase the expression of speci c cytokines essential in stimulating the production of these effectorlymphocytes, but it is unknown if this stimulation willhasten the degradation of endometrial cups.2. Materials and Methods Pregnancy was established in 9 mares ( n= 9) before prostaglandin F2 a-induced abortion was performed at 45 days of gestation. Ten days after abortion, hystero-scopic-guided injection of either treatment (n =5 ; 0.3 mg/mL MCWF) or placebo ( n= 4; lactated Ringer 's solution) occurred, with mares randomly assigned intogroups. Treatment consisted of total 20-mL volume ofintraendometrial injection (1 mL/endometrial cup, withany excess volume being injected peripherally into theendometrial stroma surrounding the cups). Blood wasobtained prior to hysteroscopy, in addition to weeklypost-treatment to measure eCG as a marker of endo-metrial cup viability, and this continued for 8 weeks. 3. Results and Discussion Hysteroscopic-guided injection of the immunomodu-lator MCWF led to a signi cant reduction of eCG Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 394 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY -STALLIONconcentration in comparison to placebo-treated mares.

Introduction Veterinarians counsel clients that arthritis, \"degenera- tive joint disease, \"is a degenerative condition by de ni- tion. One of the main goals in treatment, along with alleviating pain (symptom modi cation), is to slow pro- gression of the disease process (disease modi cation). Prevention of arthritis is the ultimate goal, but manystrategies in use are still speculative and supported by anecdotal and/or poorly documented evidence.Inflammation is central in both pain and degenerative pathways. Recognizing predisposing factors as well as signs of in flammation in a joint early, when still in syno- v i t i ss t a g e ,a f f o r d sm a n ym o r et r e a t m e n to p t i o n sa n d the ability to not only enhance current performance butalso extend comfort level into geriatric years. Normal forces on abnormal cartilage and abnormal forces on normal cartilage are both known to lead to degenerativejoint disease. Improving biomechanics is therefore oneof the most fundamental preventive measures, but in- depth discussion of therapeutic farriery, hoof-ground interface, conformation and posture, and rider inter-ference is beyond the scope of this presentation. This session will focus on describing physical manipula- tion techniques and monitoring as well as thepurported mechanisms of action of available oralsupplements to equip veterinarians to have mean- ingful discussions with clients and other professio- nals involved in the equine athletic team. Althoughspecic regulating bodies should be consulted, at the time of writing, the modalities discussed are allowed during competition in most performance horses.2. Physical Manipulation and Physical Therapy Exercises Patient education, exercise, and weight management are the primary preventive management strategies forosteoarthritis in human medicine.1While most of the athletic population of sport horses is not obese, clienteducation on conformation, training practices, realisticobjectives, and goal setting, along with individuallytargeted exercise regimes, are areas where the mostimpact in prevention of osteoarthritis can be made.Frequent, open communication with clients and train-e r sa sw e l la sw i t ht h e r a p i s t sp r o v i d i n gb o d y w o r kmodalities coupled with an understanding of the speci c sports the equine patients are competing in allow the practitioner to recognize subtle changes in performance and effect change earlier. Exercise includes building cardiovascular tness and musculoskeletal strength as well as flexibility and proprioception. 2Cross-training of equine athletes including stretching and mobility exercises along withaerobic conditioning in underwater treadmills ofdifferent water depths may not only improve musclestrength and supportive structures around jointsbut also improve proprioception and therebydecrease the risk of injury. It is widely accepted thatcore strength conditioning in human athletes reducesrisk of injury in addition to enhancing performance. It isintuitive that horses can bene t from similar training of the core stabilizing muscles. Cross-training enables anincrease in athleticism while decreasing the risk ofrepetitive use injuries. 3 NOTES 396 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICESpeci c training strategies for each discipline are beyond the scope of this presentation, but there is evidence that bones, cartilage, and the surrounding soft tissues respond (favorably or unfavorably) to the forces applied to them. Therefore, incorporatingdynamic mobility exercises and core strengthening maneuvers to equine athletes' daily routines can help build supporting musculature and stave off injury, fa-tigue, and misuse of joints. Core strengthening is con- sidered a progression of dynamic mobilization. 4 Studies on the effects of speci c dynamic mobilization exercises have focused on axial and core musculature and have demonstrated not only hypertrophy of the multi dus muscle but also improved symmetry in muscle size.5Gymnastic exercises including backing up, tight turns around barrels, and walking overraised poles performed 3 days per week were shown to signi cantly increase stride and tracking lengths. 6 Ground poles and cavaletti gymnastic exercisesincrease joint flexion.7Joint mobility is substantially increased following heating.8An adequate warm-up period and/or application of heat in the form of wrapsand blankets prior to stretching can improve the elas- t i c i t yj o i n tc a p s u l e sa n dt e n d o n sa sw e l la sm u s c l e s .8 Although further research is needed, since symmetri-cal conformation and posture is important in the even application of forces across joint spaces, it is reasona-ble to assume that a routine of dynamic mobilization and gymnastic exercises could help prevent or miti- gate degenerative joint disease in the distal limb by improving posture and motion. Often the terminology used in integrative treat- ment modalities to describe disturbances is confusing and leads to misunderstandings between different types of practitioners. Chiropractors speak of \"luxa- tions \"that seem anatomically impossible, and acu- puncturists describe energy blockages that may not be detected in Western examinations. In physiother-apy or physical therapy, a \"functional diagnosis \"results from a static and dynamic functional assessment rather than a pathoanatomic diagnosis veterinarians are trained to provide. 9Acupuncture, myofascial release, spinal manipulation, joint mobilization, and otherbodywork have been purported to improve joint and overall health. There are no studies speci cally support- ing their effectiveness in preventing distal limb osteoar-thritis in horses, but some reviews have shown improvement in human chronic knee pain followingacupuncture. 10These modalities are thought to be most effective in early recognition of abnormalities. Forexample, a traditional Chinese veterinary medicine diagnosis may be made prior to any clinical signs of osteoarthritis being present from a Western veteri- nary medicine perspective. However, this is dif cult to investigate in blinded controlled studies, so objec- tive data is lacking. Acupuncture often takes several sessions to achieve effect, which gives the practitioner the additional bene t of repeated intense observation. This allows practitioners to recognize and addressareas of weakness rather than waiting for overt injury.Incorporating objective assessments of motion and physical condition into examinations and medical records can help monitor individual cases and recog-nize pathology earlier as well as describe response totreatments more accurately and precisely for discus-sion with other professionals. Meticulous recordingof weight tape and goniometry measurements, videosand stationary photos, performance statistics from com-petition and training, and objective gait analysis equip-ment will help analyze response to treatments and manipulations. Goniometry, the measurement of joint angles, has been validated in horses 11-13and is a simple and inexpensive way to measure and monitor jointrange of motion. Bergh et al. demonstrated good inter-and intraobserver reliability of measurements of therange of motion of the carpus and fetlock in soundhorses. Both universal and digital goniometers wereprecise and repeatable, but ndings suggested \"that the same type of goniometer should be used in subsequent m e a s u r e so ft h es a m eh o r s e \" 12with the type of goniome- ter being recorded in the medical records along with the measurements. Reliable systemic biomarker tests arenot yet currently available to screen for early stages ofjoint in flammation. Some intriguing work has investi- gated urinary excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)in athletic versus sedentary horses and those with evi-dence of osteoarthritis in one or more joints, 14but assays are not commercially available, and completeunderstanding of the relation of urinary GAGs to carti-lage metabolism requires more research. 3. Oral Supplements In a 2018 survey of owners and trainers in Ireland, Murray et al. found that joint supplements were the most used type of oral supplement, and more respond-ents sought advice from feed merchants thanfrom veterinarians. 15Veterinary advice is too often bypassed in the selection of oral joint health supple-ments. Veterinarians need to be prepared to discussrelevant available data, proposed mechanisms ofaction, and possible contraindications with clients. Most oral joint supplements are intended to act through one or both of two mechanisms: as buildingblock substrates is composed of adense extracellular matrix of water, type 2 collagen, and proteoglycans. 16Glucosamine is an amino mono- saccharide that is the main component of GAGs including chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, andheparan sulfate. The negatively charged GAGs inturn bond to protein backbones to form proteoglycans.Aggrecan molecules, produced by chondrocytes, havethe charged bottle brush structure of proteoglycanmolecules (lending cartilage its resistance to compres- sion) bonded to a hyaluronan backbone. Hyaluronan is produced by both chondrocytes and synoviocytes forincorporation into the cartilage extracellular matrixand synovial fluid, respectively. However, it is believed that its demonstrated bene cial effects onIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 397joint health are due not to incorporation of the adminis- tered hyaluronan into cartilage and synovial fluid, but rather to anti-in flammatory effects and possibly induc- tion of synthesis of high molecular weight hyaluronanby synoviocytes.17 The most common oral joint health supplements with some supporting research include glucosamine,chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan),unsaponi methylsolfonylmethane, and various combinations of those ingredients. Moreis known about the oral bioavailability and volume ofdistribution of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfatethan other oral joint supplements. 18,19Most literature has focused on management of mild arthritis, andextrapolations to equine treatment are made fromhuman and canine research. Many of the most recentpublications exploring in vivo clinical ef cacy of nutra- ceuticals use multi-ingredient formulations with vary- ing amounts of substances, so it is dif cult to draw conclusions on speci c dosages and ratios (which may have synergistic or additive effects) and to compare to other studies. Because of the possibly slow-acting nature of oral joint health supplements, it has been recommendedthat human osteoarthritis patients supplement for atleast 3 continuous months before assessing individ-ual effect. 1Extrapolating the same 3-month trial pe- riod for equine patients would be reasonable if clientsare to try them. However, Clayton et al. demonstrated ameasurable improvement in gait symmetry in horseswith degenerative joint disease of the distal tarsal jointsafter only 2 weeks of supplementation 20Many the ingredients included are surmised to act as free-radical scavengers and anti-inflammatories. In general, adverse effects of nutraceutical supple- mentation have not been reported in studies in whichspecic amounts of high-quality ingredients are con- rmed, and bene cial effects are noted in numerous reports. However, quality control and adherence tocurrent good manufacturing practices in commerciallyavailable formulations can be highly variable and runthe risk of contamination with harmful substan-ces. 21,22The 7-step ACCLAIM system devised and presented by Dr. Stacey Oke at the 2008 AAEP con-vention23remains the most reliable and comprehen- sive assessment tool for commercially availableproducts. It is important to enquire about testing forquality assurance (potency and purity of ingredientsand batch-to-batch consistency) as well as how dos- ages are determined and measured. Especially with the risks of inadvertent doping violations in competi-tive horses, contamination of nutraceutical supple-ments could have jurisdictional consequences atbest, 24in addition to health risks depending on the compound. Questions have been raised in humanmedicine about the impact of oral glucosamine andchondroitin sulfate in people with type 2 diabetes. 25However, as of yet, there has been no evidence in horses with insulin dysregulation and equine meta-bolic syndrome (and hopefully less so in upper-level athletes) to dissuade use of these supplements at lev- els indicated for joint health. 4. Systemic Parenteral (IV and IM) Products Parenteral administration of some of the same com- pounds described as oral joint supplements bypasses the effects of digestion and gastrointestinal absorp- tion, potentially increasing bioavailability and effec- tive blood and tissue levels. Incorporation of thesecompounds into articular cartilage and effects on inflammation and cartilage metabolism in vivo still require more research. However, there are two sys-temic parenteral injectable medications that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for equinearthritis. This approval requires demonstration of ef - cacy as well as safety and oversight of Intravenous hyaluronic acid(hyaluronan) and intramuscular polysulfated glycos- aminoglycan are approved for treatment of arthritis in horses, but it should be noted that there are some solu- tions of chondroitin sulfate and pentosan polysulfate that are approved by the FDA as \"medical devices \" for topical wound care and bladder lavage but not for injection for arthritis. Intramuscular polysulfated glycosaminoglycan has a long history of demonstrated safety and perceived effectiveness in equine arthritis prevention. 26-28 Although experimentally the plant-derived pentosanpolysulfate compound was found to have desirable dis- ease-modifying effects in treating arthritis,29it is dif - cult to justify the risk of extra-label use of a device especially for prophylaxis when a similar FDA- approved drug is available. Eighty-six percent of respondents in a recent AAEP survey of practitioners used intramuscular polysulfated being speci cally labeled for prevention. Hyaluronate sodiumbwas used more for acute disease in the updated survey28 but is also used prophylactically by many practi-tioners.27The prophylactic use of intravenous hyalur- onan is supported by a study involving 140 racingQuarter Horses. Treatment with intravenous hyal- uronic acid every 2 weeks for 9 months resulted insignicantly improved racing data compared to intra- venous saline placebo controls. 30 5. Regulations Most of the modalities discussed above are consideredrelatively safe but still may have medical or regula- tory contraindications, especially if examination and diagnosis have not been completed. For any veteri- nary recommendations, a current veterinary-client- patient relationship should be in effect. A gait analy-sis should be performed to ensure that there is no detectable lameness that could be more speci cally diagnosed and treated. In a Journal of the AmericanIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE 398 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSVeterinary Medical Association news update from January 2017, it was reported that the AVMA \"cur- rently offers no guidance about supplements. \"31 This re flects the frustrating paucity of ef cacy data and lack of FDA oversight in the nutraceutical and supplement industries that would at least lend standardization and safety assurances to prod- ucts.31As with any substance administered by any route to horses in competition, the current regula-tions of governing bodies of overseeing competitions must be referenced and adhered to. As manipulative and complementary therapies become more main- stream, state veterinary medical boards are begin- ning to pass more speci c legislation describing what physical therapy modalities may be performedby professional staff and under the prescription of a veterinarian; licensees should reference their rele-vant states for guidance. 6. Conclusion Improved monitoring and record keeping will help vet- erinarians become more effective at objectively evalu- ating response to therapies and assessing prophylactic measures. Education and open discussion with other professionals involved in the equine athlete 'st e a ma r e paramount in recognizing changes in motion, prevent- ing arthritis, and extending the competitive career of equine patients. In most cases, the sooner subtle pa- thology can be recognized, the more successful treat- ment can be. Safety of adjunctive therapies should becarefully contemplated and evaluated even if more research is still needed to demonstrate ef cacy in blinded controlled studies. The ACCLAIM method23 should be employed to assess quality of oral joint health supplements. Physical manipulation and exer-cises should be discussed following physical examina- tion and gait analysis by a veterinarian.

The two most common components of EMS are increasedadiposity and insulin dysregulation (ID). Whileincreased adiposity may be readily identi able on physical exam, ID may exist in the absence of obe- sity or regional adiposity and in older horses may occur concurrent with pituitary pars intermediadysfunction (PPID). Understanding the patho-physiology of EMS is a dynamic and rapidly evolv- ingeld, and consensus recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the syn- drome are frequently re ned. Development of EMS is likely multifactorial, involving the interac-tion between a genetic predisposition and environ- mental and management factors. Without the ability to target one causal factor for disease, pre-vention of metabolic syndrome in the older horseshould focus on early identi cation of individuals at risk of development of endocrinopathic laminitisthrough monitoring of body condition and diagnos-tic testing for ID and PPID.2. Etiology Genetic Risk Increased genetic risk of EMS is implied by overrepre- sentation of certain breeds with the syndrome. Breedswith a higher prevalence of disease include ponybreeds, Arabians, Paso Andalusians, TennesseeWalking Horses, Morgans, miniature horses, and don-keys. 1,2Individual animals with EMS are frequently described as \"easy keepers, \"indicating that they main- tain a high body condition score or have dif culty los- ing weight as compared to the average horse. In bothhuman and veterinary medicine, \"thrifty\" genes have been proposed to describe the enhanced feed ef ciency of certain individuals who readily store energyacquired from food. This ef ciency might provide a survival advantage in times of feed scarcity but hasbeen associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2diabetes in people and EMS in horses. 3,4 Investigation into breed differences in metabolic function has elucidated differences in insulin sensitiv-ity, insulin response, and serum concentrations of lip-ids and glucose between EMS-predisposed breeds andother horses. 5-8Early research into the heritability of EMS in a group of related Welsh and Dartmoor poniesdetermined that a diagnosis of laminitis was consist-ent with a dominant gene or genes with reduced pen-etrance due to epigenetic factors such as age, bodycondition, or feed composition. 9More recently, candidate genetic loci associated with risk for hyperinsuline- NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 401IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICEmia and increased frequency of laminitis in Arabian horses10and with height and metabolic traits in Welsh ponies and Morgans.11,12Future research may lead to g e n e t i ct e s t sf o rar i s ko fE M S ,b u ti ti sl i k e l yt h a to t h e rdevelopmental, environmental, and management fac-tors play a strong role in expression of disease. Environmental and Management Risk Factors Not all horses with a genetic predisposition for EMS develop the syndrome. Additionally, horses with low genetic risk can develop EMS with suf cient environ- mental or management risk exposure, such as a diethigh in nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentra-tions and prolonged obesity. Extrinsic risk factors aremore accessible to control than genetics and thus are amore useful focus for prevention of disease. Increased adiposity in the form of generalized obe- sity or regional adiposity is frequently associated withEMS. As horses with lean body condition can also de-velop ID and laminitis, increased adiposity is not nec-essary for a diagnosis of EMS but is considered astrong risk factor. As horses age, there is a shift in b o d ym a s sc o m p o s i t i o nw i t ha ni n c r e a s ei nf a ta c c u - mulation in adipose tissue and muscle. 13A decrease in basal metabolic rate as part of the normal agingprocess, without a concurrent decrease in appetite,may predispose older horses to excess energy intakeand storage as adipose tissue. Adipose tissue plays anactive role in regulation of adipokines, and in flamma- tory mediators and increased adiposity can lead todysregulation of these systems. Leptin is an adipo-kine produced by adipocytes, and its serum concen-tration increases with increasing body condition inhorses. 14,15Under normal conditions, leptin serves to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditurein the presence of excess energy stores. Leptin resist-ance appears to occur in some horse with EMS,reflected by serum leptin concentrations higher than that expected for their body condition, which mightlead to increased feed intake and further weightgain. 16Adiponectin is another fat-derived hormone that functions to enhance insulin sensitivity. In peo-ple and horses, adiponectin concentrations decreasewith increased body condition and fat mass. 15,17 Insulin dysregulation is a central feature of EMS and a consistent risk factor for development of lamini-tis. ID is de ned as any combination of resting hyperin- sulinemia, a hyperinsulinemic response to intravenousor oral glucose, and tissue insulin resistance. 4Many studies have found that feeding diets high in NSCsresult in decreased insulin sensitivity and adiponectinconcentrations. 18-21The gastrointestinal microbiota has been implicated in the development of metabolic diseaseand obesity in people 22t h r o u g hm o d u l a t i o no fe n e r g y metabolism, gastrointestinal permeability, regulation ofgastrointestinal peptide hormone secretion, and in flam- 23Studies in horses have shown differences in the microbiota of horses with and without EMS or obe-sity. 24-26Recent research has investigated the micro- biome, metabolome, and lipidome of obese horses to seta foundation for developing diagnostic biomarkers andtherapeutics for obesity and EMS in horses. 23 Age has been shown to have an effect on insulin and adiponectin concentrations in horses. Olderhorses are more likely to have higher insulin concen-trations and lower adiponectin concentrations thanyounger horses and ponies, correlating with a higher incidence of EMS and laminitis in older horses. 27-30 3. Diagnosis Early detection of EMS is essential for prevention of uncontrolled disease and laminitis. As understanding of the pathophysiology of EMS is rapidly evolving, rec-ommendations for diagnosis have changed frequently in recent years. Recent consensus recommendations for diagnosis of EMS have been published and welldiscussed elsewhere. 2,4Briefly, basal testing of serum insulin can be useful to identify individuals with restinghyperinsulinemia but is of low sensitivity.2Dynamic testing, measuring glucose and insulin response to anintravenous or oral glucose challenge, can be useful tohelp identify individuals with postprandial hyperinsu-linemia and to evaluate tissue insulin sensitivity. Theoral sugar test is practical for use in the eld setting. Quantitative testing for ID of at-risk individuals is highly recommended. Detection of subclinical ID allows for treatment strategies to be initiated prior to an onsetof laminitis. Regular follow-up testing using the samediagnostics will allow for early detection of ID in previ-ously normal at-risk individuals and/or monitoring response to treatment. In older horses, diagnostic testing for PPID is also recommended, especially in lean individ-uals in which ID is diagnosed. Consensus recommenda-t i o n sf o rd i a g n o s i so fP P I Dh a v eb e e np u b l i s h e d . 31 4. Management Once a horse has been identi ed as at risk of develop- ment of EMS, or has been diagnosed, managementstrategies should be implemented with the goal of pre-venting severe ID and ensuing laminitis. An individ-ual program of dietary management, exercise, andmonitoring should be tailored for each horse andowner. Dietary Management Nutritional strategies for management of EMS should seek to maintain a lean to average body condition score and control ID. As many at-risk or recently diag- nosed horses are obese, weight loss is often a goal of dietary management. Feeds high in NSCs such as ce-real grains and treats including fruits and vegetablesshould be minimized in the diet. A key component inthe success of dietary management of EMS is ownercompliance, and excellent client communication strat- egies are often necessary. Multiple studies have shown that weight loss achieved through energy restriction reduces insulin d y s r e g u l a t i o ni nh o r s e sw i t hE M S . 32-35Consensus rec- ommendations for weight loss include feeding of 1.25%IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE 402 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSto 1.5% of body weight in dry matter intake (DMI) or 1.4% to 1.7% as fed, in the form of good-quality grass hay.4Some obese horses seem to develop weight loss resistance and can be reduced to 1.0% of body weight in DMI or 1.15% body weight as fed if the previous strategy is not successful in achieving weight loss.4,36 Hay quality and nutrient composition can be deceiv- ing without quantitative analysis, and ideally forage analysis should be performed. Forage with NSC con- tent of less than 10% is recommended to reducehyperinsulinemic response to feeding.37Soaking hay has also been shown to reduce the hyperinsulinemicresponse in horses with EMS38,39and doubled weight loss when compared to horses fed the same amount of hay without soaking.40As dry forage can be de cient in protein, vitamins, and minerals and signi cant leaching of minerals can occur with soaking of hay, itis recommended to concurrently feed a low-sugar for- age balancer to provide appropriate nutrition.2,40,41 Pasture access should be limited in the obese patient, especially while achieving weight loss, due to variabil- ity in NSC content in grasses and inability to limitDMI. Grazing muzzles have been shown to reduce DMI by 17% to 23% and may encourage exercise while grazing.42 Weight loss should be monitored closely over time with target losses of 0.5% to 1.25% of the initial bodyweight achieved weekly.43Monitoring weight loss uti- lizing a scale or measuring girth circumference is pre- ferrable to assessing body condition score as internal fat stores frequently are mobilized rst.36 Previously obese geriatric horses may develop dif - culty body mass due to changing metabo- lism, gastrointestinal malabsorption of nutrients, and dental disease. It should not be assumed that IDresolves with a decrease in body condition in geriatric horses as regional adiposity may remain and PPID may be concurrent. High-NSC feeds should continueto be avoided, and dietary energy should be increased in the form of fat, such as vegetable oil, instead of starches. Exercise Routine exercise likely plays a role in prevention ofdevelopment of EMS and/or severe disease due to ID. At-risk breeds often evolved in areas where forage was scarce and walking large distances to source for-age was common. Older horses are often retired from work or competition and may not experience daily exercise in any form. Exercise alone has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in people. 44In horses, data has been con- flicting, likely due to variation in the breeds, body con- dition, and metabolic pro le of the horses used and the duration and intensity of the exercise.32,45- 48 Consensus recommendations for nonlaminitic horsesinclude low- to moderate-intensity exercise for at least30 minutes, 5 or more times per week. 4 Horses with ongoing or previous laminitis pose a challenge in attempts to increase physical activity aslamellar instability can be a life-threatening concern.Consensus recommendations for exercise for horses recovered from laminitis, with stable lamellae, includelow-intensity exercise on a soft surface for at least 30 minutes, 3 or more times per week. 4Careful moni- toring of soundness and hoof stability should be a pri- ority in these cases. Monitoring Dietary modi cation, weight loss strategies, and exercise programs should be adjusted based on quan-titative measures of response to treatment, such as improvement in body condition score, weight as measured by scale or weight tape, and diagnostic testing. Documentation of these parameters by the owner and veterinarian can often help to detectchanges (or lack thereof) when subjective analysis of improvement does not. ID might not resolve with weight loss in all cases, and serial diagnostic testingas compared to a baseline is often helpful in making changes in prevention recommendations. Medications Several pharmacologic aids are used for treatment andprevention of EMS in horses. Medication is not a sub-stitute for weight loss and exercise management and will do little to affect ID if diet is not simultaneouslycontrolled. Levothyroxine sodium has been shown to reduce body weight and improve insulin sensitivity in normaland EMS horses. 49,50Current consensus recommen- dations for treatment with levothyroxine support itsuse in cases where dietary changes with or withoutexercise have been unsuccessful in achieving weight loss. Levothyroxine should be administered at a dose of 0.1mg/kg daily and then gradually tapered off af-ter weight loss has been achieved, or after 4 to 6m o n t h s . 2In humans, long-term administration of levothyroxine is associated with cardiac abnormalities. However, administration of up to 96 mg levothyroxine once a day for 48 weeks has been shown to be well tolerated by horses, with an absence of adverseeffects.49,51 Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors inhibit the reuptake of glucose by renal tubules andthus increase loss of glucose in the urine.

Summary Prevention of EMS in older horses requires an under- standing of the multifactorial etiologic nature of the syn- drome. Prevention should start with identi cation of at- risk individuals based on breed and body conditionscore. Diagnostic testing for ID will help detect subclini- cal animals and is useful to determine response to treat- ment recommendations. Active preventative strategies should be aimed at prevention of severe disease and de- velopment of laminitis and include dietary modi cation, management of body condition, and exercise.

Katie Sheats, DVM, PhD, DACVIM (LA) Author 's address: North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Raleigh, NC 27607; e-mail: mkpeed@ncsu.edu. (EA) is a signi cant health and wel- fare concern for equids, whether they are top perform- ance athletes or backyard pleasure animals. Asthmais an umbrella term for a syndrome of noninfectious,lower airway in flammation that can occur in horses of all breeds and performance disciplines. Mild/moderateEA (mEA), formerly known as in flammatory airway disease, reportedly affects 60% to 100% of some equinepopulations, including young racehorses. 1Severe EA (sEA) or heaves, formerly known as recurrent airway obstruction or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reportedly affects 10% to 20% of adult horses in thenorthern hemisphere.2-4Mild/moderate EA has been associated with impaired gas exchange and decreasedperformance in racehorses,1,5,6and sEA is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes progressive decline in lung function, compromising quality of life andsometimes requiring humane euthanasia. Both mEAand sEA are characterized clinically by recurrent, vari-able cough and impaired performance, with sEAhorses showing signs of increased respiratory efforteven at rest. 2-4These clinical signs are due to bron- choconstriction, mucus hypersecretion, and airwayinflammation as a result of exposure to various envi- ronmental triggers present in stables, hay, and dust,with a subset of cases associated with summer pas-ture exposure. 2-4,7-12In horses with hay/barn dustand pasture-associated sEA, neutrophils are the pre- dominant in flammatory cell in the lower airway based on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology. Bycontrast, BAL cytology from flammatory phenotypes including neutrophilic, mastocytic, eosinophilic, or mixed. 13 Increased in flammatory cells in the lower airways of horses with sEA and mEA are associated with impaired lung function. In racehorses with mEA, the presence of increased airway mast cells or neutrophils has beenshown to negatively impact racing performance.Speci cally, a study by Ivester showed that speed g- ures of Thoroughbred racehorses were reduced by 2.9and 1.4 points for each percent increase in BAL fluid mast cell or neutrophil proportions, respectively. 1 More recently, Stucchi showed a \"signicant relation- ship between the increase in the differential count ofneutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage and the decreasein the mmol/L of lactate \"in Standardbred racehorses. 14While this evidence suggests that these inflammatory cells play a role in decreasing respiratory performance, the cellular mechanisms and immunopa-thology are not completely understood. In horses withsEA, increasing neutrophil percentages on BAL cytol- ogy are highly correlated with asthma severity and decreased lung function. 15This decline in lung function is a signi cant welfare concern as these horses experi- ence decreased quality of life and additional health NOTES 406 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICEconsequences such as pulmonary hypertension16,17and can end up surrendered or euthanized by owners who do not have the ability or nances to manage this chronic disease. Given the signi cant impacts EA has on issues ranging from optimal equine performance to welfare, it is essential that veterinarians and equinehealth researchers work to develop a better under-standing of the underlying mechanisms of disease, aswell as identify improved methods for early recognition,diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. It is well established that in horses with EA, alveo- lar macrophages and airway neutrophils are activated by airborne organic dust in the breathing zone. 2,18,19 What is less well known is that healthy horses also ex-perience signi cant airway neutrophilia in response to organic dust exposure.10,20Organic dust consists of a mixture of many potential antigens, includingparticulate matter, endotoxins or lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycans, noxious Following exposure to organic dust, alveolar macro-phages become activated and release proin flamma- oxygen species.21-25In response to these signals, large num- bers of neutrophils are recruited to proin in human agricul- tural workers.2,26Ongoing research seeks to under- stand why this cycle of in flammation, which happens in both healthy and asthmatic horses, becomes dys- regulated, chronic, and debilitating in horses with sEA. Until more answers are available, strategies of preventive medicine including routine annual exams with comprehensive evaluation of the respiratory system using previously validated scoring systems (discussed below), increased owner education, and mitigation strategies for organic-dust exposure could help improve the lower airway health of allhorses. 2. Diagnosing Equine Asthma Depending on the clinical case presentation and set- ting ( eld vs. research), veterinarians can use a com- bination of history, physical exam, rebreathing exam, EA. These diagnostics have been reviewed recently.13 While cough and poor performance are common his- toryndings for horses with both mEA and sEA, their physical exam ndings will differ. Horses with mEA have no respiratory abnormalities evident on restingexam, whereas horses with sEA in exacerbation or cri- sis will have readily identi able abnormalities at restranging from elevated respiratory rate and increa- sed nostril flare to increased abdominal effort, anal pumping, and abnormalities on thoracic ausculta-tion including crackles and/or and trachealrattle due to increased tracheal mucus. One excep-tion to these typical physical exam ndings for horses with sEA is horses that have achieved sub-clinical status, often referred to as \"remission. \"With optimal environmental management practices thatreduce exposure to organic dust, horses with sEA canachieve near-normal to normal lung function anddramatically reduce or even eliminate neutrophiliclower airway in flammation. 36,39,40A rebreathing ma- neuver is a useful diagnostic tool in horses with ahistory of cough or decreased performance but no re-spiratory abnormalities on resting exam. A small bag(i.e., 4- to 8-gallon trash bag) placed over the horse 's nose and mouth is used to induce hyperventilation.The increased respiratory rate and effort create increased air movement and turbulence in the lower airway, which leads to increased sound and anincreased ability to detect abnormalities such ascrackles or wheezes. The maneuver is commonly per-formed for 90 seconds to 3 minutes. A healthy horseshould easily tolerate the exam, should not cough,and should return to baseline breathing rate andeffort within 5 to 8 breaths once the bag is removed.Some horses with mEA will have wheezes or coughsduring the maneuver or prolonged recovery followingremoval of the bag. 41,42 The Horse Owner Assessed Respiratory Signs Index is a client survey that has been validated and used asa diagnostic aid in multiple studies.43-47It is a stand- ardized questionnaire that has been shown to predictsEA based on the frequency of cough, the presence ofnasal discharge after exercise, the presence of abnor- mal respiration, and an evaluation of the performance of the horse by the owner. A score of 1 means thathorses are without clinical signs of respiratory disease,a score of 2 or 3 indicates mild or moderate signs, anda score of 4 indicates severe signs of respiratory dis-ease, compatible with severe asthma. 43 There are several standardized respiratory score rubrics that have been used for research investigationsof equine asthma including a 21-40or 23-point scoring system,32,48the Improved Detectable Equine Asthma Scoring System (IDEASS) score,31,49the short score,40and a visual analog scale score.40From a research perspective, standardized respiratory scorerubrics provide a readily available and inexpensivemethod to de ne clinical groups and compare one study population to another using a method that generatesquantitative data. From a clinical perspective, potential advantages of using a standardized scoring system are that it promotes a systematic and thorough exam and,if sensitive enough, provides a tool to monitor changesin chronic disease status over time. This is particularlyuseful when trying to obtain objective data to gauge apatient 's response to season, management changes, or therapeutics. To that end, Calzetta et al. conducted apairwise and network meta-analysis in order to identifyIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 407a\"quantitative clinical score suitable to assess the mini- mal important difference (MID), expressed as the mini- mally clinically detectable difference (MCDD). \"Their results showed change in the MCDD in and correspondedto a 30% improvement in clinical condition.31It was recently proposed that the 23-point scoring system,which is currently the most useful for discriminatingmild from severe EA, be a part of a minimum databasefor diagnosis of EA. 13This scoring system is best described in a study by Lavoie et al., which showedthat a score 15/23 identi ed horses with severe obstruction (lung resistance >2.5 cm H2O/L/s) with70% sensitivity and 62% speci city and a score 11/23 identi ed horses with moderate-to-severe obstruction (lung resistance 1.8 -2.5 H2O/L/s) with 82% sensitivity and 70% speci city. Further, the 23- point weighted clinical score was a good predictor ofpulmonary function as measured by lung resist- ance. 32Finally, although a 23-point scoring system may sound intimidating in terms of time, it is quite straightforward in that it addresses common aspectsof a respiratory exam (respiratory rate, nasal dis-charge, abdominal lift, nasal flaring, tracheal sounds, bronchial tones, crackles, wheezes, cough) and assignsan increasing numerical value with increasing abnor-mality/evidence of dysfunction. A limitation of thisscore, however, is that it is unlikely to distinguish nor-mal horses from those with subclinical disease. 13 BAL has been identi ed as the most readily avail- able and sensitive method for diagnosing EA.12While the procedure has been described in detail else-where,50it is worth mentioning here that the diagnos- tic utility of BAL cytology is impacted by the techniqueused both to obtain and analyze the sample. Althoughaccepted standards for BAL have not yet been estab- lished, experts routinely recommend using a minimum of 250 mL of sterile saline, attempting to recover 40%of lavage sample volume, pooling multiple aliquots,and keeping cells on ice for no more than 72 hours orplacing them in an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acidvacutainer and counting a minimum of 400 cells whenperforming differentials. 13,50The differential cell count reference values for normal BAL cytology from pub-lished studies using a 250-mL mEA. Neutrophil 20% to 25% is consistent with sEA. Mucus hypersecretion is a key feature of EA. The 2016 American College of Veterinary Internal MedicineConsensus Statement on In flammatory Airway Disease, now referred to as mEA, states that mucusgrade 2/5 in racehorses or 3/5 for sport/pleasure is suf cient to diagnose mEA. 12These proposed criteria are further supported in a study by Rossi et al., which found that trachealmucus was strongly correlated with lower airwayinflammation on BAL cytology. 34In additional to assigning a mucus score, endoscopy is also useful forassessment of the upper airway in horses presentingfor decreased performance. Imaging studies, including thoracic radiographs and ultrasound, are not currently considered part of aminimum database for EA diagnosis 13as radiographs and ultrasound of horses with mEA or sEA show verylittle change compared to healthy horses. However,because ultrasound is a readily available diagnosticfor ambulatory practitioners, two recent studies havelooked more closely at ultrasound ndings in horses with EA. 33,35A study by Siwinska et al. scored the comet tail artifacts in the right and left lungs andfound statistically signi cant differences between the overall scores in the healthy and sEA groups andbetween the mEA and sEA groups. No signi cant dif- ferences were detected between heathy and mEAhorses. Although there were signi cant differences, Siwinska et al. concluded that due to its low speci c- ity, ultrasound cannot replace other more sensitive methods (i.e., BAL) for diagnosis of EA. 35Lo Feudo et al. conducted a retrospective study of 303 horses diag- nosed with sEA, mEA, or mEA with exercise-inducedpulmonary hemorrhage. This group found that ultra-sonographic scores were higher in the sEA and mEAwith exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage groupsand were positively associated with increased and hemosiderophages, concluding thatthoracic ultrasonography can provide useful informa-tion about in flammation in the lower airway. 33 Lung function testing by spirometry or other meth- o d si st h eg o l ds t a n d a r df o rd i a g n o s i n ga s t h m ai nhuman medicine.51In a research setting, conventional pulmonary function testing with an esophageal balloonand pneumotachometer can be used to calculate pulmo-nary resistance, elastance, and dynamic compliance.This method is effective for documenting impaired pul- monary function in horses with sEA and is commonly used to investigate individual horse response to inter-ventions in research studies. However, this method isnot sensitive enough to detect altered pulmonary func-tion in most horses with mEA unless it is combinedwith histamine bronchoprovocation, 52and even then limitations of this technique to differentiate normal andmEA horses have been demonstrated.53Further confus- ing the issue are con flicting results among studies that show a strong correlation between positive response tohistamine bronchoprovocation and BAL cytology52,54,55 and studies that failed to demonstrate correlationbetween these diagnostic methods.56,57In horses with with conventional pulmonary func- tion testing to demonstrate bronchoreversibility.13 Recent evidence has shown a good correlation bet- ween the 23-point clinical score and pulmonary re-sistance.32It remains to be determined whether the 23-point scoring system combined with bron-chodilation in the eld will be suf cient to detect change in pulmonary function. Signi cant research efforts are currently directed toward developmentIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE 408 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSof sensitive, reliable, and economical methods for pulmonary function testing in the eld setting.13 3. Treating Equine Asthma Treatments for EA aim to reduce lower airway in flam- mation, reverse bronchoconstriction, modulate theimmune response, and, most importantly, minimize ahorse 's exposure to airborne, respirable triggers (more on this below). The cornerstones of pharmacologicaltreatment include corticosteroids (systemic or inhaled) and bronchodilators (systemic or inhaled). 3,12There have also been investigations into the use of mast cell stabilizing agents, mucolytics, and low-dose interferon alpha. These treatments have been reviewed recently b u ta r en o ti nw i d e s p r e a du s e .58,59 Environmental management for horses diagnosed with mEA or sEA aims to reduce horse exposure to respirable airborne triggers, which are particles less than 4 to 5 mmi nd i a m e t e rt h a tc a np e n e t r a t ed e e p into the lung and have been linked with induction oflower airway in flammation in both people and horses.60Because these respirable particles, such as endotoxin and mold spores, can also cause lower air-way in flammation in healthy horses,10,20and there is currently no way to predict which horses will go on todevelop sEA as they age, it would be prudent to recom-mend horse owners implement preventive strategies aimed at decreasing organic-dust levels in equine envi- ronments in general. Further, there is evidence thateven subclinical levels (i.e., no evidence of respiratory dysfunction on resting physical exam) of lower airway inflammation can signi cantly impact performance in top equine athletes. 1For these reasons, there is now signicant interest in organic-dust management strat- egies for optimizing equine respiratory health. 4. Preventive Medicine Strategies to Address Organic- Dust-Induced Lower Airway Inflammation in Asthmatic and Healthy Horses As previously stated, EA is a highly prevalent syn- drome that affects horses of all ages, breeds, and uses at a global level. Therefore, one of the most important preventive medicine approaches for dealing with this disease should be increased awareness among veteri-narians. Client education and careful consideration of the respiratory system during all wellness exams are critical aspects of management and prevention. As a screening tool, the Horse Owner Assessed Respiratory Signs Index scoring system has been validated as adiagnostic aid in multiple studies (as previously stated) and has even demonstrated value as a prog- nostic aid, showing increased risk for development ofsEA in horses with mucous nasal discharge and/or occasional cough monitored over a 3-year period. 30 Because clients are the ones who complete this surveyscore, it could be used to promote client education and awareness of the potential signi cance of respiratory signs such as intermittent nasal discharge and occa- sional cough. The adapted 23-point scoring system and the adapted IDEASS scoring system are alsouseful, previously published rubrics that can provide practitioners with a standardized approach to their respiratory examinations (see previous).31,61 Another important preventive strategy for optimiz- ing equine respiratory health is decreasing exposure to dust. There are 3 main methods of decreasing theairborne dust concentration in a building: (1) decreas-ing contaminant release by modifying the sourcematerials (i.e., bedding, feed), (2) decreasing the rateof particle release by decreasing the degree of agita-tion of the source materials (do not feed hay fromracks or hay nets, wetting hay), and (3) increasing theparticle clearance rates by increased ventilation. 62 Common sources of respirable dust for horses includeforage, bedding, performance substrate, geography,and pollution (i.e., industrial, smoke), with adequacyof ventilation playing a signi cant role in levels of ex- posure. Almost all horses, except those with pastureassociated sEA, would have improved respiratory health if they could live outside year-round and con- sume grass or complete feeds, rather than hay. 63 However, the reality of management, geography, cli-mate, nances, land limitations, performance use, etc. makes this an unrealistic preventive strategy formany horses. Therefore, a comprehensive approach todecreasing organic dust exposure in forage, bedding,housing, and management will require an individual-ized approach for each patient. Strategies to decrease forage-associated organic- dust exposure include thoroughly and properly soak-ing hay (remembering to consider impacts on non-structural carbohydrate if soaking > 30 minutes); 64 feeding hay from the ground (ideally on a rubber mat)to decrease dust and promote optimal mucociliaryclearance, rather than a hay net, which increases res-pirable dust 4-fold compared to feeding from the ground); 65feeding alternative forms of forage such as haylage,66chopped dry forage, alfalfa, silage, or com- pletely cubed diets; or replacing hay altogether with a complete pelleted feed.40,67,68Steaming is another strategy that has been shown by multiple investiga-tors to decrease the respirable dust in hay,20,64,69 which seems to suggest it would bene th o r s e sw i t h EA. However, one study by Orard et al. suggests thath a ys t e a m i n gm a yn o tp r o v i d ec l i n i c a lb e n e tt o horses with EA. Orard et al. 's study showed that although hay steaming signi cantly decreased the mold content in hay, it still induced an increase inBAL neutrophils and infl ammatory cytokines in a manner similar to dry hay in horses with sEA. 70The authors of this study concluded that the relevance ofhay steaming \"as a non-medicinal therapy for sEA- affected horses \"might be controversial.70 Because of differences in study design and outcome measures, there are various levels of evidence for theimpact of bedding types on dust-induced lower airwayinflammation in horses with and without EA. 71For straw bedding, there is clear evidence of its associa-tion with increased levels of airborne respirable dustin stable environments, 69as well as increased clinical signs of respiratory disease in horses; therefore,IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 409compared to straw, wood shavings are a preferred al- ternative.69However, two different studies from the same research group have shown that wood shavingswere associated with signi cantly higher airway neutrophilia in healthy horses compared to peatshavings, 72and baled peat was associated with lower airway neutrophil percentages compared to straw pellet or loosely stored peat.73Other low-dust bed- ding options include shredded paper or cardboard or a rubber mat.74The potential bene t of choosing low-dust bedding and feed options cannot be over-stated as one study by Woods et al. showed thatcompared to wood shavings and pelleted feed, man-agement systems utilizing straw bedding and haygenerate 30 times more respirable dust in the horse breathing zone. 62 Housing and management play signi cant roles in organic dust exposure for horses and in clinical signs of EA.64General recommendations include housing with good ventilation (at least 2 openings for freshventilation), grooming the horse outside, not storingdry hay above horse stalls, decreasing barn clutterthat accumulates dust, turning horses out while stalls are cleaned and barn aisles are swept and waiting at least 60 minutes before bringing them back in, usinglow-dust bedding such as wood shavings, not usingstraw for bedding, not feeding dry hay, not using leafblowers to clean barn aisles, and opting for pasture asmuch as possible (ideally 12 hours or more each day)as breathing zone levels of respirable particulate andendotoxin are signi cantly less at pasture stabling a low-dust environment. 63,64While pas- ture turnout is optimal for avoiding triggers for horseswith barn or hay-dust asthma, horses with severeequine pasture asthma (EPA) experience exacerbationof asthma when grazing during the summer. 75High heat and humidity are additional environmental fac-tors that contribute to triggering exacerbation of EPA. 13,76Indeed, asthma exacerbation due to high heat and humidity has also been demonstrated in horses with previously diagnosed sEA, indicating thatsEA and EPA are not mutually exclusive. A retrospec-tive study by Bullone et al. showed signi cant positive correlations between higher daily heat and humidity,increased respiratory clinical score (worse symptoms),and decreased pulmonary function. 76Clinical signs of asthma improve with hours to days of removingaffected horses from pasture into a stall environ-ment, 13which strongly implicates pasture-associated particles as the inciting allergens. A study by Costa etal. identi ed increased grass pollens and fungal spores as being temporally associated with EPA exacerba-tions. 11High humidity is known to shatter pollen that i so t h e r w i s et o ol a r g et or e a c ht h el o w e ra i r w a y( > 1 0 mm) into respirable particles ( 5mm).77Increased dew point temperature is also known to increase release ofNigrospora conidia and basidiospores. 78Fungal par- ticles have also been identi ed as triggers for mEA and sEA.135. Future Directions for Decreasing Organic-Dust- Induced Lower Airway Inflammation in Horses While the current data are limited, immunomodula- tory therapy is one possible strategy for preventing or minimizing deleterious environmental impacts onequine respiratory health. A study by Nogradi et al. demonstrated that mEA and sEA horses fed a polyun- saturated fatty acid supplement containing 1.5 to 3 gdocosahexaenoic acid for 2 months showed signi - cantly greater improvement in clinical score and air- way neutrophilia compared to horses receiving a low- dust diet alone and placebo. 40Future research could determine whether docosahexaenoic acid supplemen-tation also mitigates airway respiratory \"responsiveness \"in horses with- out clinical signs of EA. There have also beenseveral studies on the effects of inhaled nanopar-ticle-bound cytosine-phosphate-guanosine immu- notherapy in horses with asthma. 79-81The current hypothesis is that these particles interact with lower airway immune cells through toll-like receptors toactivate regulatory T cells and restore balance to the Th1/Th2 response. There is also evidence of an anti-in flammatory effect of this treatment, with a decrease in BAL supernatant interleukin-4, IL-8,and interferon- gin treated horses.80Future research could evaluate whether this therapymight also work as a prophylactic for horses enter-ing intensive training, such as young racehorses,as training has been associated with changes in re- spiratory immune function and increased airway neutrophilia. 82 While the evidence for \"allergy testing \"and aller- gen-speci c immunotherapy (AIT) for treating extrin- sic atopic asthma in people is compelling, the evidence for AIT for treating EA is con flicting. In the majority of humans with asthma, the airways become sensi- tized to one or more environmental allergens such aspollen from trees, grass, or weeds (seasonal allergens), animal dander, excretions of house dust mites, molds (perennial allergens), insect stings, drugs, or food.Sensitization occurs through increased activation ofallergen-speci c T lymphocytes that switch to Th2 cells and secrete mediators that cause B lymphocytes to switch immunoglobulin isotype production toward immunoglobulin E (IgE). 51Upon subsequent exposure to offended allergens, IgE gets cross-linked and indu-ces immediate release reaction hap-pens within minutes of allergen exposure. Due to recruitment of granulocytes such as eosinophils, baso- phils, and T lymphocytes, this immediate reaction canbe followed by a delayed Type IV hypersensitivityreaction about 8 hours after the initial reaction. 51 Allergen-speci c immunotherapy aims to induce clinical and immunologic tolerance to the offendingallergen through administration of select antigenpreparations subcutaneously or sublingually overIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE 410 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS3 to 5 years. Allergen-speci c IgE screening is com- mercially available for both humans and horses (Allercept\u00aescreening test). In people with atopic asthma, the role of Type I hypersensitivity, IgE, andhistamine in the immunopathology of disease isclear, which is why antihistamines and AIT therapyfor these patients is effective. In horses with EA, therole of IgE and histamine is less clear. For one, horseswith EA exhibit only a delayed (possibly Type III orIV) hypersensitivity response, rather than both imme- diate and delayed responses as in atopic asthma in humans. 83Additionally, while some studies have found increased levels of IgE in serum or BAL fluid from horses with EA,84-86other studies have not been able to demonstrate a difference in IgE levelsbetween control horses and horses with EA.47,87 Similar inconclusive results have been reported forthe use of allergy tests to correctly identify horseswith EA. 83In a recent study by Hansen et al., investigators measured antigen-speci cI g Ei ns e - rum and BAL fluid from 64 horses with a history of lower airway problems diagnosed with mastocyticmEA, neutrophilic mEA, mixed-cell mEA, and sEA.Their results show that allergen-speci cI g Ei nh o r s e s with EA is not found in systemic circulation, and onlythe mastocytic and mixed subgroups of horses with EAhad allergen-speci c IgE in BAL fluid. 86This difference in presence/absence of IgE based on EA subtype mayhelp to explain the con flicting evidence of previous stud- ies that did not investigate multiple EA subtypes.Additional differences may be explained by the lim-ited number of allergens investigated in previousstudies as more recent research suggests that pro-tein microarrays can be used for large-scale IgEmapping of allergens associated with the environ-ment of horses and may be more useful for informing patient-speci c AIT in horses with EA. 85Further research is needed to determine what role, if any, IgE/histamine plays in the immunopathology of vari-ous subtypes of EA as this may help to inform whichequine patients would bene tm o s tf r o mA I T . Finally, improved availability of non- to minimally invasive biomarkers of lower airway in flammation in horses would bene t efforts to develop approaches that are more preventive for EA, especially bio- markers sensitive enough to pick up low levels of lower airway in flammation as in mEA. 13,44Because equine respiratory health is integrally linked withenvironmental exposure, the right biomarker couldprovide a convenient and relevant way to monitorimpact of changes in nutrition, stable environment,training practices, and more on lower respiratoryhealth and performance. 6. Conclusion Respirable particles in a horse 's environment can have detrimental effects on equine respiratory healthand function, resulting in a range of consequencesfrom the mild-to-moderate lower airway in flammation of mEA that impairs performance in top equineathletes to the severe, debilitating, and recurrent inflammation of sEA that curtails a horse 'sp e r f o r m - ance career and threatens their health and welfare. Equine asthma is a highly prevalent disease that has as i g n i cant impact on the equine industry; therefore, veterinarians will need to deploy a multipronged approach of treatment, management, and even pre- vention in order to minimize the impacts of this syn-drome on horses and their owners.

Introduction The physiology of the modern horse is designed to graze for up to 18 hours1of their day on very coarse materials, meaning that appropriate preventative dentistry practices can have a profound effect on the digestive ef ciency and overall health of the horse. This signi cant forage intake is coupled with the need to grind it into small enough particles to maximize the surface area on which the cellulase digesting microbes in the hindgut can act upon. This in turn means that the effective mastication by the cheek teeth in the oral cavity produces the mosteffective digestion in the hindgut. A complete basic understanding of the form and function of the equine dentition is necessary to ensure the cause and effect of any abnormality and subsequent treatment is completely understood by the practitioner to enable the most effective mastication possible. As the advent of more appropriate feed materials for senior horses coupled with more treatment options for common geriatric ailments are prolonging the overall life span of the horse, it is also important for the practitioner to be able to prolong the effective life of the horse' s dentition. On average, the normal horse 's teeth erupt and wear at a rate of 2 to 3 mm per year. In this case, preventative dentistry often meansidentifying a more minor abnormality early in this cycle and addressing it appropriately before it wor- sens on its own or causes major pathology. Some com- mon cases of this early intervention include treating malocclusions and overgrowths before they lead to further problems (such as diastema formation thatleads to periodontal disease, or an overgrowth thatcauses painful gingival ulceration), and also identify- ing pathology early to prevent secondary complica- tions and further pain and suffering in the horse(such as a complicated crown fracture in a cheek toothor early signs of equine odontoclastic tooth resorptionand hypercementosis [EOTRH]). As equine dentistry involves this complex interplay and understanding of anatomy, physiology, and mechanics, dentistry is most appropriately performedby the veterinarian. The ability to assess the overallhealth of the horse and address multifaceted medicalproblems, of which dentistry may only be a part, canonly be done by the veterinary practitioner. Additio-nally, a complete dental evaluation involves a physi-cal examination and sedation of the horse, and vet-erinarians are also the only quali ed professionals able to offer follow-up diagnostics and imaging ifmore signi cant pathology, dental or otherwise, is suspected. The concept of \"floating \"teeth is slowly shifting, with veterinarians identifying areas forpotential added value to dentistry, but the impor-tance of veterinary dentistry cannot be overstated. There are many occasions that fall outside the con- cept of \"routine \"dentistry despite how it is referred to by many horse owners and veterinarians. Assuch, the rst step is to understand normal vs patho- logical dentition, followed by an understanding ofhow to address pathological ndings appropriately \u2014 even if that requires staged treatment and/or refer-ral to a specialist if possible, and lastly, being able toeffectively communicate the importance of the examndings and appropriate treatment to horse owners. NOTES 414 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE2. Anatomy and Physiology Overview The development of hypsodont (high-crowned and con- tinuously erupting) teeth coincided with increased grazing behavior in the horse.2As the hypsodont denti- tion developed, enamel and dentine the length of protruding enamel foldson the occlusal surface of the cheek teeth. The teeth ofmodern horses also contain an increased amount ofcementum in comparison to their predecessors.Because of the prolonged eruption of equine teeth,cementum appeared as a component of the equine clin- ical crown, where it greatly contributes to the crown size 3as opposed to brachydont teeth, in which it only appears subgingivally to anchor the periodontal liga-ments. Additionally, the softer cementum and dentineserve to buffer the more brittle adjacent enamelagainst cracking or fracturing. 1Peripheral cementum is present over the entire nonocclusal external surfaceof the equine cheek tooth, serving subgingivally as part of the periodontal apparatus,4while infundibular cementum lls the enamel \"cup\" of the infundibulum in the incisors and maxillary cheek teeth. Adult horses have between 36 and 44 permanent teeth. The typical dental formula includes 12 incisors, up to 4 canines, up to 4 rst premolars (wolf teeth), and 24 cheek teeth (premolars and molars). Canines onlyerupt in 27.2% of female horses.5The vestigial rst pre- molars are present in nearly 20% of adult horses andare found more frequently in the maxillary than the mandibular arcade.5The fully formed equine cheek tooth usually contains 5 vascular pulp horns (with 6 in all Triadan 06 cheek teeth, 6 in mandibular Triadan 11cheek teeth, and 7 in maxillary Triadan 11 cheekteeth), all of which communicate via a common apicalpulp chamber for the rst few years after eruption but later develop variable patterns of pulp horn connectionsas roots form at the apex over several years. 6,7 The prolonged eruption of equine cheek teeth is due to the constant proliferation and remodeling ofthe periodontal ligament, which creates traction on thetooth, essentially drawing it into the oral cavity. 8The rate of attrition, or wear of the teeth, is determined bytooth morphology, abrasive nature of the diet, and theamount of time horses spend masticating. Reservecrowns can be up to 9 cm long at initial eruption ofthe tooth, and cheek teeth often reach a state of com-plete senile wear, or \"smooth mouth, \"at between 25 and 30 years of age. Hypsodont teeth constantly laydown secondary dentine at the occlusal and peripheralaspects of the pulp horns for the life of the tooth.Therefore, equine pulp is required to remain metabol-ically active and maintain an excellent blood supplythrough large apical vascular foramina. At eruption,the entire equine tooth is covered by a thin layer ofcementum and the pulp horns are also covered by alayer of primary dentine. The pulp chambers are sur- rounded by primary dentine, which is surrounded by folded layers of peripheral enamel. Incisors and maxil-lary cheek teeth also contain 1 single and 2 infundib-ula, respectively, lined by enamel and lled to varyingdegrees with cementum (Fig. 1). At or shortly aftereruption, no further deposition or repair of all enamel or infundibular cementum can occur, but peripheral cementum will continue to be deposited around the apex of the tooth, anchoring the tooth via the periodon- tal ligament to the alveolus. 9Occlusally, when the tooth comes into attrition, the primary dentine wearsoff and secondary dentine begins to be laid down over the pulp horns to protect them from exposure to the oral cavity environment and its microorganisms.6 The equine cheek teeth arcade is also characterized as anisognathic, meaning that the teeth are inunequal or uneven rows. The maxillary and mandibu- lar rows of cheek teeth typically meet at an approxi- mately 15-degree angle, with the maxillary teeth being wider than the mandibular and the caudal cheek teeth meeting at a steeper angle than the more rostral cheek teeth. This angulation is not a strict mandate for correction, though, and should only be used as a loose reference with any other pathology involved prior to modifying the occlusal table angle during treatment.10The cheek teeth are further di- vided into quadrants and identi ed using the Triadan nomenclature system. The Triadan 100 tooth arcade lies dorsal to the Triadan 400 arcade on the right side of the mouth, while the Triadan 200 and 300 arcades oppose each other on the left side. Horses can func- tionally only chew on one side at a time, and this com- bination of unilateral mastication coupled with the anisognathic morphology is one of the core factors that leads to the formation of sharp enamel points \u2014 the most common dental pathology found in the mod- ern horse. Another core component of sharp point for- mation is due to the difference in microhardness and wear rates between enamel, dentine, and cementum. The enamel wears slower than the other dental tis- sues, and so it becomes more prominent when com- pared to areas of dentine and/or cementum.11,12 As prey animals, horses are often good at masking s i g n so fd e n t a ld i s e a s e .E v e no nt h o r o u g ho r a le x a m i -nation, the rst signs of disease are often subtle, which is why a comprehensive understanding of\"normal \"along with a good process and the correct equipment for examination are the rst and most im- portant steps in quality preventative dentistry. 3. The Preventative Dental Examination Many specialists and experienced practitioners in equine dentistry would agree that at least 80% of their time performing more routine dentistry is actually spent on the history, physical examination, and oral ex- amination of the horse prior to any occlusal adjustment or\"floating \"being performed. This is a signi cant area in which the veterinarian can educate the client anddemonstrate the importance of the veterinary perspec- tive. In order to perform the highest quality and most complete examination possible, the veterinarian should have the following equipment available in addition to their good understanding of dental anatomy and physiology:IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS 68 McPherson/Hausmann, Millennium, or Alumi-Speca) 8This is designed to give a view of the entire oral cavity, but also to protect the practitioner 's hand/arm and other equipment. A high-quality,durable speculum is most essential. - Rigid Long-Handled Mirror and/or Oroscope 8An oroscope can be purpose-bought or can be built using several commercially available pieces of equipment.13,14 - Long-Handled Periodontal and/or Endodontic Probes (commercially available from many equine veterinary equipment suppliers) - Headlamp 8Can be purchased at outdoor/recreational stores,but if performing a signi cant amount of den- tistry, the headlamps available from surgical suppliers offer noticeable improvements in ergo- nomics and adjustability. - Large dosing syringe to rinse feed material from the oral cavity - Appropriate sedation 8Typically involves a combination of an alpha-2-agonist (xylazine, detomidine, or romi dine) a n da no p i o i d( m o s tc o m m o n l yb u t o r p h a n o l ) - Dental chart for recording ndings during the exam 8This can be a printable PDF found online, may be part of a practice' s electronic medical records sys- tem, or a subscription may be purchased for sev- eral speci c dental charting mobile applications. - For subsequent treatment: Wide variety of dental rasps and/or purpose-built motorized equipment 4. Steps of a Thorough Dental Evaluation /C15Obtain a thorough medical and managementhistory. In addition to routine questions regarding the horse 's diet and vaccine status, the practitioner should cover the horse 's weight, particularly weight loss, and anychanges in appetite or energy level. Changes in diet and management, such as turnout, should also be noted as horses with dental disease generally do bet-ter when turned out on fresh grass as opposed to being fed dry hay. The owners/caretakers should also be asked speci cally about the horse 's eating habits and if they are dropping feed or quidding. They shouldalso be asked about any previous dental examinationndings and treatments. If the horse is ridden, any issues with bitting or the bridle should be noted. As horses age, other comorbidconditions become pertinent, and identifying those may prevent future complications. This can include suspect cases of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction(PPID), as these horses may have dif culty recovering from dental problems, and horses with advanced de-generative joint disease, as they may be less stable or uncomfortable when sedated. Additionally, if EOTRH is suspected, owners should be asked about the horse 's eating and grazing behavior. Horses with EOTRH will often pick up their feed and hay with their lips and slowly maneuver it into the oral cavity. They may be reluctant to grasp hard treats such as carrots and apples, and also may be less enthusiastic about turn-out and grazing. /C15Observation from a distance This step can affect the veterinarian 's interpreta- tion of the dental examination, but it is often forgottenor passed up in a rush to perform a procedure. Thehorse 's demeanor and facial expressions can be observed from a distance, along with any nasal dis-charge. The horse should also be observed eating hay, if possible, as quidding will most often be observed when hay is being ingested. Listening for strong andvigorous crunching sounds during mastication may also provide an indicator of the horse 's intraoral com- fort and their ability to appropriately grind their for-age. Soft squelching sounds or quidding may indicate inadequate dentition to fully masticate brous feed materials or pain within the oral cavity. The horse 's fecal material should also be observed for consistencyand fecal ber length, particularly in horses with poor dentition. Lastly, the position of the lips, tongue, andjaw should be observed. The horse does not typically Fig. 1. The dental tissues are visible on this cross section of an equine maxillary cheek tooth.IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE 416 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSrest with their jaws closed tightly together, but if the incisors are purposely held apart or the tongue is held between the incisors, further investigation forEOTRH may be warranted. /C15Physical exam The clinician 's steps for a routine physical examina- tion should be followed, with particular attention paidto the horse 'stness for sedation for a full dental ex- amination. This mainly involves examining the cardi- ovascular system along with the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. The body condition score should benoted, along with any signs of concurrent disease(such as PPID, sinus disease, or other respiratory ailments). /C15Sedation Most dental practitioners choose to use a combina- tion of an alpha-2-agonist and an opioid when per- forming routine dental examination and treatment, most commonly detomidine + butorphanol in practice. A combination of xylazine + butorphanol should be re-served for patients with regular dental records and no previous knowledge of pathology, or patients with con- cerns surrounding duration of sedation. The amountof sedative administered should be titrated for thepatient 's size and temperament, keeping in mind the main goals of sedation when performing dentistry: /C15Patient compliance /C15Stationary head /C15Tongue relaxation /C15Cessation of chewing The sedation should be administered intravenously, and the practitioner should only begin their dental ex-amination when the horse is minimally responsive to external stimulation. /C15External examination of the head This examination should be performed both visually and via palpation. The structures and con rmation of the head should be symmetrical, with note of any focalswellings, condition of the masseter muscles, and any deviation of the nose (wry nose). Even very mild wrynose can be implicated in some cheek teeth malocclu- sions. The submandibular and parotid lymph nodes should be palpated, along with the ramii of the mandi-ble and temporomandibular joints (TMJs). The TMJsare overimplicated in many occurrences of oral cavity discomfort in the horse, so any suspect pathology should be thoroughly investigated before determiningthis area to be the cause of any problem, and other more common dental abnormalities should be ruled out. The mandible can also be manipulated at thistime to ensure suf cient lateral excursion is present. This will vary by individual, but the mandible shouldmove freely and relatively symmetrically from side toside, and a slight rostral-caudal movement should also be possible. /C15Incisor and canine exam An examination of the incisors should always occur before placing the full-mouth speculum to ensure they are stable enough to allow for a safe examination of the caudal oral cavity. The number of incisors should be counted, along with noting any malocclusions and thepresence of permanent or deciduous teeth. Findings that may affect the ability to safely place the full- mouth speculum may include missing or fractured inci-sors, signs of EOTRH, and signs of stereotypic behavior such as cribbing leading to excessive wear. In many of these cases, using dental impression material or softfabric/cotton to pad the bite plates of the full-mouth speculum will allow for examination of the cheek teeth. Commonly, calculus deposition may be present on thecanines, which can typically be addressed by physical removal of the calculus using forceps to prevent associ- ated gingivitis. In general, reduction of the incisors isperformed on a limited basis, speci cally when a malocclusion (such as \"parrot mouth \")o rf r a c t u r e d teeth/uneven wear prevents smooth lateral excursionof the jaw. /C15Placement of the full-mouth speculum Care should be taken when both placing and utiliz- ing a speculum as these are large and heavy pieces ofequipment and can cause accidental injury to thoserestraining the horse. The poll strap should be posi-tioned, and the bite plates slid gently between the inci- sors, and the poll strap should then be tightened. The poll strap may need to be retightened during the examand treatment. The speculum should then be opened gradually to the extent the practitioner is able to reach the last cheek teeth (Triadan 11). If the exam is pro-longed, the speculum should be occasionally closed to allow the mouth to relax during the procedure. The mouth should then be lavaged with dilute chlorhexi-dine in warm water to remove any feed material. /C15Examination of the cheek teeth The cheek teeth should be examined both manually and visually (Fig. 2). Manual exam can help to deter-mine where there may be sharp areas on the cheekteeth that can lead to soft tissue trauma, including sharp enamel points and overgrowths. The practitioner m a ya l s ob ea b l et of e e la n yl a r g ed i a s t e m a t a ,f r a c t u r e s , or feed impaction. A headlamp and mirror should then b e used to visually follow the manual examination, look- ing for any soft tissue trauma, including any bit trauma, and counting the teeth, as supernumerary cheek teeth often are accidentally overlooked when they lay just caudal to the Triadan 11 tooth. The mirror or oroscopeshould be used to examine the occlusal surface for any pulpar exposure, infudibular caries, or small fractures. The mirror should also be used to examine the entiretyIN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 417of the gingival margin of each cheek tooth row lingually, palatally, and buccally for diastemata, food impaction,and periodontal disease along with any peripheral caries. 5. Common Abnormalities Often Able to Be Treated by Routine Occlusal Adjustment /C15Enamel points Eating concentrates encourages horses to have a much greater vertical crushing stroke along with less range intheir medially directed horizontal power stroke thanwhen masticating forage. 15The presence of slow-wear- ing enamel infoldings along with this vertical chewingmotion can lead to development of sharp enamel pointsor overgrowths as the remaining components of thetooth wear more quickly. 16However, this is a general- ization, and sharp enamel points and overgrowths are also found in horses that consume an exclusively forage diet. The level and direction of occlusal forces on theteeth, and therefore patterns of attrition, vary signi - cantly depending on the individual horse. The sharp enamel points typically form on the lin- gual edges of the mandibular cheek teeth and the buc- cal edges of the maxillary cheek teeth. The maxillary s h a r pp o i n t st e n dt ob em o r es i g n i cant as they occur in association with the cingulae that can lead to softtissue trauma and ulceration of the cheeks. Cingulaeare ridges on the lateral aspect of maxillary cheekteeth that arise from enamel folds and give rise to the sharp points (Fig. 3). Their exact purpose is unclear, but it is suggested that they give the tooth structuralrigidity. The cingulae are normal anatomical featuresof the cheek teeth and should not be reduced them-selves\u2014 only the sharp enamel points that form at the occlusal-buccal junction should be removed. 17 /C15Transverse ridges The normal protruding enamel cusps that form as adjacent dentine and cementum wear more quicklyare known as transverse ridges. They function toincrease the occlusal surface area but may becomeexaggerated due to abnormal patterns of wear. 18 Transverse ridges are, again, normal anatomical fea- tures of the cheek teeth. If they are relatively symmet-rical across all cheek teeth, seem to provide goodocclusal contact, and do not prevent excursion of thejaw, they are likely not pathological and should onlybe reduced minimally if at all. Exaggerated trans-verse ridges (or overgrowths) would be focal andnoticeably larger than those on the other cheek teeth. They may be associated with an opposing pathology (such as a diastema or missing tooth) and may lead tofurther abnormal wear patterns if left untreated.These should be reduced within safe limits to preventfurther wear abnormalities and diastema formation,with an understanding that they may still providevaluable occlusal surface contact if they can be man-aged appropriately. /C15Focal overgrowths Excessive wear in the occlusal surface is attributed to reduced enamel content or delayed eruption of thattooth, which then leads to the development of over-growth in the opposing tooth. 19It is a common mis- conception that the overgrown/overlong tooth is patho-logical, when in actuality it is often dysplastic calci ed tissue in the overworn tooth. Despite this, the over-grown tooth must still be reasonably reduced (4 -5m m at a time) to allow for proper masticatory motion and prevent sequelae from a signi cant overgrowth, such as severe malocclusion or soft tissue injury. 20 /C15Senile excavation and expiration (Fig. 4) As the cheek teeth reach the end of their dental life, they wear much more quickly as their enamel folds expire. The maxillary cheek teeth often have an exca-vated appearance, with the central portion of the toothcompletely worn due to lack of infundibular enamel atthe apical aspect of the tooth. Any opposing teeth with agreater enamel content may overerupt as teeth with less enamel will wear quite quickly. These teeth are then of limited use in mastication, and may either thenbe naturally shed or wear down to the smooth cementalcomponents of the roots. Dental treatment in seniorhorses is mostly palliative, and it is most important topreserve as much of the occlusal enamel as possible dur-ing any dental treatment to prolong the life of the tooth,while also addressing any potential sources of pain and/or periodontal disease appropriately. Frequent re- examination is warranted, but limited adjustmentsshould be performed each time. 17 6. Special Considerations /C15Wolf teeth Therst premolars are often extracted in young horses, although evidence suggests that their extraction isunnecessary unless displaced or abnormally large. In Fig. 2. Utilizing a speculum, headlamp, and a long-handled mir- ror to examine the cheek teeth.IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE 418 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSfact, these vestigial teeth often shed with the deciduous second premolars at approximately 2.5 years of age, completely without intervention. While their extraction is not necessarily harmful, it is best to wait if possible and observe for any biting dif culties when train- ing begins, and then make the decision to extract if necessary. /C15Parrot mouth and sow mouth (Abbreviation: MAL/2 and MAL/3) Malocclusions caused by mismatch of the length of the mandible and maxilla lead to the pathology nor- mally termed either parrot mouth (maxilla longer thanmandible) or sow mouth (mandible longer than max-illa). If severe, intervention with interdental wiring andsplints is present when identi ed very early and with extremely dedicated and conscientious owners, but it isnot possible to intervene once the horse is over12 months in age. In this case, the incisor overbite must be managed, along with the cheek teeth malocclusion that occurs due to the mandible/maxilla mismatch.This may be signi cant, or it may be extremely subtle. Depending on the degree of displacement, the Triadan06 and 11 teeth can become severely overgrown. 21 /C15Cheek tooth malocclusions (Abbreviation: MAL/1) The malocclusion of 1 single or bilaterally paired cheek teeth is usually also classi ed as a displacement in the lingual, buccal, or palatal direction (Fig. 5).Some of these occur congenitally while some are acquired due to abnormal mastication, but in either case, these displacements often worsen if leftuntreated, causing the teeth to become more severely angled or rotated over time.22These displacements fre- quently cause obliquely angled diastemata to form in the interproximal spaces between the normal and dis-placed teeth, which can be complicated to manage and lead to severe periodontal disease. When the displace- ments and periodontal disease become severe, extrac-tion is sometimes warranted. However, if diagnosed early, the displaced teeth can be managed by reducing the overgrown portions of the displaced teeth that arenot in good occlusal contact, therefore reducing the masticatory forces, which could lead to further dis- placement, along with management of the diastemata.These cases must be managed closely, with examina- tion and occlusal adjustment every 4 to 6 months. When the teeth are severely displaced and periodontaldisease is expected, radiographs should be used to eval-uate the viability and angulation of the tooth, and to determine if extraction is appropriate. /C15Skull distortions and wry nose (Abbreviation: MAL/4) Severe cases of wry nose are noticeable even to a cas- ual observer, and often cause greater respiratory prob- lems than dental issues; however, more subtle distortions are less noticeable but may cause wear abnormalities in the teeth. These cases often are noted Fig. 3. Maxillary cheek teeth with sharp enamel points forming on the cingulae leading to buccal ulceration (left) vs normal cingulae (right). Fig. 4. Senile excavation (circle), remaining expired root remnants (star), and senile diastemata (arrows) in aged horse maxillarycheek teeth.IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS Vol. 68 / 2022 419as a \"slant\" or\"shear \"occlusion and must be examined carefully to determine the source of the angulation. The incisors are most obviously affected, but more shear con rmation in the cheek teeth may also be found. The focus of any adjustment should be enablingfree lateral excursion in these cases. Reduction of over- growths at the extremes of the incisor arcades may be indicated, but reducing the slant and straightening the occlusion is unnecessary, highly likely to recur, and may compromise pulp.23 7. Overview of Occlusal Adjustment Both manual and motorized instrumentation are ac- ceptable when performing most routine occlusal adjustment, although motorized equipment has undergone great development in the past decade, and a great variety of motorized implements are now available. In general, motorized equipment offers more precision than manual instruments along with a greater ease in reducing overgrowths and less potential for soft tissue trauma when used appropri- ately. However, motorized instrumentation can be dangerous when used by unskilled operators or with- out sedation, and the work must be visually observed at all times. Whether manual or motorized instru- mentation is being used, the practitioner should have a variety of implements available \u2014either hand rasps of varying lengths, widths, and angles, and/or motorized equipment with a variety of head attach- ments (e.g., flat disc, apple core, chamfer) to reach all parts of the mouth. Water cooling of motorized instrumentation has been debated by many practitioners, and while it may not be strictly necessary, it is bene cial. Water cooling prevents thermal damage to theteeth and also reduces dust production. If water cooling is not available, no tooth should be reduced for more than 30 seconds at a time as this will pre- vent signi cant internal temperature increases within each tooth.24In addition, no tooth should be reduced more than 4 to 5 mm in total in 1 treat- ment session due to the risk of pulpar exposure. It has been suggested one could also carefully reduce until the beginning loss of the stained secondary dentine is seen on any of the tooth 's pulp horns,b u tb yt h et i m eac h a n g ei nc o l o ri sv i s i b l et ot h eoperator, the pulp may already be exposed. If furtherreduction is warranted, the practitioner shouldreturn in 4 to 6 months 'time and reduce the tooth again. 25,26If the horse is found to have relatively nor- mal wear and occlusion, annual re-examination and treatment is usually advised. In general, though, more frequent evaluation and less reduction of den-tal surface in each individual session leads to betteroutcomes. 8. Abnormalities That Require Further Investigation or Referral The speci c abnormalities discussed below are far from an exhaustive list of all possible equine den- tal pathologies. In general, a good principle whenaddressing a more complex dental problem is toperform radiography of the head. Some of theseproblems may only require monitoring or routinemaintenance, while others may necessitate refer- ral or more specialized intervention. References to assist in obtaining quality dental radiographs areavailable from many cementosis Radiographs are used to both de nitively diagnose and determine when extraction is necessary in cases of EOTRH. Full-mouth incisor and canine extractionis the recommended treatment in advanced cases ofEOTRH. The in flammation and resorption that is visible on clinical examination in advanced cases isoften preceded in radiographic changes by several years. Screening incisor radiographs may be per- formed in horses over 15 years in age so that earlierintervention or closer monitoring may take place ifEOTRH is found. Radiographs are de nitely recom- mended in horses with aforementioned signs noticedby owners, or if even subtle pathology is noted on clinical examination. 29 /C15Pulp exposure Pulpar exposure on the occlusal surface is often a consequence of apical infection and death of the tooth as the periodontal tissues are an independent systemand continue to function in dental eruption even ifthe tooth 's endodontic system has died (Fig. 6). Secondary dentine is no longer produced to protect and cover the pulp, and as the secondary dentine becomes worn, the pulp horns become exposed to thesurrounding environment. 30The metabolically active hypsodont tooth can allow areas of pulpar exposure orareas of noxious stimuli to the pulp, such as adjacentcaries, to be sealed with tertiary dentine in order to limit further pathological changes. 31Radiographs are recommended in cases with pulpar exposure to deter- mine if the affected tooth can be monitored or shouldbe extracted. Fig. 5. Severe lingual displacement of the Triadan 309 tooth in the mandibular arcade creating large oblique diastemata.IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE 420 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS/C15Fractured teeth Teeth with visible fractures leading to missing por- tions of the clinical crown should be radiographed any time they are identi ed, although not all fractured teeth will require extraction. Many cheek teeth withcomplicated crown fractures (commonly termed \"slab \" fractures) will form a tertiary dentine bridge andremain stable (Fig. 7). However, radiographs should be obtained, and if the tooth is affected by apical infec- tion or is no longer viable, extraction is recommended. If a tooth is affected by a crown/root fracture, extrac- tion is almost always indicated. Most commonly, the sharp edges created by the tooth fracture cause soft tissue pain, which can be addressed simply by remov- ing the fragments and reducing any sharp edges. 32-34 /C15Infundibular caries Maxillary cheek tooth infundibular caries is one of the most common dental disorders reported in horseswith caries and/or hypocementosis found in 65% to 97% of teeth depending on the study.35,36Most of these lesions are mild (classi ed as grade 1), which are unlikely to lead to further sequelae, but grade 2 and grade 3 lesions can lead to severe complications such as midline tooth fracture, apical infection, and secondary sinusitis. If infundibular caries are found on oral examination, they should be probed if possible and radiographed to determine their depth along with the stability and viability of the surrounding tooth structure (Fig. 8). Few affected teeth require outright extraction (prior to fracture), but restoration of the infundibula with flowable composite materials designed for human dentistry may be considered if the horse is of a relativelyyoung age and the caries are of grade 2 or 3 with a depth of >10 mm.37Recent long-term follow-up pub- lished by Pearce and Brooks38has shown infundibular restoration to be safe, durable, and seeming to preventthe development of further pathological changes, including apical infection and dental fracture.Infundibular restoration is a relatively new proce- dure best performed by specialists and veterinar- ians with speci c training as the morphology of the infundibula is complex and proper preparationof the cavities requires special instrumentation. Ifrestoration is not performed, severely affected teeth should be taken out of occlusion and closely monitored for signs of fracture or apical infection. /C15Periodontal disease and diastemata Periodontal disease in the horse is most often sec- ondary to another pathology, most commonly diaste- mata in the cheek teeth. These can be either primary (developmental), secondary to cheek tooth displace-ment, or form as cheek teeth lose their angulation and wear to the apex in senile horses. The soft tissue pain caused by food impaction, gingival ulceration, andultimately loss of periodontal attachments is signi - cant (Fig. 9) \u2014this is one of the most painful dental diseases in horses. 39The focus of treatment is mainly to prevent further food impaction while also attempt- ing to address the underlying cause. The periodontal pockets should be mechanically debrided and lavaged to clear any food material fully. They may also be lled with dental impression material or wax when fully cleared of debris. In severe valve-form cases, the spaces can be mechanically widened to allow more free clearance of feed material, but this should only be Fig. 7. Oroscopic view of a \"slab \"or complicated crown fracture through pulp horns 1 and 2 of the 109 maxillary cheek tooth. Fig. 6. Oroscopic view of exposure of pulp horns 1 and 3 of the 309 mandibular cheek tooth.IN-DEPTH: PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE: BEING PROACTIVE IN PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 421done by experienced practitioners as the risk of pulp exposure is high.40It is also very important to reduce any opposing focal overgrowths that could be contrib- uting to poor interproximal contact and food impaction. 9. Conclusion The breadth and variety of equine dental disorders is large, but the clinical skills of the equine veterinary practitioner enable them to treat the whole horseappropriately. With good understanding of dental anatomy and physiology, good communication skills, and appropriate diagnostics, many common yet signif-icant dental pathologies can be treated by the veteri-narian in the eld. Appropriate preventative dental practices will preserve the life of the dentition andgreatly improve the life of the horse.

Introduction Currently, there is not a specialty for podiatry in equine medicine. This could be in part because there is not a universal method to assess foot conformation and balance or a uniform method for trimming or shoeing t h ee q u i n ef o o t .1,2Although guidelines have been pub- lished,1there are no biomechanical studies de ning precise measurements that should be adhered to when addressing foot balance.3Equine distal limb lameness is commonly associated with a faulty and imbalancedfoot conformation,4and hoof-related lameness is a key cause of poor performance, lameness, and early retire-ment in the sport and pleasure horse.5Foot balance encompasses assessment in the dorsopalmar, laterome-dial, and craniocaudal planes as well as the ventral depth of the hoof.6,7Not one aspect of balance is an en- tity of its own as they are all integrated by limb confor-mation, ground reaction forces, and the muscle-tendon unit of the deep digital flexor tendon and how they act around the center of rotation in the condyle of the sec-ond phalanx. This paper presents a method usingspecic anatomical dimensions and measurements t h a tc a nb eu s e dt oe v a l u a t ea n dd e ne lack of hoof mass or excess hoof mass or distortions. This informa- tion can be visualized on the foot from a radiograph orfrom the foot to the radiograph. This information canthen be applied in a measurable trimming/shoeing pro-cedure to achieve improved balance in the distal limb. 2. Materials and Methods The front feet from 10 horses were randomly selectedfor farrier service. These horses were of mixedbreeds, ages, and riding disciplines. These feet repre-sent a range of conditions normally seen by a veteri-narian or farrier in routine practice scenarios. Theabnormal hoof conditions include low ventral depth,long toe-low heel, long toe-high heel, club foot, andmild chronic laminitis. Two horses presented 1 footwith chronic laminitis that were omitted from thisstudy because of soft tissue distortions that werebeyond the scope of this paper. This created a data-base of 18 feet. Some of these horses presented with NOTES 428 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMAGING: SCANS, SESAMOIDS, AND SUBCHONDRAL CHANGESfoot-related lameness issues. Shoeing was performed by one author (PH). To test the validity of the physi-cal evaluation/shoeing procedure, this author was blinded to the preshoeing radiographs. Radiographic Method Dorsopalmar and mediolateral radiographs were obtained on each foot, pre- and postshoeing, at 1 clinic. These radiographs were acquired by the attending veter- inarian using standard techniques (68 -70 kVp, 0.05 mAs) with a portable x-ray generator and a digital radi-ography system. The feet were radiographed on flat wooden blocks incorporating a metal ground line. The x- ray generator was placed on the ground, whereas the horizonal beam was directed 625 mm over the block. For the mediolateral view, a barium paste marker awas placed on the dorsal wall from the junction of the coronetband and hair line to the distal aspect of the toe. Radiographs were transferred in DICOM format to a PACS system. bRadiographs were retrieved using a DICOM viewercto measure soft tissue and break-over distances. To increase ef ciency, the radiographs were printed out and the angle measurements were done with a protractor. All measuring was done by one author. Physical Evaluation of the Foot After the shoes are removed or on the bare foot, the solar surface of the hoof is evaluated about the center of rotation -third phalanx line of action (COR-P3 LOA). This is a point just distal to the central frogsulcus at the rst bend of the bars (Fig. 1). The physi- ology of the COR-P3 LOA is beyond the scope of this paper, but its relevance is important as it appears that hoof growth and compression occur about thispoint. This is clearly visible when evaluating the solarsurface of the hoof, and unpublished data of veno- grams show lack of perfusion along this line (Fig. 2). The COR-P3 LOA bisects the dorsal and palmarplanes of the hoof. When reversed, the distance from the COR-P3 LOA to the palmar extent of the central frog sulcus at the heel bulb will estimate the solarmargin of P3. 8Hoof capsule extending 20 mm beyond this point may be considered distorted as normalhoof -lamella width has been recorded as 15 to 20 mm. 9 The Frog The ventral plane of the frog can give an estimate as to the ventral plane of P3. The angle of the central frog sulcus can give an estimate of the palmar angle of P3when evaluated to the hoof plane and its relationship to the ventral plane of the frog. 10Hoof wall and sole dorsal to the COR-P3 LOA that is growing in a lower angle plane than the ventral plane of the frog can create amechanical wedge to the foot, which shifts weight to the low side of the hoof. 11Probing the depth of the apex o ft h ef r o ga n ds o l ec a nb eu s e dt oe s t i m a t es o l ed e p t h at the apex of P3 (Fig. 3).12Healthy feet on a light breed horse should have a minimum sole depth of 15 to18 mm. 13The length of the frog from its apex to its wid- est part can be used as a guide for dorsal wall length during trimming or as a guideline for adequate hoof.14 The digital cushion/frog (DCF) can be palpated or meas- ured with a set of calipers for depth. Normal variationsin DCF depths have been estimated to be between 50 and 70 mm. 15Healthy heels should extend to the ground surface depth of the frog as described above. Evaluating the Mediolateral and Palmarodorsal Planes of the Hoof The mediolateral (ML) and palmarodorsal (PD) planes on the solar surface of the hoof can be Fig. 2. A venogram of a laminitis case demonstrates lack of per- fusion dorsal to COR-P3 LOA. Fig. 1. The COR-P3 LOA exits the hoof just distal to the central frog sulcus.

To use the T square, hold the leg in the nor- mal shoeing position, allowing the pastern to hangfree. The long arm of the \"T\"with the tendon stay is positioned mid-cannon over the tendon bundleas the short arm of the \"T\"is slid up to the solar surface of the hoof to the heels (Fig. 4). Evaluationof the mediolateral balance of the foot is madehere, noting the length or lack of hoof to the ven-tral plane of the frog. The palmarodorsal balance is evaluated in two planes from the COR-P3 LOA. With the foot flexed toward the \"T,\"the short arm of the T square is slid dorsally to the point of theCOR-P3 LOA. From this view, the direction ofbreak-over at the toe and excess hoof above thehorizonal plane of the \"T\"can be visualized. In the mediolateral plane, the foot is balanced to the \"T\" when the solar surface of the hoof stays level tothe \"T\"as the foot is flexed toward it from heel to toe. In the palmarodorsal plane, the hoof is bal-anced when both the palmar and dorsal planes arelevel to the \"T\"with the dorsal plane slightly lower creating a cranial radius. Evaluating the Craniocaudal Balance of the Foot The craniocaudal balance of the foot can be evaluated by measuring the hoof-pastern axis (HPA) of that leg with a goniometer.dTo measure: Posture the leg withthe cannon bone at 90\u00b0 to the ground with the pasternextended in the weight-bearing position by lifting theopposite leg. Place the goniometer on the dorsal crest of the hoof with 1 arm extending distally from the cor- onet band and the other arm extending proximally from the coronet in a parallel line to the dorsal aspect of P1. The goniometer is expressed in degrees andthe optimum reading would be a 0\u00b0 axis. Although the HPA is beyond the scope of this paper, the reason for the procedure described is that it simulates the early weight-bearing phase of the stride, whereas a bal- anced distal limb is set up for a cranial rotation of P3before full weight-bearing of the leg. The HPA has a direct relationship to the palmar angle (PA) of P3; a 2\u00b0 PA increase will extend the HPA 5\u00b0. 16 Trimming and Shoeing Method 1. After evaluation of the foot as described above, any excess hoof wall in the dorsal or palmar planes about the COR-P3 LOA of the hoof is removed. If any areas in the palmar or dorsalplanes of the hoof lack suf cient depth, this area of the hoof is built up with an acrylic polymere (Fig. 5); in some cases, this may be the entire pe- rimeter of the hoof. 2. The hoof is assessed with a \"T\"square as described and evaluated for ML and PD balance to the COR- P3 LOA. The hoof is trimmed in 2 planes to the COR-P3 LOA. First the toe is rockered back to the COR-P3 LOA and then the heels are leveled pal- m a rt ot h eC O R - P 3L O Ap a r a l l e lt ot h ea n g l eo f the central frog sulcus. The hoof is viscoelastic17 and can decompress and become unlevel throughthe solar plane during the trimming process; thismay require several evaluations with the \"T\" square for ML and PD adjustments. Considerationto the ventral depth of the foot is maintained through the trimming process. The radius of the 2- plane trim may allow some PA adjustment as the Fig. 3.

After the foot is trimmed or reconstructed as needed, the HPA is evaluated with the goniome- ter. The goniometer allows an easy and ef cient way to monitor the HPA on the \"shoeing floor. \"If the weighted HPA is a negative (broken-back) angle, each 5\u00b0 increment will require a 2\u00b0 adjust-m e n tt ot h es h o eo rs h o ep a c k a g e .I ft h ef o o tmeasures positive (broken-forward), the foot isnot corrected to a 0\u00b0 HPA as this could add ten-sion to the flexor tendon-muscle unit. 4. Rocker mechanics are employed in each shoe. The ground surface of the shoe on the leadingedge is beveled with a hammer and the footsurface is rockered into a cranial radius as dic-tated by the 2-plane trim. The goal is to placethe mechanics of break-over halfway betweenCOR and the line of action of the apex of P3.This is about the widest part of the foot and of-ten referred to as the center of pressure (COP). 5On a foot that needs a degree increase, an aluminum degree shoe can be used by itself or with degree pads. Degree pads up to 3\u00b0 canusually be added to a steel shoe without add-ing too much weight to the foot. The decision touse an aluminum or steel shoe depends on thequality of the hoof and the weight of the shoe-pad package. The speci cd e g r e ei n c r e a s ei s determined by calculating the amount of cor-rection needed as indicated by measuring theHPA with the goniometer (Fig. 6).

SD on a light breed horse should have a minimum of 15 to 18 mm.13Sole depth is deemed adequate when it approximates a healthy HL distance.15 4. An appropriate HD measurement should be equal to a healthy SD measurement plus what additional hoof mass is necessary to provideadequate PA for that foot. 5. The BA plus the PA equals the DBA, which is the same angle as the HA. The PA can befrom 2\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 in a sound horse. 20 6. BO of the hoof or shoe is in the line of action of the apex of P3. 7. The angle difference between the LOAT and COR is at 0\u00b0 (Fig. 8). When the LOAT is divergent from COR, a moment arm is created about that joint.21 Fig. 8. Lines of action within the foot.

Results The preshoeing radiograph data show that the CE-EC distance ranged from 0 mm to 15 mm, with a mean (SD) of 3.33 (4.34) mm, and 7 of the 18 feet (39%) had a 0-mm distance. Postshoeing, the CE-EC reduced to mean (SD) of 1.38 (3.35) mm, and 15 of the 18 feet (83%) had a 0-mm distance. Preshoeing, the mean (SD) proximal HL distance was 17.94 (1.84) mm, with a mean 1.08 mm greater than 25% PC (16.86 mm, SD 1.23). Postshoeing, the mean (SD) proximal HL was 17.22 (1.43) mm, with a mean .53 mm greater than 25% PC (16.69 mm, SD 1.11); this is a mean reduction of .55 mm. The preshoeing BO distance ranged from 6 mm to 51 mm, with a mean (SD) of 30.77 (13.27) mm. Postshoeing, the BO distance ranged from -11 mm to -25 mm, with a mean (SD) of -19.55 (3.96). These data suggest that the reduction of the BOleverage has a signi cant effect on the dorsal proximal placement of P3 and laminar leverage. Preshoeing, SD at the apex of P3 was a mean (SD) of 18.38 (7.22). Post-trimming and shoeing, SD was a mean (SD) of 15.77 (25% PC 16.69), with.92 amean (SD) of 24.72 (6.87) mm. Preshoeing, PA was a mean (SD) of 4.83\u00b0 (5.91\u00b0). Postshoeing, the PA was a mean (SD) of 8.94\u00b0 (4.30\u00b0). PA increase was a mean(SD) of 4.16\u00b0 (3.5\u00b0).

Discussion Current balance methods promote equal weight- bearing about COR.22The COR-P3 LOA is a new concept that incorporates the biomechanics of the foot rather than just a static view of the footthrough COR. The COR-P3 LOA divides the footinto 2 planes about the cof n joint. From the COR- P3 LOA, the solar surface of the hoof can beevaluated for ventral depth and mediolateral and Fig. 10.

This appears to be more accurate than simply sighting the solar plane of the hoof without a visual reference;23evidence of this was re flected in the CJT data (Fig. 10). Because of the viscoelastic nature of the hoof, it often deforms through the COR-P3 LOA, which requires several evaluations with the T square and adjustments witha rasp during trimming. The length of the frog as a guide for dorsal wall length is effective for retain- ing adequate sole depth under the apex of P3. Postshoeing radiographs had an average SD within 1 mm of optimum depth. Postshoeing radiographs also show that the parameters described above for the ventral depth of the DCF were adequate for the hoof palmar to the COR-P3 LOA. The HPA has a direct connection to the PA, which positions the LOAT-COR. Rather than just avisual assessment, measuring the HPA with a go- niometer can increase the accuracy for manage- ment decisions and shoeing prescriptions (Fig. 11). The DBA-HA angle from the LM radiograph can be added to the HPA measurement for further accu- racy. The rocker trim and shoe add \"mechanics \"to the foot. This allows the DDFT to rotate the foot about the DIP joint without excessive ground reac- tion forces (GRF). The mechanics of the rocker shoe moves the break-over radius palmar to the apex of P3, reducing GRF on the dorsal foot while still sup- porting the dorsal hoof wall. Previous literature has placed optimal break-over at 6 mm dorsal to the apex 24Break-over leverage dorsal distortion ofthe dorsal hoof,15with maximum values close to the coronary band.25Evidence of this was recorded as a reduction in the CE-EC distance and proximal HL zone postshoeing using \"rocker\" mechanics. Although further investigation is needed, this isbelieved to be signi c a n ta si tm a yr e l a t et ot h e perfusion and integrity of the dorsal coronary, lam- inar, and solar plexuses. The use of wedges with a flat shoe can further weaken the heels in a foot with a low palmar angle.26A properly placed rocker shoe may mitigate heel compression as it relieves the GRF palmar to the COR-P3 LOA.27 A comprehensive evaluation/trimming/shoeing system can produce successful results in improvingthe balance and function of the distal limb. The goals of the system can be veri ed radiographi- cally. Using speci c anatomical ures the palmarodorsal, mediolateral, and craniocaudal planes and the ventral depth of the foot can increase communication between veterinarians, farriers, and horse owners for management of the equine foot.Acknowledgments Funding Source Radiographic studies were funded by Mrs. Susan Cheney through the Equine Podiatry Education Foundation.

Introduction Needs exist for characterization of normal ultra- sonographic proximal SL (PSL) cross-sectional area(CSA) in speci c characterization of subtle PSL changes, and understanding SL mor-phology change from work-related stress. The objec-tives of this study were to establish normal-anglecontrast ultrasonographic PSL CSA in PSL diseases' impact on $LTE. It was hypothe- sized that in cutting horses, SL morphology changeoccurs, and this impacts $LTE. 2. Materials and Methods Prospectively, ultrasonographic examination of alllimbs in 110 two-year-old cutting horses was performedand repeated two years later. An equine radiologistgraded entire examinations and CSA measurementsat select locations were compared over time. Indi-vidual 's National Cutting Horse Association $LTEwere analyzed by PSL abnormality number, location,and development over time. 3. Results In total, 267 examinations were evaluated. Forelimband hindlimb normal CSA by zone were established.The prevalence of abnormal limbs increased betweentime points, forelimb abnormalities were moreprevalent than hindlimb abnormalities, and osse-ous attachment abnormalities were more prevalentthan ligament abnormalities. No differences wereseen in CSA changes over time and impact on $LTE. 4. Discussion This study establishes normal PSL CSA in cutting horses using angle contrast ultrasonography, providesinformation on the response of the SL to training, andallows better ultrasonographic characterization ofPSL lesions.

Introduction Striations are present on ultrasonography of the inter- mediate patellar ligament, which can be confusedwith tears. Comparison to the contralateral limb is of-ten performed to help differentiate anatomic variationfrom pathologic change. The purposes of this studywere to describe the striation patterns in Warmbloodsand Quarter Horses, determine if these patterns arebilaterally symmetric, and compare striation charac-teristics between Warmbloods and Quarter Horses. 2. Materials and Methods The intermediate patellar ligaments of six Warmbloodhorses and six Quarter Horses, free from substantialhindlimb lameness and in full work, were examinedultrasonographically. Striation pattern, striation num-ber, and the cross-section areas were comparedbetween Warmbloods and Quarter Horses. Striationpattern was also recorded and compared to the leftand right limb of each horse. 3. Results T h e r ew e r en os i g n i cant breed differences, and a par- allel pattern was the most common pattern type. Twothirds of the horses in this study had bilaterally sym-metric patterns within the distal aspect of their inter-mediate patellar ligaments, while one-third of thepopulation were asymmetric. 4. Discussion These results show that comparison to the contralat-eral limb during ultrasonography to determine ifchanges within the intermediate patellar ligamentare normal striations versus tears may lead to mis-diagnosis in one-third of horses, regardless of breed.Other signs of pathology on ultrasonography shouldbe used instead.

Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) in the cervical region is a com- mon source of pain in horses. It has been linked tomultiple performance-limiting conditions. Diagnosisof OA can be made with radiography but ultraso-nography is often used to identify more clinicallyrelevant changes such as increased effusion, jointcapsule thickening, and/or osteophytosis. The abilityto accurately grade effusion with ultrasound has notbeen well evaluated. The goal of this project was todetermine the accuracy of grading of effusion withultrasound. 2. Materials and Methods Five cadaver necks were graded for cervical t h el e f ta n dr i g h ts i d eb yo p e r a t o r1 .As e c o n do p e r a t o rthen injected the cervical facets with 0, 2, or 4 mL of a50/50 mixture of positive contrast solution and waterin a randomized manner. The rst operator returned and scanned the cervical facets and assigned a neweffusion grade to the facet joints. The cervical speci-mens underwent a baseline computed tomography(CT) scan as well as a postinjection CT scan. Effusionscores were compared between ultrasound and CT aswell as between preinjection and postinjection. 3. Results and Discussion Ultrasound resulted in signi cantly lower scores (P<.0001) than CT for both pre- and postinjection assessments.

Introduction Ultrasonography is a common diagnostic imaging tool for equine musculoskeletal disease in the eld as well as in clinical settings.1Many ultrasound machines h a v et h eo p t i o nt ou s ep o w e rD o p p l e r( P D ) ,b u tf o rmany veterinarians, the use of Doppler seems to belimited to use in echocardiography, 2and less so for musculoskeletal imaging. PD is a form of Doppler that analyzes the total strength of the returning echoes and ignores the direc-tion of flow. A color map of the Doppler shift is created where the hue and brightness of the displayed colorrepresent the velocity of flow within the vessel. PD can detect very low-velocity blood flow 3and is 3 times more sensitive than color Doppler in doing so.1 PD can consistently demonstrate blood flow in smaller vessels (hyperperfusion) associated with mus-culoskeletal in flammatory disease and can provide a useful adjunct to grayscale sonographic examination.The use of PD can increase the speci city of an ultra- sound examination by helping to differentiate vasculartissue from other types of tissue debris (blood clot,brin) and effusion. Increased perfusion is usually evi- dent in the vicinity of tendon injury and within thearea of tendonitis. 1However, as with ultrasonography in general, applicability is highly operator dependant.4 In human medicine, the use of PD in musculoskel- etal imaging is more common than in veterinarymedicine. PD is widely used to evaluate synovial inflammation and shows to be positively and signi - cantly correlated to disease severity.5It was initially used in rheumatology as a tool for detecting increasedblood flow in a joint as an indicator of active arthritis, where active arthritis is de ned as a higher state of metabolism in the joint associated with release of cyto-kines and other infl ammatory mediators. In human medicine, data show active in flammation is related to pain and other symptoms in a patient, while chronic,inactive in flammation may have a similar appearance on radiographs and grayscale ultrasound but less asso-ciation with pain. PD has also shown utility for usein imaging of tendons and ligaments to assess the amount of blood flow in and around these structures. Interestingly, PD imaging of equine tendinopathy and sclerosing therapy is seen as a possible model for human tendinopathy, 6and PD imaging for musculo- skeletal pathology in human orthopedic medicine has b e e ns h o w nt ob eav e r yr e l i a b l et o o lt oe v a l u a t es o f t - tissue hyperemia in tendons and ligaments.7 In equine medicine, PD is an emerging eld in ultra- sonographic of of equine ligament branches was able to identify increased vascular activity in 22 of 35 horses with pathology of the suspensory ligament, while no increased vascular signal was observed in normal horses.10PD scores were NOTES 444 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMAGING: SCANS, SESAMOIDS, AND SUBCHONDRAL CHANGESsubjectively higher in suspensory ligament branches of lame limbs and in branches with more severe grayscale changes. Findings supported the useof PD as an adjunctive cularization is present, as with tendon degeneration,PD can identify and characterize the extent of new ves-sel formation in the tendon tissue. Intratendinous vascu-lar activity is not detectable within normal tendons. 12,13 In the last 16 years, the authors 'practice incor- porated PD imaging in their ultrasonographic examsof tendons and ligaments after a human radiologistmade the author aware of this possibility. Since 2010,PD imaging has also been used to assess the syno- vium of several joints and assess capsular or pericap- sular blood flow. 4,5 With more literary evidence emerging about the value of PD imaging in equine ultrasonography,the authors feel con dent that there is utility for PDndings to aid in a more accurate diagnosis when performing ultrasonography of equine ten-dons, ligaments, and joints. It does not take muchlonger to complete an ultrasonographic exam witha short addendum for imaging the same structures of interest with PD. The PD observations may improve accuracy of the diagnosis and assist withevaluation of the momentary status of in flamma- tion of the observed structure. 13 2. Materials and Methods In the authors 'practice, PD imaging is performed on nearly all musculoskeletal cases with ligament and ten-don injury (since 2005) and often for joint evaluation(since 2010). With a caseload approaching 500 cases ayear, 80% of which is musculoskeletal (specialty sports medicine and rehabilitation), the total number of PD examinations for musculoskeletal imaging that havebeen performed in the authors 'practice is estimated at approximately 6000 cases. Preparation for PD ultraso- nography does not differ from the usual ultrasound preparation. For imaging super cial structures, a linear transducer capable of 8 to 12 MHz is used, while fordeeper structures, a convex transducer at 3 to 8 MHz ispreferred. Imaging of structures within the hoof capsule from in between the hoof bulbs is best performed using a microconvex transducer at 8 to 11 MHz. 14a For imaging with the linear transducer and the microconvex transducer, the haircoat should be clippedwith a #40 blade and skin washed with soap and water to remove any grease that may interfere with sound transmission and returning signals. When using theconvex transducer, spraying the haircoat with alcohol isgenerally suf cient for adequate imaging, though the presence of hair may impede Doppler interrogation. 14A contact ultrasound gel is used in all examinations.Echolucent standoff pads may also impede Dopplerinterrogation slightly and should be used only when necessary. Any ultrasonographic examination starts with the complete imaging of the subjected structure in mu-ltiple orientations and, when needed, with speci c angles before imaging the same structure with PD. This makes evaluation of structures easier as part of the computing power of the ultrasound machine isused to produce the Doppler image, which may lead toloss of grayscale resolution during Doppler evaluation.Therefore, routine imaging is performed rst with optimal settings to evaluate the structure(s) in detail,and then imaging is repeated with optimal settingsf o rP Di m a g i n go ft h es a m es i t e s . 1Gain settings for imaging while using PD should be around 50% ashigher settings will saturate the image with too muchcolor to be of diagnostic value. Increasing pulse repeti-tion frequency and using a small eld of view will improve detection of vessels. Decreasing B-mode gainmay improve detection of blood flow as well. Motion of the horse, ultrasound transducer, or the operator willresult in aliasing artifacts (Fig. 1). Sedation of thehorse and a sitting position of the operator while imaging lower extremities will facilitate \"motionless \" imaging, while supporting the imaging hand with a pillow or the other arm may make imaging of thethoracolumbar facet joints easier. Too much pressureon the transducer will collapse smaller vessels in theobserved area (less flow is detected due to operator error). Similarly, increased vascularity of distal limbstructures can be appreciated in a non-weight-bearingposition when compared with weight-bearing stanceas vessels are somewhat compressed with weightbearing. The effects of vasoconstrictive and vasodila-tory sedatives on the vascularity of these structureshave not been assessed. As with any ultrasound exam, split-screen imaging of the similar structures in the affected and contralaterallimb with grayscale imaging as well as PD is preferredin the authors' practice to assess the condition observed. The ultrasonographer must realize that after exercise,the vascular activity of any given structure mayincrease. Conversely, vascularity may decrease withdecreased ambient temperature or recent cold therapy.The effect of other commonly administered therapiessuch as laser, pulsed electromagnetic eld, theraplate, etc. on vascularity of injuries detectable with PD hasnot been assessed. Performing the PD imaging proce-dure might best be done before exercise or after a settime following exercise to get an accurate sense of basalblood flow. In the authors 'experience, differences in blood flow between the contralateral structures may be more apparent after exercise, when an increase in flow on the affected side might be augmented by work. A general rule is to not change conditions during se- quential imaging. When evaluating the effect of atreatment or medication, the circumstances of each examination should be the same, like before or after work, similar ambient temperature (the hospital hasa climatized examination room), and, obviously, withthe same ultrasound machine settings. When evaluating PD activity, good understanding of the regional anatomy is imperative. Knowledge ofthe normal location of blood vessels in the observedarea is required to perform an adequate evaluation.IMAGING: SCANS, SESAMOIDS, AND SUBCHONDRAL CHANGES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 445Tendon and joint anatomy are of greatest importance. Recognizing increased blood flow in a vessel adjacent to a tendon or joint has a different impact than a dif- fuse micro flow in the tendon structure itself or a diverging vascular pattern in the synovial tissue of a joint itself. In the authors 'practice, PD has shown to be a great tool for making it possible to differentiate between several similar conditions, whereas without PD, this differentiation cannot be made easily. Differentiation Between Active and Inactive Tendon or Ligament Lesion An active lesion is a lesion in which a higher metabo- lism is present due to release of in flammatory media- tors within the tissue and increased metabolism in the tenocytes. This process is often called tendinitis.When the initial in flammatory processes have dimin- ished, a metabolically inactive stage with less in flam- mation but with persistent alterations in the tendonmatrix is referred to as tendinosis. 9 Upon initial examination of a tendon or ligament injury, PD can provide information about the vascularactivity in and around the injured structure (Fig. 2). I ng e n e r a l ,t h em o r eb l o o dfl ow that is observed in close proximity to that structure, the more in flamma- tion is likely present.1 O f t e na ne n l a r g e dt e n d o ni ss u s p e c t e do fb e i n ga cause of lameness and grayscale ultrasound showssome altered ber pattern. However, it is not evident if the lesion has vascularization/active in flammation. PD imaging can be used to demonstrate increasedvascular activity in close proximity of the lesion whenthere is more active metabolism in the tendon. Withactive tendinitis there might be increased blood flow detectable while chronic adaptation to strain mighthave led to tendon enlargement with no increase inblood flow, the latter often is not related to clinical lameness. 10-12Evaluations and diagnoses should be p e r f o r m e dw i t hc a r et oe n s u r et h a tl a c ko fD o p p l e rsignal is not due to user error, environmental factors,or incorrect machine settings. Routine monitoring ofinactive lesions is recommended in competing horsesto assess for possible reinjury and to con rm stasis. Differentiation Between Tendinitis and Tendinosis or Tendon Degeneration Acute in flammatory stages of tendon and ligament inju- ries (2 -3 weeks after injury) may exhibit increased blood flow in the adjacent structures as well as the ten- don or ligament. More chronic processes may have less blood flow in the vicinity, while degenerative processes and regions of ber disruption often demonstrate micro- vascularization within the tendon or ligament.1,6,13 Granulation tissue will also produce increased signalduring PD evaluation. Recognizing these patterns dur-ing a complete ultrasonographic examination of atendon or ligament will assist greatly in staging theprocess and developing an adequate therapy and reha-bilitation plan. Differentiation Between Active and Nonactive Synovitis When examination and radiographs indicate a small fragment in a joint, like the distal interphalangeal or Fig. 1. Artifact due to motion at the left of the image, unform color pattern in weird shapes. Compare to the right image, which is a clearly located pattern of several hues of colors, which is an adequate power Doppler image.IMAGING: SCANS, SESAMOIDS, AND SUBCHONDRAL CHANGES 446 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSmetacarpophalangeal joints, it may not be apparent if the fragment is causing reaction in the joint or if it isencapsulated and inert to the joint. Ultrasonography o ft h es y n o v i a ls t r u c t u r e st oe v a l u a t ev o l u m ea n d thickness of the synovial membrane assists in makingthis determination. PD imaging of the synovial struc-t u r e sa n dt h ea d j a c e n tj o i n tc a p s u l em a yp r o v i d ea nimpression of the amount of in flammation in the joint and potentially aid treatment decisions (i.e., medicalversus surgical; Fig. 3). As with tendon and ligament injuries, serial evaluation after exercise may be nec- essary to evaluate exercise-induced in flammation. Increasingly recognized, osteoarthritis of cervicalarticular process joints has been identi ed as a cause for behavioral issues and lameness. 14Radiography, however, may be limited to differentiate which cervi-cal articular joint(s) are causing the symptoms asmany clinically sound horses exhibit radiographic abnormalities. 15-17Doppler imaging of the articular process joints may allow for visualization of increa- sed capsular blood flow as an indication for active synovitis/capsulitis/arthritis.17Longitudinal studies are needed to further characterize the utility of PD indifferentiating between in flamed and after an initialgrayscale ultrasonographic evaluation of the cervical articular process joints correlates with other signs ofsynovitis/capsulitis/arthritis such as effusion, synovialthickening, and proliferation. On the other hand, increased vascular activity has not been appreci- ated in the authors 'practice without accompanying signs of synovial reactivity, and/or prolif-eration. Performing both imaging modalities insequence may provide a better understanding ofwhich joint(s) are experiencing active in flammation, 17 though more work is needed to assess the signi cance and reproducibility of detectable vascularity of thesesites. 3. Power Doppler and Rehabilitation of Tendon and Ligament Injuries An advantage of the use of PD can be found when directing rehabilitation after an injury of a tendon or ligament. Often, a good rehabilitation program dependson serial exams to follow the progress of the healingprocess. 18When PD is used at the outset and for each follow-up exam, changes in the pattern of blood flow can be observed over time. In general, especially withtendon and ligament lesions, during the healing of the Fig. 2. Left image shows a grayscale ultrasonogram of a lesion in the suspensory ligament attachment to the proximal sesamoid bone. The right image shows the same image with use of power Doppler, which shows increased vascular activity within the lesion. Fig. 3. The left image shows a grayscale image of the tendon sheath of the fetlock with some synovial proliferation. The right image of the same area imaged with power Doppler shows an area of increased signal in the synovial membrane and the connective tissue.IMAGING: SCANS, SESAMOIDS, AND SUBCHONDRAL CHANGES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 447injury, a decrease in PD activity can be observed over time. A sudden increase in vascular activity during rehabilitation might indicate a potential reinjury/inflammation or too high-intensity work. These ndings facilitate objective decision-making regarding progress of the rehabilitation program and can be used to adjust treatment strategies, adapt the level of exercise, and add other treatment modalities. As with any diagnostic, data from PD imaging should never be taken as the sole tool for diagnosis. A full phys-ical exam, careful palpation, and other imaging modal- ities, as well as grayscale ultrasonography, should be performed adjacent to the PD session, and all resultsshould be evaluated as a whole. Serial evaluation is im-perative to assess progression and determine stasis.Experience with the technique is required to per- form representative examinations. 4. Summary Upon completion of a standard grayscale ultrasonogra- phy evaluation, it takes only a few additional minutes to obtain PD images of regions of interest and add themto the stored sequence, with no extra costs for the provider. By performing a PD sequence at each musculoskel- etal ultrasound exam, the added information about t h ed e g r e eo fi n flammation present, relative age of the injury process, and reactivity of the observed tissuecan be incorporated to facilitate treatment and reha- bilitation strategies.

EOTRH predominately affects incisor and canine teeth and, less com-monly, the premolar and molar dentition. It is charac- terized by external odontoclastic tooth resorption of the reserve crown, crown and apex of the tooth, andosteoclastic resorption of surrounding areas of the al-veolar bone, as well as occasional progressive prolifera- tion of irregular cementum. The severity of EOTRH increases with advancing age, with most clinically affected horses being 15 years or older; however, moderate to severe radiographicchanges have been identi ed in horses as young as 11 years of age. 1-3The condition appears to progress mesially from the canine teeth or corner incisors, withcases typically presenting with varying stages of con-current periodontal disease. The clinical appearance usually leads to an underestimation of the condition' s severity relative to the radiologic ndings. Since tooth resorption is initially identi ed in the reserve crown or apices, early cases may be asymp- tomatic or may exhibit only subtle changes, such as tooth discoloration (Fig. 1), small pits at the gingival margins, or mild to moderate gingival hyperemia andgingival recession (Fig. 2). 4,5In contrast, horses with advanced disease often present with dysphagia, pain- ful and edematous gingivitis, suppurative gingivaldraining tracts (Fig. 2), resorptive lesions at the gingi- val margins (Fig. 3), and/or pathological tooth fracture (Fig. 4).4,5There may be concurrent bulbous enlarge- ment of the reserve crown and roots of the incisorsand, to a lesser extent, of the canine teeth. EOTRH-affected horses may show masticatory problems or dysphagia, hypersalivation, quidding, hal- itosis, biting problems, head shaking, and weight loss. Although painful, EOTRH is often asymptomatic untilperiodontal disease has become advanced. 5 Other clinical ndings include enlarged mandibular lymph nodes, calculus deposition, resorptive lesions deep to excessive calculi on canine teeth, tooth frac- ture, prominent juga (eminences on the outer surfaceof the alveolar process of the incisive bone or mandi-ble, formed by the roots of the incisor teeth that arean abnormally enlarged reserve crown and/or roots from hypercementosis), severe in flammation, gingival stulas, tooth mobility, and exfoliation, or even tooth ankylosis to the alveolar bone. 2. Materials and Methods Most commonly, owners are not aware of the presence of EOTRH and no symptoms will be reported by NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 451SURGERY AND DENTISTRYowners. Some EOTRH-affected horses will be reluc- tant to have their mouth examined as part of a physi-cal examination and are better examined after seda-tion is administered. Tapping on the incisor teethwith a metal instrument or similar can produce amarked response (compared to an unaffected horse);this can be done before or after sedation is adminis-tered. A \"carrot test \"can also be utilized, but this must be performed before the horse is sedated. Thecarrot test as termed by Dr. Chris Pearce, EquineDental Clinic, UK, shows affected horses reluctant tobite a crisp carrot with their incisors and instead pre-fer to grasp the carrot with their lips to draw the car-rot into the oral cavity to masticate using cheekteeth.

The gingiva, incisor, and canine teethshould be examined for the presence of edematousgingiva, suppurative periodontal draining tracts, frac- tured or missing teeth, resorptive lesions on the crown, and pulp exposures and bulbous enlargementof the incisors and canine teeth. 3. Radiography It is vital that good-quality radiographs are taken as EOTRH requires a radiological diagnosis, and both staging and progressive monitoring of EOTRH alsorequire the use of radiographs. The plate should be placed between the incisors. If necessary, the plate can be turned so the corner is fur-thest in the mouth in order to get as much plate avail-able for imaging as possible. A computed radiography(CR) plate can be safely placed in the mouth withoutany other form of restraint apart from sedation, but it is imperative that a direct radiology (DR) plate NEVER be placed in the mouth without sedation anda cheek tooth gag or radiolucent speculum bisecting technique (Fig. 5) is utilized to image the incisors and a 15- to 30-degree oblique view from each side of them i d l i n ei su s e dt oi m a g et h ei n t e r m e d i a t ea n dc o r n e rteeth without superimposition. 1,6In the bisecting angle technique, the x-ray beam is directed at 90degrees to an imaginary line that bisects the angleformed by the long axis of the tooth and the long axis of the lm. Canine teeth are imaged most easily using the extraoral technique. The plate is held on the side of the horse 'sf a c ea n dt h ec e n t r a lb e a mi sp e r p e n d i c u l a r to the long axis of the head. The generator is lowered15 to 30 degrees from horizontal to obtain a DV oblique view and raised 15 to 45 degrees from horizon-tal to obtain a VD oblique view. 4. Radiology EOTRH requires radiography of incisors, canines, 6 cheek teeth in order to diagnose, stage, and composetreatment options. EOTRH was thought to only affectincisor and canine teeth, but because of the increasein portability and more frequent use of digital radio-graphs, it is more commonly being identi ed in cheek teeth. It can be dif cult to differentiate the resorptive lesions of EOTRH from the normal aging process ofthe tooth. Radiological signs typically include different grades of dental resorption and hypercementosis, alveolar Fig. 6.

Hypercementosis can potentially makeresorptive lesions more dif cult to see due to super- imposition (Fig. 7). The most common type of resorption found in EOTRH-affected teeth is external replacement resorp-tion (76%) and internal in flammatory resorption (49%). In one study, tooth resorption occurred in of cases and hypercementosis occurred in 34% ofcases. 2External replacement resorption is evident radiographically as a gradual disappearance of theperiodontal ligament space with progressive replace-ment of root tissues by the surrounding alveolar bone.In horses, the tooth most frequently affected by exter-nal replacement resorption (in both the maxilla and mandible) is the canine and corner incisor tooth, fol- lowed by the intermediate and central incisor tooth. 2 External in flammatory resorption is seen radiologi- cally as alveolar bone loss and a widened periodontalligament secondary to in flammatory conditions. The tooth most frequently affected (in both the maxillaand mandible) by external in flammatory resorption is the central incisor tooth, followed by the intermediateand corner incisor tooth. 2 5. Discussion Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hyperce- mentosis is more commonly being recognized by veterinary practitioners as a disease affecting thedentition of the older horse. Horses suffering fromv a r i o u ss t a g e sa n dt y p e so fE O T R Hn e e dac a r e f u lassessment of their history, physical examination,neurological and pain score assessment, oral anddental examination under sedation, and radiographs to form a proper diagnosis. EOTRH requires a radio-logic diagnosis, and radiographs can easily be takenin the eld to diagnose this condition. This allows the veterinarian to properly inform the owner of thehorse 's prognosis and devise a treatment plan.

Introduction Local anesthesia for standing sinusotomy in the horse has commonly been performed using a line block; how- ever, targeted nerve blocks could also desensitize this area. The goal of this study was to determine if local anesthesia of the frontal and infra-trochlear nerves would allow creation of a frontonasal sinusotomy. 2. Materials and Methods For phase 1, a randomized cross-over study was per- formed using 6 horses to compare frontal and infra- trochlear nerve blocks to traditional line block. Mech- anical thresholds (MNT) were obtained along a proposed frontonasal sinusotomy at baseline, 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours postblocking. For phase 2, frontal and infra-trochlear nerve blocks were per- formed in 6 horses followed by creation of skin/periosteal incisions. Data from phase 1 was analyzed using mixed-model ANOVA with P <0.05. For phase 2, ability to cre- ate and close the incision were recorded, as well as sizeof the incision. 3. Results C o m p a r e dt ob a s e l i n eM N T s ,t h e r ew e r es i g n i cant increases in MNTs following line and targeted blocks (P<0.05). Skin/periosteum incisions could be performed in 5 of 6 horses and median sinusotomy size was 6.5 /C2 5c m . 4. Discussion Frontal and infra-trochlear nerve blocks could be used to create a small frontonasal sinusotomy; however, anes- thesia of the maxillary or infra-orbital nerve may be needed to desensitize the rostral aspect.

A common location is the medial femoral condyle and has been reported in horses of almost all ages and breeds. Various treatment options have been explored. Conservative treatments include stall rest and various intra-articular injections such as corticosteroids,hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or stem cells. Surgical options are multiple and include trans- condylar lag screws. Previous reports in Thoroughbreds treated with transcondylar screws did not have a long-term follow-up. The purpose of this descriptive retrospective study is to report long-term follow-up in 58 Quarter Horses presented for transcondylar screw placement in medial femoral condyle subchondral cystic lesions at 3 equine hospitals in the United States. Different variables were considered as somehorses received oral supplements and intra-articular injections. Eighty percent of sti fles had a successful outcome, which is similar to previous studies. Of 10 horses that had radiographic follow-up, there was a22% reduction in cyst size. Most sti fle changes were observed in the rst 2 years after surgery. Authors ' addresses: Alamo Pintado Equine Medical Center, 2501 cyst-like lesions (OCLLs) are described as focal radiolucent areas that have a sclerotic rim, are conicalor spherical shaped, and are usually found in the tra-becular bone at focal highly load articular surfaces. 1,2 These lesions communicate with the joint throughtracts (cloaca) of different sizes1,3-8 The cysts are tissue, brocarti- may taglandin E2, and neutral metalloproteinases, which may contribute to the maintenance, poor endogenoushealing, and expansion of the lesions.8The lack of reso- in flammatory cytokines could NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 457SURGERY AND DENTISTRYcontribute to their formation.4SCLs are the most com- mon type of OCLLs in horses. Theories regarding sub- chondral cyst formation include dietary, biomechanical, genetic, and physiological factors. The SCLs are dividedinto 2 categories: developmental (juvenile) or acquiredlesions. 6,7,9-11SCLs are most commonly detected at <2 years of age but have been reported in older horses.5 Developmental SCLs diagnosed in young horses are of-t e nd e t e c t e do ns u r v e yr a d i o g r a p h sp r i o rt ot h eo n s e to fclinical ndings. Acquired SCLs occur as a consequence of trauma or overload of the cartilage and subchondralbone. 3,6,10Several hypotheses about pathogenesis have been raised. One hypothesis states that the focal micro-damage to the trabecule exceeds reparative ability, thesubchondral bone collapses, and the cartilage barriercracks, allowing joint fluid to contact the bone, which activates monocytes, leading to cytokine ofosteoblasts. 5,12The pressurized synovial fluid may alter loading conditions of the surrounding bone and induce amechanoregulated bone adaptation response.13 Another suggests subchondral lesions are mediated by damage to the microvasculature with ensuingchondronecrosis. The osteochondral unit is composedof dral and trabecular bone, working synergistically tosupport functional loading of the joint. 14At h i r dh y - pothesis proposes that altered collagen metabolismm a yb ea nu n d e r l y i n gp r e d i s p o s i n gf a c t o r .T h eb i o m e -chanical insults may eventually result in osteochon-dral fragmentation of the articular surface or atperiarticular locations or in the formation of juvenilesubchondral bone cysts. 1A more recent theory states that bone strain is reduced within the SCL and thatenvironment could contribute to the poor bone Lamenesses caused by distal medial femoral condyle SCLs are variable in severity and often intermittent.Many treatments have been described varying fromexercise restriction, synovial and intraoperative synovial and intrale-sional injections with steroids, and transcondylarscrews placed in lag fashion. 2,15- 17Some of these treat- ments have been used sequentially; exercise restric-tion tends to be the rst choice, followed by steroid injection before undergoing surgery.5 Previous reports utilizing transcondylar lag screws are predominantly in Thoroughbreds (TBs) with veryfew Quarter Horses included. In those studies, 75% ofTB patients demonstrated an increase in SCL density and elimination of lameness, indicating that the screw 's compression helps to promote SCL resolu- tion. 18Thoroughbreds often retire from their rac- ing careers at a young age, making long-termfollow-up problematic due to horse movement, con - dentiality, and complexities in nding new owners. The prevalence of medial femoral condyle 13.6% inQuarter Horses. 2The purpose of this study is to pres- ent follow-up data in Quarter Horses that were treated with a transcondylar lag screw based on initiation oftraining, return to their activities or training, sound-ness, and in some cases radiographic assessment. Return to initial activities or training is not an ideal measurement but is the most accessible information inlong-term follow-up. 2. Materials and Methods Horses Medical records from 2014 to 2021 were compiled for 58 Quarter Horses. The horses were between 1 and 7 years of age. Each horse had a medial femoral condyle sub- chondral bone cyst that was treated with a transcondy- lar lag screw. Of the 58 horses, 38 were con rmed by the attending clinician to be lame in a rear limb. Theremainder were diagnosed on survey radiographs.Follow-up data included phone calls (47 horses), recheck radiographs (10 horses), and lameness exams (5 horses). Surgical Technique For the surgical technique, as described by Santschi et al.,2the horses were anesthetized and positioned in dorsal recumbency with the affected limb in exten- sion. Potassium IU/kg, intravenous[IV]), gentamicin phenylbutazone(4.4 mg/kg, IV) were administered preoperatively. A10-MHz linear ultrasound probe was used to examine and identify the medial collateral ligament, medial meniscus, and proximal margin of the articular pro-cess. It is important that the stifl ew a sn o tl o c k e do r in tension. Skin staples were placed cranial to the medial collateral ligament 30 mm proximal to the proximal margin of the articular process. A fourth sta-ple was placed 10 mm cranial to the medial collateralligament (MCL) and 15 mm proximal to cartilage. Insome cases, a lateromedial radiograph was used to reassure the position of the staple in relation to the craniocaudal position of the SCL. 2A 15-mm vertical stab incision was made perpendicular to the skin surfaceand soft tissues 5 mm cranial to the MCL and centered 10 mm proximal to the palpable proximal margin of the articular cartilage of the medial condyle. 2At i s s u eg u i d e and a 4.5-mm drill bit were placed proximal to themedial femoral condyle (MFC) cartilage, the center of the medial intercondylar eminence and drilled until the cyst was entered. The drill insert was then placed into the 4.5-mm glide holeand a 3.2-mm bit was used to continue the tract axially.For assessing the position of the drill bits and screw,intraoperative multiple caudal to cranial 20\u00b0 sti fler a d i o - graphs were taken. The 3.2-mm bit was then cleaned ofbone before minimally penetrating the axial aspect ofthe condyle. In some cases, biologic therapy was injectedinto the SCL before the screw was placed. The hole was measured and tapped, and a properly measured 4.5-mm cortical screw was placed and tightened. Most screwswere placed across the condyle perpendicular to theSURGERY AND DENTISTRY 458 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsagittal plane.16Routine skin closure was performed, and a layer of skin glue was placed over the sutures. Grading Lesions Lesions were graded according to a previous assessment system.19Lesion grades were as follows: grade 1 demon- strates flattening or a small defect on the subchondral bone, grade 2 is <10 mm in depth and usually has a dome-shaped lucency, grade 3 has a condylar lucency with no evidence of cloaca, grade 4 demonstrates a > 10-mm defect with a large dome extending to the articularsurface, grade 5 is de ned as a > 10-mm lucency with a narrow cloaca at the articular surface and a mushroom shape, and grade 6 is similar to grade 4 or 5 SCL with other lucencies in the caudal MFC plateau. 18,19 Protocol postoperative protocol consisted of oral phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg) the day of and 3 days af- ter surgery. Initially restricted exercise included 2 to4 weeks of stall rest, followed by hand walking for30 minutes twice a day for 2 weeks and then access toa small paddock for 30 days. After 60 days, patientswere allowed pasture exercise and returned to normal work or training at 90 days. 3. Results This retrospective study includes 58 Quarter Horses presented for transcondylar screw placement in their medial femoral condyle subchondral cystic lesions. Different parameters subdivided the group. Somecases presented bilateral lesions, and the outcome perlimb was different. Some of the criteria classi ed theinformation by stifl e (counting a total of 69) and other items were classi ed by horse (58) (Table 1). Age and Gender Distribution Patients were divided by age groups (Table 2): 16 horses were 1 year of age (28% horses, 29% sti fles), 27 were 2 years (46% horses, 45% sti fles), 5 were 3 years (9% horses, 9% sti fles), 4 were 4 years (7% horses, 7% sti fles), and 6 were 5 years or older (10% horses, 10% sti fles). The success rate on sti fles operated was 85% for 1-year- old horses, 80% for 2-year-old horses, 50% on 3-year-old horses, 100% on 4-year-old horses, and 100% on 5-year- old or older horses. These data show that the biggest population presenting for MFC SCLs is under 3 years.Of the 58 patients, 23 (39.7%) were mares and 35 (60.3%) were geldings or stallions (Table 3). Presentation and Grading Patients were classi ed by the grade of the cyst on pre- sentation and, if bilateral, right hind or left hind (Table 6). The distribution based on laterality demon- strated that bilateral presentation is less common, given that 11 horses were presented with bilateralcysts representing 19%. Distribution on horses with a unilateral SCL was very similar; 25 horses (43%) had an SCL on the left hind and 22 (38%) on the right hind(Table 4). The cystic lesions were divided by grade in each of the previously mentioned categories. A total of 69 sti fles with SCL were treated. From the 11 patients with bilateral cystic lesions (22 stifl es), 1 (4.5%) was classi ed as a grade 5 cyst, 12 lesions (54%) were grade 4 cysts, 6 (27.3%) were grade 3 cystic lesions, 2 (9%)were grade 2 cysts, and 1 lesion was grade 1 (4.5%). Of the 25 patients with left hind MFC cystic lesions, 8% (2) had a grade 5 lesion, 52% (13) had a grade 4 lesion,Table 1.

From the 22 patients with MFC cystic lesions on the right hind, 4.5% (1) had a grade 5 lesion, 77.27% (17) had a grade 4 lesion, 13.36% (3) patients presented a grade 3 lesion, 4.5% (1) patients had a grade 2 lesion,and no patients were presented with a grade 1 lesion. Follow-Up Time Of the 58 horses involved, 18 had a follow-up of a year or less and 14 (77.7%) had successful outcomes (Table5). Horses that had successful outcomes were those that at time of follow-up were back to their previousactivity level, performing at intended use or horses that were not performing but were sound on a recheck lameness exam or follow-up radiographs. Of 16 horses that had a follow-up of 1 year, the success rate was 75% (12 horses). Eight horses had a 2-year follow-up,and the result for one of them is unknown, because the horse never performed again and is used for breeding. The success rate was 87.5% for horses with a 2-year follow-up. Of the 3 horses with a 3-year fol- low-up, the success rate was 100% with all still per- forming. Six horses had a 4-year follow-up, and one of them is not performing, showing an 83.3% success onthe 4-year follow-up. Of the 6 horses that had a 5-year follow-up, 100% of them were successful, with all per- forming well. The 1 horse that had a 7-year follow-up is sound. Radiographic follow-up was recorded in 10 of the horses involved, one of them with a bilateral defect (Table 6). The mean age of this subgroup at time of surgery was 30 months, and the mean follow-up time was 12 months. All of these horses demonstrated reduction in the cysts size. The mean cyst size reduc- tion was 47%. Eighty percent of these horses returned to performance and 20% of horses had an unknown outcome. For the horse with bilateral pa-thology, on the 3-month follow-up radiographs, the cyst on the left sti fle was found enlarged and the screw had to be replaced, and the right sti fle did not present complications. Follow-up radiographs on that horse 5 months after the screw replacementdemonstrated a decrease in size on the left sti fleo f 10/C23 mm (67.9%), and in the right the cyst was completely resolved. General Distribution Of 69 sti fles that were submitted to the study, 5.8% were presented with a grade 5 cystic lesion and allhad a successful outcome, 60.9% presented 4 MFC subchondral cystic lesion with an 85.7% success rate, 24.6% sti fles had a grade 3 lesion and 76.5%had a successful outcome, 7.2% had a grade 3 lesionwith a 100% success rate, and 1.5% had a grade 1lesion and a successful outcome. Supplements and Other Treatments Another category considered was use of supplements during or after surgery and how this affected the out- come. The population that received supplements had ei-ther Platinum Performance Osteon a (natural zeolite)and or Platinum polyglycans injected, stem cells inj-ected, and Adequan. Patients that did not receive anykind of supplements represented 62.1% (36 horses) ofthe total population. Of these 36 unsupplementedhorses, 88.8% had a successful outcome, 8.3% did nothave a successful outcome, and for the remaining 2.7%,the outcome is unknown. Of the 14 (24.1%) patientsthat received Platinum Performance CJ and Osteon,92.5% had successful outcomes, and for 1 horse, theresult was unknown. The horse that had an arthroscopyand received PRP had a successful outcome. The nal result on the horse that received proteoglycan isunknown. One horse received stem cell injections andthe result was successful. The horse that had Adequaninjected was sound. Complications Four horses (6.9%) had complications listed as failure to engage enough opposite cortex, enlargement of the cyst after screw placement, development of a tibialcyst (2 horses), and cartilage damage on the affectedjoint and osteoarthritis on the affected joint. Twenty-ve percent of this population still became sound. 4. Discussion SCLs are known to cause lameness in horses and have been identi ed in multiple locations in the forelimbsTable 6.

Equine subchondral cysts the MFC. The etiology of cystic bone lesions in horses is not well de ned. Some studies sup- port an in flammatory response, due to trauma and to impaired weightloading over the joint. This retrospec- tive study involved 58 Quarter Horses with a total of 69stifles presented for a transcondylar screw placement in medial femoral condyle subchondral cystic lesions. Datashow that most Quarter Horses presenting with MFCSCL are under 3 years of age and the age range is morevaried than reported in other breeds. Previous studiesreport that the development of SCL is more common inhorses 2 years of age, 18and when occurring in older horses, the prognosis is reduced.2,18This report shows 100% success rate on 4-year-old patients and older than5 years compared to 85% success on horses that are1 year old and 80% on horses that are 2 years old at thetime of surgery, although the case number is very small.The number of patients that are 4 years old and 5 years old or older cannot be considered representative because there were only 4 horses. Further research should bedone in older horses for a more reliable statistic. Eleven horses (18% of the population) presented w i t hS C Li nb o t hs t i fles, demonstrating that it is quite c o m m o nt op r e s e n tt h el e s i o ni nm o r et h a n1l i m b .N osignicant difference was shown in the distribution per limb affected. Of the 11 horses with bilateral MFCSCL, 17 of the 22 stifl es (77.3%) showed a successful outcome. The result in 1 horse with bilateral MFCSCL (9%) is unknown. Three sti fles (13.6%) had an unsuccessful outcome. Two of these horses demon-strated radiographic improvement in just 1 limb;however, both patients were sound and are back infull work. One of the horses with bilateral SCLs hadan unsuccessful outcome due to the development of atibial cyst and has been unable to return to intended activity. From a total of 69 sti fles that were submit- ted to the study, 59.4% presented a grade 4 MFC subchondral cystic lesion, with this grade the mostfrequently presented with an 85.7% success rate, and24.6% of the sti fles had a grade 3 lesion with a 76.5% rate of successful outcome. Both are considered rep-resentative samples given the number of horses pergroup. This outcome supports what has been shownin previous studies, in which 75% of the horses hadshown resolution, in that study resolution was con-sidered a resolution of the lameness and increase inradiographic density. 20Of horses with unsuccessful outcomes, 2 developed a tibial SCL within the rst year of follow-up (4 and 10 months) after the trans-condylar screw placement. None of these showedobvious signs of osteoarthritis on radiographs. The horse that developed a tibial cyst at 10 months was a mare with bilateral MFC SCLs. There are reports ofcases that developed together SCL. 4,13This was a nding on postmortem examination on horses that were previously treated medically for an MFC SCLin which the medial tibial condyle SCL was describedas and lined with brous tissue that contained yellow gelatinous material. 4A recent study suggeststhat damage to the articular surface of the medialfemoral condyle could cause an adjacent lesion in the opposing tibial condyle by abrasion or repetitive trauma, subsequently promoting formation of a tibialSCL. 4Four types of tibial SCLs have been described. SCLs that affect the lateral condyle of the tibia havebeen described in young horses as well as of osteochondrosis, whereas SCLs affectingthe medial tibial condyle are observed in older horseswith evidence of osteoarthritis and have been relatedwith poor prognosis. Other described but less com-mon cystic lesions are in the intercondylar eminenceand in the distal tibial epiphysis. One horse with anunsuccessful outcome had an enlargement on the cyst.Further investigation would be required to determinethe cause of the enlargement. Gender was a subdivi-sion in the attempt to see its impact on the outcome.In total, 73.9% of mares and 88.57% of geldings or stal-lions had a successful outcome. This does not make astatistical difference, and it can be supported by previ- ous research where no relation between gender and outcome is suggested. 20The percentage of success on horses without supplements was 88.9%; CJ and osteon,92.9%; 100%. This supports aprevious study that shows no evidence on supplementsinfluencing the outcome of patients that received this treatment. 20Follow-up time was another factor consid- ered. Of the 58 horses involved, 18 had a follow-up of ayear or less and 14 (77.7%) of them had successful out-comes. One of the 3 unsuccessful cases of this groupshowed improvement on the 60-day recheck and laterdeveloped a suspensory desmopathy, so the horse is notcurrently performing. Two horses in the unsuccessfulgroup developed a tibial cyst in the rst months; the remaining horse of the group is coursing his rst month postoperatively, so the postoperative recheck is pend-ing. Of the 16 horses that had a 1-year follow-up, the success rate was 75% (12 horses). Eight horses had a 2- year follow-up and the result of one of them isunknown, because the horse is currently just used forbreeding. The success rate was 87.5% for horses with a2-year follow-up; in this case, basing follow-up on hav-ing the horse back to work is not reliable, and new setsof radiographs to con rm success would be ideal. Of the 3 horses with a 3-year follow-up, the success rate was100%; 6 horses had a 4-year follow-up, and one of themis not performing. The radiographs on the rst recheck showed no reaction and the owner did not feel a com-plete improvement on the sti fle. This result shows an 83.3% success rate on the 4-year follow-up and supportsthat the radiographic follow-up is important to deter-mine the resolution of the SCL; in this case, the rst radiographic study postoperatively shows no improve-ment and the telephone follow-up supports that 6horses that had a 5-year follow-up showed a 100% suc-cess rate, with all of them still performing. The 1 horse that has had a 7-year follow-up is also performing well. This suggests that 4 years after the surgery, thelikelihood of having changes in the outcome is lower.On the other hand, the shorter timed follow-upSURGERY AND DENTISTRY AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 461changes occurred, as the 2 horses that developed tibial cysts did so on the rst year of follow-up. These results suggest that a yearly radiographic follow-up in the rst 2 years after surgery should be suggested. The ra- diographic follow-up recorded in 10 of the horses involved, one of them with a bilateral defect (Table 7),demonstrated a mean 47% reduction in cyst size, and the horse that had less improvement had a 22% decrease on cyst size. This result can be supported byprevious reports where 100% of cases with radio- graphic follow-up have at least a 50% decrease in cyst size. 2,16The mean follow-up time on these horses was 1 2 m o n t h s ,a n dt h em e a na g ea tt h et i m eo fs u r g e r ywas 30 months. In just one of the cases with a bilateral defect, the cyst was resolved after an 8-month follow- up; in this case, a screw replacement was necessary onthe left stifl e as the cyst was getting enlarged, and the right side kept recovering favorably. 5. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that MFC SCLs are more frequent in Quarter Horses aged 1 to 3 years old. All 58 horses that were part of the study underwenttranscondylar screw placement, making a total of 69 stifles. In total, 79.7% of sti fles had a successful out- come, which is similar to previous studies; 11.6% of sti- fles had an unsuccessful outcome; and 2 horses from this group had an unsuccessful outcome due to the de- velopment of a tibial subchondral cyst. The results sup- port there is no correlation between gender andlikelihood of developing MFC SCLs. An interestingpoint that has been shown in this study is that most changes in the outcome of patients treated with a trans- condylar screw are seen the rst 2 years after surgery. It also supports previous studies that have shown thatno relation is observed between supplements adminis- tration and the outcome. The 10 horses that had a radi- ographic follow-up had at least a 22% reduction in cystsize, with a mean of 47%. These results are encouraging because they demonstrate that cyst size reduction is achievable. The limitations of this study are theretrospective descriptive nature and the lack of stand- ardized follow-up data. It would have been valuable to acquire radiographic follow-up on all the patients involved and assessment of healing in all patients inthe study.

Definition Recurrent colic has been de ned as \"a colic episode diagnosed by a veterinary surgeon or displaying be- havioral signs of colic in the case of owner reportedcolic, on the proviso that the horse had been free fromcolic signs, eating a normal diet and passing normalfeces for a full 48 h since the end of the previous colicepisode. \" 1,2The frequency of colic episodes leading to a horse being diagnosed with recurrent colic has beendened as three or more transient (less than 24 hours duration) or prolonged (longer than 24 hours duration)colic episodes diagnosed within 1 month or 1 year, 3or \"two or more episodes of colic within a 6-month period of time, with at least 48 hours between colic epi-sodes. \"4Most of these de nitions have only included horses with medically managed colic and excludedhorses with recurrent colic episodes undergoing sur-gery. Recurrent colic has also been called chronicintermittent colic. 5The most recent report of recur- rence was 50 colic events per 100 horse years at risk.1 2. Causes of Recurrent Colic and Diagnostic Tests There are limitless causes of recurrent colic. In an ear-lier study of recurrent colic,3some of the more com- mon causes included lymphoma, recurrent tympanic/spasmodic colic, arteritis. someinstances, causes of recurrent colic may be apparentwhen a thorough history is obtained and with various diagnostic tests (Table 1), 6-20in the majority of horses, the cause is not identi ed. Even in horses with recur- rent displacements,21or impaction, the reasons for the recurrence are often undetermined. Most of the stud- ies completed to date have been epidemiological stud- ies focusing on management practices that tend to predispose horses to recurrent colic (Table 2).1,2,5 While addressing management factors associatedwith recurrent colic, including diet, dental prob-lems, and parasite control programs, may help some horses, there remains a population of horses with unexplained recurrent colic. These horses can become a challenge to diagnose and manage. There are several case reports and small case series published identifying histological changes in horses with recurrent colic. 7,8,16,22- 29Neuropathies neuromuscular disorders, Cajal can cause gastro-intestinal motility disorders and recurrent colic.22 More recently, recurrent colic has been associated with myenteric ganglionitis (some of these horses had lymphocytic-plasmacytic in ltration into the lamina and increased enteroglial in- testinal muscle layers,8,27inflammatory bowel dis- ease,28and decreased density of the interstitial cells of Cajal (pacemaker cells that create the bioelectrical NOTES 464 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSURGERY AND DENTISTRYTable 1.

NSAID, drugs; GI, / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSwave potentials that lead to smooth muscle contrac- tion).29As already mentioned, these are primarily case reports, and in the majority of horses with recur- rent colic, it is unknown if these histological changes exist. Intestinal biopsy is indicated to identify the aforementioned histological changes. In horseswith generalized intestinal mucosal in flammation or neoplasia, duodenal biopsy obtained via an en-doscopic approach or rectal biopsy may be useful. 30 In a recent retrospective study, however, rectal bi-opsy was found to be signi cantly less useful for obtaining a diagnosis in horses with recurrent coliccompared to a biopsy obtained via an exploratory lapa-roscopy or laparotomy. 4Similarly, another group of authors concluded that while duodenal and rectal biopsies may be useful for diagnosing in flammatory bowel disease, care must be taken with interpretation until there is more standardization of biopsy techniqueand histological scoring.31It is important to recognize that only a mucosal sample is obtained from the duo-denum and rectum, and therefore any changes in thesubmucosa and muscle layers cannot be evaluated.Intestinal biopsy is recommended in any horse under- going exploratory laparotomy with a history of recur- rent colic unless the reason for recurrent colic is read-ily apparent during surgery. Single or multiple smallfull thickness biopsies can be obtained using an 8-mm biopsy punch during laparotomy. The biopsy site can be using 3-0 or 2-0 synthetic absorbable suturein a cruciate pattern then oversewn with a Cushingor Lembert pattern. Samples can also be obtained from an enterotomy or enterectomy site; however, additional samples from distant sites would likely bemore representative of global in ltrative disease. Biopsies should be obtained early during abdominal exploration, and care does need to be taken with interpretation of intestinal biopsies taken during ex-ploratory celiotomy. Hopster-Iversen et al. reportedthat intestinal manipulation resulted in an increase in neutrophilic in flammation as well as the migration of eosinophils toward the intestinal lumen. 32Fur- thermore, there may be variation between patholo- gists in biopsy interpretation principally because the normal histological appearance of the equine intestine has not been well de ned.4Care must also be takenwith biopsy sample handling because forceps can cause suf cient damage to prevent evaluation.4One other challenge with the interpretation of histologicalndings is whether the observed changes are a cause or an effect of recurrent colic.4 In a recent study retrospectively evaluating gastro- intestinal biopsies, in flammatory cellular in ltrates (54%) and neoplasia (22%) were the most common his-tological diagnosis categories associated with recur- rent colic.4Lymphocytic-plasmacytic was the most common infl ammatory in ltrate in cases of recur- rent colic.4The relationship between recurrent colic (including colonic displacements), in flamma- tory bowel disease, management factors (including parasite control and diet), and the microbiome is an active area of research. A possible link between dysbiosis, intestinal in flammation, gastric ulcers, and stereotypic behavior (crib biting/windsucking,weaving) warrants further investigation. 3. What Can Be Done to Help These Horses and Horse Owners? Recurrent colic is a frustrating and stressful problem for owners and caregivers. Horses with recurrent colic require a complete examination including obtaining a thorough history to identify management factors that may predispose the horse to colic, complete physical ex- amination including abdominal palpation per rectum, transabdominal ultrasonographic examination (and ra- diographic examination depending on the geographical region), gastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, and rectal biopsy. Other diagnostic tests such as plasma biochem- istry pro le, peritoneal fluid analysis, and polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,or antibody titers for speci c diseases may indi- cated depending on the signalment and results ofother diagnostic tests (Table 1). Exploratory lapa- roscopy or laparotomy with intestinal biopsy is indicated if a diagnosis is not obtained with the results of the less invasive tests. Treatment can be challenging. Some diseases have fairly straightforward treatment (Table 1). However,others are more problematic. Surgical procedures such as nephrosplenic space ablation, colopexy, and colonresection should be considered in horses with de ni- tive diagnosis of speci c colonic displacements or vol- vulus. It is important that owners recognize that these surgical procedures can be extremely bene cial; how- ever, can be associated with complications and thatthey do not prevent tympanic/spasmodic colic. For example, nephrosplenic space ablation was more effec- tive for preventing nephrosplenic ligament entrap- m e n to ft h el a r g ec o l o ni nh o r s e sw i t had e nitive surgical diagnosis compared to horses with a pre-sumed diagnosis on palpation per rectum of nephros- plenic ligament entrapment. 15Management factors should always be explored (diet, housing, exercise regi-men, water source, dental care, parasite control). Corticosteroid therapy may be bene cial in some horses diagnosed with infl ammatory bowel disease;4,33Table 2. Epidemiological Findings Associated with Recurrent Colic1,2,5 Previous colic episode History of colic surgery > 8 years oldGeldings Recent change in diet [Feeding coastal grass hay] Recent change in stabling Farm density <0.5 horses/acre Dental problems Crib biting/windsucking Weaving behavior Less time at pastureSURGERY AND DENTISTRY AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 467however, long-term treatment with low-dose cortico- steroids may be necessary in horses diagnosed withlymphocytic-plasmacytic in flammation. Owners should be warned about the risks of infection and laminitis inhorses receiving corticosteroids. Cetirazine has been used to treat eosinophilic in flammation and may be used seasonally when the horse has more problemswith recurrent colic; however, the ef cacy of cetirazine has not been objectively evaluated in horses with eo- sinophilic intestinal in flammation. Bethanechol has been evaluated as a motility stimulant in horses 34-36 and may prove bene cial in management of recurrent colic. The role of dysbiosis in recurrent colic and bene t of fecal transfaunation37is another critical area of research. Unfortunately, if colic recurrence is frequent, severe, or persistent, humane euthanasia is oftenelected by owners. It is an important role of the pri- mary care and specialist veterinarian to discuss the option of euthanasia with owners. The decision for euthanasia is an individual owner decision and of- ten made based on poor response to treatment, use of the horse, perceptions of suffering, comorbidities, andnances. Recurrent colic is an important yet poorly under- stood problem in horses. Understanding the role of breed, diet, dysbiosis, and in flammation as well as the relationship between stereotypic behaviors (e.g.,crib biting), gastric ulceration, and colonic disease is an important area of research. 1,2,4,5,15,38,39Eluci- dation of underlying causes and disease processesthrough a team approach with owners, caregivers,primary and tertiary care veterinarians, and clinical researchers will hopefully lead to better manage- ment options in affected horses.

Introduction One of the most positive trends in colic surgery over the past 50 years and probably the single most critical fac-tor in improved outcomes is shortening the interval from on-farm assessment to surgical treatment. Today, trained surgeons and a well-equipped surgical hospital are within easy reach of most horses with colic, and referring veterinarians have shortened the interval to referral. However, over the last 10 years or so, the authors have independently recognized a growing incr- ease in the interval between onset of colic and surgical treatment. Many factors probably contribute to thischange, including owner misconceptions, failure of diag- nostic procedures to provide suf cient accuracy, and - n a n c i a li m p a c t .T h es h a r e dg o a lm u s tb et om a x i m i z esurvival and minimize complications and cost associ- ated with surgical treatment. Therefore, the authors are bringing this issue forward to equine practitioners to start a dialog about resolving our shared concerns.2. Role of Early Referral in Survival The main bene ts of early referral can be attributed to reduced severity of tissue injury and resulting endo- toxemia/systemic in flammatory response syndrome (SIRS) on admission.1A much overlooked bene ti s reduced complication rates (Fig. 1), which not onlyimprove survival but lower costs, increase owner satis- faction, and improve overall con dence in colic sur- gery. The bene ts of early referral are listed below: \u0081In a recent study on surgery for small intestinal strangulation in horses, horses that did notrequire resection (Fig. 2) had superior long-term survival rates than those that required resection (Fig. 3). 2I nt h es a m eh o r s e s ,t h o s et h a td i dn o t require resection had a signi cantly shorter dura- tion of colic before surgery than those that did, suggesting they were the bene ciaries of early referral.3This is a clear demonstration of the NOTES 470 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSURGERY AND DENTISTRYbenets of surgery before irreversible intestinal damage has developed. The proportion of horses that do not require resection appears on thedecline compared with the proportion treated in 1994- 2008, 2suggesting that duration of colic before referral is longer than ideal. \u0081In a study on horses with a high survival rate (86%) after surgery for large colon volvulus (LCV),a decrease in intraoperative colonic biopsy scoreby;0.5 per year was evidence of early referral and its bene ts. 4 \u0081In a study on Thoroughbred mares with LCV andan overall survival to discharge of 88%, colic dura-tion before admission was signi cantly related to survival. 5 \u0081Horses with ileal impaction can also bene t from early referral,6demonstrating an example of this bene t in a nonstrangulating small in- testinal disease. \u0081A 92% survival has been reported in horses treatedby closed manual reduction of an inguinal hernia, 7 compared with a short-term survival rate of 56% to 85.1% for surgical treatment.8Presumably closed manual reduction is effective shortly after disease onset, whereas surgery is required after a longerduration. \u0081In a multicenter study of horses with inguinalhernia, 69% of affected horses survived ifadmitted before 10 hours from onset of paincompared with 29% in those admitted later. 8 \u0081In 143 horses with entrapment in the epiploicforamen, 76% survived surgery performed 8 hours from onset of colic compared with 45%survival after surgery performed 12 hours af- ter onset of colic. 9 \u0081A prolonged duration of colic before referral canincrease the risk of postoperative ileus and di- arrhea after surgery. 10 \u0081A strong argument for early referral is provided by the observation that the length of small intes-tine strangulated can actually increase over timeas more is drawn into the strangulating ring, eventually leading to ileal involvement and amore complicated surgery. 11 \u0081Delays in referral can lead to distention in theintestine oral to the lesion, 12which leads to poor perfusion of that segment and adhesions. The preceding information identi es literature sup- port for the perception that a delay to surgery is harmful for a variety of different diseases, but espe-cially for those associated with strangulating lesions. These observations provide a scienti c basis to taking a closer look at how the interval from initial treat- ment to surgery can be shortened. 3. Owner Role \u2014Need for Careful Discussion Decision-making about colic surgery by owners is a critical but complex part of the referral process.13It can be fraught with confusion largely brought on by the nature of the disease, its abrupt onset that allowslittle preparation, demands for resources that are not always available (trailer, money), and limited access to emotional support from friends and family. Once aveterinarian on the farm has a concern about the pos- sible need for referral, the discussion that follows with the owner is critical. If the owner states that \"surgery is not an option, \"the groundwork for failure has been laid in many cases. This statement can presage achange of heart at a time when the prospects of a suc-cessful surgery have passed, considerable expense has been incurred, and the need for euthanasia is immi- nent. Then surgery becomes an option but involving a resection that could have been avoided earlier. Therefore, the referring veterinarian must have afrank and informed discussion with the owner about their aversion to colic surgery. The following are com- monly used explanations from owners for rejectingthe surgery option: \u0081Colic surgery is rarely successful. \u0081I would prefer to try medical treatment rst. Fig. 1. Flowchart relating delay in decision-making to prognosis and cost. Fig. 2. Segment of small intestine strangulated in an inguinal hernia that was correctly judged as not needing a resection.Reproduced from Equine Vet J with permission.SURGERY AND DENTISTRY AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 68 / 2022 471\u0081A friend 's horse died from colic surgery, and he or she was devastated by the poor outcome. \u0081The horse will never be the same after colic surgery. \u0081This is a pregnant mare, and it will be impossi- ble to save the mare and foal with surgery. \u0081This is an old horse and old horses do not han-dle anesthesia and colic surgery well. \u0081This horse is much loved/valued but we cannotjustify spending money on colic surgery in our present nancial circumstances. These concerns need to be respected as valid in the owner 's view, even if they do not apply to most cases. However, veterinarians need to create or avail of opportunities to correct these misconceptions as theyapply to colic surgery in general and prognosis speci - cally. There is growing evidence that the last explana-t i o n ,c o s to fs u r g e r y ,c a np l a yal a r g er o l ei na nowner 's decisions about colic surgery 14and could explain the growing rates of euthanasia, especiallybefore and during surgery.15The cost should not be viewed solely as the cost of surgery, but also includeexpenses incurred before referral, and both combined can be substantial if referral is delayed. The role of the referring veterinarian in handling the early decision process is critical. In a study from the United Kingdom on old horses, a group commonly affected with colic, owners stated that they relied heavily on guidance from their own veterinarian.16 This is where a team approach applies (see below). Horses have performed well after colic surgery, even achieving their intended goals, such as winningmajor stakes races and the Kentucky Derby ( \"Lil E. Tee \"). The nancial issue should be guided by accu- rate information as to the true range of costs for thesuspected disease and based on consultation with a surgeon at the hospital (see below). Owner educationto address unfounded reasons for reluctance becomesthe critical issue at this point. If the owner declines referral, the veterinarian must also establish very clear guidelines for how toproceed. At this point, the owner must be informed that if the horse has a true surgical lesion (especially small intestinal strangulation), only surgery will saveits life. Because a surgical diagnosis cannot be madedenitively in every case and if the horse \"appears comfortable, \"the owner might request continued medical case. . . . \"Medical treat- ments do not resolve surgical lesions. Euthanasia canbecome a reality at this point. Once the surgery optionis rejected, the owner must consider the following ifon-the-farm treatment is selected: \u0081What is my true nancial limit on this horse? \u0081Can I afford repeated visits to the farm for treatments? \u0081How much time can I commit to around-the- clock monitoring and care? \u0081Can I handle watching my horse suffer? \u0081Is my family supportive of this decision? \u0081Will I change my mind or stick the course? The last question is critical because if surgery becomes an option at any point, it should be selected promptly, not after all other medical treatment optionsand resources have been exhausted and euthanasia isthe only reasonable choice. At that point, the cost of sur-gery will be considerable and the outcome poor. Referralto a hospital for a second opinion and for supportivecare is a reasonable option and could con rm that humane euthanasia is needed, and at reasonable cost. Fig. 3.

Challenges The major challenge with referral for surgery is diag- nosing a surgical lesion with a comfortable degree of certainty. Horses that require surgery or euthanasiabecause of a surgical lesion can have one or more ofthe following: persistent pain despite analgesic drugs,a persistently elevated or increasing heart rate ( 48 beats/min), re flux from a nasogastric tube, worsening abdominal distention, abnormal rectal examination ndings, obvious abnormality on ultrasound examina- tion, and belonging to a high-risk group (see above). However, many of these changes might not develop,even in horses with strangulating lesions, and somehorses might only have subtle pain indicators (nostriltension and flare, facial grimace, and abrasions on bony prominences). The approach to diagnosis should be predicated on acceptance that an approach with a high degree ofdiagnostic sensitivity might be preferable in the farm setting to seeking a high degree of diagnostic speci c- ity. 17High sensitivity means that many horses that could be treated at home will be referred. However, overzealous pursuit of diagnostic accuracy mightleave more horses with surgical lesions on the farmand delay referral. This is the error that leads to theworst outcomes. 5. Role of Risk Factors in Diagnosis Often overlooked in the diagnostic approach are sim- ple features in the signalment that provide strong diagnostic clues as to what type of surgical lesion isinvolved (Table 1). If other ndings t with the possi- ble \"at-risk \"diagnosis, as with lipoma (see below), the odds of that disease being responsible for colicincrease accordingly. However, it is important not toxate on any particular diagnosis, which may be wrong. 6. Strangulating Lipoma Old horses have similar types of colic as young horses, b u tt h e ya l s oh a v et h e i ro w nm o r el e t h a la n dc o m m o n disease, strangulating lipoma (horses 10 years).18This age/disease link is so well established,18with increasing risk due to increasing age, that an old horse with colic should be considered as having a strangulating lipoma until proven otherwise. Unfortunately, these horses arethe most likely victims of delayed decisions about sur- gery. They are already at the end of their life span, and many of them have comorbidities (lameness, pi- tuitary pars intermedia dysfunction, and laminitis) that might tilt the decision against surgery. Manyhave earned a strong degree of emotional worth but have passed their prime for athletic activity. If dis- tended loops of small intestine are found on rectal ex-amination or on ultrasound examination, with or without re flux through a nasogastric tube, or with abrasions on bony prominences, this horse mostlikely has a strangulating lipoma. Sadly, this is the horse likely to be denied surgery because of the myth that old horses cannot handle an- esthesia and surgery well. They can and should not bedenied surgery for this reason only. 19Old horses tend to be stoic,19which can create a false impression of responding well to medical treatment. Some of thiscould be a breed effect (e.g., Tennessee Walking Horses), but all horses with a strangulating lesion can also become obtunded by endotoxemia. These can mis-lead lay handlers to an impression of a mild or resolv-ing disease. As with all horses with small intestinalstrangulation, these horses also develop a vacuum-packed large colon, which creates the erroneousimpression on palpation per rectum that they have a large colon impaction, a nonsurgical disease. This nding is actually a tip that small intestinal strangu- lation is the primary lesion. 7. Abdominocentesis Peritoneal fluid changes, such as serosanguinous dis- coloration and elevated lactate, develop early in intestinal ischemia. 20Although easy to per- form, abdominocentesis at home for horses thatcould be candidates for surgery delays referraland increases cost. Abdominocentesis might havea place if the only option is euthanasia. The fol-lowing limitations should be considered beforeusing this procedure: Abdominocentesis in the eld is easy to perform and point-of-care testing for lactate might enhance itsdiagnostic value. However, any data from abdomino-centesis can be dif cult to interpret and equivocal ndings are common and can delay referral. The Table 1.

Reassessment of Intravenous Fluid Therapy Although intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is a necessary and life-saving treatment for horses in cardiovascular shock, many horses with signs of severe colic are not in cardiovascular shock. In horses with ischemic lesions,delays, complications, and costs associated with fluid therapy on the farm are harmful when balanced againstthe bene ts of early referral. Similar concerns apply to continuous rate infusions on the farm (e.g., lidocaine). In the authors' opinion, instituting IV fluids for horses with surgical colic at a hospital is suf cient and minimizes some of the risks of aggressive fluid therapy before referral, such as: \u0081High-volume fluid therapy can actually produce a misleading degree of improvement that only confuses owners and delays referral. \u0081High-volume fluid therapy can create electrolyte imbalances through sodium diuresis that creates other electrolyte abnormalities (calcium, magne- sium). 22Some of these changes can delay postop- erative recovery and reduce survival. \u0081Time required for administration of fluids and to monitor responses is time that allows progressionof the disease and tissue injury. Consequently, the ischemic changes can become irreversible, and the more proximal distended segments will probably ll with much of the fluid-infused IV. This only adds to proximal intestinal distention and mural edema, critical factors that increase pain and delay recovery. 23 \u0081There is a growing awareness that aggres-sive fluid therapy can actually cause adverseconsequences for recovery of intestinal function. This can be mediated through damage to the vascular endothelium that exacerbates trans-capillary fluid leakage and tissue edema. 24 \u0081In a clinical study in horses with small intestinalstrangulation, a more restricted goal-directedapproach to fluid therapy had similar survival and complication rates as the traditional liberalfluid therapy. 25 \u0081Fluids given IV at the surgical facility are suf - cient to prepare the horse for surgery. 9. Treatments and Diagnostic Procedures Repeated at the Hospital This can become a contentious issue with many owners. Although applying diagnostics and treatments on the farm is well intentioned, many of the same procedures have to be repeated at the surgical facility to justify the decision for the next option -surgery or euthanasia. Owners regard this as an unnecessary additional cost, arguing that their veterinarian already did the same. Unfortunately, some information might be missing or some indicators could have changed during the interim. Possibly, warning owners of this beforehand might pre- pare them to accept this necessity. 10. Teamwork Decision-making about colic referral is complicated for owners,13and therefore a team approach is recom- mended, which starts with the owner, trainer (or manager), and referring/primary veterinarian. If clini- cal signs in any way suggest a surgical treatment is indicated, but owner reluctance persists, a surgeon at the hospital that would receive the referral should be consulted to provide a reasonable overview of cost and prognosis. The decision that surgery is or is not an option should be based on solid facts that could be pro- duced by frank discussion with all involved. The goal is not to change the owner 's mind but to prevent a fatal change of course when the window for a success-ful surgery has passed. 11. Recommendations The referral process could be regarded on the most ba- sic clinical level as needing a second opinion for a horse that does not t within the typical colic that will respond on the farm. The decision for or against surgerywhen indicated is the owner 'sp r e r o g a t i v ea n d ,i nm o s t cases, the decision they make is the correct one forthem. The problem situations are those in which thesurgery option is rejected, only to be selected later when the nonsurgical approach is clearly failing. Again, this decision is the owner 's prerogative, but should be based on a realistic understanding of cost and prognosis andwith guidance from all involved in case management. The cost of surgical treatment is substantial, and hospi- tals should review their surgical pricing system toSURGERY AND DENTISTRY 474 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSdetermine if treatment components can be \"packaged or structured \"in a way that produces a favorable cost for all. For example, \"stop \"points could be identi ed at different stages of the surgery and postoperative care, related to complexity and associated expenses (e.g., need for resection and anastomosis, development of postoperative refl ux or colic). Regardless of approach, owner education is critical to a successful outcome, andeveryone plays a role in that duty.

These ndings support more optimism toward surgical treatment of foals with SISO, and rst opinion veterinarians should be encouraged to dis- cuss favorably a surgical referral option for owners of foals with suspected SISO given these updated survival rates.

This retrospec-tive case-control study examined differences in clinicaloutcomes between adult and foal SISO patients. 2. Materials and Methods Hospital records for surgical SISO cases were collectedfrom North Carolina State, Colorado State, Universityof Pennsylvania, The Ohio State University, andUniversity of California, Davis equine referral centers.Foals were 6 months of age and case-matched to adult controls between 2 to 20 years of age. GraphPadPrism software was utilized for statistical analysesusing Shapiro-Wilk normality tests, simple logisticregression, or Fisher 's exact tests when appropriate andP<.05 was considered signi cant. 3. Results Common adult lesions included strangulating lipomas(n = 36), volvulus (n = 25), and inguinal hernias (n = 10).Common foal lesions included volvulus (n = 22), intus-susception (n = 5), and mesenteric rents (n = 3). Datarevealed 25 of 41 (60.98%) foals and 75 of 105 (71.43%)adults were recovered from surgery. Of those recovered Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 476 2022 / Vol. 68 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSURGERY AND DENTISTRYfrom surgery, 24 (96.0%) foals Resection survival group ( P=. 6 ; 95% CI, 0.8- 2.7). Survival analysis indicates foal short- term survival is not signi cantly different from adults (P= .44; 95% CI, 0.5 -37.3). Long-term survival was col- lected when possible and was available for 13 adultsand 5 foals. Of 13 adults and 5 foals, 2 adults and 2foals were euthanized 1 month postoperatively Follow-up shows 84.62% adults and 60% survival in available foals, thoughthe cases available were too few for statistical analysis. 4. Discussion The results of this study demonstrate no signi cant difference in outcome of surgically treated SISO foalscompared with adults. The clinical application of suchndings supports more optimism toward surgical treatment of foals with SISO.Acknowledgments The Authors thank Emily Hellstrom for her assistance collecting long-term follow-up data.
