Have you ever experienced great confidence, autonomy, and inner drive in your life? This was likely when your solar plexus chakra was healthy, harmonious, and functioning at its optimal state. However, there are many habits, mindsets, and traumatic experiences in life that can cause your solar plexus chakra to become blocked, suppressed or stagnant. If you have experienced a strict upbringing, bullying, authoritarian parents or figures in your life, mental, emotional, sexual or physical abuse or were conditioned as a child with disempowering ideologies (such as religious, traditional or social beliefs), you likely have an impaired solar plexus chakra. This guide will help you begin your own unique process of undergoing solar plexus chakra healing. What is the Solar Plexus Chakra? The solar plexus chakra, or Manipura, is the center of our willpower, self-esteem, and energy of transformation. Located about six inches above your belly button within your diaphragm, the solar plexus chakra is associated with the color yellow and the element of fire. This chakra is responsible for regulating the energy associated with action, intention, identity, and vitality. What is Solar Plexus Chakra Healing? Solar Plexus Chakra healing is the practice of opening, clearing, cleansing, supporting, and strengthening the solar plexus chakra within our bodies. Solar Plexus Chakra healing involves using a number of holistic remedies such as aromatherapy, sound, crystal, movement, and emotional therapy to re-establish harmony within the body-mind organism. 17 Signs of an Unhealthy Solar Plexus Chakra The best way to tell whether you need to undergo solar plexus chakra healing is to pay attention to your thoughts, feelings, actions, and physical sensations within your body. Here are some signs to look out for: - You constantly feel fatigued and lazy - You have a problem with overeating and overindulgence - You tend to manipulate others to get what you want, OR ... - You frequently feel powerless and weak - You tend to be a bully or overly dominating around others, OR ... - You feel insecure and unassertive - You lack self-confidence in most areas of life - You tend to seek approval from other people (i.e. you're a [people-pleaser](https://lonerwolf.com/people-pleasing/)) - You have low self-esteem, OR ... - You have an excessively inflated sense of self (i.e. a big [ego](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-the-ego/)) - Your body temperature is usually very cold OR very hot - You have addictive tendencies - You struggle to send boundaries around other people - You tend to form co-dependent relationships with others - You suffer from a digestive system disorder such as IBS, ulcers, hypoglycemia, diabetes, etc. - You suffer from frequent gas, constipation or stomach upset - You have excessive weight around the stomach (i.e. a pot belly) How many of these signs can you relate to in this list? Do You Have a Deficient or Excessive Solar Plexus Chakra? Did you know that there are actually two types of chakra imbalances? While a deficient solar plexus chakra is passive or energetically \"numb,\" an excessive solar plexus chakra is energetically aggressive or manic. Here's a breakdown of the difference between the two: Deficient = lifeless, sluggish, passive, blocked, inwards (not enough energy flows in) Excessive = lively, agitated, reactive, aggressive, outwards (too much energy flows in) Therefore, if you have a deficient solar plexus chakra, you will be more prone to issues such as fatigue, low self-esteem, and poor willpower. On the other hand, if you have an excessive solar plexus chakra you will be prone to egotism, controlling behaviors, and addictions that numb you. The question is, what type of imbalance do you have? It's also possible to fall somewhere in the middle. 18 Solar Plexus Chakra Healing Practices So what does a healthy and balanced solar plexus chakra look and feel like? When you have a clear, strong and harmonious solar plexus chakra, you will firstly feel confident in yourself. You will no longer struggle with self-doubt or aggressive egotism, but instead, you'll feel comfortable in your own skin and you'll trust in your abilities. You'll come to understand that you have the power of choice, i.e. the power to choose your mindset, and therefore how you approach life and other people. Not only will you feel more self-assured, but you will also have the energy and willpower needed to create healthy boundaries. You will no longer lapse into explosive or self-minimizing roles around others, but instead, you'll stand your ground with respect for yourself and others. Your newly found energy will allow you to move out of lethargic and addictive patterns, and instead carry out your goals and dreams with enthusiasm. You will feel energized, focused, empowered, and in alignment with life. Sounds great, doesn't it? But remember, bringing about these changes doesn't just happen overnight. You will need to be sincere and patient in your dedication to cleanse the solar plexus, especially if it has been blocked for many years. Here are some of the best solar plexus chakra healing practices out there which will help you begin to heal this energetic center: 1. Break out of routine and take a risk Best suited to: deficient blockages Lethargic and \"safe\" routines only tend to perpetuate our feelings of powerlessness. Break the dull inertia of your life and try something new. Step outside of your routine and go exploring, even if that means going to a different shopping center on your Saturday shopping trip. Even small breaks in routine will infuse you with energy and vitality. One small change can give you the motivation and renewed energy you need. 2. Cut ties with critical and negative people Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages If you can't cut ties permanently with belittling and critical people, try your best to keep a distance from them. During this time of your life, you'll benefit from supportive people who will encourage you to grow, not unsupportive people who will drag you through the mud. Remember that the power is in your hands. It is up to you to decide who stays and goes in your life. If someone is frequently discrediting, underrating, or bad-mouthing you, take steps to remove them from your life. 3. Explore the biggest sources of resistance in your life Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages What are you constantly fighting against? What are you afraid of? What issues keep coming back in your life? When you ask these questions and discover the answer, you'll uncover the greatest source of energy loss in your life. The next step is to learn how to preserve your energy and stop the resistance. Ask yourself, \"What must I understand, love or let go of that will free up my energy?\" Often, those with blocked solar plexus chakras tend to invest huge amounts of energy towards fighting, avoiding or suppressing something. 4. Eat more of these foods Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Eat whole grains such as rice, oats, spelt, and rye which are all great for digestion. Try including more legumes in your diet such as lentils, chickpeas, and beans. Add spices such as turmeric, ginger, cumin, and cinnamon to your food as these spices are heating to the body. Also include yellow fruit and vegetables such as lemons, bananas, corn, pineapple, and yellow capsicums into your eating plan. 5. Get out in the sun more Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages As the solar plexus chakra is represented by the element of fire, the sun is an immensely healing source of vitality. In fact, the less vitamin D you have in your life, [the more prone](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908269/) you are to issues such as anxiety and depression. Taking a simple morning walk in the sunshine, or even relaxing in the afternoon sun with a good cup of tea is a powerful practice for the solar plexus chakra. 6. Release any anger you store inside Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages When done in conjunction with [grounding](https://lonerwolf.com/root-chakra-healing/), releasing pent up anger can help you to unblock your solar plexus quite rapidly. Our congested power is often expressed as blocked anger (just think of the \"angry\" explosions of volcanoes!), so when we release that anger, we can access that energy again. Try releasing your anger in a healthy way such as through vigorous exercise, punching, kickboxing, dancing, singing, writing, crying or expressing it through art. 7. Take more of these cleansing herbs Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Use herbs to help ground and clear the solar plexus such as chamomile, rosemary, lemongrass, marshmallow leaf, and ginger. One of the best ways to take herbs is to drink them as tea. For the solar plexus chakra, I recommend Buddha Teas' soothing and 100% organic Solar Plexus Chakra Tea which [ you can buy here.](https://lonerwolf.com/go/solarplexuschakratea/) I'm actually drinking a cup of this tea as we speak! I love that it's infused with the essence of citrine. 8. Stop seeing yourself as a \"victim\" Best suited to: deficient blockages One of the most damaging mindsets carried by those with blocked solar plexus chakras is the notion that they are \"powerless\" and defenseless victims of life. If you carry this mentality, it will manifest as the tendency to blame other people for your unhappiness. You might also find yourself constantly sacrificing your needs for others who don't always appreciate your efforts. (This is called the [Martyr Syndrome](https://lonerwolf.com/martyr-complex-symptoms/).) Secretly, there is a lot of energy put into playing the victim, and it is a facade that must be maintained (and reaffirmed) every day. If you see yourself as a person who is being victimized by someone else or something else, explore what it feels like to say \"no.\" Playing the victim is so attractive because it allows us to [bypass the weight of self-responsibility](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-spiritual-bypassing/), so don't be surprised if you find yourself terrified of \"stepping up\" and reclaiming your power. It takes practice and courage. 9. Repeat the following affirmations Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Reclaim your personal power by repeating the following affirmations: \"I can,\" \"I will,\" \"I and courageous,\" \"I embrace my strength,\" \"I love the person I am,\" \"I stand up for myself,\" \"I am responsible for my life,\" \"I am worthy of love and kindness,\" \"I am whole.\" The more you repeat these affirmations with sincerity, the more they will reprogram your unconscious mind, and therefore, open your solar plexus chakra. Try starting each morning with one of these affirmations. 10. Laugh at yourself Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages When we can laugh at ourselves and find humor in life, we have power. Even the darkest periods of life can be infused with humor. Humor is a great source of strength and reminds us that life is always in a state of transition. Nothing ever truly remains the same! When we find humor, we find freedom. The more serious you are, the more disconnected you are from your source of power. 11. Meditate with the following crystals Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Use crystals as energetic totems that will help you harmonize your energy. Try meditating or carrying crystals such as [amber](https://lonerwolf.com/go/amber/), [topaz](https://lonerwolf.com/go/topaz-crystals/), [citrine](https://lonerwolf.com/go/citrine-crystals/), [tiger's eye](https://lonerwolf.com/go/tigers-eye-crystals/), and [yellow calcite](https://lonerwolf.com/go/yellow-calcite-crystals/). amber which [you can buy here](https://lonerwolf.com/go/amber/) from a high-quality seller. 12. Let go of unhealthy attachments Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Unhealthy attachments are tremendous sources of energy loss and are often responsible for solar plexus blockages and energy stagnation. Attachments can be emotional, mental, and also physical. We can become attached to ideals, beliefs, memories, expectations, desires, fears, people, places, objects, and substances. Attachments are essentially forms of energy that become \"stuck\" in our bodies and minds. Sometimes, these bits of energy become so dense that they result in dangerous addictions and severely limiting habits. The best way to break an unhealthy attachment is by asking yourself, \"Is this belief/memory/desire/object serving my highest good?\" The moment you can acknowledge that something in your life is detrimental is the point when you can begin the process of recovery. [Letting go](https://lonerwolf.com/letting-go/) is about learning how to take care of yourself and find inner stability and security without the need for an external crutch. 13. Take care of yourself every single day Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Healthy self-esteem is one of the cornerstones of a lively solar plexus chakra. When you take care of your body and psychological health, your energy instantly becomes harmonized. Think about what areas of your physical, mental, emotional or spiritual health you have been neglecting. Otherwise, consider what is causing you the most pain in your life, and target that! For example, if you have been neglecting your body, it will manifest as aches, pain, and chronic illness. If you have been neglecting your heart, you will feel constantly stressed, angry, or overwhelmed. Taking care of yourself is a form of [self-love](https://lonerwolf.com/self-love/) and respect. Remember, no person can care for you better than YOU can. Only you know your deepest needs at any and every given moment. 14. Learn to breathe deeply and take a step back Best suited to: excessive blockages If you struggle with dominating or controlling other people, learn how to focus on your breath. By breathing deeply and taking a step back, you can think realistically about the situation (and person) at hand. Focusing on your breath will also give you the space to treat yourself with compassion and to understand that any form of [ego-inflation](https://lonerwolf.com/inflated-ego/) is a cry for love and attention. 15. Clear blocks with yoga Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Yoga is a potent and elegant way to reset your body and any suppressed energy that may be stored away. For opening the solar plexus, try yoga poses such as the bow pose, upward dog, full wheel pose, and the breath of fire. Please note that when you try these yoga poses, you may experience waves of emotional energy. Don't worry; this energy is just being released as part of the clearing process. 16. Do a solar plexus visualization Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Imagine a throbbing or swirling ball of luminescent yellow light in your diaphragm. Feel the ball of golden energy dissolving all blockages or aggressive flows of energy within you. 17. Engage your willpower by setting goals Best suited to: deficient blockages Overcome lethargy by making a list of ten things you would like to accomplish, and dedicate yourself to completing those things. This willpower list can be as complex or simple as you like. For example, you might want to improve your posture, get more sleep, start a new eating plan, track your expenses, or read a certain book. By setting clear goals, you will be able to exercise your willpower more easily. 18. Cleanse the solar plexus chakra with essential oils Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Use oils [cinnamon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QJBVUY4?tag=lonerwolf-20), [rosemary](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PM2T3N6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20), [cypress](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PM2WL30/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20), [clove](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PM7S5R6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20), and [sandalwood](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SVF0JNO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20). You can put these oils into an oil diffuser, rub them on your wrist (in a diluted form), or wear them in a [diffusing pendant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016K52S7Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20). Finally, you can also try to hum \"RAM\" to yourself. The vibrations of this sound match the vibrations of the solar plexus.
