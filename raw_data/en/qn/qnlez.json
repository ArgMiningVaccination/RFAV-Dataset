This balance therapy has already been practised for several thousand years. It dates back to a beautiful legend in ancient China. It's said that one day about five thousand years ago, a farmer found a turtle by Luo River. On the shell of the turtle, there were some curves which could be translated into a group of numbers (See the numbers chart below): |4||9||2| |3||5||7| |8||1||6| Take a look for the above chart: adding all the numbers from all the three rows and columns is 15 in total. This is the model of balance. If human body's balance is broken, people will get sick and suffer from different diseases, including Yin Yang disharmony, imbalance of internal organs, disorder of energy and blood, and so on. Factors Causing the Imbalance of Internal Organs - Irregular diet; - Emotional disorder; - Stress, anxiety and depression; - Over-working; - Pollution; - Chemicals. Ageing Considered from a Chinese Medicine Perspective Ageing is also a factor for imbalance of human body. For instance, at the age of 50, women may experience the onset of menopause while men may suffer from prostate problems. Why does this occur? From the Yin/Yang theory, women are yin in nature and men are yang in nature. Over time, yin is consumed with ageing and this leads to yin deficiency, manifesting as hot flashes, night sweating, and heat in the palms. Since women are yin in nature, they experience this deficiency as menopausal symptoms. For men, as the yang is consumed with ageing, this leads to Qi and yang insufficiency, resulting in frequent urination at night, dribbling and incontinence, lower back pain, impotence, premature ejaculation, and cold extremities. Chinese Energetic Evaluation System The advanced Chinese energetic evaluation system leads to find the earlier changes of imbalance. Every day our body tries to communicate with us or to warn us with various symptoms. But we are often either too busy to pay enough attention to our body or we ignore the body's messages due to our own lack of knowledge. Traditional Chinese Medicine offers advanced methods for the understanding of the body's symptoms. Through the skin colour change, hair loss, the different conditions of the tongue and pulses, we can find the earlier problems of human body. On the other hand, Chinese medicine believes that there is a non-sickness and non-healthy condition which needs early care. The advanced Chinese energetic evaluation system helps find such kind of functional disorders. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment The TCM treatment aims on balancing and harmonizing human body. The acupuncture and moxibustion can warm the body for cold symptoms; pricking points for heat diseases; descend energy for excess in the upper part of the body and the head; ascending energy for prolapse syndromes and incontinence of stools and urine. The final purpose is to regain and maintain the balance. Because of this, the acupuncture practitioner may select the symmetrical points from upper and lower parts of the body; from the left and right sides of the body; from front and back. The herbal treatment is about the same: sedating for the excess condition and tonifying for the deficiency situation; cooling heat and warming cold. The purpose of all these treatment is to balance the whole body, mentally, physically and emotionally. Comments: - Nicki said..
