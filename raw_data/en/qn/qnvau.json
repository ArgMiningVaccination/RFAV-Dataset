Enjoy the personal attention of our experienced team of wellness professionals, here for you every step, so you can leave worries at home and focus completely on deep cleansing and relaxation. >Our cleanse retreat is designed for complete nourishment, and as such does not involve fasting, which can actually rob the body of important nutrients and slow your metabolism. Our professional chefs cook you three fresh, light meals a day that will aid the body in detoxing and recharging. These meals will nourish your body's internal detoxification system, thereby increasing the natural capacity you have to cleanse and restore. You may lose weight, and you will definitely feel more energized, lighter, and buoyant. Who Manages the Program?
