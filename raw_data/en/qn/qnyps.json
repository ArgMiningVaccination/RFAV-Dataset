This disease is caused by the highly contagious severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which rst exhibited human-to-human transmission in December 2019 and has infected millions of people within months across 213 di erent countries. Its ability to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers has put a massive strain on thecurrently available testing resources. Currently, there are no clinically proven therapeutic methods that clearly inhibit the e ects of this virus, and COVID-19 vaccines are still in the development phase. Strategies need to be explored to expand testing capacities, to developeective therapeutics, and to develop safe vaccines that provide lasting immunity. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used in many medical applications, such as biosensing, drug delivery,imaging, and antimicrobial treatment. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with particle-likecharacteristics and a diameter of 60 140 nm. Synthetic NPs can closely mimic the virus and interact strongly with its proteins due to their morphological similarities. Hence, NP-basedstrategies for tackling this virus have immense potential. NPs have been previously found to be e ective tools against many viruses, especially against those from the Coronaviridae family. This Review outlines the role of NPs in diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccination for the other two epidemic coronaviruses, the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the 2012Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. We also highlight nanomaterial-based approaches to address other coronaviruses,such as human coronaviruses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus porcine and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), andtransmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); and other viruses that share similarities with SARS-CoV-2. This Review combines thesalient principles from previous antiviral studies with recent research conducted on SARS-CoV-2 to outline NP-based strategies thatcan be used to combat COVID-19 and similar pandemics in the future.

INTRODUCTION A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak of thepulmonary disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), starting in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China.13The primary symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, severe respiratory illness, pneumonia, and dyspnea.1,2Since the initial outbreak, e cient human-to-human transmission has led to exponential growth of the virus, infecting millions of people.1,4The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and declared the outbreak a pandemic on11 March 2020.3,4At the time of publication, SARS-CoV-2 has infected tens of millions of people across the globe, leading to more than 800,000 deaths worldwide. The ght against a viral pandemic needs multipronged scienti c approaches. The rst requirement is the diagnostic detection of the virus. The development of fast and e ective testing methods enables contact tracing and isolation of infected people, slowing the spread of the virus. Particularly with SARS-CoV-2, which spreads quickly through asympto-matic carriers,5large-scale testing is required to obtain a complete picture of viral spread. The testing methods must beaccurate, suitable for mass production, inexpensive, and easy todeploy and use. Second, there is a need for therapeuticinterventions that can e ectively cure or reduce the e ects of the virus. Therapeutics in the form of drugs and treatment strategies are essential to reduce the morbidity and mortalitycaused by the virus. Third, vaccines must be developed to helpcreate antibodies, leading to eventual herd immunity. Vaccination has been able to eradicate various epidemic diseases, including smallpox, polio, and tuberculosis, in manycountries. 6However, the development of vaccines against most viral diseases has proven to be challenging.

(HIV), which has caused over 40 million deaths to date.7 Similarly, respiratory viral diseases (e.g., in fluenza) infect 3 5 million people and cause 290 000 650 000 deaths annually.8 The 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected 8300 people with a mortality rate of 10%, eventually subsided in the summer, but there were no vaccines found at that time.9In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus a ected at least 27 countries with a very high mortality rate of 35%.10,11 Since then, much progress has been made in the eld of vaccination against coronaviruses, the principles of which applyto SARS-CoV-2 as well. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits 80 and 50% similarity with the genomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively.12All coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses, similar to the 2003 SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also has azoonotic origin, having emerged from bats.9SARS-Cov-2 has approximately 96% similarity from the Coronaviridae family, is covered by an envelope with protein spikes.12As illustrated in Figure 1 a, the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are spike surface glycoprotein ( S), small envelope protein ( E), matrix protein ( M), and nucleocapsid protein ( N). Ocial electron microscopy images released by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), shown in Figures 1be, show the morphology and structure of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 particles have a diameter ranging from 60 to 140nm.12,14Due to the particulate nature, morphology, and size domain of SARS-CoV-2, nanoparticle (NP)-based strategies present a powerful approach for tackling this virus. Recently,NPs have been widely used in many medical applications, such as biosensing, drug delivery, imaging, and antimicrobialtreatment.1518Various NPs have been shown to be e ective tools for the detection and inhibition of and vaccinationagainst coronaviruses.19,20This Review describes how we can build on the NP-based strategies used against viruses from theCoronaviridae family to develop tests, therapeutics, and vaccines to ght SARS-CoV-2. 2. NANOPARTICLES FOR DIAGNOSTICS Most viral RNA detection methods are based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) due to itssimplicity, high sensitivity, and high speci city based on the exponential increase in RNA produced during the oper-ation. 21,22Although RT-PCR methods are widely known as the standard methods for coronavirus detection, there are somelimitations that need to be addressed, including low extractioneciency, the use of time-consuming processes, and false positives caused by contamination. 23Regarding the improve- ment of virus detection e ciency, due to their high surface area and ultrasmall size, NPs have been applied not only inRT-PCR methods but also other virus detection methods, suchas an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 24,25Various kinds of NPs have been studied in the context of virus detection, including metal NPs, carbonnanotubes, silica NPs, quantum nanoislands NPs (MNPs), and QDs have been applied tocoronavirus detection. Most of these diagnostic methods are Figure 1. (a) The SARS-CoV-2 structure is illustrated, with its structural viral proteins indicated. Reproduced with permission from ref 12.

Table 1 provides a summary of the NPs used in the diagnostic detection of coronaviruses. 2.1. Metal Nanoparticles and Metal Nanoislands. Most metal NP-based virus detection techniques were designed based on the unique optical and electrical properties of metal NPs. In particular, noble metal NPs, such as gold, silver, and copper, have unique optical properties called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). LSPR has beenutilized in biosensing applications due to the tunable light absorption and scattering wavelength in the visible region. The change in the LSPR extinction maxima of metal NPs depends on the refractive index of the surrounding media and the degree of NP aggregation, which are important factors for the use of these NPs in biological applications.3941Gold NPs (AuNPs) are the most common NPs used in diagnostic detection of viruses due to their unique optical properties, stability, and biocompatible properties.4244Due to the LSPR eect, the aggregation of AuNPs causes a redshift in the LSPR peak position, resulting in an obvious change in the solution color from red to blue, which can be observed with the naked eye. This phenomenon is caused by the plasmonic coupling among the neighboring NPs when the colloidal NPs aggregate.45 The applications of AuNPs in virus detection have been reported.42AuNPs are also the most common metal NPs that have been used for coronavirus diagnostics. The use of AuNPs in colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV has been reported.27In this study, the di erence in the electrostatic properties of single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA) was the foundation of the method. Speci cally, ssDNA or ssRNA could interact with citrate ions on the surface of AuNPs and stabilize the particles even when salt was added into the solution, while the presence of dsDNA caused aggregation of AuNPs under the same conditions. Based on this nding, Li and Rothber designed a simple colorimetric hybridization assay to detect SARS-CoV based on the formation of dsDNA from viral ssRNA.27This colorimetric detection method con rmed the formation of dsDNA with a target concentration of 4.3 nM. Essentially, the results were observed within 10 min without the need for any complicated instrument. In a di erent approach, the formation of long dsDNA molecules from reactions of the target viral RNAs with a pair of thiol- functionalized probes showed the ability to stabilize AuNPsunder positive electrolyte conditions.28In the presence of the target viral RNAs of MERS-CoV, the formation of disul de bonds between the thiol-functionalized probes, which weredesigned to interact with target viral RNA, caused a self- assembly process to produce long thiol-modi ed dsDNA molecules on the gold surface. These monolayers of the long polymer-type structures of thiol-modi ed dsDNA on the surface prevented the AuNPs from aggregating under positiveelectrolyte conditions when MgCl 2was added into the solution (Figure 2 a). On the other hand, the thiol-modi ed probes, without interaction with the target molecules, stayed on the AuNP surface in individual (monomeric) or dimeric molecules, formed via a disul de formation reaction. Due to their short chain length, both monomers and dimers of the thiol-modi ed probes could not prevent the aggregation of AuNPs when salt was added, as shown in Figure 2 b. This colorimetric reaction led to a change in the AuNP colloidal solution color in the presence of MERS-CoV at as low as 1pmol/ L, and the detection process took only 10 min without additional procedures. AuNPs can be further functionalized with biomolecules to modify their surface properties. For example, colloidal AuNPs conjugated with streptavidin were used for an RT-LAMP combined with a vertical flow visualization strip (RT-LAMP- VF) assay for MERS-CoV nucleic acid detection.29In this study, viral RNA was ampli ed by RT-LAMP, followed by a labeling process to form biotin/ fluorescein (FITC)-labeled amplicons. These amplicons can AuNPs to generate a complex via biotinstreptavidin interactions. This complex showed color formation when captured by an anti-FITC antibody coated on the detection strip. The formation of the complex on the strip was visible to the naked eye within 35 min. The detection limit of this technique is equivalent to 10 copies/ L of MERS-CoV RNA. Moreover, the method showed high speci city for MERS-CoV without cross-reactivity with functionalized AuNPs the N gene (nucleocapsidphosphoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2.30Speci cally, in the presence of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2, the thiol-modi ed ASO-capped AuNPs agglomerated, which caused a change in the color of the ASO-capped AuNP colloidal solution.

This method yielded the resultwithin 10 min after the RNA isolation process. Additionally, the detection limit of this method was 0.18 ng/ L. In addition to plasmon-based virus detection, AuNPs have been applied to electrochemical detection of coronaviruses.Layqah and Eissa reported the use of AuNPs to modify carbonarray electrodes in electrochemical biosensors for both MERS-CoV and HCoV detection. 31In this method, a viral antigen (recombinant spike protein S1 of MERS-CoV or Oc43 N of HCoV) is immobilized to the surface of AuNPs on the working electrodes. When a xed amount of the corresponding viral antibody is added to the sample, the antibody binds to theimmobilized antigen, decreasing the square wave voltammetry(SWV) reduction peak current. In the presence of virus, thechange in current is di erent due to competition between the virus and immobilized antigen for binding to the antibody. Hence, the virus is detected based on the measured change in current in competitive immunoassays. The deposition of goldimproves the electron transfer rate and increases the surfacearea of the electrode, resulting in high sensitivity of virusdetection. 31Specically, this detection method was able to detect both MERS-CoV and HCoV with detection limits of 1.0and 0.4 pg/mL, respectively. The detection process yielded results within 20 min. The method can be used for arti cial nasal samples as well as to detect MERS-CoV and HCoVsimultaneously. Recently, Lee et al. developed a method for the detection of MERS-CoV based on nanoplasmonic on-chip fromgold NIs (AuNIs) deposited on the top and side walls of glassnanopillar arrays were used to enhance the light absorption eciency of the detection chip. Hence, ultrafast PCR thermal cycling was achieved via enhanced plasmonic photothermalheating generated via excitation of surface electrons of AuNIsby a white light-emitting diode (LED). When the LED was o , ecient heat di usion through the NPAs allowed expeditious cooling of the PCR mixture. Consequently, this methodrequired only 3 min and 30 s for rapid ampli cation of complementary DNA (cDNA) of MERS-CoV at a concen- tration of 0.1 ng/ L. However, the method could yield results very rapidly due to the use of gel electrophoresis forvisualization of the amplicons of target viral cDNAs after thePCR. Interestingly, a faster detection technique was utilized byWang and co-workers in a recently LSPR biosensing technique for highly accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence. Two-dimen-sional AuNIs (5.0 5.2 nm thick) were functionalized thiol-modi ed cDNA receptors of viral gene sequences (RdRp- COVID or RdRp-SARS) to create micro fluidic LSPR sensor chips ( Figure 3 a). Localized thermoplasmonic heating signicantly improved the hybridization speed of viral gene sequence targets with their cDNA receptors immobilized onthe sensor chips, enhancing the sensing performance. Importantly, this sensor can distinguish SARS-CoV andSARS-CoV-2 due to the partial mismatch between thesequences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cDNAreceptors, as shown in 3 b,c. sensitivity toward SARS-CoV-2 sequences at a concen- tration of 0.22 pM. Although AuNPs are the most common metal NPs used in virus detection, several studies have suggested the use of other metal NPs. Silver NPs (AgNPs) have been used in paper-basedanalytical devices (PADs) for MERS-CoV detection.33The device can also be applied in the diagnosis of other bacteriaand viruses, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and human papillomavirus (HPV). In peptide ions onthe surface of AgNPs, inducing NP aggregation together with achange in color. On the other hand, in the presence of viraltarget cDNAs, acpcPNAs preferred to interact with the targetcDNAs to form dsDNAs and stayed separate from AgNPs inthe solution, leading to no signi cant color change. 33The paper-based device exhibited high sensitivity, with detectionlimits of 1.53, 1.27, and 1.03 nM for respectively. 2.2. Magnetic Nanoparticles. Magnetic NPs (MNPs) play an important role in the separation of viral RNA fromsolution before the diagnosis process. 47,48The most common MNPs that have drawn attention in the biological applicationeld are iron oxide NPs due to their high magnetic e ciency and simple synthesis approaches.49,50Regarding coronavirus detection, Gong et al. used silica-coated superparamagneticNPs (SMNPs) PCR-based assays to improve the selectivityof the target cDNA of in the separation process. Speci cally, silica-coated SMN Ps were conjugated cDNAs toproduce magnetic-conjugated dsDNA complexes. The mag-netic-conjugated dsDNA was separated from other compo-nents by using simple magnetic separation before dehybridiza-tion to form enriched cDNAs. 34The viral enriched cDNA was ampli ed through PCR followed by isolation via another magnetic separation step. The ampli ed viral target cDNA was detected by a sandwich hybridization assay with silica-coatedfluorescent NP (SFNP)-based signaling probes. The technique can detect the target cDNA with a detection limit of 2.0 \u00d710 3 copies within 6 h. Recently, MNPs have been applied to SARS-CoV-2 detection. Several studies have reported the use of iron oxide Figure 3.

Zhou, Yu, and co-workers reported a viral RNA extraction method using poly(amino ester) with carboxyl group (PC)-coated MNPs (pcMNPs).35 SARS-CoV-2 captured and enriched by pcMNPs to produce pcMNP RNA complexes. Due to the magnetic property of pcMNPs, the pcMNP RNA complexes were easily extracted from the solution by applying an external magnetic force. Interestingly, the pcMNP RNA complexes can be immediately used in the following RT-PCR process for viral RNA ampli cation without the use of an elution step. The pcMNP-based extraction method exhibited high purity andhigh productivity within 30 min. In addition, the pcMNPs showed good binding with viral RNA, resulting in 10-copy sensitivity using the RT-PCR-based detection technique. 2.3. Quantum Dots. Due to their unique optical and electrical properties, QDs have been applied in the detection of several viruses. 53,54For coronavirus detection, a QD- conjugated RNA aptamer speci c to the SARS-CoV Nprotein has been reported to have high sensitivity in recognizing immobilized viral protein on designed chips.36The authors used commercially availa ble QD-605 with an emission maximum at 605 nm to obtain an outstanding detection limit for the SARS-CoV Nprotein at 0.1 pg/mL by detecting thefluorescent emission intensity measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy.36 The nanohybrid structures of QDs and other NPs have also been reported for coronavirus detection. Because of their extraordinary plasmonic properties, star-shaped antibodies named anti-HA and anti-NA were immobilized on the surfaces of the star-shaped gold NPs and CdTe QDs, respectively. When a recombinant protein of in fluenza A (H5N1) waspresent in the same anti-NA-conjugated QDs, antigen antibody interactions (immunolinking) of the recombinant proteinwith the two antibodies immobilized on the surfaces of theNPs and QDs. The plasmon exciton nanohybrids signi cantly enhanced the chiral optical response of the solution. Consequently, the viralrecombinant protein was detected based on the measured circular dichroism response of the solution. In this technique, star-shaped AuNPs were chosen due to their broad plasmonicpeak at 590 nm that maximizes the optical coupling andoverlaps with the QD excitonic wavelength. The method showed sensitivity at 1 pg/mL for H5N1 detection and was able to detect several other viruses in blood samples, such asavian in fluenza A (H4N6) virus, fowl adenovirus, and coronavirus. 37In 2018, a similar approach was used by the same research group to dev elop a magnetoplasmonic fluorescent biosensor NPs (MPNPs). As shown in Figure 4 , two types of particles were functionalized with viral antibodies. The viral antibody-functionalized NPsstayed apart from each other in the solution. After the target virus was added to the system, the conjugated ZrQDs and MPNPs formed magnetoplasmonic fluorescent nanohybrid structures via immunolinking. Hence, the detection of the target virus was based on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of the ZrQD Fe 3O4@Au MPNP nanohybrids after simple magnetic separation. The nanohybrid structures also showed a change in photoluminescence emission intensity with a change in virus concentration in the system.38The method can selectively detect the presence of infectiousbronchitis virus (IBV) at a concentration of 79.15 EID/50 L in blood medium.

NANOPARTICLES FOR THERAPEUTICS Much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, but it has been determined to be an enveloped virus with spike proteins as the main cell-infecting sites and an ssRNA as the genetic material.Many viruses investigated in NP-based antiviral research are from the coronavirus family or share a similar structure with SARS-CoV-2. NP-based therapeutic drugs can inhibit theeects of viral infection in several ways, including by blocking receptor binding and cell entry, blocking viral replication and proliferation, and directly inactivating the virus. Thesetherapeutic strategies are discussed in this section. Table 2 lists the NPs that can be used for therapeutic strategies against coronavirus infections together with the key takeaways that can be applied for COVID-19. 3.1. Nanoparticles That Block Cell Attachment and Viral Entry. Viral infections start with the binding of viral particles to receptors on the host cells, followed by the entry of the virus into the cells. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike S glycoprotein is responsible for cell binding and entry. 82,83As illustrated in Figure 5 a, the Sprotein of SARS-CoV-2 can be divided into two subunits: the S1 subunit is responsible for attachment, while the S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion and entry into the cell.82,84The S1 subunit consists of an N- terminal domain (NTD) and a C-domain; the S2 subunit consists of a potential fusion peptide (pFP), heptad repeats N and C (HR-N, HR-C), and a transmembrane domain (TM).The S1 protein has been shown to bind speci cally to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells.13,82Membrane fusion of the attached virus mostly occurs via endocytosis.13,83Therefore, blocking the mechanism by which the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor or blocking viral endocytosis is a potent strategy fordrug development and treatment. One of the drugs beingwidely considered for this purpose is chloroquine. Chloroquine has been shown to inhibit endocytosis of NPs general; since SARS-CoV-2 is NPs, chloroquinecan block the endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles as well, as illustrated in Figure 5 b. 85The proposed mechanism involves chloroquine-induced suppression of PICALM, whichprevents endocytosis-mediated of NPs, including SARS-CoV-2. Although chloroquine blocks NP endocytosis into the cell, the e cacy of chloroquine depends on its delivery and cellular uptake, which can be greatly aided by encapsulating the molecule inside polymeric NPs. The most commonly used NPs for encapsulating chloroquine arepoly(lactic acid) (PLA) polymeric NPs. 80 In addition to facilitating drug delivery, NPs can also directly interfere with receptor binding and cell entry of viruses. Ting etal. demonstrated that 1.6 nm cationic carbon dots (CDs) synthesized from curcumin (CCM-CDs) can block viral entry of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a coronavirusmodel. 76The inhibition e ciency was over 50% at 125 g/ mL, blocking viral entry at an early stage (see Figure 6 a). The blocking is most likely caused by electrostatic interactionsbetween the cationic CDs and the negatively charged PEDV, which neutralizes the e ective charge on the virus particles, leading to virus aggregation, as seen from the zeta potentialdata in Figure 6 b. The CDs also suppressed the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing cell apoptosis. Curcumin can also act as a reducing and capping agent in the synthesis of curcumin-modi ed AgNPs (cAgNPs), which have also been shown to inhibit cell entry of respiratory viruses. 60For this purpose, smaller cAgNPs with large surface areas are seen to be more e ective than larger NPs. Interestingly, smaller cAgNPs are also less cytotoxic than larger NPs.60The driving force behind this process is the same as that for \"protein corona \"formation; high surface areas of small AgNPs lead to direct interactions with the viral envelope proteins and greaterinhibition. 60Graphene QDs have also been found to be eective in interfering with cell binding of HIV,86while AgNPs coupled with graphene oxide (GO) sheets have been shown tobe eective in blocking cell entry of feline coronavirus (FCoV) enveloped viruses. 61Moreover, various surface-function- alized AgNPs and AuNPs have also been shown to be e ective in blocking cell entry of HIV and herpes simplex virus(HSV).87The advantage of AuNPs is that they are less cytotoxic than AgNPs.8890 In addition to virus aggregation, AuNPs can also directly interfere with the cell entry mechanism, as demonstrated byHuang et al. 59Similar to the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit shown in Figure 5 a, the S2 protein of MERS-CoV contains heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), and a fusion protein(FP). As illustrated in Figure 7 a, after the FP inserts into the cell membrane, HR1 and HR2 bind to form a six-helix bundle(6-HB). The 6-HB pulls together the MERS-CoV envelopeand host cell membrane, promoting fusion. Huang et al.identi ed a peptide, named pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), which could mimic the conformation of HR2. Thus, this peptide can interact with HR1 to block the formation of 6-HB, inhibiting the cell fusion process. When PIH wasimmobilized on the surface of gold nanorods (PIH AuNRs), a 10-fold higher inhibitory activity was observed that couldcompletely block cell fusion at the optimized concentration(see Figure 7 c,d). The PIH AuNRs also demonstrated excellent biocompatibility (see Figure 7 b). In addition to AuNPs, other NPs have also been shown to be eective at blocking viral entry while maintaining low toxicity. Among synthetic NPs, porous silicon NPs (SiNPs) areespecially favored due to their extreme biocompatibility. SiNPsare biodegradable, since they gradually dissolve in water toform nontoxic silicic acid. 66Osiminka et al. showed that SiNPs were able to act as scavengers of free virus particles and prevented them from infecting host cells. Binding of SiNPs with virions is universal for di erent enveloped viruses, making them potential agents against SARS-CoV-2 as well.66 Mesoporous-SiO 2(mSiO 2) NPs, when functionalized with various moieties, exhibit the ability to attach themselves toenveloped viruses via hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions.Strong bonds between the functionalized mSiO 2NPs and the virus disturb the virus 's attachment to host cell receptors and reduce viral entry into the cells.72Other types of biocompatible NPs known for inhibiting cellular viruses (SeNPs).

Nanoparticles That Block Viral Replication and Proliferation. For viral infection, therapeutics that inhibit the proliferation speed or infectivity of viruses are of paramountimportance. These treatments will keep the virus level in thebody low enough for the immune system to respond e ectively and in a timely manner as the rst line of defense as well as to limit the virus 's capability to resist treatment via genetic mutation. Due to multiple outbreaks, respiratory diseasescaused by members of the coronavirus family have receivedmuch research attention over the past decade for the development of e ective therapies. Various NPs have been investigated as antiviral age nts for inhibition of viral proliferation. The infectivity of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of the coronavirus family, is signi cantly diminished in the presence of AgNPs and silver nanowires (AgNWs) at concentrations below the toxic level. 62Silver nanostructures have also been demonstrated to decrease cellapoptosis induced by viral infection. Data have suggested thatAg nanomaterials regulate p 38-MAPK-p53 mitochondrial signaling cascades by inhibiting TGEV-induced expression ofthe Pi-p38 protein. This regulation reduces cell apoptosisinduced by TGEV infection. PEDV is a commonly studied model virus of the coronavirus family due to its high similarity to other human-infectingcoronaviruses and the economic impact caused by PEDVinfection. Han and co-workers reported the suppression ofPEDV infection by 3 orders of magnitude via treatment withglutathione-capped Ag 2S nanoclusters (Ag 2S NCs).74The study also pointed out that the mechanisms of inhibition ofviral proliferation are based on the suppression of RNAsynthesis, as shown in Figure 8 . The authors further found that Ag 2S NCs activated the generation of interferon (IFN)- stimulating genes (ISGs) and cytokine expression, which further inhibited viral infection. In addition to members of the coronavirus group, there are various viruses with structures similar to that of SARS-CoV-2with positive-sense ssRNA genetic material, an envelope ofphospholipids, and proteins. Many of these viruses have even been used as models for coronavirus research in recent years, and the e cacy of nanoparticles on these viruses could be relevant to therapy development for SARS-CoV-2. As one ofthe most heavily studied viruses due to multiple globalpandemics in the last 100 years, in fluenza A viruses with their frequent genetic mutation and increasing resistance to drugshave been the target for various NP-based therapeutic researcheorts. A potentially e ective therapeutic target of many influenza viruses is hemagglutinin (HA), a highly conserved surface protein possessing six disul de bonds. Haam and co- workers used porous gold NPs (PoGNPs) to target the HA protein on various in fluenza viruses based on strong gold thiol interactions. 58The results demonstrated signi cant inhibition of viral infectivity in cells treated with PoGNPs, and the cellviability increased to 96.8%, compared to 33.9% of nontreatedcells. The viral inhibition e was con rmed on the H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2 viruses to demonstrate the universaleectiveness of the approach. The biocompatibility of PoGNPs was also evaluated by the WST-1 assay, showing 95% cellviability. Alghrair et AuNPsfunctionalized with FluPep, a peptide that can e ectively inhibit in fluenza A viruses (IAVs), showed greater antiviralTable 2. continued NPs conjugate size (nm) cytotoxicity (dose, time) virus approachlevel of study key takeaways for COVID-19 ref. lipid nanodiscssialic acid 15 - H1N1 viral inactivation in vitro/in vivo60% infection reduction, 40% death rate reduction PLA: 2020, 3, 8557 85808565 activity than free FluPep.94Haag and co-workers used electron microscopy imaging to visually glycerol dendrons protein to e ectively inhibit viral proliferation.55Moreover, inhibitory e ects on and biocompatibility with H1N1, a current seasonal virus that caused two deadly global pandemics in 1918 and 2009.In addition to in fluenza viruses, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a model virus often used for coronavirus research, has also been reported to be highlysuppressed after exposure to AgNP-modi ed GO (GO AgNPs) with 59.2% inhibitory e ciency. nanocomposite treatment also enhanced the production ofIFN- and ISGs, which can directly inhibit viral proliferation. In another study, Tong et al. reported the synthesis ofglycyrrhizic-acid-based CDs (Gly-CDs) and their highinhibitory activity of up to 5 orders of viral titers throughmultisite inhibition of inhibition of viral invasionand replication, stimulation of IFN production in cells, and inhibition of viral-infection-induced ROS production, provid- ing a promising alternative for coronavirus infection therapy as Figure 5.

This work also showed the remarkable ability of Gly-CDs to suppress PEDV andpseudorabies virus (PRV), s uggesting a broad antiviral capability compared to previous work.97These results on model viruses might serve as guides for research and development on SARS-CoV-2. The infection caused by Zika virus, a virus with a similar structure to coronaviruses and the cause of a widespreadepidemic in South and North America in 2015, was suppressedby benzoxamine-monomer-derived CDs (BZM-CDs). 78The data from a plaque uniform assay and transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) showed that BZM-CDs could reduce viral infectivity via direct interaction with the viruses. The inhibitory ability of BZM-CDs was also demonstrated on Japaneseencephalitis and dengue viruses, two other life-threatening viruses that also exhibit structural similarity to coronaviruses, as well as on nonenveloped viruses (e.g., adeno-associated virus(AAV), porcine parvovirus (PPV)), suggesting that the broad- spectrum potential of the NPs should be further investigated for SARS-CoV-2. Alphaviruses, a genus of RNA viruses with a structure similar to that of coronaviruses, were strongly inhibited in Vero (B)cells by modi mimetic ligands, while no observable cytotoxicity in human cells was detected. 79The incorporation of tyrosine sulfate mimetic ligands on CNCs led to increased viralinhibition compared to incorporation of the control CNCs. This discovery suggests potential applications of CNCs for the treatment of HIV and HPV. In addition, studies of NP-basedantiviral treatment of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 were also reported for AgNPs with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) respiratory virus RSV,99and SiNPs with RSV.66 In the coronavirus family, the outer envelope with the surface proteins is vitally important to the infection and proliferation of the virus. Various studies have reported the remarkable e cacy of NP-based inhibition of HIV by targeting the viral outer envelope using AgNPs,100AuNPs,101103 porous SiNPs,66and silica NPs.72Human-related enveloped tacaribe virus, PRV, and HSV have be signi cantly inhibited by silica NPs,72AgNPs,104CDs,97and modi ed Figure Schematic diagram of the inhibition of MERS-CoV S2-subunit-mediated inhibitor can inhibit HR1/HR2 complex (6-HB)-mediated membrane fusion and prevent MERS-CoV infection (right).

These NP-based antiviral therapies targeting the outer envelopes of enveloped viruses are very relevant to further studies on SARS-CoV-2. 3.3. Nanoparticles for Viral Inactivation and Viricidal Treatment. Instead of inhibiting the cell virion interaction, genetic material replication, or release of newly formed virions, another strategy to halt viral infection is inactivation or destruction of the virus itself. In an elegant study led by Stellacci, AuNPs coated with 3-mercaptoethylsulfonate (MES) showed viral infection inhibition at a concentration corre- sponding to the EC 90, but the viral infectivity was fully recovered upon dilution. This process is called reversible viralinhibition and is similar to the e ect of heparin, a common virustatic material that targets virus cell interactions. Interest- ingly, the authors found that when MES was substituted by a 2:1 mixture of undecanesulfonic acid (MUS) and 1-octanethiol(OT), the MUS:OT AuNPs could induce irreversible viral inactivation human-infecting ranging fromHSV, VSV, RSV, and dengue virus to HPV and lentivirus. 57 The MUS ligand has a long and flexible hydrophobic backbone terminated with sulfonic acid mimicking the heparin sulfateproteoglycan a common conserved targetof viral attachment ligands, allowing e ective virus NP binding. This strong binding force ( 190 pN) led to irreversible deformation of the virus, as shown in Figure 9 . The strong viral MUS:OT AuNP binding was further conrmed by electron microscopy imaging and molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover, an in vivo test in mice and an ex vivo test in human cervico vaginal histocultures also demonstrated the viral inactivation activity of the MUS:OT AuNPs, with no cytotoxicity observed. This strategy is intrinsically broad spectrum, allowing viricidal treatment of Figure 9. (a) Viricidal activity of AuNPs coated with MES or MUS.

The viruses used in the study were very similar to coronaviruses, suggesting the potential applicability of the method for SARS-CoV-2. In another study, Kong et al. showed that decoy virus receptor-functionalized nanodiscs, self-assembled inactivate the H1N1 virus by selectively targeting the virion 's surface proteins to cause irreversible physical damage to the envelope.81The antiviral activity of the viral decoy molecule sialic acid was ampli ed after grafting onto the nanodiscs due to the enabling of multivalent interactions with viral target proteins. The data also showedthat the presence of the functionalized nanodiscs led the virusto self-disrupt its envelope with its own fusion machinery. Thestrength of this method is the use of biocompatible NPs and viral decoy molecules, making it a compelling method for in vivo studies. Gao and co-workers recently showed the catalyticinactivation of iron oxide (Fe 3O4) NPs targeting the viral envelopes on 12 (H1 H12) of IAVs.108The ferromagnetic Fe 3O4NPs with an average diameter of 200 nm were named iron oxide nanozymes (IONzymes) due property, catalyzing Consequently, IONzymes could strongly induce lipid peroxidation in the viral envelope and destroy the integrity of viral surface proteins, including HA, neuraminidase,and matrix protein I, leading to inactivation of the viruses.Additionally, the authors loaded the IONzymes on facemasks and observed good protection against multiple strains of IAVs, including H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9. nanomaterial make itattractive for e ective and safe early stage antiviral therapeutics. Thus, the IONzyme nanomaterials present a potentially powerful approach against SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the works highlighted above, other studies also reported promising inactivation and viricidal e ects of dierent NPs on many viruses that share structural similarities with SARS-CoV-2. Among those reports are the inhibition of dengue virus by photosensitizer-carrying upconversion NPs,which high-energyphotons; 109inhibition measles virus by AuNPs synthesized by using Allium sativa (garlic extract) as a reducing agent;110inhibition of hepatitis C virus by AuNP-based NP cores.115 3.4. Nanoparticles Combining Multiple Approaches for Treatment. In addition to NPs that employ one of the three methods mentioned above to treat viral infection, variousworks have also shown NPs that can attack viruses via acombination of approaches. Nanoparticles that can inhibit theviruses via multiple mechanisms o er more e ective opportunities for reducing viral infection through synergeticeects. Recently, Szunerits and co-workers modi ed carbon QDs (CQDs) of di erent sizes in the range of 4.5 8 nm with various functional groups, including NH 2, COO,N3, triazole, R-B(OH) 2, and with cant inhibition of HCoV infection in a concentration-correlated manner.Mechanistic studies by the authors suggested that the particlesnot only interfere with the replication of HCoV but also inhibit the interaction of the surface Sprotein with the host cell and therefore interrupt the cell fusion of HCoV as shown in Figure 10. Rather than interacting with viral proteins, these CDs interfere with the cellular mechanism for Sprotein attachment and viral uptake. This work demonstrated highly promisingantiviral agents based on biocompatible NPs, which should befurther investigated for their activity against SARS-CoV-2, which is also an HCoV with the Sprotein as the main cell- infecting site. PRRSV, a model virus for coronavirus studies, has been shown to be directly assay data indicated that viralproliferation and protein expression were inhibited by AuNCs.The functionalized AuNCs in this study showed lowbiocompatibility and therefore may not be suitable for invivo application. However, the coupling of AuNCs with othersuitable biocompatible virus-targeting agents could lead to eective virus inactivation. Figure 10.

NANOPARTICLES AS IMMUNOGENIC AGENTS FOR VACCINES The most e ective way to ght a viral epidemic is through vaccination. The goal of vaccination is to initiate a strongimmune response that leads to the development of lasting and protective immunity against the targeted pathogen. The components of the immune system can be broadly classi ed into two categories: innate (nonspeci c) and adaptive (speci c) immune systems.117,118The innate immune system comprises natural killer (NK) cells, DCs, macrophages, monocytes, and innate macrophages secrete cytokines and chemokines that induce in flammation for local defense or to facilitate tissue repair; DCs act as sentinels, carrying replenish macrophages DCs; and innate lymphoid cells integrate and amplify cytokines. The adaptive immune system comprises antibodies, B cells, antigen- presenting cells (APCs), T cells, and T-helper (Th) cells. Antibodies are immunoglobins (Igs: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgE, IgG, and IgM), which are the rst line of defense, secreted by B cells residing in lymph nodes, after recognition of an antigen, while T-helper (Th) cells assist Ig class switching. IgG and IgA are the two major types of antibodies secreted for direct neutralization of pathogens. The most important T cells are CD4+and CD8+T cells, which are the central coordinators of the immune response. CD4+T cells recognize antigen peptides presented on APCs, while activated CD8+T cells induce the death of infected cells. Activated CD4+T cells, called Th1 cells, also produce IFN- , which drives the presentation pathway, facilitating recognition, generation of antiviral antibodies by B cells, and killing and disposal of infected cells with the help of NK cells and macrophages. Th cells and macrophages also produce interleukins (ILs) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF- ), two important classes of cytokines for antiviral immune responses.119,120Table 3 lists the NPs that can be used to trigger innate and adaptive immune responses againstcoronavirus infections. The most common NP-based vaccines are virus-like particles (VLPs) comprised of viral proteins, while NPs have also been used as vehicles for targeted RNA delivery to components of the innate immune system. The various NP-based vaccine designs are discussed in detail in the following sections. 4.1. Virus-Like Particles. The goal of vaccination is to deliver antigens that activate the immune system against the virus. There are various ways to generate e ective vaccines. Currently, most vaccines are based on whole viruses, either live attenuated viruses or inactivated viruses.128However, live vaccines are unstable and di cult to deliver, and the potential for genetic reversion to a more virulent form is always a concern. On the other hand, inactivated vaccines induce a weaker immune response. In both cases, ensuring complete inactivation, the absence of any further infection, and full compliance with safety standards takes 12 18 months. This timeline is far from ideal when ghting extremely virulent diseases such as COVID-19. The alternative is to design subunit vaccines that can prime immune responses via delivery of a subset of the viral proteins. Since these vaccines have no potential for replication, subunit vaccines o er a much safer approach and can often be approved faster. Such vaccines can be enabled by using VLPs, which are protein-based NPs containing viral envelope proteins without the accompanying genetic material. Due to their particulate nature, VLPs canmimic whole viruses and are much more stable than soluble antigens. Several VLP vaccines have been licensed for clinicaluse against various pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV),HPV, Norwalk virus, HSV, and malaria. Early VLP designspossessed limited immunogenicity due to the absence of S epitopes on the surface of the VLPs. 129Incorporating S epitopes in later designs yielded more immunogenic VLPs. Coleman et al. recently developed MERS-CoV spike ( S) protein NPs that can protect mice from MERS-CoVinfection. 123The spike ( S) protein, primarily responsible for receptor binding and cell entry, also induces neutralizingantibodies, making the Sprotein an ideal target for the anti- MERS vaccine. This vaccine also stops MERS-CoV replicationin the lungs. In a related study, the same research group usedfull-length MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV Sproteins to generate 25 nm diameter consisting of multiple Sprotein molecules. 9Inoculation with these VLPs leads to the generation of neutralizing antibodies in mice. In both ofthese studies, neutralizing antibody levels were signi cantly boosted when the VLPs were used with alum and Matrix M1adjuvants (15-fold with alum and 68-fold with Matrix M1), asseen in Figure 11 a. 9,123Alum is an aluminum salt that acts as a mild irritant, stimulating in flammasome responses, while Matrix M1 is a saponin-based adjuvant manufactured by Novavax, AB.9Novavax is currently developing COVID-19 vaccines using VLPs with full-length glycoproteins adjuvantedwith Matrix M1.118,123,130Jung NPs with to antibodies in mice.11The spike protein NPs had a diameter of 35 nm, which increased to 80 nm when the NPs were formulated withalum. When used in conjunction with a recombinantadenovirus serotype 5 encoding the MERS-CoV spike gene(Ad5/MERS), Th1/Th2 activation was balanced, generating alonger-lasting antibody response. Figure 11 bs h o w st h e eectivity of this VLP in MERS-infected mice. The self- assembly of MERS-CoV protein NPs can be further assisted bya ferritin template to ensure the display of target antigens onthe surface. 131Since the spike Sprotein of most important antigenic determinant for inducing neutraliz-ing antibodies, repetitive display of these Sprotein epitopes on the surface of the VLPs stimulates a stronger immuneresponse. Pimental et al. observed that even using a smallersegment of the Sprotein may be su cient if the epitopes are concentrated on the surface. 124Using template-based synthesis with coiled-coil proteins, the C-terminal heptad repeat region(HRC), and a small segment of the Sprotein, they generated VLPs (see Figure 11 c) that were able to stimulate anti-SARS antibodies even in the absence of an adjuvant, attributedlargely to its nanometer size, repetitive display of the epitope,and good mimicry of the epitope 's natural con guration. Similar results were also observed by Sharma et al. when theyincorporated multiple copies of the HA protein on the surfaceof the VLPs; HA is a surface-exposed glycoprotein and is the most highly immunogenic target for IAV. Immunization of IAV-infected mice with HA-conjugated surface VLPs providedfull protection from morbidity and mortality without the needfor additional adjuvants. 8Thus, we observed that VLPs based spike Sprotein of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were eective in stimulating a strong antibody response. The antibody response is enhanced in the presence of adjuvantsor by concentrating multiple repeating units of the Sprotein on the surface of the VLPs.ACS Applied Nano Materials www.acsanm.org Review https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.0c01978 ACS Appl. Nano Mater. 2020, 8557 85808571 Wang et al. designed novel chimeric VLPs using a canine parvovirus structural protein with the receptor-binding domain(RBD) of MERS-CoV.125Parvovirus-like particles are very stable, highly immunogenic, and do not cause disease inhumans, making them a safe expression platform, while the RBD unit of MERS-CoV is a major antigenic determinant for antibody induction. RBD-speci c humoral antibody responses were detected in mice treated with these VLPs 2 weeks afterinjection and were signi cantly enhanced in the presence of a polyriboinosinic acid [poly(I:C)] adjuvant. The VLPsproduced a Th1-based response cant IL-2 secretion, VLPs Th2 responses, producing , IL-2, and IL-4 responses. The IgG antibody titer in mice treated with VLPs along with the adjuvant showed a 320-fold increase in mouse sera. The poly(I:C) adjuvant is able to activate a relatively high numberof DCs in lymph nodes to generate a robust immune response.Cross-virus VLP design was also studied by Carter et al. 132 SARS-CoV polyprotein 1a (pp1a) self-assembled into VLPsthat pulmonary brosis (IPF) caused by Herpesvirus saimiri These studies show that VLPs developed using subunits from onevirus can serve as e ective vaccines against other viruses as well. ARTES Biotechnology has utilized duck hepatitis B small surface antigen to design an enveloped VLP (eVLP)technology called METAVAX to deliver SARS-CoV-2 spikeSprotein-loaded vaccines. ARTES Biotechnology is also utilizing another vaccine technology using capsid VLPs(cVLPs), called SplitCore, to develop vaccines using SARS-CoV-2 Santigens. Ufovax, a spin-o vaccine company from Scripps Research, is also developing COVID-19 vaccines using self-assembling protein VLPs (1c-SApNP technology). Similar COVID-19 vaccines with VLPs VLPs); most of these vaccines arealready in either in the preclinical or clinical trial phase. 130 4.2. Chitosan, Protein Cage, and Polymer Nano- particles for Targeted Vaccine Delivery. NPs have been widely explored for drug delivery applications due to theirfavorable size, photothermal and magnetic properties, con-trolled release, and easy functionalization, enabling targeted attachment to speci c cell types. 133137Many researchers have also attempted to utilize these attributes for targeted vaccinedelivery to cellular components of the immune system. DCsare special sentinel cells, a type of APCs. Various strategiesemployed for selective targeting of DCs have shown greatpotential in the design of low-dose vaccines. 138Raghuwanshi et al. designed a vaccine targeting DCs using chitosan NPs asdelivery vehicles.93Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide that binds strongly to nucleic acids due to its cationic charge,139,140 which makes these NPs ideal nucleic acid delivery vehicles, further aided by their excellent biocompatible, biodegradable,and nontoxic nature. Raghuwanshi et al. formulated NPs byloading negatively charged plasmid DNA encoding nucleocap-sid ( N) a SARS-CoV vaccine antigen on cationic biotinylated chitosan NPs. Compared to the Sprotein, the N protein is more highly conserved in coronaviruses, which o ers the ability to design broad-spectrum e ectiveness across various mutating strands of the Coronaviridae family.

Naked DNA is ine ective in crossing mucosal barriers and is rapidly degraded by nucleases,while chitosan NPs transiently open the tight junctions toallow mucosa. c as IFN- and Th1 cytokine responses, were stimulated. Compared to systemic vaccination, mucosalvaccination is often more e ective against mucosal pathogens due to the ability of these pathogens to induce secretory nasalantibodies. 93,126Wiley et al. designed a safe broad-spectrum vaccine against multiple coronaviruses using a protein cage NP(PCN) that targets mucosal cells.126The PCN does not contain any antigen-speci c proteins but is derived from a small heat shock protein (sHsp 16.5) instead, which causes theformation of inducible bronchus-associated The iBALT strategy provides an alternative approachfor broad-spectrum viral protection in the lungs. The PCN- induced iBALT structures contain B cells, CD4 +T cells, DCs, and CD8+T cells. CD4+and CD8+T cells accumulated rapidly in the lungs of PCN-treated mice. These iBALT responsesprotected the mice from lethal doses of various respiratoryviruses (H1N1, SARS, RSV). Protection against SARS-CoVwas already apparent within 3 days after infection, implyingthat innate mechanisms are also modulated by this PCNtreatment (see Figure 12 b). Despite the strong antiviral response, no histological damage was observed in the alveolararchitecture of the lungs, and eosinophilic in flux into the lungs was reduced. Thus, this PCN vaccination targeting iBALTmicrostructures can nonspeci cally enhance immune protec- tion against a diversity of respiratory viruses and in the absenceof pulmonary in flammation, thus e ectively protecting the host (see Figure 12 c). For cell-speci c targeted vaccination strategies, NPs with dimensions of 100 nm have been generally found to be goodfor cellular uptake by DCs via phagocytosis, since they resemble the natural targets for DCs, such as viruses orbacteria. 118Several studies have found that the submicron size is optimal for mucosal cell uptake and that NPs less than 200nm in size are more readily transported by draining lymphnodes. 140NPs with sizes of 20 200 nm have long circulation times and become enriched in lymph nodes, leading toenhanced lymphatic transport, allowing direct access tolymphoid-node-resistant DCs. 118This feature enhances antigen uptake and presentation to B cells, enhancing the humoral response, or to T cells, allowing immunomodula-tion.118Cationic NPs have been widely used to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the lungs for the treatment ofvarious respiratory diseases over the years via intranasal andintratracheal routes. 143To combat a rapidly spreading virus such as SARS-CoV-2, mRNA (mRNA)-based vaccines arepromising candidates, since they can be scaled rapidly.Cationic lipid NPs encapsulating mRNA are being widelyexplored for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. 144Lipid NPs (LNPs) can deliver mRNA to the cytoplasm, where themRNA can undergo direct translation to the target protein;this process can then trigger APCs and activation of B cells andT cells. 144A vaccine developed by Moderna in collaboration with NIAID, containing mRNA encapsulated inside lipid NPs,is currently in phase-2 human clinical trials.130,145Moderna 's previous MERS and SARS vaccines developed using a similardesign had demonstrated 90% reduction in viral load.145In addition, vaccines BioNTech/P zer/Fosun Pharma (LNP lipid NP-encapsulated mRNA vaccines, currently in preclinical trials. 130 Another type of NP used to deliver genetic materials to the lungs via nasal instillation is calcium phosphate (CaP).146 Since CaP is a naturally occurring substance in mammalianhard tissues, it is a safe and biocompatible biomedical carrier.Additionally, acting as a mucosal adjuvant, CaP can initiate animmune response stronger than that induced by aluminumsalts and for longer durations. 129CaP is often encapsulated with polymers such as poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) andpolyethylenimine (PEI), to increase cellular uptake.146PEI is known for facilitating targeted delivery and stimulatingimmune responses in alveolar cells and macrophages, alongwith other polymeric derivatives of PLGA, such as poly( DL- Figure 12.

Copyright 2009 Wiley et al.ACS Applied Nano Materials www.acsanm.org to their biocompatibility and excellent safety pro le, PLGA and PLA have already been approved by the FDA to be used invarious drug delivery systems for humans. 80,140Using a thin (sub-20 nm) shell of PLGA with a large aqueous core, Lin etal. made a hollow NP to entrap a soluble stimulator of IFNgenes (STING) adjuvant (see Figure 13 ). 127Due to the acid- sensitive PLGA hydrolysis, the NPs readily release the adjuvantupon cellular uptake, as seen in Figure 13 . Localized at the endoplasmic reticulum, STING is with the spike protein, theSTING-PLGA NP size increases to 148 nm, which leads to a virus-like distribution of the (Addavax) induced signi cantly higher levels of antigen-speci c antibodies due to balanced Th1 and Th2 responses. Higher antibody titers and longer-lasting responses due to a balanced Th1/Th2 response werealso observed by Jung et al., as described previosuly. 11The polymer-based NPs with STING and MF59 adjuvants weresuperior in their ability to mount humoral responses comparedto free STING agonists or MF59 alone. This study stronglydemonstrated the advantages of hollow polymeric NPs asvaccine delivery vehicles due to their biocompatibility, sizeconsistency, colloidal stability, tunable adjuvant loading, pH-responsive release, and antigen functionalizability. 4.3. Quantum Dots and Gold Nanoparticles. QDs, with sizes much smaller than the aforementioned NPs, have alsobeen utilized for designing vaccines against coronaviruses.Positively charged carbon QDs with dimensions of 1.6 nm, made from curcumin, were studied as vaccines against PEDV, amodel coronavirus. 76Although these CDs primarily blocked viral cell entry, they also induced the production of ISGs thatsuppress viral replication and budding. Ag 2S nanocrystals(NCs), another type of QD, were also found to positively regulate ISGs and the expression of proin flammatory cytokines.74However, among inorganic NPs, the most commonly employed NPs in vaccine design are AuNPs.Sekimukai et al. discovered that AuNPs can act as both anantigen carrier for the SARS-CoV spike Sprotein and an adjuvant. 121AuNPs bind to the Sprotein via electrostatic interactions, forming a protein corona around the AuNPs.Mice immunized with these NPs showed Th1 and Th2responses; however, these responses were accompanied byallergic in flammation and eosinophilic in ltration. Chen et al. utilized AuNPs to formulate synthetic VLPs (sVLPs) by incubating 100 nm AuNPs in a solution containing the spike S protein of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV),as shown in Figure 14 . 122Following removal of free protein, antigen-loaded AuNPs were recovered that resembled naturalviral proteins, as seen in Figure 14 . Protein corona formation increased the NP size to 139 nm, which remained stable over a7 day period, with each particle retaining approximately 200 250 spike proteins. Compared to inoculation with freeproteins, vaccination with these VLPs showedenhanced lymphatic antigen delivery (6-fold), stronger anti-body titers, increased T cell response, and reduced symptoms(see Figure 14 ). Thus, there are multiple advantages to using AuNPs as next-generation va ccine delivery agents. (1) Inorganic NPs such as AuNPs have high surface energy,leading to spontaneous protein corona formation. 121As a result, a smaller amount of antigen is required than VLPs tomake antigen-exposing NPs of sizes comparable to those ofcoronaviruses, CD4 +T cell and B cell responses.147 Easy functionalization of AuNPs allows the loading of variousother nucleic acids as well. (2) With the NP acting as anadjuvant itself, additional adjuvants are not necessary. 121,147 (3) AuNPs used as antigen carriers also stimulate phagocytic activity of lymphoid cells, stimulate APCs, and induce therelease of in flammatory mediators. 147Localization Characterization of adjuvant-loaded viromimetic nanoparticles.

AuNPs primarily enter cells viaphagocytosis, stimulating macrophages, DCs, and lympho-cytes. 147Phagocytosis of NPs is determined by their size and shape.147AuNPs with dimensions of 40 100 nm are ideal for phagocytosis, while shape dependence follows the orderellipsoid > spheres > rods > cubes, although in some cases,rods are internalized better than spheres. 118,148,149However, larger spherical virus-like AuNPs generate the strongest antibody responses. (4) AuNPs have good stability and lowcytotoxicity.88,148 5. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES 5.1. Nanoparticles for Diagnostics. NPs have been applied to various kinds of virus detection methods. Metal NPsand QDs with unique optical properties have the advantages ofenhanced sensitivity for optical biosensing. Meanwhile, MNPsare mainly applied to the virus extraction process due to theirmagnetic properties. Additionally, the nanohybrid structurescombine the advantages of each type of NP to improve theeciency of virus detection. Recently, NP-based virus detection has been reported as a promising technique to detect the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. With further research and development, NPs will undoubtedly play an important role in improving not only coronavirus detection e ciency but also other biological pathogen diagnoses. 5.2. Nanoparticles for Therapeutics. Overall, the studies covered in this section show that various NPs can be used to design drugs aimed at disrupting the attachment of SARS- CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor and blocking the cell entry process while themselves remaining largely nontoxic toward the host cells. E ective antiviral therapies, especially in the early stage of infection, are vitally important to halt viral proliferation long enough for the immune system to respond to the virus and limit cellular damage in flicted by viral invasion as well as to minimize genetic mutations caused by the high replication frequency of the virus, which might lead to therapeutic resistance. NPs with various structures, composi- tions, and conjugations have been fabricated and evaluated in Figure 14.

The antiviral performance,stability, and biocompatib ility of these NPs have been rigorously investigated on di erent human-infecting viruses ranging from members of the coronavirus family to otherviruses with close structural similarity to SARS-CoV-2 itself.Using novel antiviral approaches with flexible combinations, many NPs have also been demonstrated to be e ective against a broad spectrum of viruses with minimal cytotoxicity,suggesting that these NPs are good research candidates forNP-based antiviral therapies to ght the COVID-19 pandemic. 5.3. Nanoparticles as Immunogenic Agents for Vaccines. Overall, the studies covered in this section o er valuable insight needed for the development of vaccines for COVID-19. The following four conclusions can be drawn: (1) Self-assembled VLPs, template-based and supported VLPs, andsynthetic VLPs can all be systematically formulated in sizes andshapes that mimic those of original coronaviruses. Thesefeatures help induce strong immune responses while avoidingexposure to the virulent genetic components of the virus itself.(2) Repetitive decoration of antigens on the surface of NPvaccines can enhance immune responses, even when usingsmaller subsets of the proteins; this e ect can be further enhanced by matching the natural con guration of the epitopes. Vaccine developm ent has typically exploited coronavirus Sprotein epitopes, but Nprotein epitopes can also be utilized to design broad-spectrum vaccines. (3) NPsoer the opportunity to combine antigen delivery abilities with adjuvant properties. (4) Vaccines targeted speci cally toward mucosal cells, DCs, and lymph nodes generate strongerlocalized immune responses against respiratory viruses suchas SARS-CoV-2. Nanosized particles (40 200 nm) are especially suitable for targeted delivery to mucosal and alveolarstructures, mimicking natural infection routes and inducingdirect immune responses in the worst a ected tissues. Thus, NPs are expected to play a major role in the ght against COVID-19. The optical and magnetic properties ofvarious NPs can be utilized for building diagnostic test kits.The stark morphological and physicochemical similarities ofSARS-CoV-2 with synthetic NPs also make NPs a powerfultool for intervention. NPs can be systematically functionalizedwith various proteins, polymers, and functional groups toperform speci c inhibitory functions while also acting as excellent delivery vehicles. NPs o er possibilities for fast and safe vaccine development using subunit proteins instead ofwhole viruses. Additionally, NPs can also be utilized to makebroad-spectrum respiratory drugs and vaccines that can protect us from seasonal viruses and prepare us for future pandemics as well.
