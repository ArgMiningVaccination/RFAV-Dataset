Kikwitgeneral (350 beds) and Kikwit II (100beds).When the Ebola outbreak initiallyoccurred, it wasn't clear if peoplewere suffering from a bacillarydysentery or a viral hemorrhagicfever such as Ebola.Transmission and SymptomsEbola is transmitted by contact withinfected secretions bloodand SymptomsAdvanced symptoms includedkidney and liver failure, hiccups,tachypnea and internal and externalbleeding.Survivors improve at the two-weekmark.3Infection Time PeriodPeople can be infected anywherefrom two days to three weeks beforebecoming symptomatic.In Kikwit, Democratic Republic of theCongo, mean documentedincubation time was six days.Once symptomatic, people usuallydie within two to six days.Initial Infection of StaffLate April - A hospital employee wasoperated on for what was thought tobe an acute abdomen.One week later - The operating staffbegan showing symptoms anddying.Many patients and staff membersfled the hospital.Initial Infection of StaffThe only people who remained werevolunteer health workers andpatients too sick to leave (e.g. TBward).On May 4 - An isolation unit wascreated, but not turned into a trulyeffective unit until May 11-14 due tolimited resources and knowledge.Beginning of The OutbreakThe hospital had limited supplies of:-Protective-barrier supplies (masks,gowns, bed covers)-Fresh water (needed diesel fuel topower the pumps)-Electricity-Waste disposal systems andlatrines-IV tubing and supplies-Medications \"Odoch Walter [seated], 21, wasvomiting blood. An ambulance driveris spraying him before he puts him inthe vehicle. In case he did have Ebola,they were trying to keep him and theambulance 'clean.'\"To be sprayed like that in the face, bythis person who's completely coveredin plastic and rubber and treats you asa threat to their life\u2014it's all prettyhorrible. He died two days later.\"Supplies ArrivedProblems encountered:-Varying forms and styles ofsupplies with no consistency(difficult to train and becomefamiliar with).-Supplies were inappropriate fortropical climate (e.g., goggles notface shields).-Hoarding.-Theft.4By the Time Help Arrived164 identified cases - of which 134died (82%).63 health workers infected - of which47 died (75%).Approximately 40% of cases were inhealth workers.After May 11, 93 new cases werereported.In total, of the 36 healthcare workerson the isolation units, 8 died (22%).Staff Psychological IssuesStaff working on the isolation unitsreported becoming psychologicallyisolated and stigmatized.-Family (afraid of becoming ill,nursing mothers could not nurse).-Neighbors (rumor of healthcareworkers intentionally killing people,unable to shop local markets).-Medical staff not working on theisolation unit avoided those who did.Additional Staff StressStaff were taking care of colleagueswho were infected and dying.-Constant daily reminder ofpersonal risks.-Resulted in either isolation fromsick colleagues or engaging indenial of own risks.-Infected staff who survived,experienced trouble withneighbors and survivor's guilt.Staff StressMany staff did well during the initialcrisis, but began to show signs ofpsychological stress when the crisisbecame more routine.Post-emergency letdown eventhough crisis continued.At that point, they had to face issuesof daily living (buying food), dailysafety issues, and still dealing with alife-threatening situation/virus.Staff StressLess busy with more time to reflect.Have time to appreciate loss ofcolleagues.Anticipation waiting for next wave ofillness.Helpful FactorsMaintain a sense of professionalism.If an individual loses theirprofessional identity, they are morelikely to be devastated, particularly ifit was their major or only motivatingor sustaining factor. Staff conflict,administrative struggles, orprofessional disapproval areparticularly dangerous to identify atthese times.5Helpful to maintain identity throughpositive teamwork, support fromcolleagues, shared responsibilities,and recognition of sacrifices made inthe line of duty.Lessons LearnedBe prepared to take care of the entireregion or city.Have a plan to handle usualemergencies such as pregnancy,appendicitis, MLS, trauma.Lessons LearnedUse liaisons with governmentofficials, and if possible have anindividual whose job it is to obtainneeded resources such as gasolineand to keep possession of resources(i.e., prevent looting).Expect an initial loss of staff, eitherthrough illness or people leavingtheir posts.Lessons LearnedMust provide incentives orrecognition for staff, whether theyare volunteers or permanentmembers. If not they will desertduring the time of crisis or bedemoralized after the event,inhibiting rebuilding.Need to fight the elements as well asthe illness.Lessons LearnedMaintain the physical strength ofstaff with food, water, and safe placeto take breaks.Provide protection for your hospitalstaff and, if possible, their families.Understand the culture in which anoutbreak occurs.Hurricane Katrina -New hospitals-4400 patients with HIV6Hurricane Katrina -New OrleansPost-storm (as of April 13, 2006)-24% of population has not returned-Only 15 of 22 local hospitals re-opened-Only 2000 hospital beds available(1.99 beds per 1000)-Tulane medical school lost 1/3 ofits faculty-LSU medical school, lost 1/4 of itsfacultyScope of ProblemRed Cross caring for 50,000 peoplein shelters.Approximately one million residentswent to hotels or friends and family.9,000 hospital beds lost (for wholearea affected by storm).Most of those left behind were poorwith no resources.Universal Problems for AllHospitalsLightingAir-conditioningTelephone serviceElevators - patient controlMedical Problems FacedComplications in patients withuntreated chronic diseaseLoss of or inability to fill medicationsInability of patients to contact theirlocal physiciansDifficulty caring for patients onventilatorsChallenges of evacuating a largenumber of sick individualsDehydrationMediaOne hospital administrator wasquoted as saying, \"the media is ourrescue plan now.\"Hospital staff contacted local newsand radio programs which helped tonotify local and national officials ofplight.National attention from CNN causedrenewed efforts by the NationalGuard to evacuate certain locations.Safety and SecurityHospitals became a target for lootersand violence.-Money-Drugs-Supplies-Hostages-Unclear motivation (Why shootdown a rescue helicopter?)7Lessons LearnedMaintain internal structure of controlto maintain order, sense of purpose,and hope.Be prepared to make decisions thatare best for your institution withoutexternal approval.Try to contact external authority.Don't wait to be contacted.Lessons LearnedDo not expect or count on externalauthority to be aware of yoursituation or needs.Even though national disasterresponse plans call for institution tobe self-sufficient for 48 hours, it isbest to prepare for 7 days.Have surge capacity for patients,families of staff, and storm refugees.Lessons LearnedHave voluntary spiritual andpsychological support available forgroups and individuals.Psychological support should besupportive, practical, and focused onthe here and now. \"Do not opendoors which cannot be closed.\"Lessons LearnedHave safe areas for staff todecompress and rest if possible.Try to provide for staff needs, suchas food, hydration, and creaturecomforts when possible (coffee,clean underwear).Use highlight needs of yourinstitution.Lessons LearnedHave a family/communication liaisonofficer to help with rumor control andto aid staff and families dealing withissues regarding family.Have a means of internal radiocommunication - VHS radios.Hurricane Katrina Analysis of the ResponseEffortHurricane Katrina dealt some familiarblows in emergency response: thefailure of communication systemsand resultant difficulties challenged responseefforts in this disaster as with othersbefore it.8Hurricane Katrina Analysis of the ResponseEffortKatrina also pushed some responseelements, such as plans for surgecapacity in the healthcare workforce,to their limits for the first time inrecent memory.Hurricane Katrina Analysis of the ResponseEffortThe public health and medicalresponse to Katrina has also calledattention to the matter of disasterplanning in healthcare facilities, andthe potential role of healthinformation technology in expeditingthe care of displaced persons.Hurricane Katrina Gaps in EmergencyPreparednessHospitals and medical providersoverwhelmed, with doctors andnurses often working with fewsupplies, in unsanitary conditions,and without electricity.Hurricane Katrina Gaps in EmergencyPreparednessInsufficient measures taken to carefor the chronically ill, those innursing homes, and the disabled inthe event of a mass emergency orneeded evacuation.Hurricane Katrina Gaps in EmergencyPreparednessStoppage in the chain of delivery offood, water, medicine, and othersupplies due to the nation's \"just intime economy.\"Disruption of emergencycommunication systems.Inconsistencies in infectious diseaseand public hazard response.Hurricane Katrina Gaps in EmergencyPreparednessProviding limited, slow, andinconsistent information to thepublic.9Spanish Lady Flu1918-1920 - data reconsidered.Estimated deaths - 62 million.Healthcare facilities in major UScities overwhelmed.
