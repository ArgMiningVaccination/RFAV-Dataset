Ideally, therapeutic modalities should help control symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life while causing minimal or no toxic effects. In this regard, it is worth examining cannabidiol (CBD) for its potential anticancer properties. CBD may possess antitumor activity through several mechanisms, including regulating reactive oxygen species, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, and immune modulation. In addition, pre-clinical studies indicate that CBD is a potential modulator of growth factors and induces apoptosis in tumor cells. This review summarizes the evidence regarding the effects of CBD as a non-toxic adjuvant in cancer care. It's a tremendous conference. When you deal with hormones, there's a lot of detail. I have been doing this now for nine years and I've learned a lot in this conference. There are so many people that bring different expertise and if you sit there and listen, you will find something new that you can apply in practice. Gerrie Lindeque, MD, South Africa I highly recommend that doctors look into the conference for a number of reasons. First of all, the information is excellent and the practical techniques to help patients get better is there, but there is also the camaraderie. The people who come to these conferences are inspiring to me as a practitioner. That's worth just as much to me as the information. Alex McLellan, ND, Nova Scotia, Canada After I took the course, I realized this was a whole paradigm shift, a completely different way of looking at thyroid function. Instead of looking at it from the brain down, how the brain instructs the thyroid gland, it is looking from the thyroid receptors up . . . by looking from the bottom up, that really listening to people's symptoms. Without some guidance from other physicians that really understood the protocol, I might still not understand how to do it. Tedde Rinker, DO, California I attended the conference at Stowe, Vermont. The number of varied programs was really a good introduction to many medical problem treatment areas. It was a good chance to meet other professionals and time to have interchange and receive CME credits. I would highly recommend physicians to consider going to the Restorative Medicine Conferences. Joseph Fiacable, MD, Fort Wayne, IN As practitioners, we are always looking for the best ways to serve our patients needs. The Restorative Medicine Conferences provide insights into the healing arts that are not covered in naturopathic and medical schools, and it amazing to watch the dramatic changes as patients get well the therapies really do work! The Conference has cutting edge scientific knowledge and information that will change forever the way you practice medicine. I am grateful to have these valuable tools in my practice, tools that can help so many people. The Association for the Advancement of Restorative Medicine (AARM) is a non-profit medical association whose mission is to promote the use of, and education surrounding Restorative Medicines amongst medical professionals. AARM members are part of a community of like minded professionals who meet multiple times a year to discuss their latest findings in their respective fields. Through these conferences, as well as our herbal Fellowship program, AARM hopes to advance the use of Restorative Medicine as a foundation for health. Restorative Medicine focuses on the importance of a balanced endocrine system through recognizing how the different chemical messengers influence each other. Stabilizing the endocrine system as a whole, rather than treating a single individual hormone, helps to optimize health and promote longevity. The ultimate goal of Restorative Medicine is to reduce or eliminate the need for ongoing medical treatment, when possible, by truly restoring health at its core. There are several ways you can get involved in our movement! To start, we suggest becoming an AARM Member, which will give you access to botanical medicine and nutrition monographs, a listing in our practitioner directory, 20% off conference registrations, and more! Then, once you're ready, we invite you to attend one of our conferences or to take our Herbal Fellowship Course, both of which present opportunities to earn CME Credits! Or, if you're still exploring what Restorative Medicine has to offer, we recommend reading The Journal of Restorative Medicine, "}
