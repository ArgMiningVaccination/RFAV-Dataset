Statement of the Perceived Problem The approaches to the preclinical development of oncology drug products have been and continue to be independently discussed and developed in Europe, th e USA and Japan. The preclinical approaches are not agreed on acro ss product classes, betwee n small molecules of different molecular mechanisms and across product classes such as biologics and drugs. The available disharmonized guidance has resulted in inefficient use of animal resources, and ineffective drug development in a critical area of human health. The European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EME A) has official preclinical guidance for the development of cytotoxic cancer treatments. Wh ile cytotoxic agents c onstitute a decreasing class of agents in development, guidance is needed to address the newer, non-cytotoxic (signaling pathways) and cont ext dependent (tumor mutati on specific) mechanisms for treatment of cancer now in development. Nor are biologic approaches that include both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic mechanism addr essed in these guidances. The FDA is developing guidances for biologi c therapeutics and drugs that wi ll broadly address preclinical development of the various mechanisms of cancer therapy. Further, in the context of FDA's Exploratory IND Guidance, some preclinical ap proaches to early investigative oncology drug development are briefly outlined, although not lim ited to this therapeutic application. The MHLW is currently developing pr eclinical guidance that will a ddress various mechanisms of anticancer therapy, but will not include biologic s in its scope. Thus, there is substantial concern that, when these guidances are complete d, they will not offer a harmonized approach for preclinical developmen t of drugs needed for the treatment of cancer. This independent proliferation of guidances focused on preclinical issues in oncology drug development highlights the critical need fo r guidance on this topic and indicates the inadequacy of the current state. While these current independent approaches have their merits, the dissociated efforts will likely result in disparate recommendations that will adversely impact global development of needed cancer therapies. The result will be both delays in the availability of needed agents and waste of valuable resources, including test animals. Amplifying this problem, is the fact that most ICH S guidances and M3 either explicitly or implicitly exclude cancer therapies from their recommendations, yet there is no alternative offered for a harmonized product development stra tegy. As a result, M3 or S6 guidance is often inappropriately relied on (or expected) particularly fo r non-cytotoxic and biologic agents in development of cancer therapeutics. -1- FINAL S9 Concept Paper Endorsed : 10 May 2007 An ICH guidance that focuses on preclinical recommendations to support the development and marketing of cancer therapeutic agents for the treatment of primary cancer, would: 1) address the current state of disharmony noted above; 2) facilitate development of agents meeti ng a global critical public health need; 3) result in refinement and a relevant reduc tion in the use of experimental animals in an area of extensive drug research and development; and 4) address the gaps in preclinical developm ent guidance that have arisen from the new therapeutic classes of targets identif ied from the human genome project, and recent advances in cancer biology. Issues to be Resolved 1) Scope of the guidance: Therapeutic cl asses to be included; Preclinical development approach in relation to pr oduct class and how to cover the breadth of the product classes in the oncology gui dance; classes to be excluded are therapeutic vaccines, cell and gene therapy. 2) Necessity for long term precl inical testing to support early clinical trials 3) Duration, species, type of non-c linical safety studies to support the early and late development phases 4) Harmonization of approaches to the exte nt justified for biological and small molecules Type of Expert Working Group We recommend setting up an Expert Working Group (EWG) which includes representatives/experts of the six ICH parties and observers on request. Timetable The EWG should be summoned to the ICH meeti ng in Yokohama in Oc tober 2007 to draw up a step 1 document. Existing draft MHLW a nd FDA Guidances as well as existing EMEA guidances should be consulted as an initial fram ework. Subsequently, the EWG is to be asked to release a step 2 document by October 2008 and a step 3 document by June 2009. A step 4 document should be completed by early 2010. This aggressive time line could be anticipated based on the advanced work th at is currently being undertaken on guidance development by MHLW and FDA. Parties Making the Proposal PhRMA proposed this issue as a new Safety topic for ICH at the October 2006 meeting. All parties supported the developmen t of "}
