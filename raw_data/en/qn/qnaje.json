When sleeplessness becomes chronic, mental well-being can suffer significantly. That's why integrative psychiatrist Henry Emmons, MD, believes that [prioritizing sleep](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/natural-mental-health-sleep-yourself-well/) is the best way to promote optimal mental health. \"When sleep falls into place, depression and anxiety can sometimes improve on their own, and natural remedies are much gentler and safer than prescription sleep aids.\" Emmons considers [magnesium the most crucial micronutrient for treating sleep](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/how-magnesium-helps-you-sleep/) issues, but he also suggests these herbal remedies: - Valerian root interacts with GABA and serotonin receptors to calm nerves and improve sleep; it's especially good for those who suffer from anxiety or hyperactivity. - Passionflower can increase the time we spend in restorative slow-wave sleep, leading to fewer disturbances and better-quality rest overall. - CBD stands for cannabidiol, a chemical found in hemp plants. CBD calms the nervous system, and studies suggest it may improve the overall quality of sleep.

Notably, [dark chocolate](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/is-dark-chocolate-actually-good-for-us/) contributes to both, according to psychiatrist Drew Ramsey, MD. He contends that the flavanols it contains may help combat brain fog. But when the fog persists, there are supplements that can help. Functional nutritionist Jesse Haas, CNS, LN, recommends these herbs: - Tulsi (a.k.a. [holy basil](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/how-to-use-holy-basil-for-calm/)) has been shown to improve mood and cognitive functioning, including memory. [Rhodiola](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/how-to-use-rhodiola-for-energy-and-focus/)can help enhance memory, learning, and cognitive performance. - Curcumin and Bacopa monnieri have been linked to improved memory and attention in the aging brain.

But in times of acute stress, certain remedies can offer additional relief. \"For situational stress, I look to remedies that tamp down stress hormones and support the adrenals,\" says Emmons. Here are some good options: - Kava root contains kavalactones, compounds that influence a range of neurobiological activities related to anxiety, including modulating GABA receptors. [Ashwagandha](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/recipe/evening-ashwagandha-latte/)is an adaptogenic herb that can reduce cortisol levels and improve sleep. - L-theanine is an amino acid that can settle some physiological responses to stress, such as elevated heart rate.

Fatigue To treat general sluggishness, Haas focuses on stabilizing blood sugar by [reducing caffeine](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/how-much-caffeine-is-right-for-me/) and sugar. Ramsey encourages clients to go gluten-free: He says [gluten](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/gluten-the-whole-story/) isn't a root cause of depression for most people, but that people with gluten and other food sensitivities may experience fatigue, headaches, joint aches, and mood changes when they eat those foods. Emmons maintains that nutrient status must be part of the equation when addressing low energy. \"I always think in terms of systems,\" he explains. Emmons suggests these supplements: [Coenzyme Q10](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/coq10-the-miracle-molecule/)supports energy production at the cellular level, in part by [supporting mitochondria](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/the-care-and-feeding-of-your-mitochondria/). Individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome typically have low levels of CoQ10, but supplementing can benefit energy levels for everyone. - Lithium orotate is a milder version of prescription lithium (which is lithium carbonate). Emmons suggests that it can be a good choice if fatigue is accompanied by a low mood.
