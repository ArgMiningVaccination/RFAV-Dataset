Revel in relaxation and indulge in the bliss of our spa-like setting as you re-hydrate and recharge. Intravenous (IV) therapy is gaining popularity, and for good reason. IV therapy can offer many health and wellness benefits. If you're wondering if IV nutrient therapy is right for you, it's essential to take the time to research the benefits of this unique treatment before deciding. At the biostation, we offer several nutrient IV therapies to help nourish your body, relax your mind, and improve your well-being. IV therapy administers nutrients directly into the bloodstream, allowing your body to absorb them immediately. It's the quickest way to deliver nutrients to your body because it skips the digestive system, enabling your organs to absorb nutrients directly, resulting in a 90% to 100% absorption rate. In comparison, nutrients taken orally must go through the digestive system and only offer a 20% to 50% absorption rate. IV nutrient therapy offers therapeutic and preventive nutrients to stimulate your immune system and boost your energy levels. Although it may seem like a new trend, doctors have used it for centuries. Medical professionals started using IV nutrient therapy as early as the 1600s by injecting medication directly into a patient's veins. Unfortunately, many quickly abandoned IV therapy due to poor hygiene practices. IV therapy saw a resurgence during World War I when doctors recognized it as a viable treatment for saving lives. In the 1960s, Dr. John Myers created The Myer's Cocktail, which contained vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, and B vitamins. His world-famous cocktail was effective against various issues, including migraines, acute muscle spasms, asthma attacks, fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome, upper respiratory infections, seasonal allergic rhinitis, fibromyalgia, chronic sinusitis, cardiovascular disease, and more. IV nutrient therapy can help with a wide variety of issues, from dehydration to a lack of energy, and it can also aid in repairing and detoxifying. Some of the uses for IV nutrient therapy include the following: At the biostation, we offer IV nutrient therapies to: Our IV nutrient therapies can help improve your overall wellness in as little as 20 minutes. Depending on your needs, our therapies may or may not include blood work on file and can take anywhere from 20 minutes to four hours. In the past, hospitals and healthcare facilities used IV nutrient therapies for patients who were nutrient-deficient, dehydrated, or unable to take oral medications. Today, anyone can benefit from IV nutrient therapies at clinics such as the biostation. If you're experiencing an illness, such as the common cold or flu, IV nutrient therapy may help give your immune system a boost. It can also help replace lost fluids, replenish electrolytes, and more to help restore your body's nutrient levels to an optimal state. Stress from everyday life may cause your energy levels to plummet, and nutrient IV therapy can give you a much-needed energy boost. If you're an athlete, nutrient IV therapy can help you recover from the push of physical activity. IV nutrient therapy can deliver various supplements, vitamins, and minerals, resulting in many health benefits. These include, but are not limited to, the following: As people explore what IV therapy can do for them, new benefits become apparent. IV nutrient therapies offer benefits without any gastrointestinal side effects, loss of potency, or absorption issues, allowing the nutrients to go directly into your bloodstream for faster effectiveness. IV nutrient therapy recipients have reported the following benefits: Before receiving IV nutrient therapy, you need to have a medical history evaluation completed. Several IV nutrient therapies at the biostation require you to complete lab work to ensure you receive the right amount of nutrients your body needs, while others do not require blood work. After the initial consultation, your age, weight, and medical condition will determine the quantity and rate of IV fluid you receive. A qualified nurse or doctor will disinfect your skin at the injection site, usually your arm, before locating a vein and inserting the IV catheter. Once the IV is in place, you can sit back and relax for the duration of your IV nutrient therapy treatment, with most treatments taking 30 to 90 minutes. You can read, watch your favorite show, or even nap during the procedure. The only discomfort you may experience is during the initial puncture as the nurse or doctor inserts the IV. You'll most likely notice the effects of your IV nutrient therapy session 12 to 24 hours following an infusion. Some people start to feel the effects immediately after the treatment. You can expect to continue enjoying the impact of your IV nutrient therapy treatment anywhere from eight days to three weeks after your treatment, depending on the type of IV nutrient therapy you receive.
