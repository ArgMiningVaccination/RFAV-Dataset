KELLOGG FOUNDATION 75 YEARS pages contain four reports* that FrameWorks Institute prepared for the W .K. Kellogg Foundation. These reports explore how people thinkabout food and our food system and continue the process of informing ourcommunication work. This research is the first phase of a larger strategic frame analysis of the food system, initiated at our 2005 Food and Society Conference. Strategic frame analysis is a com-munications research process that helps us understand how the public thinks about anissue and then tests ways that we might prompt different ways of thinking. While fram-ing research uses traditional research methods, like in-depth interviews, focus groups,and telephone surveys, that is where the similarity ends. This method, combining the-ory and practice from the cognitive and social sciences, allows advocates to \"preflight\"their arguments by providing empirical evidence of the effects of various messages onpublic understanding and support. The result is not a bumper sticker, or a new \"spin,\"but rather a more profound understanding of why the public thinks the way it does andwhat it would require to engage them in a broader view of the food system, one morein keeping with experts' views. These initial reports are intended to help the Food and Society community begin to identify some of the barriers we now all face in our communications, starting withunderstanding how people reason about food system issues. From this understandingwe will move to the next level of research which is testing ways to shift understanding. Please share these reports with your colleagues, but keep in mind that they represent an unfinished picture and should not be thought to hold the answers to framing thefood system. Strategic frame analysis is an iterative process; final recommendationsevolve over time across a body of research. The recommendations in these reports arepreliminary , and will be tested in three more phases of research. The next phaseincludes multiple focus groups. A parallel project will look at simple metaphors thatcan make the food system less abstract and more concrete. Finally , these two aspects ofmessage development will be further tested in a large national survey . From everyround of testing will emerge findings that will figure in the final recommendations.Please note that these reports are thought pieces leading to a larger set of suggestions. Atthe very least, concrete evidence of what is not working found in this report can help winnow out unproductive elements in our current messaging. That said, we will not have the complete picture of how we might influence ways of thinking about food until the quantitative and qualitative research is finished in 2006.At that point, we will have much clearer ideas for message creation to share with you.We'll be conducting training sessions around strategic framing and its applications foryour own message development. These reports mark the beginning of our understand-ing about how people think about food, not the end. The real creative work will needto be done by advocates who can take the outline of the message that emerges from this research and apply it to specific issues and opportunities. ii* Standard rules governing citation and intellectual property usage apply .We hope these reports stimulate ideas and discussion.

About the Reports Cognitive Elicitations Cultural Logic was charged to describe what the population at-large thinks of food and food systems. The characterizations included in the cognitive elicitations are intended toreveal how these issues are understood by the general public. \"Not While I'm Eating: how and why Americans don't think about food systems,\" Cultural Logic, June 2005. The purpose of this report is to help us understand why and how Americans remain blind to the real processes of food production and distribution \u2014despite the central role of food in American life. Cultural Logic identified several key patterns of reasoning thatmake it hard for Americans to think about where their food comes from. These includethe dominance of \"little-picture \" understandings of food, emotional associations that dis- courage critical thinking about the sources of food, and understandings of food systemsin terms of generic ideas about modernization. \"All Trees and No Forest: How advocacy paradigms obscure public understanding of the food system, \"Cultural Logic, July 2005. This report is based on interviews with food advocates to discern how they think about the food system. Cultural Logic 's assessment is that while it would be very helpful if members of the public had a conceptual picture of the food supply system as a whole - including its environmental, economic and ethical dimensions - advocates ' communica- tions are not likely to help them acquire one. Advocates tend to focus on self-contained\"paradigms \" that can obscure the larger picture, and may not even relate closely to food. Cultural Logic concludes that without a conceptual grasp of food systems, members ofthe public are likely to misinterpret or ignore many communications from advocates. Opinion Research Public Knowledge reviewed existing public opinion data to determine what is already known about public opinion in relevant issue areas before exploring new avenues forcommunications. To do this, Public Knowledge synthesized more than 250 documentsinto a strategic overview. iii\"Digesting Public Opinion: A meta-analysis of attitudes toward food, health, and farms, \" Public Knowledge, July 2005. This is a review and analysis of relevant, publicly available opinion research conducted in the United States within the past five years. The review is organized into three sections:perceptions of the relationship between food and health; understandings of food process-ing and quality issues; and views of farm-specific topics. Media Content Analysis As the summaries above suggest, most Americans do not think much or at all about their food being part of, or coming from, a system. Often, people get their information fromthe news media. To identify how food systems are presented to the public by the newsmedia, Cultural Logic reviewed more than a hundred newspaper articles printed betweenJanuary 1, 2004 and the present. Articles were selected based on keyword searches thatfocused on aspects of the food system other than eating. This analysis asked the ques-tions: in what ways would consumers of these articles come away better educated aboutthe food system, and in what ways might the coverage actually reinforce some of theirerroneous understandings? \"Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Representations of Food Systems, \" Cultural Logic, August 2005. This is a content analysis of coverage of the food system in a range of national newspa- pers. Emerging from this analysis were several findings, including: many news storiesplay on traditional images of farming and rural America that work against advocates ' goals, and news stories often reinforce scary or dehumanized aspects of the food systemthat we associate with an inevitable modernization. We encourage you to read these reports and to let each other (and us) know what you think. It will help to keep the entire process moving forward.

Kellogg Foundation ivDigesting Public Opinion: A Meta-Analysis of Attitudes Toward Food, Health and Farms By Meg Bostrom, Public Knowledge Introduction The W .K. Kellogg Foundation developed the Food and Society Initiative to \"support the creation and expansion of community-based food systems that are locally owned andcontrolled, environmentally sound and health-promoting. \" To build public support for this effort, the Kellogg Foundation asked the FrameWorks Institute to analyze existing public perceptions and develop a communications frame that will engage the public in a dialogueabout relevant policy options, such as support for small locally-owned farms, support for locally-grown organic food, and information leading to wise consumer choices, among other options. The objective for this phase of research is to review existing public opinion data to determine what is already known about public opinion in relevant issue areas before exploring newavenues for communications. To that end, this researcher synthesized more than 250 docu-ments into the following strategic overview. The overview is organized into three primary sec-tions: Food and Health, which discusses public perceptions of health and the role that foodplays in human health; Food Processing, which reviews public understanding of the dangers,benefits, and innovations in processing that affect food quality; and Farming, which discussespublic perceptions of a range of farm-specific issues. Americans are generally satisfied with various actors in the nation 's food system. The positive consequence of strong satisfaction with grocers, farmers, and so on, is that the public truststhese actors and is likely to listen to their views. However, the high level of public satisfactionalso means that there is no groundswell of public support for government intervention in thenation 's food system. In fact, this research indicates that the public finds it difficult to think systemically about food. The connection between food and health promotion or disease prevention is a consistent theme in the news media. This frame has some benefits since Americans are concerned about physicalhealth and have come to understand the components of a nutritious diet. In fact, a majority ofpeople reports that they are consuming at least one specific food for functional health benefits. In recent years, health-related news coverage of food has increasingly emphasized obesity . In many ways, the obesity conversation is not about a healthy diet, because people are willing toengage in unhealthy eating patterns to lose weight. More importantly , a public conversationabout obesity is not conducive to building support for public policies. While people under-stand that obesity is a serious health problem, they also view it as a matter of individual con-sumer choice. An individual is responsible for his or her diet, not the food system. The mainpolicy result of communications about obesity is public support to provide more informationfor individuals to make wiser choices, not an improved food system. A second approach, and one that begins to move the public toward a systemic conversation, is to connect human health with the qualities of food that are influenced by food production 1and processing. Surveys indicate that the public is aware of some dangers in food production, such as mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and pesticides, but people havelittle understanding of other dangers, such as antibiotic use, hormones, and genetic modifica-tion. Opinion on all these topics is largely unformed and malleable. Few view any of these asserious concerns and even fewer are taking any action to address these threats. At the same time, majorities hold positive views of food processing that avoids dangers in food production and promotes healthy products. The public believes that organic productsand locally grown foods are healthier, supportive of small farmers and their communities, andmore environmentally friendly . While positive perceptions are widespread, loyal, consistentuse of organic and locally grown foods continues to be rare. There may be an opportunity tobuild support for public policies by linking food production (both the dangers and the bene-fits) with its impact on human health. Finally , a third approach to a public conversation about the food system is to focus on farms, particularly smaller farms and farms that employ environmental practices. Americans valuefarms and are concerned that the number of farms in the United States is in decline. Peoplebelieve small family farms produce safer, more nutritious food and are more likely to protectthe environment. Therefore, while they support farm subsidies across the board, the public,when allowed to distinguish between small and large farms, strongly supports subsidies forsmall family farms and opposes them for large industrial farms. Importantly , most members ofthe public do not understand how farming practices can harm the environment. Therefore,farming is not currently an \"environmental problem, \" though farmers can be enlisted in envi- ronmental solutions. The interpretation offered in this review is the author 's alone. Other analysts may provide a different interpretation of the data. Method A framing meta-analysis entails a review and interpretation of existing public opinion research. The analysis that follows is a synthesis of available data, not a catalog. The objectiveof this analysis is to illuminate patterns in public opinion that lead to strategic insights, not tolist every question asked. Approximately 250 documents comprising thousands of survey questions were reviewed in the course of this research, of which more than 40 research studies are specifically cited inthis report. Frequently , separate research efforts ask similar questions and obtain similarresults. Therefore, the author attempted to cite the most recent results available. Furthermore,the author attempted to include only research that was conducted by credible sources usingsound research methods. In most instances, survey results are cited only when the entire sur-vey was available for analysis. In a few instances, however, results were only available througha written analysis or news article. These instances are noted in the research references. The research was constrained by the need to reference only publicly-available sources of infor- mation. Proprietary research, including research that can be obtained for a fee, is not includedin this review , due to restrictions on disseminating such information. Any findings from pro-prietary research that are included in this report are available to the public through news arti-cles, websites, and so on. 2Digesting Public OpinionFinally , this is a review of opinions held by the general public in the United States. Surveys from other countries and surveys of elite audiences, such as food producers, elected officials,and so on, are not included in this analysis. Of course, these views are important, but they areoutside the scope of this report. Summary of Findings Industry Perceptions Americans have strongly positive perceptions of various actors in the food system. Supermarkets and packaged food companies rank first and third in doing a good job servingconsumers, and the restaurant industry, grocery industry, and farming and agriculture rank inthe top five industries in positive public perceptions. Unlike other major infrastructures inthe country, such as energy and healthcare, thereis no groundswell of public dissatisfaction callingfor government intervention in the food system. In rating several industries, the public gives super- markets and packaged food companies exceptionallyhigh ratings. In fact, supermarkets receive the high-est rating of 21 industries reviewed. Fully 92 percentsay that supermarkets \"generally do a good job of serving their consumers \" (an increase of five per- centage points over the prior year 's ratings), 2and 42 percent believe that supermarkets are generallyhonest and trustworthy - the highest rating among 15 industries. In addition, only 8% believe super-markets should be more regulated by government,while 17 percent believe supermarkets should beless regulated. 3 Packaged food companies are also rated highly ,with 83 per cent r eporting that packaged food com- panies generally do a good job of serving their con-sumers (third highest of 21 industries and anincrease of five percentage points over the prioryear), 4and 23 per centsaying that packaged food companies are generally honest and trustworthy(ranked sixth of 15 industries). Only 24 per cent would like to see more government regulation ofpackaged food companies, and 8 per centwould like less government regulation. 5(Table 1) 3Digesting Public Opinion 1 Harris Interactive, The Harris Poll \u00ae 1,010 adults 18+ nationally , April 5-10, 2005. 2 Harris Interactive, April 5-10, 2005. 3 Harris Interactive, The Harris Poll \u00ae 2,204 adults 18+ nationally , February 16-20, 2004. 4 Harris Interactive, April 5-10, 2005. 5 Harris Interactive, February 16-20, 2004.T able 1: In Percent Supermarkets 92 Computer hardware companies 84Packaged food companies 83Computer software companies 81Airlines 80Hospitals 79Online search 79Banks 78Electric gas providers 72Life insurance companies 70Online retailers 70Telephone companies 70Car manufacturers 66Investment and brokerage firms 65Cable companies 63Pharmaceutical and drug companies 56Managed care companies, such as HMOs 41Health insurance companies 40Tobacco companies 35Oil companies 31Do a Good Job of Serving Consumers1In a 2004 review of industry attitudes conducted by the Gallup Organization, all actors in the food system placed in the top five of 25 industries tested. The restaurant industry received positive ratings from the greatest number of surveyrespondents (58 per cent positive), f ollowed by the grocery industry (52 per cent), and farming and agri- culture (50 per cent). 7(Table 2) Food and Health One of the most common associations with food is its connection to human health. In fact, the connec-tion between food and disease prevention or healthpromotion is a consistent theme for the news media. According to the Center for Media and Public Affairs, which has conducted several years of analysis of food-related news coverage: \"The most enduring aspect of coverage has been the attention to disease preventionor, more accurately , risk reduction or health promo-tion, as a goal of sound nutrition. In each Food for Thought study , disease prevention or risk reduction has placed among the top three topics. \"8 Compared to other personal considerations, physical health is a moderate-to-strong concern. Many peoplethink about physical health fairly often, are not assatisfied with their health as other areas of their life,and believe they can do better. This suggests thatpeople pay attention to and are interested in improv-ing health. At the same time, health also competesfor attention with other daily concerns, particularlywork and finances. A significant percentage (44 per cent) thinks \"a great deal \" about physical health, but only 35 percent are \"very satisfied \" with their health. On a scale of 1-10, survey respondents rate their health a moderately high 7.14 on average, but believe they can do better in the next fiveyears (8.11 on a 1-10 scale). Most (54 per cent) b elieve they are very likely to achieve this goal of improved health in five years. This pattern of response is similar to survey participants ' ratings on their career and financial situation. In each instance, it is an area about which many peoplethink a great deal, are less satisfied than with other areas of life, and believe they can improve. 4Digesting Public Opinion T able 2: Computer industry 60 Restaurant industry 58 Retail industry 54 Grocery industry 52 Farming and agriculture 50 Travel industry 50 Real estate industry 47Banking 46Internet industry 45Education 45Automobile industry 37Accounting 35The federal government 34Healthcare industry 33Advertising and public relations industry 33 Electric and gas utilities 32 Pharmaceutical industry 31The legal field 27Oil and gas industry 21Positive View6 % \"Very\" or \"Somewhat Positive\" 6 The Gallup Organization, 1,017 adults nationally , August 9-11, 2004.

Fewer are satisfied with their leisure activities (37 per-cent very satisfied, 6.17 on a one to 10 scale), but it is also an area few spend a lot of time considering (27 percent a gr eat deal). (Table 3) Most report that they are in good health and very high percentages of the public exercise each week.However, most say they do not exercise often enough. A majority (52 per cent) describes their own health as \"excellent \" (18 percent) or \"very good \" (34 percent). An additional 29 per centdescribe their own health as \"good \", while only 14 per centsay \"fair\" and 4 per- cent\"poor. \"10More than three-quar- ters (77 per cent) r eport that they get physical exercise within the averageweek, but nearly as many (7 per cent) say they should be getting more phys-ical exercise. 11 5Digesting Public Opinion T able 3: Thought a Very 1-10 Best in Avg.

Data provided by The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, University of Connecticut.Americans know that a healthy diet consists of vegetables, fruits and chicken. However, food choices are not based on health considerations alone. Nearly half the public eats atfast food restaurants at least once per week, even though three-quarters believe fast food isnot healthy. Survey respondents report that they actively try to include healthful foods in their diet, including vegetables, fruit, and chicken, among others. Majorities try to avoid fat, sugar andsoda. (Table 4) Seventy percent of Americans eat at a restaurant at least once in the average week, and 45 per- centeat at a fast food restaurant at least once in the average week. 13They frequent fast food restaurants even though they know that most of the food served is \"not too good for you \" or \"not good at all for you \" (53 percent and 23 per cent r espectively).14 In recent years, health-related food coverage has increasingly centered upon weight man- agement as a health issue. However, some consumer research suggests that people do notnecessarily see eating for weight loss as eating for health. Dieters are willing to employunhealthy eating behaviors to lose weight. Media coverage of food increasingly revolves around obesity . According to the Center for Media and Public Affairs: \"Concerns about weight management and obesity accounted for 15 percent of all the health discussions tracked in the Food for Thought V research in 2003. That is up from 5 percent in 2001 and shows how the topic has come to dominate food news. \"15 However, eating for health and eating for weight loss are not necessarily the same. A report on qualitative research for the International Food Information Council Foundation finds that,\"Consumers talk about a distinction between eating for health and eating for weight loss. Most believe that restricting foods or food groups is not the answer for better health. This isnoted among all audiences, including those who have tried, or continue to be on, restrictivediets. Interestingly , dieters claim they are willing to employ \"unhealthy \" eating behaviors for as long as it takes to put weight 'balance ' back into their lives. \" 16 Weight loss is a common objective. One in four is currently trying to lose weight and a majority would like to. A majority of the public has seriously tried to lose weight at somepoint, and a significant percentage feels they are currently overweight. Americans say theyare willing to diet to live longer. While most Americans (54 percent) describe their weight as \"about right, \" fully 40 percent say that they are \"very\" or \"somewhat overweight. \" More than one in four (27 percent) reports that they are currently trying to lose weight and 58 percent say they would like to lose weight.17 6Digesting Public Opinion 13 TNS Intersearch, May 10-16, 2004. 14 The Gallup Organization, 1,006 adults nationally , July 7-9, 2003.

People undertake a varietyof actions when they attempt to loseweight. While exercise tops the list (44percent), dieting is broken into several distinct categories (counting calories,counting carbohydrates, etc.) thatwould pass exercise in frequency ifcombined. 19(Table 5) Most say they are willing to change their eating habits to promote long life.Three quarters (73 per cent) would \"rather live longer, even if it means having to watch your diet, \" while 23 per centwould rather \"eat what you feel like, even if it means you would not live as long as you might otherwise. \" 20 The connection between child health and food has also gotten significant attention in recent years. Most parents see nutrition and physical fitness as essential. They believechild obesity is a serious problem, even though very few have had a health professional voice concerns about their own child's weight.Most believe their child gets enough physicalactivity, but fewer are confident that their childhas a very nutritious diet. When people consider all the things that chil- dren need to be taught, a majority states thatnutrition and physical fitness is absolutely essen-tial (68 per centand 51 per cent r espectively). This is an impressive rating, but it ranks lower thanother areas, such as honesty , discipline, inde-pendence, and money management.

Fully 83 per cent of par ents report that their school-age child has a physical education class at school and 58 per centsay their child participates regularly in after- school sports activities. While most parents are satisfied with their child 's level of activity , a significant percentage believes their child needs more physical activity . A slight majority (57percent) of par ents with schoolchildren believe their child gets as much physical exercise as he or she should, while 42 per centbelieve their child should be getting more exercise. 25 While most parents believe their child is getting enough physical activity , fewer are confident that their child has a nutritious diet. Only 26 per cent of mothers de scribe their child 's overall diet as \"very balanced and nutritious, \" while an additional 68 per cent say it is \"somewhat bal- anced and nutritious. \"26Another survey found that, while 61 per centsay their child 's diet is healthy , only 18 per centdescribed it as \"very healthy . \"27Finally , a majority (51 per cent) reports that \"my children eat some nutritious, healthy foods, but not nearly enough, \" while nearly as many (47 per cent) say \"my children eat mostly nutritious, healthy foods. \"28 The public is convinced that obesity is a serious public health issue. However, the obesity frame isnot conducive to building support for public poli-cies, because people view food as a matter of con-sumer choice. Individuals are responsible fortheir diet, not the food system. People believe that obesity is a serious problem. Fully 93 per centsay obesity among adults is a serious health problem (58 per cent very serious) and just as many (93 per cent) say overweight children and teens is a serious problem (61 per cent very serious).29 8Digesting Public Opinion T able 7: Not getting enough physical exercise 86 Poor eating habits 85The marketing of sweets and other high-calorie foods to children 65 Watching too much television 59Genetics, or a family history 50Lack of information on good eating habits 45The cost of buying healthy food 45Restaurant portions that are too large 44Lack of information about food content 37Causes of Obesity29 % Most or Very Important 22 CBS News/New York Times Poll, 642 adults nationally , May 9-11, 2003. 23 Stony Brook University Center for Survey Research, November 5-25, 2003. 24 TNS Intersearch, May 10-16, 2004. 25 TNS Intersearch, May 10-16, 2004. 26 Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, sponsored by Club Mom, 1,207 women nationally with children under 19, March 8-March 11, 2004.

In rating a series of causes ofobesity , lack of exercise and poor eating habits top the list (86 per centand 85 per cent r espec- tively). A majority points to just one systemic problem, which undoubtedly rates highlybecause adults are reluctant to hold children responsible. T wo thirds (65 per cent) believe mar- keting sweets to children is an important cause of obesity . (Table 7) Food is a matter of consumer choice, according to surveyparticipants. Presented withtwo statements, only 29 per-centsay snack food \"is junk food, is costing Americansbillions of dollars in health-care costs due to child obesi-ty , diabetes, heart disease,and high blood pressure, andshould be discouraged by thegovernment through labelinglaws, warnings and taxes, \" while 67 per cent\"say that snack food is a matter of consumer choice and that a small group of Americans should not impose their eating habits on the rest ofthe country . \" 32Furthermore, fully 83 percent say that obese individuals are responsible (51 per- cent very responsible), while far fewer hold food manufacturers responsible, even when given areason - \"because of the serving size and fat and sugar content of their products \" (52 percent responsible, 14 percent very responsible). When forced to choose whether food manufacturersor consumers are responsible, the public overwhelming sides with consumer choice. Only 14percent think \"food manufacturers should be required by law to reduce serving sizes and fat and sugar content to make their products healthier, \" while 83 percent say \"it is up to individual con- sumers to choose healthy food products. \" 33 Finally , in rating a variety of actors, a majority of the public finds just one as having a great deal of responsibility for the obesity problem \u2014 individual Americans ' choices (67 per cent). Importantly , the fewest find government policies responsible (20 per cent a gr eat deal of responsibility). This suggests that, at least as far as obesity is concerned, it is difficult to makea case for government policy addressing the food system. However, 43 per centand 40 per cent, respectively , attribute responsibility to fast food restaurants and schools that allow high calo-rie snacks, suggesting some possible openings for a systemic conversation. (Table 8) P eople demonstrate support for two categories of policies: policies to provide more infor- mation to individuals and policies directed at child health. Because they see addressing obesity as the responsibility of individuals, the public is most enthusiastic about policies that allow individuals to make better choices. They support warn-ing labels on food, nutritional content at restaurants, and public service advertising cam-paigns on nutrition and exercise. In addition, the public is willing to act to protect children 9Digesting Public Opinion T able 8: Individual Americans in their choice of diet and lack of exercise 67 Fast-food restaurants 43Schools that allow high-calorie snacks and sweets 40Manufacturers of high-calorie packaged and processed foods 36Marketers and advertisers of high-calorie and processed foods 35Government policies and laws on food content and marketing 20Responsibility for Obesity Problem31 % Great Deal 31 TNS Intersearch, May 10-16, 2004. 32 Fabrizio, McLaughlin & Associates, 1,200 adults nationally , June 11-June 14, 2002.

Fewer support taxes on junk food or limiting portion sizes in restaurants. (Table 9 and Table 10) One policy that most Americans stand behind is protecting individuals from losing health insur- ance. Fully 92 percent say that \"health insurance companies should not be permitted to drop people from coverage because they 're overweight \" and 72 percent say \"health insurance compa- nies should not be permitted to charge higher premiums for people who are overweight. \"36 10Digesting Public Opinion T able 9: % Support % Strongly Support Warning labels on high-fat and high-sugar foods about the health risks of being overweight 75 49 A law requiring restaurants to list the calorie count and fat content of all items on their menus 61 38 A ban on advertising high-fat and high-sugar food on children's television shows and in children's magazines 56 36 A tax on high-fat and high-sugar foods, with the money used for advertising and programs to fight obesity 41 21 A law setting a legal limit on portion sizes in restaurants 23 11Support for Government Policies 34 T able 10: % Support % Strongly Support Government-funded advertising campaigns that promote eating right and exercising 74 44 Making a law requiring fast food restaurants to list nutrition information - such as calorie count - for all items on their menus 70 44 Warning labels on packaged food about the health risks of being overweight, just like there are warning labels on cigarettes about the health risks of smoking 67 40 The federal government regulating television ads for junk food and fast food that are aimed at children and teens the way they do for cigarettes and alcohol 53 29 Putting a special tax on junk food - that is, things like soda, chips, and candy - and using the money for programs to fight obesity 40 18Support for Government Policies35 34 TNS Intersearch, May 10-16, 2004. 35 ICR International Communications Research, Childhood Obesity Survey , sponsored by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and San Jose Mercury News, 1,017 adults nationally , February 4-8, 2004. 36 TNS Intersearch, May 10-16, 2004.Importantly, support for policies to protect child health can be easily undermined by trig- gering other powerful frames, such as freedom of speech and parental responsibility. While majorities support regulating junk food ads when they are thinking in the context of health, support for this measure drops when placed in a different context. In a survey aboutcommunications policy , a majority of the public stated opposition for restricting ads for junkfood on children 's television. After hearing that \"some people say it is time to restrict ads for junk food on children 's television shows; others oppose such restrictions, saying companies should be free to advertise whatever they want, \" 56 percent oppose and 37 per centfavor restricting ads for junk food on children 's television shows. 37 In addition, the public overwhelmingly opposes allowing parents to sue for their child 's obesi- ty . Only 6 per centthink \"parents should be able to sue major soft-drink and snack food com- panies if they believe their child became obese from eating junk food and drinking softdrinks, \" while 84 per centthink \"the government should pass laws to prevent these kinds of lawsuits. \" 38 While the public says schools should teach children about nutrition, most would not sacri- fice other educational priorities to put more emphasis on nutrition or physical education. The public does not believe that schools should be responsible for monitoring children 's weight, but does believe that schools have a responsibility to teach children about healthyfoods. Nearly eight in ten (79 per cent) believe that it is \"not a school 's responsibility to moni- tor children and teens ' weight, \" but three-quarters (74 per cent) say that it is \"a school 's responsibility to teach children and teens about healthy foods to eat. \" 39 However, even in the context of a survey about health, most Americans would not place more emphasis on physical education and nutrition in the schools if it meant sacrificing other priori-ties. Only 29 per centwould \"increase the number of physical education classes even if it means cutting back on electives such as foreign languages and social studies, \" while a majority (57 percent) would keep things as they are now , and 5 per centwould cut back on physical educa- tion to expand electives. Only 31 per centwould \"increase the number of nutrition and food science classes even if it means cutting back on electives such as foreign languages and socialstudies, \" while a majority (55 per cent) would keep things as they are now and 4 per centwould cut back on nutrition classes. 40 Most believe that the food provided by schools is healthy, so there is little public support for reforming school nutrition. A slight majority opposes soda machines in schools untilthey learn the financial reason for installing machines, which causes many more to opposetheir use. 11Digesting Public Opinion 37 Conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, sponsored by Henry J.

When only considering child health and obesity , members of the public divide concerning whether or not soda and vending machines should be allowed in schools. A slight majority (55percent) says that soda machines should not be allowed in schools, while 41 percent would allowthem. Concerning vending machines, just as many would allow them as would not (48 percenteach). 41However, when the financial reasons for the use of vending machines in schools become apparent, the public strongly opposes allowing these machines in schools: 69 percent say thatschools \"should not be allowed to raise money for their budgets by allowing soda and candy vending machines in school, \" while 30 percent say they should be allowed to do this. 42 The lack of concern about vending machines may be due to parents ' belief that schools pro- vide healthy food. Most parents believe that the lunch provided by their child 's school is healthy (67 per centhealthy , 13 per cent very healthy), while only 18 per cent th ink it is unhealthy (6 per cent very unhealthy). A majority (58 per cent) thinks there is no difference in their child 's diet during the calendar year, while 25 per cent b elieve their child has a healthier diet during the summer and 15 per centsay it is healthier during the school year.43 Since there is little concern about the nutrition in school food, the public shows little enthusi- asm for efforts to correct lunch programs. By a narrow 49 per cent to 47 percent mar gin, peo- ple say they are willing to pay higher federal taxes to cover the cost of more nutritious schoollunch programs in the public schools. 44 Food Processing: Dangers, Benefits, and Innovations Many Americans are aware of dangers in the nation 's food system, such as mad cow dis- ease, pesticides, antibiotic overuse, and so on, but few see these as serious concerns andfew are taking any action to address these threats. They strongly support labeling to pro-vide consumers with information about product qualities. Many are aware of mad cow disease, but few are concerned. Roughly two-thirds of the pub- lic (67 per cent) have been following news reports about mad cow disease either very closely (22 percent) or somewhat closely (45 per cent). While they are aware of mad cow disease, few believe it likely that they or someone in their family will become infected (9 per centlikely , 4 percent very likely)45and most believe it is not a significant problem: 6 per centsay it is a cri- sis, 28 per cent a major problem, 53 per cent a minor problem, and 12 per centnot a problem.46 Furthermore, fewer than one in five has taken any action to avoid getting mad cow disease, including: stopped ordering beef at fast food restaurants (16 per centhave taken this action), 12Digesting Public Opinion 41 ICR International Communications Research, February 4-8, 2004. 42 TNS Intersearch, May 10-16, 2004. 43 Stony Brook University Center for Survey Research, November 5-November 25, 2003.

Only 19 percent have a great deal of confidence in the US meat inspectionsystem to protect Americans from mad cow disease, while an additional 37 percent have \"a good amount \" of confidence, and 41 percent have \"only some \" or \"very little \" confidence. 48 Only about one in four knows of the debate concerning antibiotic overuse. Many say they are willing to spend more to avoid food produced with antibiotics, pesticides, and hormones. Only 45 per cent of Am ericans are aware that fresh meat and poultry can be raised with antibi- otics in animal feed and only 28 per centhave heard about the debate concerning the overuse of antibiotics in animals raised for food. However, once they hear of the consequences ofantibiotic use, a majority (57 per cent) wants to avoid these products. 49 While few see pesticides, hormones and antibiotics as a high risk, many are willing to pay more to avoid these chemicals. One-quarter (28 per cent) note that food produced with pesti- cides, hormones, or antibiotics, pose a \"high risk \" to human health, 42 per centsay \"moderate risk\" and only 20 per centsay \"minor risk. \" At the same time, two-thirds report that they are willing to spend more for food produced without the use of pesticides, hormones, and antibi-otics, and nearly half are willing to pay 10 per cent or more in higher f ood prices. One in five (19 percent) is willing to pay 5 per cent more, one-third (33 per cent) are willing to pay 10 per- cent more, and 15 per cent of sur vey respondents are willing to spend 20 per cent more for food produced without pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics. 50 Finally , the public is less likely to buy food with a label saying it is from animals fed withantibiotics or hormones (47 per centless, 4 per cent more, and 45 per cent no differ ence), and slightly more likely to buy food with a label saying it is from animals that have not been fedantibiotics or hormones (46 per cent more likely , 7 per centless, and 43 per cent no differ ence). About one-third (32 per cent) curr ently try to avoid food from farm animals that have been fed antibiotics or hormones, while 60 per centsay it is not that important to them. 51 No matter their level of concern about a specific product danger, high percentages of survey respondents support more food information. They believe that labels should identify chemicaluse, organic properties, country of origin, and so on.

A majority has tried organic products, partic- ularly produce, and many see a variety of benefits to these products, including health, envi-ronment, and support for small farmers. Loyal use continues to be rare, however. The onlydownside of organics is cost, according to survey respondents. A majority (54 percent) has tried organic foods and beverages, but just one in 10 uses organic products regularly .53Few organic produce purchasers are loyal to organic produce. Among those who have purchased organic fresh produce, just 2 percent only buy organic fresh produce andan additional 5 percent buy it if it is available. One-quarter (26 percent) prefer it but also con-sider other factors, while 35 percent sometimes purchase it but don 't necessarily prefer it. Finally , 24 percent of those who have purchased organic produce don 't usually purchase organic. 54 Those who have purchased organic mostly choose fruits and vegetables (68 per cent), followed by bread or baked goods (26 per cent), non-dairy beverages (26 per cent), eggs (26 per cent), dairy products (24 per cent), packaged goods, such as soup or pasta (19 per cent), meat (22 percent), fr ozen foods (18 per cent), pr epared foods or ready-to-go meals (14 per cent) and baby food (7 per cent). The most frequent complaint about organic products is that they are too expensive (73 per cent).55 The public sees a variety of benefits in organic products: organic foods are better for the envi- ronment (58 percent), support small and local farmers (57 per cent), are better for health (54 percent), are better quality (42 per cent) and taste better (32 per cent).56In addition, a certain set of considerations come to mind when people think about an appropriate definition for\"natural meat, \" including: no antibiotics in the feed (79 per cent), no growth hor mones (79 percent), no animal byproducts in the feed (68 per cent), humane treatment of animals (48 percent), and humane slaughtering methods (44 per cent). 57When forced to choose between health and environment, most say health concerns are the driving reason to purchase organics. 14Digesting Public Opinion T able 11: (In Percent) Chemicals used in 90.7 Organically grown 86.0Country of origin 85.9Use of waxes 84.5Use of biotechnology 78.4Irradiated 77.8Nutritional value 77.1Fresh Produce Items Should be Labeled to Identify:52 52 Dr. Roberta Cook, Fresh Trends 2002, as reported in \"Consumer Attitudes about Organic Foods, \" by Dr. Roberta Cook, University of California Davis, January 2004. 53 Synovate, The 2004 Whole Foods Market Organic Foods Trend Tracker* survey , commissioned by Whole Foods Market, 1,000 adults, August 2004.

One-quarter (23 percent ) of the population consistently uses organic food and an additional 26 percent include organic food in their diet. As noted in an article in the Santa Cruz Sentinel, the National Marketing Institute has devel- oped the following five segments of organic consumers: \"WELL BEINGS, 23 PERCENT: Consistently use organic and natural food, vitamin/mineral, herbal and homeopathic formulas to support, treat, and enhancepersonal and planetary health. Strong preference for environmental [ sic] friendly products, such as toxic-free household cleaners, energy efficient appliances, and recy-clable materials. FOOD ACTIVES, 26 PERCENT: Attain health primarily through food, including both natural and organic food and beverages, along with fortified packaged goods. Believesupplements support health but are overwhelmed by choices. Prefer alternativehealthcare to traditional medicine. MAGIC BULLETS, 12 PERCENT: Focus on vitamins, minerals, herbs and 'miracle foods ' to support health, less concerned with nutritional value of food. Preoccupied with weight loss and discounts. Preference for self-treating, using over-the-counterremedies. FENCE SITTERS, 18 PERCENT: Neutral about the nutritional content of the food they eat. Little faith in the value of supplements. Price-sensitive when grocery shop-ping; splurge when they eat out. Seek RX prescriptions to fix health problems. EAT, DRINK AND BE MERRYS, 21 PERCENT: Choose taste over nutritional or health value. Know they should eat healthier and take supplements but don 't. Highly price sensitive. Preference for over-the-counter remedies followed by RX prescriptions totreat health conditions. \" 59 As noted earlier, news coverage has emphasized risk reduction or health promotion as a goal of sound nutrition. Research indicates that, while the public is aware of some func-tional benefits of food and actively includes certain foods for a specific function, mosthave, at best, just a shallow understanding of many nutrients. The terms \"functional foods \" and \"nutraceuticals \" are sometimes used to describe foods that have a particular health function or a perceived pharmaceutical benefit based on the nutritionalproperties of certain foods, such as the functional benefit of oatmeal in reducing cholesterol. 15Digesting Public Opinion 58 Dr. Roberta Cook, Food and the Environment Update 2001, by the Hartman Group, as reported in \"Consumer Attitudes about Organic Foods, \" by Dr. Roberta Cook, University of California Davis, January 2004. 59 Sally Blodgett, \"New Research Shows U.S. Health Habits Changing, \" written by reporter Sally Blodgett, Santa Cruz Sentinel. The article reports on proprietary research by the National Marketing Institute based onresearch conducted with a panel of 64,000 consumers.Consumers prefer the term \"functional foods \" (62 percent) o ver \"nutraceuticals \" (31 percent), but Cogent Research makes the point that neither term improves understanding since allfoods have some function. 60 Many act to improve their health by incorporating certain foods into their diet. A strongmajority (62 per cent) says they are consuming 1-3 specific foods for functional health bene- fits, which is 10 percentage points higher than reported in 1998. 61 There is some indication that the level of public awareness of specific food-health relationshipsis determined by the length of time the public has been hearing about a particular association.According to Cogent Research, one of the more recent associations, between soy protein andheart disease, has a lower level of awareness (23 per cent), than the association between antioxi- dants and cancer (34 per cent), and the most people are familiar with the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis (64 per cent\"have heard a lot \"). 62 However, some researchers caution that public awareness does not necessarily indicate public understanding. In an analysis of qualitative research, Strategy One writes, \"Although respon- dents could list many nutrients by name, this does not mean they understand what they areor why they should be consumed. \" 63Strategy One lists several quotes that demonstrate this consumer confusion: Lycopene. I don't know what it is, but I think I'm supposed to have more of it. I don't know what Omega-3s are, but I know they are good for you. There are too many fats. We don't know them. It's too confusing. I feel like I'll die from ignorance.What's good and what's bad for you keeps changing. Few have heard much about genetically modified food, and awareness has declined in recent years. Few Americans report that they have heard very much about genetically modified foods. Whether phrased as \"the use of biotechnology in the production of food \" or \"genetically mod- ified food \" only about one-third of Americans have heard \"a great deal \" or \"some \" about those topics (35 per centbiotechnology , 32 per centgenetically modified food).64 There is some indication that awareness of this topic has declined slightly in recent years. According to a trend question by the International Food Information Council, the percentageof Americans that have heard or read about biotechnology has dropped from a high of 16Digesting Public Opinion 60 Cogent Research, sponsored by the International Food Information Council, 1,004 adults nationally 18+, March 2002.

Generally, the public is cautious and uncomfortable with genetically modified food. Whengiven the chance, significant percentages express no opinion about this topic, and opinionmoves back and forth between support and opposition, depending upon language choices. Impressions of biotechnology and genetically modified foodslean negative, with more hav-ing an unfavorable than favor-able view of biotechnology (30percent unfavorable, 25 percentfavorable) and genetically mod-ified foods (44 percent unfavor-able, 21 percent favorable).This compares with stronglypositive views of organic foods (64 percent favorable, 15 percent unfavorable). (Table 12) Furthermore, the public moderately opposes the introduction of genetically modified foods. A plurality (43 percent) say the \"risks outweigh the benefits \" of genetically modified foods, while 38 percent say the benefits outweigh the risks, and 19 percent are unsure. 67In addition, 47 per- cent \"oppose the introduction of genetically modified foods into the US food supply , \" while 27 percent support it and 26 percent have no opinion. While close to half the public opposes theintroduction of genetically modified foods, this represents an 11 percentage point decline (from58 percent opposition) in 2001. 68 The public is unfamiliar with the extent to which genetically modified foods exist in super- markets, and knowledge has not increased since 2001. Most believe they have not eatengenetically modified goods, but an increasing percentage report that they have. Finally,while a majority is unlikely to eat genetically modified foods, willingness to eat geneticallymodified foods has increased slightly since 2001. The public does not know whether or not foods produced by biotechnology are currently available in the supermarket. One third believes they are available (34 per cent), one-third thinks they are not (37 per cent) and one-third is unsure (30 per cent).

A slight majority (54 per cent) thinks they have not eaten genetically modified foods, while 30 per cent r eports that they have. This represents a change from 2001, when 62 per centsaid they had not eaten genetically modified foods and 19 per centsaid they had.70Roughly four in ten say they are likely to eat genetically modified foods (42 per centlikely , 13 per cent\"very likely \"), while a slim majority says they are unlikely (52 per centunlikely , 30 per cent\"not at all likely \"). The percentage reporting they are likely to eat genetically modified foods has increased from 38 per cent in 2001.71 The public is unsure about the safety of genetically modified foods, but when people hear how common genetically modified foods are, many quickly shift to assuming these prod-ucts must be safe. Initially , 30 per cent beli eve genetically modified foods are safe, 27 per cent b elieve they are unsafe, and 42 per centhave no opinion. Once they hear that \"more than half of products at the grocery store are produced using some form of biotechnology or genetic modification, \" opinion shifts toward believing these products are safe (48 per centsafe, 25 per cent uns afe, and 27 percent no opinion). This response has been fairly constant since 2001.72 Very few people admit to knowing much of anything concerning government regulation of genetically modified foods. They tend to believe that there is too little regulation, but manyhave no opinion on this. However, when asked to evaluate a series of goals for regulatingthese products, the public overwhelmingly supports a cautious approach, emphasizing con-sumer awareness and safety. The labeling that the public supports is likely to lead toreduced consumer acceptance, as most say that they would be less likely to buy productslabeled as genetically modified. Very small percentages of the public say they know something about government regulation of genetically modified food. Only 12 percent say they know something (1 percent \"a great deal, \" 11 percent \"some \") while 28 percent say they know \"not too much, \" and a majority (55 percent) know \"nothing at all. \" Among the 40 percent who say they have at least some minimal knowl- edge of government regulation of genetically modified food, 40 percent believe there is too littlegovernment regulation, 8 percent believe there is too much, 19 percent say it is about right, and 33 percent have no opinion. The percentage believing there is too little government regulation increased 5 percentage points from 2003 to 2004. 73 In evaluating a series of goals for the regulation of genetically modified foods, survey respon-dents clearly indicate that they want to be cautious and prioritize consumer awareness andsafety . Very high percentages strongly favor labeling products and removing from the marketproducts deemed to be unsafe. Fully 71 per cent str ongly favor ensuring that these foods are safe before they are allowed to come to market, and 65 per cent str ongly favor requiring FDA approval even if it means substantial delay .

At the same time, only 19 per cent strongly favor prohibiting genetically modified food from being sold in the US.75(Table 13) Labeling is likely to influence consumer behavior, as people say they are less likely to buy foods with a label saying it had been genetically modified (55 per centless likely , 6 per cent more, 37 percent no differ ence), and more likely to buy food with a label saying it had not been genetically modified (51 per cent more likely , 9 per centless, 39 per cent no differ ence). At the same time, only 34 per centsay they try to avoid genetically modified food now , and 61 percent say it is not that important to them.76 While the public wants a cautious approach to genetically modified foods, it is not opposed to them. In fact, when some of the benefits of genetic modification are explainedto survey participants, they can see a variety of good reasons for genetic modification. Americans are open to the idea of genetically modified food. Half (50 per cent) say they are likely (50 per centlikely , 15 per cent very likely) to buy \"produce, like tomatoes or potatoes, if it had been modified by biotechnology to taste better or fresher, \" while 45 per cent are not likely to buy such produce (25 per cent not at all likely). Response to this question has been fairly consistent; however, purchase resistance is increasing. Likeliness to purchase is at itslowest point since the question was first asked in 1997 (response is usually in the mid-50s,though it has been as high as 62 per cent), and unwillingness to purchase is at its highest point (with 37 per centthe lowest measure in 1999 and 2003). 77 19Digesting Public Opinion T able 13: % Strongly Favor74 Labeling all food that is genetically modified 80 Labeling all processed food that contains genetically modified ingredients 78Removing any genetically modified food deemed to be unsafe after it has come to market 75 Genetically modified foods should be subject to the same rules as new conventional foods 71 Ensuring that all genetically modified foods are safe before they come to market 71Balancing the interests of consumers and food producers to provide the best and safest food 69 Requiring the FDA to approve any genetically modified food as safe before it goes to market, even if it causes substantial delays 65 Genetically modified foods should be regulated more stringently than new conventional foods 54 Prohibiting any genetically modified food from being sold in the United States, even if the FDA believes it is safe 19 Streamlining the process so that new advances in genetically modified food are brought to market as soon as possible 17Goals for Regulating Genetically Modified Foods 74 The Mellman Group and Public Opinion Strategies, September 22-26, 2004. 75 The Mellman Group and Public Opinion Strategies, September 22-26, 2004. 76 TNS Intersearch, July 9-13, 2003. 77 Cogent Research/Wirthlin Group, trend questions for IFIC.Higher percentages are willing to buy produce that has been modified, so as to not need pesti- cide. Nearly two-thirds say they are likely (64 percent likely , 28 percent very likely) to buy \"pro- duce, like tomatoes or potatoes, if it had been modified by biotechnology to be protected frominsect damage and required fewer pesticide applications, \" while 32 percent are not likely to buy such produce (19 percent not at all likely). Again, likeliness to purchase such a product is at itslowest point and unwillingness to purchase is at its highest point since February 1999 whensurvey respondents indicated they would be likely to purchase this type of product by a 77 percent to 21 percent margin. 78 When exposed to a variety of reasons for genetic modification, the public sees good reasons tosupport modification, especially for human health, world hunger, and science. (Table 14) Discomfort with genetic modification is particularly pronounced when survey respondents consider modifying animals. As indicated in Table 14, each time animals were included in the reason for genetic modifica- tion, public support dropped. For example, 77 per centsay a good reason for genetic modifica- tion is \"to produce more affordable pharmaceutical drugs by using plants to produce pharma- ceutical compounds \" (77 percent good reason, 54 per cent very good reason).

Similarly , the public gives higher ratings for providing \"organs for transplant to humans \" (56 percent good reason, 36 percent very good reason) than for trans- planting \"animal organs to humans \" (41 percent good reason, 19 percent very good reason). In fact, the four reasons with the highest opposition are the only four reasons that mention some-thing specific about animals. 80 In addition, when rating their comfort level with genetic modification, people are least com-fortable with any kind of animal use. On average, survey respondents are neutral about geneticmodification of plants (5.94 average on a 10 point comfort scale), and they become increasing-ly uncomfortable as they consider other life forms: microbes, such as bacteria or algae (4.14),animals used for food sources, including cattle, fish and shrimp (3.73), insects (3.56), animalsused for other purposes, including cats, dogs and race horses (2.29), and humans (1.35). 81 However, there is some indication that the public reacts differently to animal biotechnology donefor different purposes. A majority has a favorable view of genetics to improve animal care andnutrition (53 percent favorable, 17 percent very favorable), but tends to have an unfavorableview of genetic engineering that adjusts animal traits (47 percent unfavorable, 30 percent not atall favorable). The public clearly has an unfavorable view of cloning animals (depending onquestion wording, 64 percent un-favorable, 51 percent not at all favorable; or, 74 percent unfa-vorable, 58 percent not at all favorable). 82(Table 15) Even the public 's strong opposition to genetic modification of animals may be open to influence, though attitudes toward cloning are more solidly negative. The public may be open to influence on genetic modification of animals as well. When given different scenarios, people say that some scenarios would have a positive effect on theirimpression: \"animal biotechnology can improve the quality and safety of food, for example, 21Digesting Public Opinion 80 The Mellman Group and Public Opinion Strategies, September 22-26, 2004. 81 The Mellman Group and Public Opinion Strategies, September 22-26, 2004. 82 Cogent Research/Wirthlin Group, trend questions for IFIC. 83 Cogent Research/Wirthlin Group, trend questions for IFIC.T able 15: In Percent Favorable Unfavorable Genomics is a form of animal biotechnology that uses knowledge about genetics to improve overall animal care and nutrition. 53 27 Genetic engineering is a form of animal biotechnology that allows us to move beneficial traits from one animal to another in a precise way. 39 47 SPLIT SAMPLE Cloning is a form of animal biotechnology that retains desirable traits by producing animals that are biologically identical to the parent. 15 74 SPLIT SAMPLE Cloning is a form of animal biotechnology that retains desirable traits by producing animals that are identical to the parent. 24 64Overall Impression of Three Areas of Animal Biotechnology83through improved animal health or improved nutritional quality of the food produced \" (60 percent p ositive effect), and \"animal biotechnology can reduce the environmental impact of animal waste \" (52 percent p ositive effect). Far fewer find compelling the idea that \"animal biotechnology can increase farm efficiency by increasing the amount of food produced ordecreasing the amount of feed needed by the animals \" (37 percent pos itive effect). 84 Opinion of genetic engineering appears to be more open to influence than opinion of cloning. A majority (53 percent) says they would be likely to buy meat, milk and eggs from animals enhanced through genetic engineering if the FDA determined it was safe (21 per cent very likely), but 63 per centwould be unlikely to buy products from cloned animals even if the FDA said they were safe (43 per cent\"not at all likely \").85 Since public opinion on genetic modification continues to be largelyunformed, there is an opportunityto shape how the public under-stands this issue. Trusted spokes-people will be central to effectivecommunications, and most say thatfarmers, the FDA, friends/familyand scientists will matter most. Most members of the public say that their view of genetic modification is determined by their understanding of the impact genetic modification will have on their family (71 percent) and thetrust they have in communications messengers (66 percent). Religious beliefs are the leastimportant consideration (37 per-cent). (Table 16) Of a series of spokespeople, the most trusted on this topic arefarmers (81 per cent tr ust, 38 per- cent tr ust a great deal), the FDA (83 percent, 37 percent), fri ends and family (81 per cent, 36 per- cent), and scientists and academics (81 percent, 31 percent). The news media (41 per cent, 8 percent), biotechnology companies (51 per-cent, 12 percent), and food manu- facturers (54 per cent, 12 percent) are the least trusted.

In one such list from June 2001, just as many registered voters rated farm issues as a concern as worker lay-offs, and more rated farm issues as a concern than did worries about nuclear attack. In thepost-911 world, these ratings would undoubtedly be much different. However, this list servesas an indication that people have concerns about a variety of farm issues, when they are giventhe chance to express them. All of the tested farm concerns were rated at similar levels by thepublic. (Table 18) Americans value farms and are concerned that the number of farms in the United States is in decline. They hold far more favorable impressions of small scale family farms than largeindustrial farms and believe small family farms are better than large farms at producingsafe, nutritious food and protecting the environment. Survey respondents are concerned about the decline in the number of US farms (82 per cent concerned, 46 per cent very concerned) when they hear that \"the number of U.S. farms have dropped from seven million in the 1930s to about two million today , and 330 farmers leavethe land every week. \" 89It may be relatively easy to make the case that government policy is doing little to address family farm loss, since Americans believe that the US government farmpolicy currently favors large farming businesses (80 per cent), not small farmers (6 per cent). 90 23Digesting Public Opinion 88 Tarrance Group, sponsored by American Farmland Trust and the Joyce Foundation, 1,024 registered voters nationally , June 2-June 21, 2001.

When asked to consider the production of safe, nutritious food, a higher percentage ofthe public trusts smaller-scale family farming practices (85 per cent tr ust, 45 per cent\"place a lot of trust \" in this type of farm) than trusts large-scale industrial farming practices (69 percent trust, 24 percent place \"a lot of trust \" in this type of farm). Forced to choose between the two, 71 percent think smaller-scale family farms care more about the safety of food than large-scaleindustrial farms (15 percent). Similarly , more than two-thirds (69 per cent) believe that smaller- scale family farms are more likely to use techniques that will not harm the environment, while22 percent choose large-scale industrial farms. 91 Americans strongly and consistently voice support for a strong agriculture system in the United States. They do not want to rely on food from other countries, even if it would beless expensive. Even before the terrorist attacks on the United States, fully 81 per centstated that it is impor- tant that the food they eat \"comes from farms and ranches in the United States rather than from foreign countries \" (81 percent important, 52 per cent very important).92Three-quarters (74 percent) disagree with the statement, \"if the US could buy all its food from other coun- tries cheaper than it can be produced and sold here, we should. \"93In fact, more than two- thirds (68 percent) would pay more for food grown in the U.S. rather than abroad and 71 per- cent agree with the statement \"I would be willing to pay more for food that is grown locally , near where I live, rather than far away . \"94 One reason they support agriculture in the United States is that most believe that food grown in the U.S. is fresher and safer (80 per centand 79 per cent r espectively) than imported food, and half (51 per cent) per ceive that food grown in the U.S. actually costs less.95 Furthermore, the public prioritizes locally grown food. They believe locally grown food is fresher and that, by purchasing it, they are supporting their community and local farmers. Three-quarters say that it is important (73 per centimportant, 38 per cent very important) to know whether their food is produced or grown locally or regionally ,96and half (52 per cent) say it is important that the food they eat \"comes from farms and ranches in your own state rather than outside your state \" (52 percent important, 23 per cent very important).97 In a survey of four regions with buy local campaigns, more than half (58 per cent) of people in the regions said it was very or somewhat important to them that food come from farms andranches in their area. The researchers noted that those who considered it important to buylocal prioritized certain criteria at higher levels than those who did not think it was important 24Digesting Public Opinion 91 Roper Public Affairs & Media, March 26 to April 10, 2004. 92 Tarrance Group, June 2-June 21, 2001. 93 Ronald C.

As noted in the table below , those who consider it important to buy local place more importance on nutrition, chemicals, and organic properties.98(Table 19) Most indicate that they have acted to buy locally produced food. More than two-thirds(70 percent) have purchased something directly from a farmer in the prior year. Amajority (54 per cent) r eport that they have purchased from a farmers ' market and 40 percent have bought from a farm stand. 100 In response to an open-ended question about the benefits of locally grown food,survey respondents in regions with buylocal campaigns report that they buy locallyproduced food because it is fresher (44 per-cent), to support their community and local farmers (40 per cent) and because it tastes better (12 per cent). Most often, people report that they prefer to buy locally grown vegetables (70 per cent) and fruit (59 per cent), while f ewer prefer locally grown meat (18 per cent), dairy (13 per cent), and poultry (10 per cent). Only 13 percent say that it is not important to buy local. 101 The challenge for buy local efforts is to offer people easy opportunities to purchase locally grown food on a regular basis. The public needs little convincing that locally grown food has benefits, however, exposing the public to locally grown food may be a challenge. Most weekly shopping occurs in locationsthat are unlikely to have a large amount of locally grown food, such as large grocery stores (73percent shop on a weekly basis), small independent stores (37 per cent), convenience stores (36 percent), and war ehouse stores (9 per cent). Fewer frequently shop at locations that specialize in locally grown foods: farmers ' markets (11 per cent), r oadside stands (5 per cent), and commu- nity supported farms (4 per cent). 102 Furthermore, even if a grocery store carries locally grown food, noticeable signage would be needed to draw shoppers ' attention, because few frequently look at labels to determine place of origin (39 per cent fr equently , 21 per centsometimes).103 25Digesting Public Opinion T able 19: % Very Important Consider Buying Local Important Not Important Freshness 89 84 Nutritious or healthy 73 58Chemicals/pesticides 64 46Cost 62 55Convenience 40 40Organic 27 11Reasons to Buy Locally Produced Food99 98 Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, sponsored by Foodroutes Network, from a report by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, 4 surveys of 400 each, conducted in areas with buy local campaigns (Santa CruzCounty , California; Blackhawk County , Iowa; the Greater Philadelphia Metro region; and Baton Rouge,Louisiana), March 12-21, 2002.

They are particularly likely to support subsidies for small farms, for those farms that have been damaged by weather, and forfarmers who are willing to incorporate environmental practices. There is near universal support for providing federal payments to help farmers stay in business when drought or floods damage farmer 's crops (88 percent approve) and three-quarters approve of providing federal payments to help farmers stay in business when they face low market pricesfor their farm products (77 percent). 104Members of the public are divided in their understanding of the existing subsidy process. Half of Americans (50 percent) believe that farmers receive subsi-dies on a regular annual basis, while nearly as many (46 percent) believe they only receive subsi-dies in bad years. 105 When they take farm size into account, survey respondents support subsidies to small scale farmsand oppose subsidies to large-scale farms. By a 77 percent to 19 percent margin, Americans favorproviding subsidies to farms of less than 500 acres. Forced to choose between conditions, 44 per-cent favor giving subsidies to small farmers only in bad years while 34 percent favor giving subsi-dies on a regular, annual basis. The public is less enthusiastic about subsidies for large farmingbusinesses. In fact, only 31 percent favor and 65 percent oppose giving subsidies to large farmingbusinesses. Those who favor subsidies would provide them in bad years (24 percent) while few(9%) would give subsidies on a regular, annual basis. Similarly , a majority (57 percent) opposesproviding subsidies to businesses that provide farmers with equipment and services, while only36 percent favor providing them subsidies. 106 Americans believe that the US government farm policy currently favors large farming businesses(80 percent), not small farmers (6 percent). 107In fact, the public assumes that more than half of subsidies (58 percent of subsidies on average) go to large agricultural businesses, while 42 per-cent of subsidies go to small farmers. However, they want subsidies to favor small businesses (63 percent of subsidies should go to small farmers, 36 percent to large agricultural businesses).108 The public consistently lands on the side of subsidizing farmers. In a series of two-sided debates, a majority of the public always chose the pro-subsidy stance. The most compelling reasons to support subsidies include controlling food cost, protectingfamily farms from economic competition, the benefits of locally grown foods, food safety andfood supply . (Table 20) People also value farms and ranches for a number of environmental reasons. They believe land owners have a responsibility to be good stewards of the land and support subsidies toencourage environmental practices on farms. People value farms and ranches for a variety of environmental reasons including: as habitats for wildlife, like pheasants, wild ducks, and other animals (58 per centvalue highly), scenic qualities (46 per cent), and recreational opportunities (32 per cent).110 26Digesting Public Opinion 104 Tarrance Group, June 2-June 21, 2001. 105 PIPA and Knowledge Networks, December 19, 2003 - January 5, 2004. 106 PIPA and Knowledge Networks, December 19, 2003 - January 5, 2004. 107 PIPA and Knowledge Networks, December 19, 2003 - January 5, 2004. 108 PIPA and Knowledge Networks, December 19, 2003 - January 5, 2004. 109 Tarrance Group, June 2-June 21, 2001.27In Percent Preferred Statement It is up to individuals to decide how much food they eat. Removing subsidies and driving up the cost of food isnot the way to address the problem of obesity andwould be hard on the pocketbooks of low-incomeAmericans. Family farming is an American way of life that should be maintained. Subsidies are the only way that small familyfarms can compete with large agribusiness and importsfrom low-wage countries. People should have food available to them that was locally grown. Locally grown foods taste better and leadpeople to have a larger share of fresh foods in their diet.Without subsidies, most of our food would be grown faraway, even in foreign countries. Farming is a risky business. Depending on the weather, farmers have good years and bad years. The governmentneeds to help farmers have a minimum income so thatthey can be sure they will get through the bad years. When food is grown in the USA we can be more confi- dent that it meets the proper food safety standards.Subsidies ensure that American farmers can keep pro-ducing safe food for the American people. There is nothing more important than food. The govern- ment needs to subsidize farming to make sure there willalways be a good supply of food and that the price doesnot go up and down, according to the whims of themarket. It is not our responsibility to take care of farmers in other countries. We need to do what is best for Americaand let other countries take care of themselves. It is good for the US to subsidize its farmers because then they are able to provide food to people around theworld at very low prices, enabling poor countries to feedtheir populations and reducing hunger. If we do not give subsidies to US farmers, other devel- oped countries will keep giving subsidies to their farm-ers and the US will not be able to compete in the globalmarket. Farmers in poor countries work for much lower returns than American farmers. Without government subsidies,American farmers won 't be able to compete and a lot of people working on farms will end up unemployed. Subsidizing farmers gives America an important export product. If subsidies were ended it would lead the US toimport more food, worsening the already-bad trade bal-ance we have with other countries. Choosing Between Two Sides of a Farm Subsidy Argument110 Rejected Statement Subsidies have prompted US agribusiness to produce far more food than the US people can eat, driving downthe cost of food. This has led retailers to serve largerportions of food and played a major role in the epidemicof obesity, which is threatening the health of manyAmericans and driving up healthcare costs. There are many ways of making a living that are part of the American way of life. It is unfair to subsidize farmersand not subsidize other equally American ways of mak-ing a living. Having locally grown food is nice, but the people who want it should be willing to pay the extra cost of produc-ing it, rather than expecting the government to subsidizetheir preferences for certain kinds of food. Farmers should not be given preferential treatment. Just like any business, they should have capital reserves andinsurance protection, so they can take care of them-selves if they have a bad year. They should not expectthe government to bail them out. The US government monitors the safety of all food sold in the US, so there is no reason to believe that imported foodis less safe. Subsidizing American agribusiness based onsuch unfounded fears is a waste of taxpayers ' money. It is not consistent with the American way to have a whole sector of the economy dependent on governmenthandouts at taxpayers ' expense. We should trust the market, not the government, to find the right balancebetween supply and demand. It is unfair for US farmers to get government subsidies so that they can sell their products below the price ofproduction, making it impossible for poor farmers tocompete. We don 't like it when other countries do the same kind of thing to us. It is not good for the US to flood the world market with subsidized food. This has been shown to undercut farm-ers in poor countries that rely on agriculture. In manycases this has wiped out their agriculture, made thesecountries dependent on the US and increased hunger. If we give subsidies it is just as likely that other devel- oped countries will just match them, creating an endlesscycle. We should do what makes sense \u2014reduce our subsidies \u2014and press others to do the same. 38 Rather than giving poor countries foreign aid, it is better to let them export what they can produce. For manypoor countries, agricultural products are one of the fewthings they can export. We should not undercut them byflooding the world market with cheap subsidized farmproducts. If the US uses taxpayers ' money to prop up exports, it only creates an illusory gain, because ultimately thesesubsidies have to be paid for by raising taxes or increas-ing deficits. % 79 70 70 6261 58 565454 53 50% 16 25 26 3436 37 373738 38 40 109 PIPA and Knowledge Networks, December 19, 2003 - January 5, 2004.T able 20: A land owner has a responsibility to be a good steward, assert survey participants. Nearly all (94 percent) agree with the statement \"Land owners have responsibilities to protect soil resources for future generations, \" and a majority (56 per cent) believes \"Farmers who fail to adopt needed soil conservation practices should be financially penalized. \"111 The public would like more commitment from farmers concerning environmental practices in exchange for federal subsidies. A majority (58 per cent) states that farmers willing to use prac- tices to protect water and air from pollution should receive more federal payments than farm-ers who refuse to do so, while 31 per cent be lieve the limited money should be based on finan- cial need alone. 112Furthermore, three-quarters and higher approve of several environmental conditions on federal payments: Adopt university tested practices to prevent pollution of streams or other bodies of water 88 per centapprove Protect wetlands on their farm or ranch 83 per cent Apply some conservation practices, such as protecting waterways, wetlands, and wildlife 75 per cent Adopt university tested practices for providing wildlife habitat on their land 73 per cent113 Importantly, the public supports subsidies to encourage environmental practices, but does not see that farms harm the environment. Therefore, farming is not currently an \"environ- mental problem, \" though farmers can be enlisted in environmental solutions. A majority (54 percent) disagrees that \"farming is a major source of pollution in our nation today \" and only 20 per cent agr ee. Furthermore, survey participants select \"undecided \" at high levels when confronted with statements about environmental damage by farming. A plurality(45 percent) is undecided whether, \"Present farming methods are polluting our water supplies, \" while just 34 per cent agree and 21 per centdisagree. Similarly , 43 per cent are undecided whether, \"American farmers use more chemicals than are necessary to produce food, \" though just as many (43 per cent) agree that far mers use more chemicals than necessary . 114 Americans are more likely to worry about the environmental impact by farming in other coun- tries than in the United States. Three quarters worry (74 percent worry , 42 percent worry a greatdeal) about farming 's impact on the environments of other countries, while fewer (61 percent worry , 27 percent worry a great deal) worry about the environmental problems that are causedby U.S. farming methods. 115 Once again, the public assumes that small family farms are more responsible than large scalefarms. More than two-thirds (69 percent) believe that smaller-scale family farms are more likelyto use techniques that will not harm the environment, while 22 percent choose large-scaleindustrial farms. 116 28Digesting Public Opinion 111 Ronald C.

Nearly three-quarters (71 per cent) believe that \"animals deserve some protection from harm and exploitation, \" while 25 per centbelieve that \"animals deserve the exact same rights as people to be free from harm and exploitation. \" Furthermore, a majority favors passing strict laws con- cerning the treatment of farm animals (62 per centsupport, 35 per centoppose). At the same time, the public opposes several proposals concerning the treatment of non-farm animals, suchas: banning all types of hunting (22 per centsupport, 76 per centoppose), banning all medical research on laboratory animals (35 per centsupport, 64 per centoppose), and banning all product testing on laboratory animals (38 per centsupport, 61 per centoppose). 117 However, concern about the humane treatment of animals may be on the rise. One survey showed increases in support for humane treatment standards (48 percent in 2004, up from 37 percent in2003) and humane slaughter (44 percent in 2004 compared to 30 percent in 2003). 118 Majorities are willing to pay for environmentally-friendly farming, but fewer are willing to pay for food production practices that treat animals humanely. Finally , strong majorities report that they are willing to pay more for farming practices that are environmentally friendly: 81 percent agree \"I would be willing to pay more for food grown on farms using good environmental practices. \" 71 percent agree \"I would be willing to pay more for food if it meant that it could be produced in ways that protect the environment. \" 60 percent agree \"I would be willing to pay more for food produced without using chemicals. \"119 Fewer are willing to pay more for the humane treatment of animals. A slim majority (51 percent) reports that they are willing to spend more for humanely-produced food. One in seven (14 per-cent) is willing to pay 5 percent more, one in five (21 percent) is willing to pay 10 percent more,and 16 percent of survey respondents are willing to spend 20 percent more for food produced withthe humane treatment of animals. 120 Summary Points Americans are generally satisfied with various actors in the nation 's food system and see them as trusted spokespeople. At the same time, this high level of public satisfaction indicates there islittle support for government intervention in the nation 's food system. 29Digesting Public Opinion 117 The Gallup Organization, 1,005 adults nationally , May 5-May 7, 2003. Data provided by The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, University of Connecticut. 118 Synovate, May 2003. 119 Ronald C. Wimberley , 2001-2002. 120 Roper Public Affairs & Media, March 26 to April 10, 2004.People are concerned about physical health and have some understanding of the link between food and health. However, they are frequently confused about conflicting health information. Most importantly , the current food-health conversation emphasizes food choices and individ- ual responsibility . The food system is invisible in this conversation. The public is more open to shared responsibility for children 's health and nutrition. Even here, however, support for policies can be easily undermined with more powerful frames,such as parental responsibility . School-based nutrition provides an opening for a conversationabout child health, but since most believe school lunches are nutritious, this may be a chal-lenging approach. Currently , people do not think very much about food processing and production. While they are aware of some dangers and benefits that occur due to food production practices, opinion inthis area is largely unformed and malleable. There may be an opportunity to shape opinion bylinking human health with food production in ways that make the food system more visible. The public holds very positive perceptions of farms, particularly small family farms. People believe small family farms produce safer, more nutritious food and are more likely to protectthe environment. There may be an opportunity build on these understandings to lead to sup-port for policy . The challenge will be in moving people from justpositive feelings toward a more sophisticated understanding that will promote long-term change. 30Digesting Public OpinionNot While I 'm Eating: How and Why Americans Don 't Think about Food Systems Findings from Cognitive Elicitations By Axel Aubrun, Ph.D., Andrew Brown, Ph.D., and Joseph Grady, Ph.D. Background Experts and advocates have had considerable success in educating certain groups of Americans about the nature of, and problems with, our food system. Various pro-ducers, retailers, and consumers are working hard to re-think and re-make food sys-tems into something healthier, more satisfying and more sustainable. Yet most of the U.S. population remains persistently indifferent to the whole question of where their food-stuffs actually come from and whether and how systems might be improved. Without achange in the public 's thinking on issues related to food systems, real progress is likely to be very slow. This research is part of a broader effort, funded by the W .K. Kellogg Foundation, to understand why and how Americans manage to remain blind to the real processes of food production anddistribution - despite the central role of food in American life. Cultural Logic 's cognitive elici- tations with Americans were designed to explore the public 's default patterns of thought related to food systems because, for better or worse, it is by means of these understandings (cognitiveand cultural \"models \") that people think, learn and communicate. Even if they are offered information that is critical from an expert perspective, people 's thinking on the issue can be derailed by the faulty assumptions, misguided inferences, conflicting values, and gaps inknowledge that characterize their current dominant frames. Communications that are meantto be comprehensible and persuasive to the broader population must be crafted with thesedefault understandings in mind - otherwise, messages are likely to be disregarded, disbelieved or misunderstood. In effect, they cannot make their way into the public consciousness. Summary of Findings It will not surprise readers of this report that Americans think very little about where their food comes from. There are a variety of straightforward reasons why this should be the case;for the majority of living Americans, food has always been available and acceptably healthy .Furthermore, fewer and fewer Americans participate in food production, or even witness it. It is partly due to American exceptionalism in such matters that the U.S. stands in such historical contrast with most other cultures in the world, when it comes to interest in howfood is produced. Besides these most obvious reasons, though, there are other powerful factors that prevent Americans from thinking about and engaging with the topic of food systems. The importanceof these factors is that they have the power to derail productive thinking even when experts try to focus the public 's attention on this usually-ignored issue area . This report focuses on two default 31modes of thinking about food, both of which obscure and distort the \"Big Picture. \" The first and more dominant of these modes is based on people 's own Lived Experience - providing \"little picture \" perspectives, along with emotional incentives notto think about food systems. The other is a mode that allows for a \"big picture \" of a sort, but is too generic (and mislead- ing) to be very helpful. The dominance of lived experience Most of the time, for most Americans, thinking about food is dominated by default under- standings and emotional stances that are based on the lived experience of eating, shopping,cooking, being served, and so forth. Various aspects of people 's thinking about foodmake it much harder for them to think about food systems . The big picture is essentially \"crowded out .\" The more familiar and natural patterns of thinking associated with the experiential domain of food are so rich, complete and cognitively satisfying that people typically haveno sense that there is something more to know , and they are not asking the questionsexperts want to answer for them. It is difficult for new information to find its way intothe established, little-picture ways of thinking. New information is translated into new (and less productive) terms by the dominant models. The default patterns of thinking are so powerful that new information (presented by advocates, for example) can become confirmation of existing understandings , rather than helping people achieve new understandings. Warnings about food risks, for instance, areinterpreted as confirmation that individuals need to make smarter choices, and that indi- vidual foods should be avoided, since \"healthy food \" and \"healthy eating \" are understood in these comfortable, little-picture terms - as opposed to having anything to do with sys- tems of production, marketing or cultural patterns. There is emotional pressure to ignore problems in the food system. The lived experience of food creates close ties in people 's thinking between food and nurturance, and various aspects of contemporary culture reinforce people 's sense of being passive \"receivers \" of this food/nurturance. Along with a default Consumer Stance, which prompts people to trust the places where they shop, for example, the FoodReceiver stance discourages people from taking responsibility or thinking critically , andencourages a trusting complacence - people are motivated to block out troubling infor- mation, and in fact, anyinformation about the ultimate sources of food. Importantly , this pattern of denial goes well beyond people 's conscious sense that they 'd \"just as soon not know , \" and shapes their thinking at a more unconscious level. Food systems as just another example of \"Modernization \" When Americans areinduced to move outside their comfortable patterns of reasoning about food, and to think about food production in broader terms, their thinking reflects a genericsense of how the \"modern \" world works - incorporating fragmentary information about food systems, but not adding up to a fuller picture that could help people understand the impor-tance of the changes advocated by experts. 32Not While I 'm EatingMembers of the public can, when pressed, offer simple sketches of some of the basic elements of the American food system, including large, corporate farms (which may be relatively high-tech); distribution to restaurants and stores (especially including supermarkets); extensiveprocessing of basic foodstuffs into ready-made products; and government guarantees of foodquality . At first glance, this sketch seems to correspond well (if very incompletely) to expertmodels. Upon closer examination, though, it is clear that rather than a simplified food sys-tem model, people are operating from a generic model of Modernization, and plugging intheir smattering of factual knowledge about food and food production. While this publicmodel overlaps with expert understandings, it also entails significant distortions, unfortunateassumptions and cognitive \"blind spots \" such as the following: The degree of modernization is exaggerated. Applying the generic narrative of modernization to food, people may believe that family farms are extinct, or else entirely irrelevant to the actual food supply; that all food pro-duction is in the hands of multifaceted conglomerates; and that farms are almost indis-tinguishable from factories. Modernization is seen as unstoppable. Since modernization as a general trend is seen as an inevitable, impersonal progression, Americans often believe the same about food systems. There is nothing people do to \"cause \" modernization, and nothing they can do to stop it or substantially guide its progress. Problems are the \"price of progress. \" The most natural way of understanding problems within a \"Modernization \" frame are as costs of the benefits we all want. Attempted \"solutions \" to the problems may be seen as misguided interference which threatens the benefits. Certain kinds of information have no place and are filtered out. If people 's thinking about food is shaped by a \"modernization \" schema - rather than by a (missing) food system model - then information that doesn 't fit that schema is harder to focus on and remember. This helps explain why people don 't understand sustainability (preserving things as they are sounds like a contradiction of modernization), diversity(of crops or of farmers - modernization is largely \"about \" standardization), agricultural subsidies (which can seem like Quixotic bulwarks against modernization), or organicfarming (which can seem like an irrelevant side current, or another attempt to resistmodernization). More generally , the lack of a specific model of food systems means that certain kinds of information has no place to \"stick\" in people 's minds. (It is a well-established principle in the cognitive sciences that facts are not stored like isolated objects in the mind, but as parts ofbroader organizing \"schemas, \" \"models, \" or \"frames. \") The limited educational value of food scares Food scares have some power to raise awareness about larger issues related to food produc- tion, but their effects are severely limited by the powerful default patterns of thinkingdescribed above. 33Not While I 'm Eating Food scares may serve simply to confirm the generic Modernization narrative. Rather than adding new understandings to people 's repertoire, food scares are just as likely to simply confirm familiar ideas about the inevitable costs and risks of progress.Since people are generally passive and complacent about progress, a particular food scareis not likely to lead them in productive directions. Familiar little-picture models reassert themselves quickly in people 's thinking. Even if people catch a brief glimpse of a systems perspective on food, they are likely to return to a more natural mode of reasoning focused on lived experience and the \"little picture. \" Food safety issues become questions about smart individual choices at the store, or disappear altogether as people 's Consumer and Food Receiver models take over, allowing them to forget the uncomfortable information and resume their enjoyment ofthe products of the food system. The news media 's brief, episodic discussion of food safety \"incidents \" makes it especially easy for people to take in information without learning anything of substance. Research Method The analysis presented here is based on interviews conducted by Cultural Logic in 2005 with a diverse group of thirty individuals in Indiana, North Carolina, California and Rhode Island. Subjects Subjects were recruited by various means, including postings on Web sites and through a process of ethnographic networking - researchers began with \"seed contacts \" in each of the target communities, and developed a pool of subjects from which a diverse range was selectedfor interviewing. 1The sample included 15 women and 15 men. Subjects ' ages ranged widely - 10 subjects were in their teens or 20s, 9 in their 30s, 5 in their 40s, and 6 were 60 or older. 20 of the subjects were European-American, 4 were African-American, 3 were Asian-American and 3 were Hispanic-American. The sample also included a mix of political orienta-tions (11 conservatives, 1 independent, and 18 liberals), and of people who live and grew upin urban, suburban and rural areas. Educational backgrounds also ranged widely (high-schoolonly to graduate degree) as did occupations. 2 Elicitations Subjects participated in one-on-one, semi-structured, recorded interviews ( \"cognitive elicita- tions \"), conducted according to methods adapted from psychological anthropology . The goal of this methodology is to approximate a natural conversation while also encouraging the sub-ject to reason about a topic from a wide variety of perspectives, including some that are unex-pected and deliberately challenging. Cognitive Analysis This type of data-gathering - and the analysis of transcripts, based on techniques of cognitive 34Not While I 'm Eating 1See discussion of \"snowball sampling \" as a key technique of ethnographic research in H. Russell Bernard 's Research Methods in Anthropology: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches, 2nd Edition . 1995. (pp.97ff). 2Note that, rather than looking for differences between groups as some research methods do, cognitive elicitations are designed to identify common patterns across groups of Americans.anthropology and linguistics - yields insights not available from standard interview , polling, or focus group techniques. It does not look for statements of opinion, but for patterns ofthought that may even be unconscious. It does not look for familiarity with issues in thenews, but for more established and long-standing, default reasoning patterns. Some of theclues to these important patterns come from topics that are omitted , moments of inconsistency where one understanding clashes with another, and the metaphors people use to talk about a subject. Furthermore, the method is designed to explore the differences between rhetorical mode - in which people define themselves in opposition to other groups and perspectives, and repeat ideas and phrases familiar from public discourse - and reasonable mode - in which they reflect their own experiences, think for themselves, and are more open to new information.Put briefly , this analysis focuses on howpeople think rather than what they think. Cognitive research works on the premise that unconscious, default understandings of the world (cognitive and cultural models ) can guide people 's understanding of an issue in ways they do not even recognize. One of the most important aspects of these default models is thatthey often lead people to understandings that they might reject at other moments of morecareful reflection. For example, average Americans recognize on an intellectual level thattheir food comes from a complex process of production and distribution that is very impor-tant to their quality of life, yet habitual ways of thinking about food create cognitive \"blind spots. \" People who know better on some level , still are easily derailed from thinking about food systems because of well-established, default understandings of the world. These hidden,underlying understandings can be very difficult to challenge and displace, and, if they are notaccounted for, they can derail communications. Finding 1: Interference from Dominant Models One of the chief obstacles to engaging the public on issues related to food systems is people 's powerful tendency to think in modes that exclude the knowledge that expert messages arebased on: People rarely think about food systems , because their thinking is dominated and guided by \"Little Picture \" understandings of food, based on their own lived experience. The experience of food The natural and default understandings that guide people 's thinking about food most of the time are rooted in their direct experiences of shopping, cooking, serving, being served andeating. When asked what was important to them about food, people inevitably answered withmodels rooted in their direct, everyday experience of food. I think good food is enjoyable, something that tastes good. I like to cook, so for me, good food is something that I know I cooked . . . I like trying new things. You know you 're getting pleas- ure out of eating something that you haven 't had before. Suburban female, age 29 If you 've ever taken your time and you had no obligations, just chilling, eating food with your family and just hanging out, it 's like the greatest thing. Yeah. At family get-togethers. Definitely food. Food 's awesome. ... No, to tell you honestly, I really don 't care where the food comes from. I 'd rather like to think that it came from somewhere and somebody got paid for it and everybody 's happy but I 'm sure it 's not the case all the time. Rural male, age 25 35Not While I 'm EatingPeople 's thinking about each of these experiential domains is dominated by rich sets of famil- iar, cognitively satisfying models. Food is variously construed as: nutrients for a body; a matter of individual pleasure and aesthetics; a source of comfort or opportunity for exploration; a way through which people construct and live a particular \"style\" of life (individual, regional, ethnic, and so on); a matter of personal health and self-discipline; a daily chore; a significant expense. Unfortunately , and to a striking degree, these understandings do not require any \"Big Picture \" grasp at all of where food comes from. The significance of the dominance of these lived-experience models is that they can actively interfere with and derail attempts to communicate about broader issues. Crowding out other models To some extent, little-picture models of food simply \"occupy the space \" in people 's minds where experts would like to introduce new information and patterns of understanding.Because their current understandings feel so complete, people typically don 't seek out infor- mation about food systems - they are not asking the questions that experts would like to answer . More insidiously , these default models guide people 's thinking in ways that distort the kinds of information provided by advocates and experts. Example: A model for production and distribution: the store and the cook Cognitive models already exist that explain where food comes from, but these are decidedly not the models that experts would like people to think in terms of. Models based on livedexperience only follow the chain of production and distribution back one or two steps - to the cook and to the store. This little picture reflects people 's familiar patterns of giving and receiving food, and so, from a cognitive perspective, it \"explains \" food production, distribu- tion and consumption, blinding people to broader understanding. When people are ques-tioned about the food they eat, they find it hard to think beyond the retail outlet. Q: When you think about the food that you eat, what are the steps that get it to your table, whether it 's bread or produce or whatever? A: Oh, you mean like the steps \u2014 in other words shopping, or microwave? Q: More like, How was it produced? How did it end up in the grocery store?A: That, I 'm not as familiar with. Urban female, age 33 A: Fish? Where does it come from? Well, it comes from the ocean. Q: Sure. But so how does it get here?A: Oh um, I never really thought of that. I guess they fish for it. 36Not While I 'm EatingQ: OK. Who do you picture fishing? A: I don 't know , kind of I guess just fishermen. I don 't know exactly. Q: What 's the picture in your head if there is one? A: Well when I do buy fish, I normally buy it at a Chinese market. It 's like an indoor market. It's a supermarket or like a grocery story. But it 's just for Chinese food ... and if I 'm going to buy shrimp or fish or anything I 'll buy it there. Because it 's fresh. Urban female, age 37 Information \"translated \" by dominant models When experts offer information about some aspect of food systems, this information often ends up reinforcing people 's current understandings rather than introducing new ones. This is because the public 's dominant, pre-existing models already seem to \"explain \" the facts experts want to talk about, so that \"new information \" in fact confirms and strengthens the established understandings that are based on the lived-experience, little-picture perspective. Example: Personal health as good individual food choices From an expert perspective, there are important health effects that emerge from properties of food systems. From the perspective of the public 's little-picture models, though, health effects arise from individual food choices and the characteristics of individual foods . The average person makes food choices first and foremost based upon availability , aesthetics, price, and convenience. But healthfulness is one area where many Americans do a consider-able amount of cognitive work. Their cognitive models of healthy eating give them ways ofthinking about the repercussions of food choices, taking in complex and changing informa-tion, making calculations, and making partly moral judgments about success (i.e. being\"good \" and disciplined) and failure (i.e. being \"bad\" or undisciplined). However, people remain relatively blind to the health effects of Food Systems. Instead their thinking takesplace entirely within a little picture. \"Individuals can and should choose healthy options .\" This stance is fundamentally about individuals and not about food systems, and it incor- porates ideas of morality , maturity and self-discipline. It is a person 's bad choices that lead to ill-health. Look around you. Everybody who weighs 300 pounds has made an unwise choice. Health stuff is in the media. Nobody doesn 't know that a stick of butter is too much for one day. And a lot of people probably use a stick of butter in a day. Rural female, age 65 It takes a certain amount of discipline to [eat healthy], and I don 't think the general public has that. Not to eat un healthy. T o incorporate more vegetables into a diet. And why would I think that? Because I see it on the news about obesity running rampant. Suburban male, age 30 This little picture model that focuses upon individuals, their knowledge, their personal discipline, and their \"moral fiber \" pre-empts any explanation that tries to take the effects of food systems into account. It is a powerful item of \"common sense \" that is very difficult to contradict. 37Not While I 'm EatingAnd viewed through this powerful cognitive lens, a systems view (e.g. \"corporations are irre- sponsibly marketing unhealthy food \") sounds like an \"excuse \" for people who lack the wis- dom or strength of character to choose wisely . \"Healthfulness is in the ingredients, not the system. \" In the cultural models that link food with health, food is assembled from ingredients (like fat, or preservatives, or whole grains), each of which has some impact on an individualbody 's health. This limited view offers no help in understanding systems-related health issues, which can include epidemiological effects across populations, environmentalimpacts, and the effects of corporate ownership on food quality . Ultimately , the models imply that the response to most problems with food is not to intervene in the systems that create the food, but rather to use different ingredients, and for individualsto make better choices. If people are to learn to associate human health with healthy food sys-tems, they will need a great deal of help in seeing these connections and adopting a broaderperspective than the ones they are comfortable with. Emotional resistance created by dominant models Not only do the public 's default models \"occupy the cognitive space \" and \"answer the questions \" people have about food, they also involve emotionally important stances toward food, many ofwhich are counterproductive from the perspective of experts and advocates. These stances can actpowerfully against people 's ability to think critically (or at all) about food systems. Case 1: Food is about \"being nurtured \" Importantly , many of our most intimate associations with the lived experience of food (and our sense of where it comes from) involve nurturance of one kind or another. Eating, sharingfood, taking part in meals and gatherings, being treated to a night out are all examples of thislived experience. There is also a basic and universal set of associations that relate parentingto giving food, and childhood to receiving food. These comfortable and well-entrenched waysof thinking about food actually discourage thinking about the bigger picture, and food systems in the expert sense. Passive gratitude Part of the pleasure and appreciation of food is accepting the role of receiver, of being nurtured. Being fed, looked after, cared for, tended to, treated, and so on, involves a pas-sive stance of acceptance that calls for gratitude, not analysis. This also clearly places thesource of food at the nurturer, especially the parent and the cook. This little picture isself-contained, familiar and powerful and the big picture has no role to play here. Good food reminds me of something. Whether it be a holiday, or something my mom cooks. Often to me good food is comforting. It 's satisfies a desire or craving a lot of times. For me food is a memory thing. Suburban Female, age 24 If people associate eating with being nurtured, they are motivated notto think hard about where the food is actually coming from, beyond the immediate offerer. And given 38Not While I 'm Eatingthe current American system of food production and distribution, average Americans find themselves more and more often in the passive role of receiver/child: With the growing reliance upon processed foods and convenience foods, people cook less and rely upon professionalized food systems more for preparation and presentation. Because of an individualistic social system, we are eager for nurturance in our lives, and food is a common resource. The desire for \"comfort foods, \" regardless of who actually prepared them, is a case in point. The consumer industry caters to this need. Advertising focuses on the nurturing dimen- sion of food, commonly portraying food as love, and often supplying iconic nurturantfigures as spokespeople. People speak about commercial food providers in much thesame way as they would family members. I love McDonalds. I 've had it ever since I was a little girl. I used to call it \"Donald 's.\" That was practically my first word. Urban female, age 19 If I was still married, my wife would be cooking the food and whatever she decided, whether we 're going to be watching our weight or eating a lot of protein . . . Now , for breakfast I go up to McDonalds and I get a McGriddle, which keeps me going through themorning. And then I 'll get a wrap or a salad or something for lunchtime. I 'm mostly in the hands of what, whoever prepares food. Urban male, age 62 For all these reasons, food regularly appears in front of us without our needing to understand much about it, as we rely upon others to think about it for us. The passive stance towardfood - which discourages critical engagement with food systems - is perpetually reinforced from all sides. At some level, no one wants to think ill of their nurturers. The experience of feeling nurtured depends on trusting the \"nurturer \" - whether a parent, a small farmer, or Archer Daniels Midland. The nurturing role is morally good by default, and not compatible with the troublingtruths about food systems. The appropriate response to being nurtured is gratitude, deferenceand acceptance. To respond otherwise is ingratitude, an attitude most people try to avoid. Efforts to get people to dwell on problems of the (nurturing) food system can violate people 's deep desire to be secure, to be nurtured and to successfully nurture others. Ultimately , theFood Receiver stance promotes denial about the problematic nature of food and food systems.When people are asked to start with their familiar, lived experience of food and \"think out- wards \" about the larger food system, they will often be only reluctantly critical. Case 2: The Consumer Stance Like \"being nurtured, \" the \"consumer stance \" is an extremely powerful default model that interferes with people 's ability to understand and critique the big picture of food systems. The Consumer Stance is a general, little-picture orientation for Americans that limits and distortsthinking on many different issues (including health insurance and energy , to name two oth-ers), and in a variety of different ways: It implies a hierarchical relationship between provider and buyer, and a child-like passivity on the part of the consumer. 39Not While I 'm Eating It makes the idea of a \"system \" (which is broken, dysfunctional, or in need of improve- ment) hard to focus on. It narrows an individual 's scope of action to merely choosing from pre-existing alterna- tives. (A consumer does not typically imagine or create alternative products, but merelychooses to buy , not buy , or search further.) Like the model of healthy eating, for instance, the Consumer Stance - toward food or any- thing else - is a little-picture perspective that is perfectly self-contained and \"good to think. \" It seems to explain how the world works, and limits the kinds of questions people ask. People 's thinking about food fits very naturally within the Consumer Stance perspective. Understandings that focus upon the table and the point of sale are perfectly coherent, and feelcomplete, without any reference to the broader picture of where food comes from. Following this model, even if people do notice problems with food, they act only through consumer choice. For instance, if they want to reject factory farming, they opt out by pur-chasing free-range meats or organic produce - they do not seek to reform the food system. In the Consumer Stance appeals to reform the food system seem at best superfluous and at worstan infringement on people 's freedom of choice. Even when challenged to think abstractly about the implications of food systems, people tend to fall back to understandings based on consumer choice. For the most part I think the food [at the farmer 's market] is more expensive because it 's grown more carefully and it 'scared for . I guess I see myself as being able to make some choices. I do not make a lot of money but I can make some choices. I think so many peopledon't have choices. And I think that 's too bad . . . Or they don 't have the knowledge, or they see the coupons at the supermarket and go for the frozen food that 's half-off that week. Rural female, age 53 If you know it 's local, then you might know who 's growing it. And what they 're doing to it. Then you have an easier time picking and choosing the kinds of things you 're willing to ingest. Whether it 's chemicals or genetically altered foods or whatever . Rural female, age 19 The myth of \"consumer demand \" The Consumer Stance includes a specific view of how products \"come to be. \" There is a well-established and widespread presumption that consumer choice creates \"demand, \" which is then met by suppliers - things are there on the shelves because consumers want them there. While this is partly true, the model exaggerates the degree to which con-sumer choice shapes the system. It almost completely obscures the ways in which con-sumer behavior is created, shaped and constrained by the food system. To the extent that people stay within the little picture of the Consumer Stance, they find it difficult to understand the power that systems of production and distribution haveover their daily lives. 40Not While I 'm EatingA: They 've engineered the tougher skin so the apple can travel. Q: So what do you think about that?A: I guess it 's ok. I don 't see any harm in the apple. It just doesn 't taste as good. It 's not as comforting as an apple that you can bite into easily. But as long as people put up with itand go on buying it, I don 't think a tougher skin hurts the apple. Rural female, age 65 Following this model, the only appropriate way that people shape the system is to \"vote with their pocketbooks. \" The \"decent merchant \" It is difficult for people to think of products that enter their homes as having morally problematic origins. The fact that the clothes we wear are often produced in sweatshops(and even by slave labor) has proved shocking to consumers; yet it is easy for most of usto quickly return to our usual way of thinking. Food is particularly intimate - it enters not just our homes but our bodies - and thus is hard to associate with bad origins. The \"fantasy food system \" In many ways, direct and indirect, American food marketing creates a parallel, imaginary food system that encourages people not to think about the real system. This system ispartly based on nostalgic, traditional images and partly on pure fantasy . Marketers dis-play images of sunny kitchens instead of factories; happy , flower-eating cows donatetheir milk for the children; and the magic of cartoon elves stands in for the work ofcookie-making chemists. The bucolic farm scene that is still central in American stereo-typed understandings of rural life is often pictured. These images are more attractive andin many ways a better fit with default thinking than are the real systems. Q: Would you have any sense of where the milk that you would buy would come from? A: Local dairy, local cows I would guess. Q: If you picture where those cows are what comes to mind?A: They 're in a nice green pasture somewhere. Q: Do you figure that 's probably the truth or is that how you would like to picture it? A: That 's the way I 'd like to picture it. They probably eat out of a trough and don 't wander around very much. Urban male, age 62 Ads or campaigns that address the bigger picture (health, environmentalism, social justice, etc.) face a tough uphill battle against the fantasies reinforced by marketers. A cumulative \"gravitational effect \" While members of the public are capable of critiquing aspects of the American food system, the unconscious patterns we have described in this section exert a powerful pull that bringpeople 's thinking back again and again into line with comfortable models. It is hard to \"keep people on track \" in a critical discussion about food systems, and even though people can sometimes talkcritically about the topic, they may actwith the trust and complacency consis- tent with the models described here. 41Not While I 'm EatingIn the next section we consider more carefully what happens as people are able to maintain attention on (relatively) realistic understandings of the American food system. Finding 2: Food Systems and Modernization When pressed, average Americans are able to provide a reasonably coherent, if very impover- ished, description of a larger food production and distribution system. The account they offerincludes some of the basic elements of what experts would like Americans to consider as theythink about food and where it comes from. It is clear, however, that people are essentially making this account up as they go along - they have no established understanding that they can easily call to mind, and instead they must scratch their heads and imagine what the \"real story \" is, or must be. Their method for doing this appears to involve taking fragmentary pieces of knowledge about food production that they have absorbed and \"plugging them in \" to a very familiar, pre-existing cultural model - their understanding of Modernization. The resulting account includes many gaps and distortions, and can be thought of as a simplifiedcaricature of actual U.S. food systems - one that is probably as counterproductive as it is helpful, from the perspective of advocates. An educated guess: modernized food systems Because modernization is related to changing food systems in the understandings of experts as well, the average person 's systems view , such as it is, does overlap with an expert model. Agricultural system People surmise that food is produced primarily by large-scale agricultural operations, relying upon machine technology and scientifically-developed inputs such as chemical fertilizers andpesticides. They don 't assume that the food system is dominated by owner-operated family farmers who sell directly to retailers. Instead, people often sketch a system more character-ized by corporate-client, manager-employee, and buyer-seller relationships. Economic system People have a sense that farming success is not just dependent upon weather, soil and pests, but also upon market forces, competition and government policies. They see \"economic forces \" as a primary cause of changes in the food system. Distribution, retail & marketing system They can more or less visualize a complex and modern distribution system, where large com- panies buy up, process and truck products to supermarkets, food \"factories, \" and restaurants. As far as the US goes I 'm sure they probably raise [cows] on large cattle farms and, you know , slaughter them and probably pack them up, put them on trucks. Maybe they send them to fac-tories to package them, but I 'm not sure about that. Then they probably send their trucks from there and go to each individual place. Rural female, age 23 Regulatory system They are aware of regulatory agencies like the FDA and USDA, which are entrusted with inspecting and ensuring the safety of the food supply . 42Not While I 'm EatingDynamic systems They believe that all of these systems have been evolving in tandem with other changes in society as a whole. Yet despite these apparent parallels between expert and lay thinking, there are very significant problems in the public 's understanding, as it is shaped by the modernization narrative. Distorting Effect 1: Exaggerating the degree of Modernization While it does bear seeds of truth, the public 's model of modernization is much more rigid and extreme than the experts '. Pretty soon I don 't think they 'll even have to have land. I mean I guess they 're probably going to be able to just do something in a laboratory or something. Urban female, age 37 The modernization story \"takes over \" in Americans ' minds, and the resulting caricature of modernized agriculture, food processing and distribution actually interferes with people 's ability to become more knowledgeable and sophisticated about existing food systems. Oneimportant problem is that because people tend to hold such an extreme view of how agricul-ture has changed, alarming facts presented by advocates might actually strike people as goodnews (!) by comparison with what they already believed. Small, owner-operated, family farms gone or irrelevant While in some modes of thinking, Americans picture a rural landscape filled with bucolic family farms, Americans also \"toggle \"3to a view in which family farms are basically a thing of the past. In this understanding, most of the food found in the supermarket comes from a sys-tem almost entirely dominated by corporations and large-scale operations. I think we probably tend to think of the classic farm, like a small family-owned farm, but I think in reality they 're all pretty large factories nowadays, sprawling complexes with ware- houses, and lines and rows and rows of chickens and livestock and all that. . . I would imagineit's run by some corporate interest, I just don 't think it 's Ma and Pa Kettle anymore. Suburban male, age 35 They 're gone. The small farmer 's gone. Rural female, age 65 A variant of the understanding that family farms are (nearly) extinct is the idea that they are on the landscape - and help form part of the idyllic rural utopia people hope still exists - but have little or nothing to do with the \"real\" food system. In other words, people may hold a model of the bucolic family farm that is unconnected to their understandings of the food they buy andeat, or with the whole of the modern food system. In effect, words like farm, farmer , crops , cows, and so on can actually divert people from thinking about the food system altogether. I live by a bunch of farms but they aren 't really that full scale, ship to ten different supermarkets 43Not While I 'm Eating 3We use the term \"toggling \" to refer to switching between simultaneously held yet contradictory beliefs about the world. People toggle in response to different situations or contextual cues.type farms, just your little stands. I actually go to the farm and buy stuff from the farm itself. . . It's not like they really give it anywhere else. Rural male, age 25 The small family farms are almost nonexistent anymore. You have a lot of large corporation farms. . . Those constitute the majority of the volume of food that 's produced . . . I 've seen a lot of people with small tracts of land, who I don 't think farm so much for production or profit. I think they farm for their own consumption. Urban male, age 34 I think [family farming] is just fading. It 's like the blacksmith. It 's going to get to the point where it 's not a career so much as almost a calling. Suburban male, age 40 In this common way of thinking, family farms - along with farm stands, farmers markets, and \"subsistence farming \" - represent a sort of parallel universe to the modern food system. The farmer 's market is an old fashioned, inefficient (inconvenient), quaint place populated by ide- alists or poor entrepreneurs. It is not really integral either to an individual 's shopping needs or to the \"real\" economy as a whole. Smaller food processors and distributors gone People visualize a complex and modern distribution system, where large companies buy up, process and truck products to supermarkets, food \"factories, \" and restaurants. Again, this image mirrors what people believe has happened to business sectors across the spectrum. A: Wheat 's grown, it 's harvested ... Q: What 's the place where it 's grown? A: A field, I don 't know . On a large corporate wheat farm owned probably by Beatrice or one of those companies. It 's harvested, brought to a mill, ground. [The mill] is probably owned by the same people. Kind of like the McDonald 's model - from coming up out of the ground 'til it gets on the shelf. The bread 's baked in one of their bakeries and shipped by their trucking company. Suburban male, age 40 \"Farmers \" replaced by \"managers and laborers \" The concept of \"farmer \" doesn 't fit well with the modernized food system that people are try- ing to describe. Experts should note that the term means different things to different people.When questioned about food systems, people often translate the farmer into a kind of manag-er, or they drop the term altogether and describe a system of corporate owners, managers andworker-laborers. [The farmer 's typical day is] probably not getting out and milking the cows at four in the morning and driving a plow through the fields all day long. It 's much more like being a facto- ry worker , or foreman of the factory, going around, making sure things are working as theyneed to be working. Suburban male, age 35 44Not While I 'm EatingIndustrialized agriculture Low-tech, old-fashioned agrarian practices give way to high-tech, industrialized technologies. People believe that modern agriculture relies upon machine technology and automation. Theimages they call to mind are drawn from factories rather than traditional farms. My family, my grandfathers and my dad: they were all steel workers. Farming is done like that. It 's mass production. Urban male, age 62 When I drive by they 're running the tractors and stuff. But then you don 't see a huge amount of that. So I 'm assuming there 's a factory somewhere where they do their thing and they 're run- ning machines. I 'm assuming there 's a lot of automation to it these days. Suburban female, age 37 Corporate farms are almost run like the Department of Public Works of any city. All the com- bines, all the equipment is kept in a central location and they have thousands and thousands ofacres to tend and crop dust and water and irrigation and all that. Suburban male, age 40 In sum, people 's sense that agriculture has been transformed is somewhat accurate but also exaggerated in ways that are destructive. For instance, the fact that there are still about 2 mil-lion family farmers in the U.S. sounds like surprising (good) news to average people. Distorting Effect 2: Modernization as an unstoppable force The Modernization Model comes pre-assembled with rather rigid understandings about change - including the ideas that it is irreversible, inevitable and to a great extent outside of direct human control. It also entails a mix of benefits and costs. But, according to the model,like it or not, progress happens. These in-built prejudices about the general nature of change present particular challenges to advocates wishing to make changes specific to food systems - especially changes that seems to violate the model. People 's default assumption is that altering the nature of Food Systems is akin to diverting the course of modernization, a project most people would regard as fool-ish or hopeless. I look at corporate farming as sort of a necessary ... evil? Not even evil. It 's, uh, neutral. It just is what it is. It 's the way food is grown. It 's not good or bad. Suburban male, age 40 According to the logic of the Modernization Model, it is essentially impossible to go \"back- ward \" - things go from old and pre-modern to new and modern. This creates a strong preju- dice that modern things (e.g. chemicals, corporations) are of the future, while more tradition-al things (e.g. family farms or herbicide-free tilling) are of the past and outmoded. Given themodel, some expert messages \"make sense \" while others don 't. For instance, it makes sense that big corporations replace small grocers, but the idea that butchers can out-compete meat-packing multi-nationals violates the \"common sense \" supplied by the model. 45Not While I 'm EatingDarwinian change In the public model of Modernization, there is no active agent - modernization is a process beyond the control of people. In the American understanding, it is driven by a kind ofDarwinian competition between old and new ways. For instance, people explain the declineof the family farm and the spread of new technologies as a result of finding \"more efficient \" or \"more competitive \" ways of doing things. It requires a very pressing reason to \"go against \" the natural logic of this process. Q: It doesn 't sound like you see it as an important goal, to try to get more farmers farming. A: I 'm for the small farmer , but I can 't see them being real successful against the big corporations. Q: It 's a little bit like they 're dinosaurs? A: Yeah unfortunately. They can 't compete with the big corporations. Suburban female, age 37 We have become a more modern society. I think that fewer people have been able to make a liv- ing farming and so they turn to other things. Obviously inventions and technology havechanged farming a lot and made it easier to do some things and more difficult to do others. Ahundred years ago, most people farmed. And now today most people don 't farm. Urban female, age 24 Passivity in the face of Modernization The Modernization model frames change as something that happens to you. You can adapt or resist it, but as an individual you are not the one who makes the system change. It is a modelof transformation that inspires a passive, or at best a \"reactive \" stance that stresses accommo- dation or resistance. A: You don 't have the little farms. They have all been bought up because they haven 't been as efficient. Q: Would you see any cons to that?A: I suppose the social aspects of not having a lot of people engaged in agriculture, but they can get jobs doing something else. They 've had to. There 's been that social change that 's been forced upon people but that 's OK. Farming is a tough way to make a living I think. Urban male, age 62 Modernization is all-encompassing Institutions across the spectrum in the US have been growing in scale and complexity , and according to the Modernization view , food production, distribution and processing have beenchanging more or less in lock-step with everything else. Since many traditional characteris-tics of life seem to be disappearing, like the intimacy and power of local communities, thescope of action and influence for individuals, and so on, the same should go for food systems.In short, people do not assume that food systems are a separate case, and this magnifies thesense of inertia that accompanies all of these trends described above. Distorting Effect 3: Problems as \"the price of progress \" or \"need for more progress \" Just as the modernization model entails rigid and unhelpful understandings of change, it also entails characteristic ways of understanding problems. When people are reasoning (uncon-sciously) in terms of the model, any given problem related to food is understood in terms of aproblem related to modernization. 46Not While I 'm EatingThere are two key types of problem encompassed within the American model of moderniza- tion. The first and more dominant is the idea that progress inevitably means the loss of cer-tain positive features of life. Even though Americans tend to view themselves as people whoembrace innovation and progress, their model of modernization also includes drawbacks suchas increasingly intrusive technologies, bureaucracies, corporations etc. Another unpleasantentailment of progress is people 's increasing powerlessness in the face of larger and more indifferent systems in various spheres of life. Critiques of food systems are swept up into thisgeneral model of \"what is wrong in the world. \" My sisters all work jobs and they don 't sit down and eat locally grown. They get microwaves and they stick something in there and that 's their dinner and that 's just the way it has to be . . . When I was growing up, it was just simpler . But now there 's more people here. There 's more people living in big cities. In the more suburban areas it 's just a more complex life. You don 't have time to prepare and cook. And so you eat crap basically. [My sisters] try to do the bestthey can but none of that stuff that you put in the microwave was grown by farmers. Or if itwas, it was grown far away and shipped over and frozen somewhere. Suburban male, age 44 These and other kinds of change are understood as the \"price of progress \" in a cost-benefit sense. When it comes to the details of change, there is a good deal of uncertainty about whatproblems ought to be solved and which ought to be accepted as drawbacks that are necessaryto allow the good change people want. Q: How do you feel about [trying to preserve family farms]? A: If you get to the supermarket you 're always guaranteed that your food 's going to be there. Whereas if you go to a little farm, there 's a limited amount there. People are busy already. So unless they plan on doing all their food shopping on a farm on a weekend, and just taking their time, I don 't think they 'll go for the little farm thing. Rural male, age 25 We can either have the set up that we have today where there are farmers making food and there are lawyers doing law and there are writers writing books or we can go back 200 years agowhere everyone lives on a farm and everyone makes their own clothes and their own furniture. Rural female, age 53 According to the cost-benefit logic of modernization, trying to \"solve \" a problem could prove disastrous if it means interfering with the benefits of progress. Clearly , this kind of thinking isincompatible with a simple problems and solutions presentation of downsides of the Americanfood system. People are likely to resist some solutions even when they understand them. A second way of understanding problems, within the Modernization model, is that progress simply hasn 't made enough headway in certain areas, yet. This is the case, for example, with some people 's understanding of food safety . I'm entirely for the genetically altered food, because to me genetically altering it just reduces the need for any chemical, pesticide, fertilizer . That will be the wave of the future. And oncepeople get over the bugaboo of fearing it, then I think that what you 're going to find is that organic is going to take on a whole different meaning. Suburban male, age 40 47Not While I 'm Eating[Food] is safer than it used to be, but I don 't think it 's as safe as it could be. One of the things I read up on a few years ago was irradiation of food. How that would really dramaticallyincrease the safety of food and yet the FDA wouldn 't let them do it. Urban male, age 50 The Modernization model leads people to expect that the advancing frontiers of progress will eventually catch up with a problem like this and solve it. The best approach for an individualor a community may just be to \"stay out of the way . \" Distorting Effect 4: Information filtered out by the Modernization model Of course average Americans are not, and will never be, experts on food systems. There are relatively basic facts that they tend not to know - for instance, virtually no-one in the thirty elicitations showed any awareness of herbicide use as an issue. The relevance of an organizing model like Modernization is that it means that certain pieces of information are more likely to stick and be absorbed than others, because they fit themodel and make perfect sense. Other concepts or pieces of information don 't fit the frame, and are therefore \"hard to think. \" The Modernization story itself has no role for herbicides, for example, so unless people have had a very specific and vivid exposure to the topic (asthey have with the toxic effects of some pesticides) they are likely to remain oblivious to it. The following are several other areas where people do not understand an issue in the way experts would like - at least partly because the issue does not fit neatly with thinking about modernization: Sustainability There is virtually no familiarity with the term, except among a small percentage of active, environmentally-oriented individuals. People do not know what \"sustainability \" means in regard to agriculture, and cannot guess why our food systems might be unsustainable, exceptin two senses: Some are aware that soil \"wears out \" over time, and many guess that the term \"sustainability \" refers to economic viability - i.e. the idea that it is harder and harder for farmers to pass their farms along to their children. The very concept of sustainability (preserving things as they are) is a direct contradiction of normal attitudes toward progress. Clearly , the Sustainability argument is one that has yet to bemade in an effective way with the public - and just as clearly , this argument will be fighting uphill against understandings of modernization. Diversity People do not understand the continuing diversity of farm-types and farmers, nor why such diversity might be practical and desirable. They aren 't at all aware of the issue of monoculture, or of any problems this might create. These issues also seem to contradict the modernization model in which one of the familiar \"costs \" is standardization and bland efficiency . Subsidies Average Americans have only a very limited sense of what agricultural subsidies are, and no 48Not While I 'm Eatingreal sense of the way that they shape food systems. They are usually understood as assistance to family farmers, to allow them to stay in business one more year, for instance. Q: What do you think the purpose of the subsidies is? A: Well, it 's this idea that farmers can 't possibly exist on their own as a business entity, that they need the government to prop them up Suburban male, age 35 This type of approach certainly seems out of step with the passive, hands-off approach that modernization models call for, and if anything, can be understood as a direct attempt (possi-bly well-justified, possibly Quixotic) to combat modernization. Organic While there is a shared understanding that organic food is grown without pesticides, there is a striking lack of consensus about the details of organic farming and whether it makes sense. Unfortunately , organic farming is often seen mainly as a form of resistance to modernization - one that some people indulge in for idiosyncratic reasons. I don 't really understand organic food. I know that it 's food that 's grown where they don 't use any pesticides or anything to kill of the bugs, so there 's not really any artificial chemicals or anything on it. I don 't mind if they kill the bugs! It matters not to me. Suburban female, age 29 This clash makes it difficult for people to recognize organic food as a move towards a superi- or, \"next generation \" way of farming, for example. Even people who seem to have all of the information can fall into the idea that organic agriculture is a step back toward the past. There is no way that you could make a go of it, raising turkeys, feeding them naturally, doing it the way you did it before. Because you could not make a profit and stay in business. There 's one farm in Illinois that does it. And they do well just because there are enough people in theChicago area who want to remember what it was like to eat a turkey thirty years ago when itjust [had] so much more flavor . Suburban male, age 44 A Case in Point: Crisis Mode and the Food Scare Recurrent stories in the media or advocacy outreach bring people face to face with problems in the food system. The stories can be intensely troubling to people, even if only temporarily ,and food scares have been factors in causing people to notice and conceptualize systems thatare outside their own experience. Everyone interviewed for this project was familiar with oneor more stories about contaminated Mexican strawberries, e coli in the beef supply , Mad Cow disease, dolphin by-catch in tuna fishing, or other such crises. In short, food scares seem like\"teachable moments \" of a sort, where people learn about the existence of food systems - and how such systems actually do intersect with lived experience. Unfortunately , because of the interfering models described in the earlier sections, food scares do disappointingly little to help people form more helpful understandings of food systems. 49Not While I 'm EatingConfirmation of the Modernization narrative One reason for the limited educational value of \"food scare \" stories is that the problem of the moment can almost always be understood in terms of generic modernization. Either modern-ization has gone too far (e.g. the increasing over-reliance on pesticides) or not far enough(e.g. the fact that \"safe\" pesticides apparently still haven 't been developed). Since the prob- lems do not fall outside the general scheme, they don not lead people to question it. As withother problems, like the standardization and consolidation of supermarket chains, theModernization model may seem to offer an explanation of food scares, while not offering anyreal reasons or any rationale for alternatives. And for all of the reasons discussed in the previous section, the Modernization model does not engage people to act for systemic change.: Modernization is a process that \"just happens. \" It is too big and the inertia too great to allow dramatically different alternatives. \"More progress \" is often the solution to problems. Cost-benefit thinking implies that many problems are probably just the price we pay for our modern way of life (i.e. better than the alternatives). Unfortunately , most food scares fit neatly within this general story . Resurfacing of lived-experience models Because a systems perspective is an unnatural state of mind for most people, people tend to return to their little picture defaults as quickly as their context allows, and to lapse into theircustomary \"cognitive blindness \" toward vis- \u00e0-vis food systems. Issues that fade away So, although for some people the food scare can be a transformative experience, for most peo- ple the effects only last as long as the media attention. When an incident disappears from theheadlines, people forget about it or assume that the problem has been solved. Q: So do you feel that they resolved that issue pretty much? Or do you just stop thinking about it?A: I just stopped thinking about it. Once I didn 't hear anything else going on about it any- more. I just normally went to the store and went and got it. When you hear the publicityabout it, obviously you 're reminded of it, so you stop. And when you don 't hear anything else about it you forget and then you just go out and get it. Urban female, age 37 When something seems to disappear from the news, it 's usually because it 's gotten better . Urban male, age 37 Naturally , media coverage contributes to this tendency , since it only casts a brief, narrow spot- light on particular cases, and on isolated corners of the food system. And given the cognitivetendency to reduce larger issues (e.g., social justice or chemical pollution) to single, prototypecases, people tend to infer that the larger problem has been dealt with when a particular caseis \"cleaned up. \" 50Not While I 'm EatingIssues that get translated into little-picture problems Furthermore, even when people 's thinking is impacted in long-term ways by a food scare, their reasoning is likely to be shaped by the much more natural little-picture understandingsthat generally guide their thought. So, for instance, a food scare may turn an individual into amore careful, health-conscious consumer - as opposed to a citizen interested in more respon- sible oversight of food handling and production. Consumers hoping for the best When people are operating from the (passive) consumer stance, their only apparent course of action is to stop buying and wait for reassurance that things are back to normal. Their limit-ed options as consumers help ensure that they stay primarily within the little picture, whilethe store, the government, and the business community deal with the problems of the BigPicture. This stance also gives them a very powerful motivation to hope and believe that thefood system is OK. Q: Do you generally trust the food supply? The food that comes in to your home? A: I do. I do trust it. Because obviously I don 't have anywhere else to buy it. Where else am I going to get it from? We know to go to the grocery store to get whatever we need. So you sortof have to trust it. You don 't have a choice. Urban female, age 37 When a food system critique or food scare threatens to detract from people 's lived experience, they are capable of \"forgetting \" about the troubling information. Some people can even describe this experience. Lately I 've been kind of disgusted, because PETA sent me some disgusting flyers, just gross. A whole package of stuff that I wish I hadn 't looked at. But I still eat steak. They showed how the animals are killed and all that stuff, and I don 't want to think about that when I 'm eating meat. So now I actually think about how it got there, you know , when I 'm looking at it in the grocery store before I buy it, I 'm thinking what happened to it before it came ... It's been about a month since I got that, so it 's fading, the memory of the pictures is fading. It was disgusting. I had to throw it away so my family wouldn 't look at it. Suburban female, age 23 T ruthfully I never thought about [chemicals in food] until I went to Europe. And I think Europeans are much more conscious of it than Americans are. With beef in particular , with theadvent of all of the mad cow disease and that sort of thing. They 're very conscious of what gets injected into their animals. And it never occurred to me until it was pointed out so blatantly.But I 'll think about it rarely. It 's the kind of thing I don 't want to think about while I 'm eating. Urban female, age 22 Except specifically during intense media coverage of a scare, people are reassured by a combi- nation of factors. government regulations and oversight (the reach of which they generally exaggerate) good business practices (e.g. \"Businesses won 't kill off their customers! \") fellow consumers (e.g. \"No one is dropping dead from pesticides. \") media quiet (e.g. \"Since we aren 't hearing anything, everything must be OK. \") personal experience (e.g. \"I've never gotten sick. \") 51Not While I 'm EatingThanks to these understandings, plus a strong desire to be reassured, Americans may consider the idea that the food system is dangerous, but ultimately most people reject it. As far as I know , nothing has happened. I mean Mad Cow disease I don 't think has come over here so far . As far as chemicals, I don 't think that there 's any problem with anything out there. I'm sure the Food and Drug probably looks into preservatives and chemicals that go into food. Rural female, age 23 I don 't want to buy a head of lettuce and have a bug fall out of it, nor do I want to buy a head of lettuce and have no bugs fall out because it 's so full of pesticides that if I eat it, it makes me sick. So it 's nice that there 's somebody overlooking [sic] things. Suburban male, age 60 I know some people might have problems with gene manipulation of fruits and vegetables - I personally don 't, but again, I don 't know the scientific background . . . You want to be aware of it. I mean I don 't want just any pesticide on my food. I don 't want to find myself with cancer down the road, but on the other hand, I think it 's pretty well - naively, of course, and the lazi- ness kicking in - I think it 's pretty well regulated. Urban female, age 33 Q: Do you feel like the food sources are safe? A: For the most part. You hear reports of people getting sick from South American strawberries and whatnot. I buy all those foods, and I 've never really gotten sick from any foods. So for the most part, by my personal experience, I feel the food supply is pretty safe. Urban male, age 34 In short, despite the apparent promise of food scares as teachable moments, the results are disappointing. The best evidence for this is that Americans have been exposed to countlessfood scares, and yet show all the signs of misunderstanding and ignorance discussed earlier inthis report. Recommendations Earlier in the report, we discussed average Americans ' difficulty in taking in new information about food systems - largely because they have no established model of a food system to \"plug\" this information into - and the disappointing limitations of food safety scares as teach- ing moments. In this section, we consider several ways advocates might consider improvingtheir communications about food systems in order to avoid the pitfalls awaiting them. (Notethat these recommendations will serve as hypotheses for later rounds of research and testingby the FrameWorks Institute and partners.) Positive bridges from systems to lived experience - Slow Food and Local Food While we did not find evidence that these movements have had impacts at the public level - nor that these are exactly the right terms in which to talk about the issues - cognitive analysis suggests that both the Slow Food and the Local Food concepts have a number of advantageson which advocates might successfully build. Each addresses people 's lived experience of food - shopping, cooking and eating - while being conceptually organized around big-picture, systems perspectives. 52Not While I 'm Eating Both concepts are very concrete, in a way that is pedagogically promising (again, not necessarily as expressed in the current language). Both allow people to understand how they can play a role in a larger system. Both can be explained in commonsense ways - e.g., Local means not shipping long dis- tances (therefore cheaper and consumes less fuel). Local means that money stays in thecommunity and contributes to a solid, diverse economic base. Local means good thingsfor your locality . Local means fresher, and healthier (and should not mean dirtier andless regulated). Local means, \"you know where it came from. \" Both take a positive out- look towards food and food systems, rather than relying on uncomfortable messagesabout danger that people are motivated to dismiss. Both rely upon implicit critiques ofthe mainstream food system, but focus attention on positive visions. Each includes a place for enjoyment of food. Each allows for an overarching nurturance model rooted in reciprocity and caring. We offer two cautions related to these approaches: Farmer 's markets : For reasons discussed earlier in the report, it is easy to evoke the wrong understandings when talking about food systems - one of these would be to give farmer 's markets a central role in discussions of food system changes. These are so strongly associatedwith quaintness, and so far removed from the \"real\" food economy , that mentioning them can probably derail a serious discussion. \" Movements \": While movements by definition involve large groups of people, they are also easily seen as special interests. Advocates working with the slow and local food concepts caneasily run up against average Americans ' distaste for and discomfort with extreme positions or \"isms. \" In order to reach a group larger than a hardcore few , communicators should be careful to frame the issues in practical, commonsense terms and to avoid distancing labels. Organic as the \"next generation \" of food/farming Most people regard organic food as \"better \" than other food (even if it is not \"better enough \" to justify the extra expense). And from an expert perspective, organic farming seems to offeran opportunity to bring many different threads together, including consumer health, workerhealth, small farm viability and environmental sustainability . These factors make the organicconcept a potentially important communications tool for advocates. Modernization : One of the most important potential pitfalls in communicating about organics is the risk of seeming to go up against modernization. Because modernization is a powerfulcultural model which views progress through time as inevitable and one-directional, a mes-sage that seems to fall on the wrong side of progress is unlikely to succeed. There may bevalue in pointing out that organic farming is \"traditional \" farming in many ways - but advo- cates must also make it clear that the real motivations for going organic have to do with newscience (e.g. of health and environment), innovations in method, and economic realism. Iforganic farming is \"merely \" about preserving a \"dying way of life \" (i.e. the family farm), it can only ever appeal to a small percentage of the population. Commonsense : In order to make the most of this concept - as with local and slow food - advocates must take care to frame organic farming as a smart, economically viable approach,rather than a fringe movement that appeals to the tastes of \"single-issue consumers. \" 53Not While I 'm EatingDefinition : Organic farming is defined in terms of chemical inputs and technical farming prac- tices, and most people do not have a clear sense what it refers to. It is important for commu-nicators to find ways of defining the term in user-friendly ways that do refer to particularmaterials and practices - one of the communications advantages of the concept is that it is scientific, concrete and objective. Broader context : Because of the understandings people bring to the topic of food, it is also important for advocates to tie organic food/farming to broader ideas like community , localeconomic good, and the experience of shopping/eating. A new cultural model of food systems The biggest \"win\" for advocates on this issue (and for everyone else), and the greatest chal- lenge, would be to introduce a new , full-fledged cultural model of food systems intoAmericans ' shared understanding of the world. Such a model would not only enable people to notice the systems that produce their food, but would also encourage them to take an interestin and engage constructively with those systems. Ideally , such a model would: Make people conscious of and curious about the fact that food comes out of a food system; Make it easier to connect people 's lived experience to the broader system, ideally in multiple and overlapping ways, and in ways that feel important; Create the sense of a food system that people can feel positively about as opposed to one they fear or are angered by; Make it easier to absorb central concepts like \"sustainability , \" and \"environmental health, \" as coherent parts of a larger picture. Achieving this new level of public reasoning and discourse represents one of the core chal- lenges facing food system advocates, and would require a sustained effort aimed at educatingthe public, in addition to effective explanatory language around which to build this strategy . Conclusion There are a wide variety of ways in which people 's default understandings of a topic can impede progress on an issue: People may feel they have a rich understanding of a topic, while actually lacking some very basic knowledge. This is the case with childhood development, for example, wherepeople fail to appreciate the fact that a young child 's interactions shape the development of brain architecture. Or they may lack even a rudimentary understanding of an issue - as is the case with global warming, where only a tiny percentage of Americans understand that the problemis caused by a heat-trapping layer of gases. Or they may use an inappropriate frame to process new information, as when people understand rising obesity rates in terms of the country 's \"moral decline. \" 54Not While I 'm EatingIn the case of food systems, Cultural Logic 's elicitations research points to a combination of all of these problems. Americans have rich sets of understandings and associations related tofood, which reduce their interest in and ability to grasp new information. They also lack afundamental concept - the idea of a food system. For lack of such a conceptual model, they make certain reasonable guesses and a number of false assumptions about the American foodsystem, by drawing on some fragmentary knowledge about food and where it comes from,plus their rich but generic understanding of modernization. Finally , their stance toward food- primarily the Consumer Stance and the passive Food Receiver stance - actually motivates them notto want to understand. Given this combination of factors, it is not surprising that advocates have had a difficult time making headway on some crucial issues. Nonetheless, ascommunicators continue to develop conceptual approaches that offer the public concrete newways of understanding the food system and our relationship to it, there is an opportunity forreal and important progress. 55Not While I 'm Eating56All Trees and No Forest: How Advocacy Paradigms Obscure Public Understanding of the Food System By Axel Aubrun, Ph.D., Andrew Brown, Ph.D., and Joseph Grady, Ph.D. Introduction As part of its ongoing effort to bring about meaningful improvements in the United States food system, the W .K. Kellogg Foundation has commissioned a variety oftypes of research into how Americans think and talk about the topic. Earlierresearch by Cultural Logic for the FrameWorks Institute investigated the patterns of reasoning that the general public brings to the subject of food and food systems, and howthese can prevent learning, diminish engagement and derail productive thinking ( \"Not While I'm Eating: How and Why Americans Don 't Think About Food Systems, \" 2005). In this supplementary memo, we consider the understandings that expert advocates bring to the subject, how those understandings shape their communications, and the likely impacts of thesecommunications among the public. In principle, advocates are well positioned to move publicopinion forward on the topic. They disseminate ideas through campaigns, public appearancesand discussions with policymakers. In other issue areas, however, we have found that patternsin expert reasoning and discourse can create obstacles to public understanding and engagement,and that it is worth looking closely at those patterns and their possible effects. The memo is based largely on ten formal interviews with expert advocates involved in a wide variety of issues related to food systems. Each interview was a one-on-one conversation last-ing roughly twenty minutes, recorded for later analysis. (All participants were assured thattheir commentary would be anonymous, so no identifying information or direct quotationsare offered in the report.) The conversations took place during the Food and SocietyConference in Landsdowne, Virginia in April, 2005. During the course of the conference, aCultural Logic researcher also had numerous informal conversations with additional atten-dees, as well as leading a discussion session focused on advocates ' experiences with commu- nicating about issues related to food and food systems. All of these conversations - in addi- tion to a review of materials produced by advocates - have provided input to this memo. The Forest and the Trees Advocates on food-related issues recognize that they face a serious challenge: Problems with the American food system, and that system itself, are hardly on the radar screen of averageAmericans. Yet if there is to be meaningful progress on various important issues related to thefood supply chain, it is critically important that this topic become part of the public conversa-tion between average Americans, the media and policymakers. One of the natural goals foradvocacy on issues related to the food supply system, then, is simply to put the subject itself\"on the table. \" 57For very natural reasons, food advocates focus on a wide variety of particular issues as they go about the work of raising public awareness. After all, food systems are connected to virtuallyall aspects of human life, and of the biosphere itself. Ideally , though, the collective product ofall these efforts would be that Americans become more conscious of where their food comesfrom, and of food systems as a problematic area deserving individual and national attention. But the research presented in \"Not While I 'm Eating \" (along with the experience of any number of advocates and other researchers) demonstrates clearly that food systems have not emerged asa topic in the public mind - or that that emergence is happening at a frustratingly slow pace. In this memo, we consider one of the key reasons this is so: Americans have no working conceptual model of the food system as a whole, and advocates are not helping them acquire one . Of course, advocates consistently offer explanations of various important problems related to food - the harmful effects of pesticides, the low wages paid to agricultural workers here and abroad, the disregard of large food distribution companies for dietary health, and for theneeds of people in particular neighborhoods, and so forth. But the key ideas around whichadvocates ' thinking and communications are organized often work against, rather than for, the crystallization of food system as a coherent concept. Self-contained paradigms Advocates ' work is often anchored by a set of ideas that amount, from a cognitive per- spective, to self-contained paradigms that are largely insulated from other issues, and therefore do not effectively contribute to a bigger picture of the food system and its mean-ing. For example, advocates ' work may focus on a particular issue, such as a living wage for farm workers - along with a motivating value , such as fairness. This combination of issue and value is sufficiently rich to guide reasoning and feel like a world unto itself, in away that connects little if at all to a paradigm focusing on environmentally sustainableagriculture, for example. (Even if the topics canin principle be connected, this is not a cognitively natural move.) Minimal reference to the food system In fact, these individual paradigms may make only minimal or indirect reference to the food system itself, at least as they are likely to be understood by the public. The issue ofthe living wage for farm workers, for example, is one that is probably easy for averagepeople to think about, in a way that has little or nothing to do with food - as a matter of greedy companies paying their workers too little (a story that might as well take place inthe garment industry). The public 's thinking can quite naturally move between the issue and the value , leaving the larger food system out of the picture. Promoting little-picture thinking Some of the paradigms used by advocates may actually have the effect of leading people towards \"little-picture \" thinking, in which they focus on aspects of individual experience (shopping, cooking, eating, working a farm, etc.), rather than any bigger picture, includinga grasp of food systems. 1This is often because the story that advocates are telling is easily co-opted by the very powerful consumer paradigm (see, e.g., our discussion of organicslater in the memo). 58All T rees and No Forest 1 For more on the important distinction between big-picture and little-picture thinking, please see \"Not While I 'm Eating. \"Ironically , from a cognitive and cultural perspective, the paradigms that are central to the work of advocates are currently at risk of making the food system harder to see, rather than easier. Yet the advantages of Americans sharing a working conceptual model of the food supply sys- tem as a whole would be tremendous, and are worth exploring in some detail. Why a Unified Conceptual Model for Food Systems? 1. Engagement and salience Advocates often feel intuitively , and are often advised by communications consultants, that emotionally charged appeals are critical to engaging people on an issue. And, to an extent,such appeals can obviously be effective. But one of the key elements that is often omittedfrom communications as a result is an effective explanation that allows people to grasp a prob- lem in a concrete way , including the cause-and-effect relationships that are central to an issue.Experience on a variety of issues, as well as robust findings from the cognitive sciences, makeclear that when people are able to focus on a problem in a concrete and practical way , theybecome more engaged than when they only have access to troubling information and imagesrelated to \"symptoms. \" This has been true in the area of child abuse, for example - where advocates now realize that tragic images and statistics have \"plateau-ed \" in their ability to arouse public support, and must be complemented by additional explanations of risk factorsand the mechanisms by which community intervention can help. It is also true in the case ofglobal warming, where the public is well aware of potentially catastrophic impacts butremains relatively disengaged due to a lack of understanding of how the phenomenon works 2. In short, one of the more effective tools for raising the salience of an issue is to crystallize itas a clear conceptual model in people 's minds, so that people can reason about it in a practical way . Currently , there is no such shared model for the food system as a whole, and providingone has not been high on the priority list of (many) advocates. 2. Making sense of advocates ' communications Many of the arguments advocates make, and the facts they present, would make more sense to people if they had a broader sense of the food supply chain. In some cases, such a model isprobably even an indispensable precursor to understanding . Without such a model, people are unlikely to be able to see the answers to basic questions: What 's the link between food and social justice? What 's the connection between food and the environment? What 's the connection between food (production) and community? What does \"sustainability \" refer to? -Sustain what or who? What is \"food security \" about? Who or what is insecure, and why? What exactly is organic food? What is the relevance of family farm viability , beyond protecting the livelihood of individuals? 59All T rees and No Forest 2 Research conducted by Cultural Logic and others has determined that when people have an understanding that global warming is caused by a heat-trapping layer of gases, they become more engaged on the issue, partly becausethey can better understand appropriate solutions.(See the next section for further discussion of some representative paradigms and how their impact would be strengthened by an underlying conceptual model.) 3. Unification and diversity of the field It is clear that the food and food systems \"field\" (if such a disparate collection of perspectives and goals can be called a field) would benefit from some degree of unity - if for no other reason than that communications could, in principle, reinforce each other rather than competing for society 's attention and energy . Yet this unity is and will continue to be difficult to achieve. The ends thatadvocates are interested in pursuing will continue to remain very heterogeneous - activists in the area of environmental sustainability are not likely to abandon their mission in favor of pursuingbetter wages for farm workers, or vice versa, and neither group is likely to switch to a focus onrevitalization of urban neighborhoods, or on the traditional pleasures of the table. More subtly , experience in communications on a wide variety of issues establishes clearly that a field cannot be united around a large and mixed set of values . Even when they are comple- mentary in principle, different values take thinking in different directions. A given communi-cations piece - including the mission statement for an organization, for example - needs an organizing idea, and a single underlying value is often the best way to give a piece coherenceand strength. (E.g. an environmental organization might organize the presentation of all itsdisparate activities around the idea that we owe it to our children and grandchildren to be good stewards of their natural legacy .) The diverse values that motivate the various advocates around the food systems table - from community (e.g. revitalizing Native American groups), to health (e.g. improving the American diet), to social justice (e.g. for minority farm workers), and so forth - are each important, and none of them is going to go away . In short, the field is not likely to choose a single value message that unifies the perspectives of all the active participants. Instead, if there is an opportunity for unity among food and food system advocates, it is on the conceptual level. If there were such an agreed-upon model, then advocates in a variety ofareas could refer to it as a touchstone in all their communications, if only in passing - thereby reinforcing each other 's communications . Importantly , this conceptual platform would also allow advocates to pursue their own inde- pendent agendas, while contributing to the overall effort of raising the salience of the foodsystem as a whole. (Even if a particular group is only interested in Part X of the overall sys-tem, their references to Part X could do more than they currently do to make it clear that it ispart of an overall system that matters.) 4. Creating broader constituencies The food supply system as whole is clearly something that everyone in the public should be concerned with, as opposed to any particular issue such as herbicide use or neighborhoodredlining, which will always engage some members of the public more than others. 5. Making advocates ' jobs easier Currently , a great deal of advocates ' effort goes into trying to open people 's eyes to some par- ticular corner of American food systems. Communicators in each issue area must constructtheir own explanations \"from scratch. \" If there were a shared understanding of the food system that advocates could refer to and tap into, their work would clearly be easier and more efficient. 60All T rees and No Forest6. Inoculating the paradigms against \"consumer thinking \" One of the dangers that faces many of the individual paradigms discussed below is that they are susceptible to being \"co-opted \" by powerful advertising lobbies that tend to reduce the issue to a matter of \"consumer choice \" - a cognitive move that discourages people from see- ing the big picture. Providing a clear and direct sense of the food system itself, makes peoplemore resistant to falling into \"consumer thinking. \" In the next section we consider a number of representative paradigms that currently organize advocates ' thinking and communications, and how these are made less effective by the lack of a shared conceptual model - and/or how they would be strengthened and made more effective if such a model were part of the culture. Example Paradigms The paradigms discussed in this section are not only used internally among colleagues at the Food and Society conference. They also appear on web sites, in interviews, and in other publicforums. These ideas act as de facto, and sometimes deliberate and explicit, anchors of commu-nications about food systems. It is therefore important to think through their likely impact inthe current cognitive/cultural context - and how they might be made more effective. Food security Like most of the paradigms considered here, this one is not understood by average people. Based on our conversations with a diverse group of thirty Americans from different regionsand backgrounds, we are confident not only that the phrase is unfamiliar, but that it wouldstrike people as puzzling, since they tend to feel little or no insecurity related to food.Moreover, as the example of global warming makes clear, even if a major food security-relatedcrisis were to emerge, this would not necessarily promote a deeper understanding of the larger system. In order to understand the idea of food security , in something like the way it is understood by experts, people would need to have more of a sense of the ownership of food production, whodecides where and how to distribute food for sale, and how prices are set, for example. Theseare not areas they are currently able to think about. For lack of a conceptual understanding of food systems, members of the public are also unlike- ly to appreciate the different values messages offered by advocates which relate the food supplyto democracy , community empowerment and social justice (related to redlining, for instance). Instead, given their current dominant patterns of thinking, people are likely to associate this term with safety against terrorism, food tampering or shortages - i.e. vivid, concrete and immediate types of danger that can easily be associated with food. The term is likely to be associated with little-picture rather than big-picture thinking, and a Consumer stance ratherthan a Citizen stance. Likely \"solutions \" would include heightened law enforcement, food surpluses stored in warehouses, and stacks of canned goods in the basement. The level one values that the term is likely to evoke include safety and protection - which are just as likely to lead to \"hunkering down \" as to increased cooperation and management. 61All T rees and No ForestSustainability We have direct evidence from the elicitations that this term/concept is not understood by the public. This is not because people do not understand the word, but because they have troublethinking about aspects of our food system that might be hard to sustain. The (vivid and little-picture) guesses that some relatively knowledgeable lay people are able to take usually focuson soil depletion over time, or the possibility of keeping a farm in the family from one gener-ation to the next. In order to understand this concept, Americans would need to understand more about the environmental impacts of farming, the idea that farm products contain hidden costs that needto be paid later, and on the highest level, the idea that no-one is currently managing the foodsystem with a long-term view. Since these ideas are not part of average people 's conceptual repertoire, the values that are important to advocates -including stewardship and responsible management of resources, for example - are also not evoked by the idea of sustainability . In principle, this concept certainly pulls people towards big-picture thinking, since it focuses by definition on broad systems. Unfortunately , as people currently speculate about its mean-ing, it is (not surprisingly) associated with little-picture images of individual farmers tillingtheir soil or trying to pass along their property to their children. Social justice for farm workers This is certainly an idea people can understand, but as mentioned earlier, not necessarily in a way that is connected with food systems or even food. There is very little difference in cogni-tive terms between this case and the plight of Nike workers or hotel workers. That is to say ,this paradigm can very easily elide the whole business of food systems. Farmland preservation and family farm viability Average people do understand that farmland and family farms are disappearing, but they understand this in terms of suburban sprawl - i.e. in terms of the beauty and freedom of open spaces, and in terms of the passing away of traditional ways of life. For experts, these topicsare pieces of a larger picture such as food security , where farmland is preserved in everyregion so that communities can grow their own local food and maintain control over theirfood supply . But for lay people, once again, the issues are associated with different (little-pic-ture) understandings and values, none of them self-evidently practical in nature, having littleto do with food, much less food systems. Slow Food While this is a growing movement, it is not one with which many average Americans are familiar at this point. Certain aspects of the concept - including the rejection of fast food in favor of more carefully prepared meals - are easily grasped, without any reference to food sys- tems. Others, such as the idea of preserving the diversity of crops (and other ingredients), arecertainly less graspable, given people 's current lack of awareness of various aspects of the food supply system. It is worth noting that this concept certainly exerts a cognitive pull towards a little-picture focus on the individual, to the extent it focuses on pleasure (an inherently individual concept). 62All T rees and No ForestOn the other hand, it can be connected with a bigger picture if it is framed in terms of either (A) a generally accepted \"right \" to delicious, diverse food, or (B) an understanding that in order to really have good, healthy food you need diverse crops, diverse ways of growing them,close attention to them, more craft and less commodification. The first approach, though(along with the movement 's central value of \"protecting the pleasures of the table \"), is not one that resonates well with mainstream American culture. 3 Local Food While this is a concept that is currently unfamiliar to many Americans, it is easily understood and has the conceptual advantage of concreteness. The benefits of local food are easilygrasped once the concept is presented (including reduced fossil fuel consumption, fresherfood, and satisfying connections with local community and traditions), and can appeal to adiverse group with different priorities. And while the paradigm is defined, in a sense, by afocus on a \"smaller picture, \" it also provides a conceptual \"scale model \" of the larger systems that it would be helpful for Americans to understand. The broader public may most naturally perceive local food as a form of \"resistance \" to the \"real,\" mainstream, modernized system of food production and supply in the country 4- i.e. a minority movement by definition, associated with niche supermarket sections, special menuitems and scattered farm stands. But even so, this positioning can serve as a tool for openingpeople 's eyes to that broader system and its flaws. Interestingly , this concept seems to be highly resistant to being co-opted by conventional producers. Organic Food The strength and weakness of the organic paradigm is that it is rooted in a critique of the con- temporary food supply system. Because it is defined in terms of the materials and practicesused in farming, organic food makes the most sense in the context of an understanding that afood system exists, and that there may be something wrong with it. The presence of organicfood at the supermarket (despite its higher price tag) is a reminder that the food system isbeing contested. On the other hand, because the vast majority of people do not have a picture of the food sys- tem, their cognitive models regularly lead them to other, less helpful understandings of whatorganic food is all about. Some of the positive interpretations focus on better taste, benefits toindividual health, and individual environmental consciousness. (Organic marketers typicallyfocus on these aspects, for obvious reasons.) Worse, all of these concepts are subject to \"dilu- tion\" in the marketplace, so that the term organic itself is perpetually threatened with being so vague as to become meaningless. Moreover, competitors and many consumers discount organics as evidence of health extrem- ism, environmental idealism, class elitism or fraud; or simply as a clever marketing ploy . All 63All T rees and No Forest 3 The movement is always likely to have a very selective appeal - partly because it is likely to be broadly perceived as a minority effort against the inevitable forces of modernization. Nonetheless, the Americans who do share thisvalue may , in principle, be an influential enough subgroup to bring about change of certain kinds. 4 See \"Not While I 'm Eating \" for a discussion of the role of the modernization concept in Americans ' thinking about food and food systems.these interpretations focus on the relationships between individuals and food, rather than on the broader systems that produce that food. Elicitations with the public clearly show that, although organic food is one most well-known of contemporary food movements and the most visible of food system critiques, the absenceof a model of food supply has encouraged understandings to fragment in unproductive ways. Diversity Diversity is a paradigm with several distinct types of relevance in the world of food systems advocacy . For experts, minority participation in the food system, the effects of monocultureon sustainability , food security , supermarket consolidation and so on are all areas where a lackof diversity weakens the capacity of the food supply system to truly meet the needs of thegeneral population. These understandings of the meaning and importance of diversity alldepend on a grasp of the big picture of food systems. From the perspective of laypeople who do not see the larger systems, though, the broad bene- fits of diversity don 't make sense - if anything, the idea of diversity runs counter to the pub- lic's sense of a prevailing current of modernization and standardization. As it stands, each type of diversity being advocated for has to be justified as important in and of itself. Rather thanarguing that diverse systems are stronger, more flexible, and better designed for a changingworld, advocates disperse into isolated issue areas, each with their own constellation of val-ues. Family farms are important for tradition or local community . Minority participation isimportant for social justice. Monoculture is bad for the soil (therefore, irresponsible farming,and bad for the environment). Once again, despite a paradigm with considerable potential to unify the field, the discourse falls apart because the conceptual models that make sense of the paradigm are missing. Traditional foodways Though they may not use exactly this language, many advocates work within a paradigm that focuses on restoring the traditions that sustained people and communities in the past, bothnutritionally and culturally . Unless people have a broad conceptual understanding of what afood system encompasses, though, messages along these lines are likely to sound like otherappeals to reject the modern world and return to a nostalgic past (i.e. attractive, impractical,and subject to \"solutions \" based on images of that past). Specifically , arguments based on tra- dition and community are not likely to compete successfully with Americans ' powerful cul- tural model of modernization, which entails the inevitability of change and \"progress. \" A shared conceptual model of food supply systems would allow them to grasp the practicalvalue of the kinds of foodways that have been lost. Conclusion Current communications strategies for bringing the general idea of a food system into the public discourse can be described as indirect, with advocates focusing on a broad variety ofself-contained paradigms that each focus on one piece of the food system. The cognitiveanalysis of expert concepts discussed in this memo suggests that this indirect approach isunlikely to be effective both because the individual paradigms pull thinking in different 64All T rees and No Forestdirections, and because for many of them the food system concept is not central. Rather than radically changing the current \"modular \" approach, we suggest complementing it with an effort to provide the public with a clear conceptual model of the larger food system.Introducing such a model into the public discourse would provide an alternative, and moredirect, approach to solving the problem of the \"missing big picture \" of where food comes from. It would also strengthen each paradigm, while increasing the collective efficacy of advo-cates ' efforts to bring the food system into public awareness. Of course, introducing such a model into public consciousness and discourse is no easy mat- ter. In the short run it will entail investing significant energy into developing and testingeffective ways of explaining food systems, identifying ways that fit naturally into advocates ' communications on a variety of particular issues. Ultimately , it will also involve exploringother conduits for introducing those explanations to a broad audience, from ads to changes inschool curricula. But while the challenge is great, the rewards for a successful effort will beeven greater. 65All T rees and No Forest66Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systems By Axel Aubrun, Ph.D., Andrew Brown, Ph.D., and Joseph Grady, Ph.D. Introduction This analysis, funded by the W . K. Kellogg Foundation and building on previous research on how Americans think about food systems, examines the ways in whichthe topic is presented to readers, directly and indirectly , in the nation 's newspapers. The effects of the news media on people 's understanding of issues has been well doc- umented, and goes beyond the question of whether people are \"informed \" about particular facts. Instead, the collective effect of the media is to create a set of default understandings andexpectations that act as a kind of lens through which Americans see the world. Viewedthrough this lens, some facts about the world make more sense and are easier to see, whileothers are a poorer fit with people 's default understandings, and become harder to see. As advocates struggle with the difficult job of raising Americans ' consciousness regarding food systems and related issues, they will do well to bear in mind the ways in which current newscoverage is helping and hurting their cause - both because this coverage partially defines what they are up against in American public discourse, and because an understanding of cur-rent journalism can help advocates plan ways of improving the coverage, by introducing ideas of their own through interviews, press releases, news events, and other opportunities. Previous research by Cultural Logic, FrameWorks and others has established that Americans don't naturally think much about the systems that supply their food, or easily grasp that there are such systems at work. (See \"Research Background \" below for further discussion of current patterns in Americans ' thinking.) One of the places where people do run across references to the food system is in news reports - in stories about food scares, about changing trends in consumption, about farmers who are finding new markets for their goods, and so forth. Thecentral question guiding this analysis concerns the likely impacts these articles have on read-ers: In what ways would consumers of these articles come away better educated about thefood system, and in what ways might the coverage actually reinforce some of their erroneous(and counterproductive) default understandings? Summary of Findings In this section we summarize some of the important implications that emerge from the media review. Many pieces play (destructively) on traditional images of farming and rural America. Among the most destructive patterns in the material is the tendency for writers to (intention- ally or unintentionally) evoke stereotypes that work against advocates ' goals. The materials tend to reinforce a cognitive disconnect between food and food supply systems. 67In Americans ' prevailing patterns of thinking, food and food production have separate lives, as distinct and unconnected cognitive and experiential domains. The materials tend to rein-force this disconnect by addressing either the domain of food (including eating, dining, shop-ping, etc.) or the domain of agriculture and agricultural economics - but not both. There is a strong tendency to reinforce little-picture thinking by focusing images of the Individual Farmer . The image of the lone farmer struggling to eke a living from the soil is laden with many layers of meaning and symbolism in American culture. Therefore it is no surprise that many writerschoose to open many of their stories with this evocative icon. But, as in other issue areas, afocus on individuals tends to obscure broader issues that are critical to an understanding ofadvocates ' perspectives. (Occasional stories manage to weave the image of the individual farmer into a piece that promotes big-picture thinking about food systems, but these are the exceptions.) The materials suggest that farming is removed from the \"real economy. \" Many of the depictions of farmers suggest that farming is a calling that people pursue for per- sonal, idiosyncratic reasons. This image removes agriculture from the real world of econom-ics, and from the realm of public, as opposed to private concerns. Farming is depicted as anachronistic occupation. Many stories reinforce the idea that farmers belong to another century - thereby further removing them from understandings of modern problems, approaches and solutions related tofood systems. References to \"the fall \" of traditional rural America make problems seem inevitable. There is a strong background narrative underlying many of the pieces - the story of the \"fall\" of the rural utopia that defines America 's past (and its \"best years \"). While it is appropriate for journalists to describe problems in rural areas, this evocative framing makes it less likelyreaders can take a \"Responsible Manager \" stance towards current problems in the food system. A strong focus on consumers and a consumer-perspective obscures the real dynamics of food systems. When pieces are not focusing on farmers, they are often focusing on food from a consumer perspective that is unhelpful in a number of ways - in particular, the pieces support the illu- sion that consumer choice is the driving force that shapes the food system, and obscure allother causal forces. Articles on food trends, on particular agricultural sectors, and so forthexaggerate the extent to which consumer preferences determine what food gets produced(and how , where, etc.). This model obviously obscures the role of the many other actors whoactually wield much more direct and deliberate control over the systems - including the deci- sion-makers at firms that produce, market and distribute food. Many pieces tend to reinforce the negative implications of the \"generic modernization \" understanding of food systems. Lacking a clear conceptual model of food production and food systems, Americans often think about the topic in terms of their generic understandings of the overall processes of 68Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systemsmodernization. Pieces that emphasize scary or dehumanized aspects of current food produc- tion tend to reinforce these associations, with the result that problems in food systems canseem more inevitable, more acceptable (as the cost of progress), and less associated withactors who have made decisions. (Instead it can seem like an impersonal, even \"natural \" process that is transforming the world under its own irresistible momentum.) The report also discusses a number of ways in which articles related to food systems frame issues productively . Among these are: Highlighting the relationship between farmers/food-producers and the rest of the actors in a region. Embedding discussions of particular farms/farmers thoroughly within big-picture discus- sions of agricultural, environmental, economic or other big-picture issues - rather than framing them in iconic isolation. Focusing explicitly on the food supply chain - how particular foods come to be pro- duced (and marketed and distributed) in particular ways. How are the decisions madeand who makes them? Appealing to readers as responsible actors - either by highlighting the power of educated, activist consumers, or better yet, by showing how individuals have a stake in solutionsthat are not commercial in nature. Method For purposes of this analysis, Cultural Logic reviewed roughly 115 newspaper articles collected from newspapers in various parts of the country , from Miami to Seattle to Detroit to Washington, DC. The articles were identified by searching archives for terms such as\"food, \" \"food systems, \" \"food production, \" \"food trends, \" \"agriculture, \" \"farms, \" \"farming, \" and \"farm production. \" The sample was designed to exclude the overwhelming number of articles that focus strictly on eating - i.e. food-related topics like diet plans, recipes, restau- rants, etc. Instead, we searched for articles on all other aspects of food and food systems - from agricultural methods to consumption trends to health and environmental impacts toeconomic issues. Articles from the period of January 1, 2004 to the present were drawn from The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The Miami Herald, The Detroit Free Press, The Chicago T ribune, TheDallas Morning News, The Seattle Times, and The Los Angeles Times . AP Newswire articles appearing in other mainstream, mid-size or smaller market newspapers were also included. Unlike analyses performed by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, for instance, this analysis is not a quantitative look at the frequency of topics, for example, but a qualitativeexamination of how topics related to food systems are treated in the materials, and the likelyimplications for readers ' thinking. The analysis looks at such factors as the types of topics that are and aren 't mentioned in a given article, the ways in which topics within a story are treated as either related or unrelated, the causal stories conveyed or implied by the articles, themetaphors used to talk about food-related topics, and so forth. The analysis is less about cata-loguing what is explicitly said than it is about identifying the implicit understandings that areconveyed by the materials. The analysis also focuses on the relationship between the stories 69Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systemstold in newspapers and the stories people already have in their heads, as established by previ- ous rounds of qualitative research. (See Research Background below.) Much of the report is devoted to harmful patterns in the coverage of food systems \u2014i.e. ways in which the coverage is likely to create counterproductive understandings in the minds of readers, or to encourage a continuing \"cognitive blindness \" to the nature of food systems. However, we also discuss pieces that avoid these traps, since these positive examplescan help guide advocates (and responsible journalists) identify ways of providing more constructive framing. Research Background This analysis is informed by a substantial body of previous research (much of which was com- missioned by the FrameWorks Institute) on how Americans think about food and food sys-tems. The previous research includes Cultural Logic 's own in-depth interviews with diverse collections of Americans on the topics of food systems and rural life, and conversations withexperts participating in the annual Food and Society conference (Landsdowne, VA, April,2005). 1Some key findings from this previous research are summarized below , since they play a role in the analysis presented in this report. Americans ' patterns of thinking about foodmake it much harder for them to think about food systems . The experiential domain of food is so cognitively rich that people typically have no sense that there is something more to know. Patterns of thinking based on the lived experience of eating,shopping, cooking, being served, and so forth essentially \"crowd out \" thinking about a bigger picture. Another powerful effect of the default, little-picture patterns is to \"translate \" new information into confirmation of existing understandings. Warnings about food risks, for instance, areinterpreted as confirmation that individuals need to make smarter choices, and that individual foods should be avoided. Importantly , the default patterns of understanding also discourage critical thinking about where food comes from. The lived experience of food creates close ties in people 's thinking between food and a passive sense of being nurtured. Along with a default consumer stance,which prompts people to trust merchants, for example, this food receiver stance encourages atrusting complacence, and dampens interest in anyinformation about the ultimate sources of food. Finally , the patterns of thinking about food are mostly unconnected with thinking about how food is produced. The worlds of food and agriculture tend to exist separately as unconnecteddomains of thought. 70Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systems 1 For the full reports, please see \"The Agrarian Myth Revisited: Findings from Cognitive Elicitations, \" October 2003; \"Not While I 'm Eating: How and Why Americans Don 't Think about Food Systems: Findings from Cognitive Elicitations, \" June 2005; and \"All Trees and No Forest: How Advocacy Paradigms Obscure Public Understanding of the Food System, \" July 2005.Food systems are just another example of \"modernization. \" When Americans are induced to think about food production in broader terms, their thinking often reflects a generic sense of how the \"modern \" world works. People may have fragmen- tary knowledge about food systems, but this knowledge rarely adds up to a fuller picture thatcould help them understand the importance of the changes advocated by experts. Instead,people often operate from a generic model of modernization, into which they add in theirsmattering of factual knowledge about food and food production. The result is an exaggerated picture of giant conglomerates, completely mechanized food pro- duction, extinct family farmers, and a trend towards the reduction of food to powders and pills. Importantly , the modernization narrative obscures the existence of specific actors and decision- makers (modernization is a massive, impersonal trend), implies that changes in food systemsare inevitable, and that problems are the price of progress. Furthermore, the modernizationframe filters out various key ideas - e.g. the role of diversity (of crops or farmers - modern- ization is largely \"about \" standardization), and the meaning of sustainability (modernization is not about the natural world, nor about preserving things as they are). Advocates ' communications generally do not promote an understanding of food systems as a whole. Instead their work often focuses on particular sets of ideas that amount, from a cognitive per- spective, to self-contained paradigms . Issues like ecologically sustainable agriculture, the living wage for farm workers or the return to the traditional pleasures of the table are rich enoughto feel like worlds of their own, and are largely insulated from each other. Furthermore, these paradigms may seem only tenuously connected to the food system. For example, it is easy for average people to think about farm workers ' wages in a way that has little or nothing to do with food - as a matter of greedy employers paying their workers too little (a story that might as well take place in the garment industry). Finally , the paradigms used by advocates may reinforce the default, \"little-picture \" patterns in people 's thinking - e.g., given the current lack of understanding of food-related issues, the notion of \"food security \" probably conjures images of well-sealed cans in the supermarket, stockpiles of food in the basement, or guards posted outside food warehouses. Rural America is often thought of in terms of a distorting \"rural utopia \" model. A strong default pattern of thinking defines rural people as hard-working, virtuous, simple, and poor. (Note that rural people themselves are not immune from this pattern.) This viewmay be sentimentally positive, but also leads to serious problems, including the following: Rural poverty becomes invisible as a problem . The fact that rural people may have little money is simply a natural facet of their simpler and more virtuous lives - and their con- dition is not generally considered \"poverty \" per se. Rural America is system-less and cause-less. Life there is often seen as qualitatively differ- ent in ways that can both obscure understandings of problems, and frame helpful inter-ventions as corruption. Rural America is self-sufficient . The rural utopia frame obscures the fact that many rural people are not in situations where they can get the help they need from friends and family ,and frames \"outside help \" as unnatural and immoral. 71Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systems Development is the main threat . In the rural utopia view , rural areas are a resource to be preserved, rather like water or gold. Sprawl means an overall reduction of rural spaces,which are gradually eroded from the edges in. This understanding obscures the fact thatmuch of the harm to rural ways of life is about disrupted systems (social, economic, etc.). As we discuss in the remainder of this report, these unhelpful patterns are often in play - or are inadvertently reinforced - even in articles that seem to address food-related issues in other- wise positive ways. Problem 1: The Disconnect between Food and Food Supply Systems Many of the stories in the sample fall into one of two categories - stories about farmers and farming, and stories about consumers and their food. For Farmers, Subsidies Are a Matter of What Kind of Row You Hoe T aking root in a new land: Immigrants fill need for farmers by renewing a passion for plantingFresh Spinach Is Growing On AmericansOnce and for All, It 's Not Kerry Ketchup [about the ups and downs of the Heinz brand] [Note that the sample excluded the very numerous articles that focus solely on diets, restau- rants, and other aspects of eating.] Articles very seldom draw effective bridges between thesystem of food production on one hand and the lived experiences of the consumer/reader onthe other. This common aspect of the journalism reinforces one of the central problems inAmericans ' thinking, from the perspective of food systems advocates: food-related models and farming-related models are largely disconnected in people 's minds. While of course journalists are under no obligation to address the two domains in ways that reinforce their interconnec-tion, this is an area where advocates can offer direct or indirect help in crafting stories that tiefood and food systems together in a meaningful bigger picture. Problem 2: Using and Reinforcing Rural Stereotypes When writing about topics related to food systems, journalists regularly invoke images that play on well-established, even stereotyped understandings of rural people and rural living - particu- larly in an article 's opening lines. From advocates ' perspective, these models are counterproduc- tive because they emphasize that rural people are essentially different from everyone else - that they live in a world apart, in a kind of timeless, tradition-bound existence. (These cultural mod-els are discussed in more depth in Cultural Logic 's report, \"The Agrarian Myth Revisited. \") Symbols of the rural: family farms and farmers One of the most common leads for an article about food systems is a brief portrait of an indi- vidual farm or farmer. Tom Carpenter picked at a bud on a Granny Smith apple tree, blooming and unpruned. The Central Washington farmer didn 't bother to cultivate this particular block of apples after learning his water would be rationed this summer because of drought. Judging by the laws of nature and the cruel twists of the farming life, Joan Lundquist is doing just fine as she takes another stab at making a living from the rich dirt of the San Joaquin Valley . 72Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsLike stories on other topics - from child abuse to health insurance - these articles which focus on individuals automatically steer readers ' thoughts toward little-picture understandings that make it harder to see the bigger picture of systemic problems and solutions. The prob-lems seem to be those of individuals, and the solutions seem to be the kind that smart, hard-working individuals can create for themselves. More subtly , but just as damagingly , the familiar image of the farmer carries along with it a great deal of symbolic baggage that can work powerfully to prevent readers from acquiringnew information. When an article about food systems begins with an image of a farmer - the central character in American myths about rural life - it almost inevitably evokes models related to tradition, virtue, and nostalgia. What it does not do is cause people to come to abetter understanding of food systems. Farmer virtues It is the farmer that most epitomizes the rural virtues of hard work, endurance and piety . It is the farmer who is family-oriented, stoical in poverty , connected with nature and her rhythms,and uncorrupted by the modern world. Another of the most powerful of farmer virtues is self-reliance. Leslie Hendry lives 75 miles from Casper on her family ranch near the tiny community of Lysite in central Wyoming. Shopping and socializing are an hour-and-a-half drive. The nearest neighbor is five miles away . Her older son is away at college, and her younger boy , a high-school freshman, has to ride a school bus three hours a day; he doesn 't get back until supper time. During busy seasons, like calving, Hendry works outside with her husband and the hired men. But right now , she 's inside, dealing with the piles of paperwork needed to run the business of a ranch. All day , alone, without even the radio on for company .That's how she likes it. \"I'm just home, and that would probably drive some people nuts, \" she said . A portrait like this one naturally reinforces stereotypical views of rural self-sufficiency , making it seem unnatural or even wrong to work against rural problems caused by isolation and dispersion. Although the following article goes on to discuss numerous reasons for the success of the farm, the reader is very likely to see its success in the particular virtues of the Roney family ,who have somehow resisted change. Marilyn Roney recalls many sweet moments from her farm-kid upbringing that later helped lead her to join her parents in farming the land tilled by her family for four gener-ations. \"I remember when I was little sitting on the tractor with Pa and singing as loud as I could to the tune of the engine, \" she says of one such happy moment, smiling as she strolls amid crops of corn, bright yellow squash and other vegetables destined for Seattle-area farmers markets. \"I want my (future) children to grow up just like I did, \" says Roney , 31, fresh-faced in jeans and sweatshirt and now the lead decision-maker at the farm,known today as The Farmer 's Daughter. 73Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsIn another typical article, about two entrepreneurs returning to the Midwest, a journalist writes: Here was a farm-raised, self-reliant work force made to order for expanding businesses like theirs, old neighbors who possessed a traditional work ethic, openness and loyalty - hallmarks of rural life, but traits sometimes hard to find in urban America. Stories that are ostensibly about food systems have a way of becoming fables about the power of rural virtues. And because virtues are housed in people rather than systems, these fablesfail to suggest solutions other than individual ones. Worse, the virtues themselves are typical-ly compatible only with a traditional world, the stories subtly imply that our modern inter-ventions would themselves be destructive and unwelcome. Farming as a \"calling \" rather than a living People do not see small-scale farming as economically sensible (anymore), and newspaper reporting tends to reinforce the understanding that farmers don 't farm for money . \"My idea of paradise was helping my gramma and grampa on their farm in Nebraska, \" Ms. Manix said. \"And here, we got to have all the animals, the calves and the chickens and the goats. \" But there was no money in it. So Mr. Manix worked as a carpenter and tilled gardens and cut hay for other people. Ms. Manix used to pick a whole field of Lincoln peas by herself. \"We worked for 20 years, making about $15 a day on our vegetables, \" Ms. Manix said. Instead, farming is a calling or vocation, pursued for personal and idiosyncratic reasons. This Calling model has a number of destructive implications: Farms are not linked to the \"real\" economy . Money is only necessary in order to allow farmers to continue doing what they love, or to continue a family tradition. Farms are not linked to the real world of our food supply . Farmers who seem too concerned with making money are \"greedy . \" Ironically , entre- peneurship - on which the continuing existence of small farmers depends - is incompat- ible with this common understanding of farmers - as well as with the \"rural virtues \" of poverty and modesty , for example. Given these understandings, it is inevitable that readers will regard farming as a subject that does not concern them directly . It may be sad when someone has to stop doing somethingthey love, but it is hardly unusual or a cause for public concern. Farming as \"out of time \" Articles like those already cited also promote the perception that farmers are somehow \"of another time. \" As most Americans see it, farming epitomizes the traditions of the country 's rural past. It is an admirable and virtuous (and arduous) way of life, but a poor fit with thecontemporary world - as a result, it is inexorably passing away . In fact, when people think about where the world is going, farms often provide a central image that represents what weare \"leaving behind. \" 74Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systems\"The Fall \" When people are operating within the rural utopia frame, the actual problems of rural areas are typically understood in terms of a familiar \"next chapter \" in the story of rural utopia, its \"fall\" in the face of modernization. The article about entrepreneurs cited earlier describes the fallen state of the rural towns: Across the Great Plains, farm towns are dying, their downtown shops going dark, their young people forsaking failing family farms and sputtering local economies to make a liv-ing elsewhere. The story of the decline of rural areas has become so ingrained that a common way of intro- ducing good news from rural areas is by reminding people that rural areas are a place where\"bad news \" usually comes from. For example: Across the Great Plains, the story is as familiar and as mournful as the unremitting prairie wind. Rural schools are closing, small towns are dying and young people are in ruinouslyshort supply , having run off to cities rather than stay home to take over daddy 's cow farm. This article goes on to explain an effort on the part of rural officials to take advantage of new market opportunities. However, everything about the story that is hopeful or solution-orient-ed has to fight against the prevailing direction established by the fall model - a story of steady decline of a traditional rural way of life, and the plight of people and places that are now old-fashioned and outmoded. Even if the journalist does ultimately suggest an optimistic message,the story has inadvertently confirmed the stereotype that rural areas are \"usually \" in terrible shape these days. The exception ends up proving the rule. Rural dystopia: still an easy model to trigger Another of the cultural models that all Americans hold somewhere in their minds frames rural areas as blighted backwaters. People are familiar with the image of rural areas as placesof illiteracy , ignorance, poor health, poor housing, inadequate education and violence.Appalachian shacks, run-down Indian reservations, \"redneck \" trailer parks, and other similar stereotypes are specific instances of this rural dystopia model that people sometimes use tothink about the problems of rural areas. In the following example a journalist criticizes apolitically well-connected farm by playing on the rural dystopia model. PISCATAWAY, N.J. There are no cows at the Cornell Dairy Farm. A few shaggy ponies graze in its overgrown pasture, behind a hand-painted sign announcing \"pony rides. \" A goat wanders among the trash containers, rusted construction equipment and ramshackleoutbuildings. A few roosters scratch in the driveway outside the farm store, which sellsone item: eggs that are trucked in from Pennsylvania. While writers rarely use the stereotypes of rural dystopia in their articles to mock or deni- grate people, journalists may sometime trigger this model incidentally , especially when theyare trying to shed light on problems in rural areas. One story of a man returning to a familyfarm begins: When Jack Manix showed up at his grandfather 's farm here 31 years ago, the 200-year-old homestead was headed for ruin. \"The roofs leaked, the fences needed fixing, the cider shed had broken down, \" Mr. Manix recalled. \"Grampa had to give up his cows because he couldn 't take care of them. \" 75Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsThe image of run-down buildings and poverty-stricken farmers can trigger negative stereo- types about ramshackle country lives, and confirm people 's ideas that rural areas and rural people are best ignored or left behind. Overwhelming power of stereotypes The counterproductive \"traditional \" images described in this section typically appear before an article moves on to its actual point - often the description of a situation that actually con- tradicts the default models. By beginning a piece with an emotionally resonant and familiar image, reporters are often successful in \"hooking \" readers into a story . The \"news \" of the arti- cle becomes the difference between what people expect to hear and what the journalist is actu- ally reporting. A large body of research suggests, however, that once a dominant model has been evoked, it is reinforced rather than undermined by what follows. Once dominant cognitive models are trig- gered, they are very difficult to contradict. This is true even when the journalist spends therest of the article trying to change people 's minds about rural areas. The new information tends to confirm the model or to be \"filtered out \" by people 's pre-existing understandings. As a result, rather than displacing old models, articles like these tend to entrench them further,taking readers further from where advocates would like them to be. Problem 3: Feeding the Modernization Myth Cultural Logic 's research has shown that people tend to \"toggle \" between two contradictory models of the food system. On one hand is the model of traditional farms and farmers dis-cussed in the previous section. On the other hand, people often speak as though those smallfarms are purely a thing of the past and as though agriculture has been entirely transformedinto something unrecognizably \"modern. \" Americans may know very little about the actual food supply system, but they do have a familiar cultural model about modernization and tendto plug their fragmentary knowledge into this model, producing an extreme picture of high-tech, unnatural, corporate-run agribusiness. Because people think of modernization as a one-way , un-stoppable, uncontrolled movement toward greater size, complexity , centralization, and technological sophistication, they uncon-sciously conclude that this is the direction in which agriculture (if it can even be called thatanymore) is moving as well. Trends in agriculture that don 't fit this model are very hard for people to appreciate or take seriously . In many of the articles that we surveyed, journalistsreinforced this hyper-modernization model. High-tech answers to agricultural problems Some reporting simply plays up the benefits of scientific and technological developments. For instance, in \"One-Billionth Acre of Biotech Seed Planted \" (Washington Post , 5/10/05) the jour- nalist portrays a system that is embracing high-tech solutions. Tom West, vice president of biotechnology affairs for Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., said in a statement Monday [that] biotech crops are one of the greatest technological advances inthe history of agriculture. Such crops have been at the center of heated debate between envi-ronmentalists, who worry they 're not safe for the land or human consumption, and industry organizations, that say biotech crops reduce the use of pesticides and other farm chemicals. 76Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsDespite a brief reference to the environmentalists who \"worry , \" the article goes on to convey the industry 's stance that the rapidly increasing use of biotech is an established fact. The hyper-modern food system Other articles make more creative use of people 's ambivalence about the benefits and the dan- gers of modernization. In some cases, agriculture is described in terms that exaggerate theindustrial and high-tech aspects of food systems. An article promoting the benefits of mecha-nization opens with a vivid description of a futuristic, monstrous, (and still imaginary)orange-picking robot. A hulking, nameless creature lumbers among the citrus trees, its eight arms and eyes in constant motion, searching for its prey: oranges. Part robot, part tractor, the contraptionis an unusual combination of one internal-combustion engine, four rubber tires, eightdigital cameras, eight electronic arms and an excruciating number of computer algorithmsthat choreograph every movement. Its metal arms maneuver among the branches, where\"eyes\" spot the fruit and suction-cup \"hands \" grasp them even more gently than human hands, which is what they are designed to replace ( \"How to pick an orange, \" Los Angeles Times , p. I18, 1/2/05). The article goes on to argue that technology will solve the problems that have plagued the cit- rus industry , including the persistent injustices of the migrant labor system and the US 's lag- ging competitiveness. One-way modernization: from farms to factories Journalists contribute to people 's idea that agriculture has become more akin to manufactur- ing than farming. Even when articles are critical of trends in agriculture, they tend to use lan-guage that emphasizes an industrialized system, which is \"modern, \" and an alternative system that is \"traditional \" and therefore of the past. In the article below about the intensification of dairying in Ohio, the journalist writes: Where Mr. De Haan envisions bovine splendor, some of his neighbors see the farming equivalent of a smoke-belching chemical plant. \"These are not farms, they are factories, \" said Mary Pierce, 44, who lives down the road from Mr. De Haan. \"And they should be regulated as such. \" Critics say the farms, which typically have several hundred and sometimes thousands of cows, are an insult to another tradition: the small farm where herds of 60 to 150 cowsgraze on open grassland. The large farms, known as confined animal feeding operations,have too little acreage to allow grazing, produce more manure than they can handle andthreaten to pollute aquifers, critics contend ( \"Seeking, and Seeking to Preserve, Greener Pastures, \" New York Times , 3/26/05). Articles like these, while accurate and worthwhile, also reinforce the tendency for Americans to believe that the food industry is progressing in lock-step with other changes in their socie-ty . To the extent that problems in agriculture are understood as symptoms of the generalprocess of modernization, readers are likely to conclude that these changes are inevitable, thatthere are no particular actors responsible, and that their own role is simply to make the bestof the situation. 77Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsProblem 4: Consumer-Centered Reporting Not surprisingly , most reporting on food and food systems assumes that the reader is primari- ly a consumer. This is a problem from advocates ' point of view , first because the \"Consumer Stance \" is basically passive, and incompatible with the systems-oriented, critical approach that most experts would like to promote. Secondly , consumer-oriented portrayals of the food sup-ply system tend to exaggerate the influence of consumers on the nature of food production,and to obscure the active and important roles of producers, advertisers, distributors and retail-ers in shaping consumption. Interestingly , reporting on food and food systems contributes to a particular kind of \"tog- gling, \" between two equally damaging views. On one hand, it can encourage the passive consumer stance in which people don 't imagine or create, but merely wait to see what the market offers. On the other hand, the articles can promote a model of a consumer-drivenmarket - in which consumers are in the driver 's seat when it comes to setting the food-pro- duction agenda. In this model, all the institutions and actors of the food supply systemrevolve around the desires of the consumer, like planets orbiting around the sun. Importantly ,however, this model asks nothing of consumers other than that they buy what they want.In short, each of these stances encourages complacency toward the food supply system. The free-choice paradigm According to the logic of this simple organizing model, consumers choose what they eat, unconstrained by any other factor. Every year, more than 30,000 new products squeeze onto grocery store shelves. Every year, somewhere between 60 percent and 80 percent of them flop. The battle to win consumers ' tastes can drive food and drink makers to the edge of rea- son. Some new foods fail because they taste bad. Some fail because they look funny . Somemight never get a second look because they are too similar to other products. Some prod-ucts also fall victim to bad business planning or inadequate distribution. Toss in the factthat consumers are becoming more educated and more demanding while stubbornlysticking to brands and formulas they know. In response, food marketers are trying tobecome more clever \u2014 and in some cases more daring \u2014 according to the Food Marketing Institute ( \"Strange but New , \" Detroit Free Press , p. 3F , 12/28/04). In this model, the driving force is demand. For example, the article below reports on the end of the long-standing U.S. trade surplus in foodstuffs. Despite the complexity of this historicchange, it is framed as a simple outcome of consumer preferences: The ever-increasing appetite for foreign foods and beverages in the United States is among the reasons the nation is expected to pay as much for imported farm products in fiscal2005 as it earns by selling wheat, soybeans and other products abroad, according to aDepartment of Agriculture report released this week. The article goes on to mention several other reasons for the change - ranging from currency rates to patterns of global trade to the conservatism of US commodity farming - but the arti- cle's opening establishes the powerful consumer-driven frame, making it less likely readers will take in the other causal forces that are mentioned. 78Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systems\"Untapped Markets \": Counter-examples that don 't undermine the model Many groups of people are poorly served by the food systems, yet reporting on the topic emphasizes only that the system hasn 't yet noticed them, or that retailers have finally noticed an \"untapped market. \" A typical instance would be the following article on a historically- underserved population, U.S. Hispanics. At Minyard 's Carnival stores, the bakery has plenty of cakes, but it also has a tortilleria capable of making 4,800 corn tortillas an hour. The seafood department 's live tanks hold swimming catfish instead of pincher-taped lobsters. The grocery business along the Mexican border in Texas and California is ahead on this trend, \" said Michelle Del Toro, research manager at the Food Marketing Institute in Washington. Ms. Del Toro is the author of a 55-page report that bears out what Dallas-area grocers have known for some time: that Hispanics make up a lucrative market justwaiting to be tapped. Rather than reporting on decades of neglect by a highly centralized supermarket system, the report highlights the fact that Hispanics have grown so numerous that they are now beingcatered to by the food retail industry . Given a choice between portraying a system successfullydriven by consumers or one structured and limited by corporate practices, the journalist hasexaggerated the power of the consumer. Even articles that report on the industry 's more questionable practices of marketing and prod- uct design reinforce the \"common-sense \" idea that things exist on menus and on shelves because consumers want them there. In November, Hardee 's debuted the double-patty , four-strips-of- bacon Monster Thickburger \u2014a 1,420-calorie, got plenty of notice from late-night talk-show hosts and critics. One health-and-nutrition advocacy group dubbedThickburgers \"food porn. \" Frazer and others at Hardee 's flick off such criticism, saying they 're only giving con- sumers, namely \"young hungry guys \" ages 18 to 34, what they want. In the article, \"Fast Food goes beyond Supersize \" ( Detroit Free Press , 7/19/05), the journalist begins the article with the claim that the larger (and much more profitable) portions beingpromoted at fast food restaurants are just giving consumers what they want: What health-food trend? T urns out there 's still a large chunk of diners looking for big slabs of burger basics like cheese, bacon and layers of beef patties. In an about-face to theflurry of low-carbohydrate items introduced over the past two years, fast-food chains havebeen out-supersizing each other with new menu items. Hardee 's, Burger King and Wendy 's are promoting hefty sandwiches with names like the Monster Thickburger and the Enormous Omelet. Even Starbucks is tapping into the pleasure-seeking sect with thelaunch of Chantico Drinking Chocolate, which it calls a \"drinkable dessert. \" \"It's a backlash by the American people against the food police, \" said Dean Haskell, an analyst at JMP Securities. \"And operators are catering to it. We try to eat healthy at home, but when we go out we want to splurge. \" The model of consumer responsibility is so engrained that the same article offers no remark upon counterevidence showing that consumers, when given both information and choice,chose healthier (but less profitable) options than the ones the restaurants are promoting. 79Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsIn April, casual-dining chain Ruby T uesday 's reversed a bold move it made last September to prominently post nutritional data on its menus and at tables to help customers makeinformed food choices. Customers did just that, choosing not to eat Colossal Burgers orsignature rib dishes. Articles that report on efforts to create new consumer \"demands \" do not offer any analysis about the forces behind the push to market new products nor the cumulative affect of all of this marketing. The overall effect is to distill the portrayal to the simple clarity of the consumer-driven model. Missing Mechanisms: factors other than consumer choice The defining characteristic of the free-choice model is that forces that might affect or con- strain consumer choices seem to have no clear mechanism. By contrast, the consumer-drivenmodel of food systems offers a very clear mechanism of how consumer purchases influencesupplier decisions. Nutrition guidelines: Who reads them? For example, an article looking at the new national nutrition guidelines conveys the anxiety they have created in the food industry: \"A single word or phrase can mean millions of dollars in additional - or lost - sales for food companies. \"Yet, because the article does not explain how such guidelines might affect the food consumers choose from the shelves, the argument ismuch weaker than the clear and powerful consumer choice model. In fact, one authority citedin the article downplays the power of the guidelines. Harry Balzer, who tracks American eating habits as vice president of the NPD Group in Rosemont, said he didn 't expect the guidelines to have a huge impact on consumption. Diet gurus, product marketers and media outlets: Who heeds them? The integrated and \"synergistic \" relationships between marketers, dietary experts, govern- ment, and media outlets are described in several articles, but again, with no compelling expla-nation of the forces acting on consumers. As a result, such reports don 't encourage the reader to think beyond the consumer-driven model. In 2004 food companies increased the number of low-carb offerings more than fivefold, to 2,378 products, just as Heath and more than 16 million others appeared to have lost theirappetite for low-carb diets. Atkins Nutritionals Inc., the products company behind the pop-ular diet of the same name, and other firms such as Northfield-based Kraft Foods Inc. andChicago 's Sara Lee Corp. flooded the market with products, many of which failed to stick. In only two years [Atkins] has gone from producing almost all its products in-house to licensing the power of its brand to other food producers who have put Atkins goods inthe dairy , refrigerated and freezer aisles as well as in the rest of the supermarket. It 's that potential and the power of the Atkins name that prompted Parthenon Capital andGoldman Sachs to pay a reported $533 million for an 80 percent stake in the privatelyheld Atkins in October 2003 ( \"Low-carb audience, full of other food choices, thins out, \" Chicago T ribune , p. 1, 1/16/05). Ironically , the plethora of product lines, the huge monetary stakes involved, and the massive efforts on the part of food suppliers to create and maintain inertia of fad diets or healthcrazes, only serve to confirm how central the (fickle) consumer really is. Ultimately , themodel insists that it is the individual consumer that makes his or her free choice. 80Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsWeak mechanisms: Advertising and misinformation The paradigm of freedom of consumer choice is so well-engrained that there were no articles in the samples that questioned it. There were a few articles that mentioned influences on theconsumer - one discussed the power of advertising, for instance - but for each of these there were many that offered quotes like, \"That's the bottom line for any company . If it doesn 't sell, it'll go off the menu. \" The end result is that the whole question of food industry responsibility disappears entirely , because in this model all that the food industry does is sell people what they want. Evenwhen a story focuses on safeguards to prevent schoolchildren from eating unhealthy food, themeasures are framed in language that is about limiting the children 's freedom (i.e. the use of words like \"limit\" and \"ban\"): National statistics on childhood obesity and on the low consumption of fruit and vegeta- bles among youth have prompted school districts around the country to limit the amountof junk food available to students. The Seattle School District earlier this month adoptedpolicies that banned the sale of pop and foods high in sugar and fat. Ask students at Everett High School what they think of the district 's new policy banning pop, candy , chips and french fries in favor of healthier food, and you 'll hear yelps of protest. In the rare cases where advertising goes so far as to be fraudulent, the consumer-driven model is \"saved \" because a compatible model is evoked to explain the undue influence on con- sumers: Sometimes people can be tricked. In what has become a near free-for-all marketplace for health claims on food products, consumers are often convinced that the more they eat of these products, the healthier, orthinner, they are likely to be. ... [T]hink again. Congress has made it extremely difficult for the Food and Drug Administration to closely regulate health-related claims for foodsand supplements ( \"Beware Food Companies ' Health Claims, \" New York Times , 9/21/04). Taken together, these consumer-centered patterns constitute a very challenging obstacle for effective communications about food systems, and allow producers to position themselves onthe high ground of freedom. Constructive Patterns of Coverage The counterproductive patterns discussed above describe the bulk of the stories sampled in this research, and it might be natural to conclude that more constructive stories are simplynot compatible with the parameters of the mainstream press. This is, in fact, not the case. Anumber of stories actually do succeed in framing the issue of food in ways that are conduciveto a better understanding of the food system. In this section, we show that more productivecoverage of food is possible, and that this coverage is characterized by a number of specificpatterns. While a few articles are models of coverage that do much to provide the reader witha \"big picture, \" many others simply contain productive elements - examples of which are dis- cussed here. 81Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsAvoiding the rural stereotypes trap by reporting on real interactions between farmers and non-farmers. Not all articles use models like rural utopia as the \"hook \" in order to involve readers. Some stories instead make an attempt to describe the actual relationships that Rhode Islanders, forinstance, are likely to have with farms and rural areas, including Ever take a quick trip to the local farm for some good deals on fresh produce? Do your children like to play in the autumn mazes or take field trips to farms? Or do you justenjoy the quiet scenery and beauty of having farmland so close to the city? \"Many R.I. farms are cultivating the tourist crop, \"(Providence Journal , p. 1C, 12/19/04), This brief article explains the ways in which farmers and non-farmers interact in Rhode Island (through direct sales at farms stands and markets, \"agritourism, \" and through the shared landscape and economy). It goes on to show how each affects the other, and how bothare part of a shared system. In regions other than New England, the nature of the interactionsare different, of course, and journalists would presumably need to work to discover just whatpeople 's real connections to farmers and rural areas actually are. But in any case, these story lines of interconnectedness deserve creative adaptation. Using the farmer as illustration not icon Sometimes journalists successfully use individual farms and farmers as illustrations of larger issues. However, the symbolic baggage that farming images carry means that this requires care-ful, meticulous effort on the part of the journalist. The stories must emphasize again and againthat this is not about farmer-myths, but about contemporary people engaged in agriculture inthe contemporary system. In \"Sell in Bulk, Lose Farm. Sell Locally , and Watch Revenues Grow , \"( New York Times , 9/21/04), journalist Keith Schneider chooses a particular farm as an illustration, but in nearly every sentence he makes it clear that this farm and these happeningsare merely specific instances of larger trends. The images of tradition and rural virtue are mini-mized in order to emphasize that this family of farmers is making its way in the modern world.It is worth quoting at length to demonstrate the consistency of his approach. One of the truly good-news stories in American agriculture, and one with meaning for small businesses of all kinds, is what 's happening on T yler Road here at the Shetler Family Dairy . Not that long ago, George and Sally Shetler were small fry in an industry dominated by big players, producers of a bulk commodity in which prices essentially had not budgedfor 20 years. Continuing to supply the conventional fluid milk market, the Shetlers con-cluded, would take them down the same bankruptcy path that the Department ofAgriculture says claimed almost 400 farms a week from 1974 to the mid-1990 's, most of them small. So in 1995, the Shetlers decided to try a more entrepreneurial approach. If the markets they could reach through conventional channels were unsatisfactory , what new marketcould they tap? The one right around them, as it turned out bottling and delivering theirmilk directly to stores in Traverse City , 25 miles away , the center of a five-county regionwith 165,000 residents and growing faster than almost any place in the Midwest. This kind of article does more than describe the plight of a family farm or spin the story of a scrappy farmer whose skill and hard work finds success where others find failure. Instead, it 82Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systemshelps give people a more accurate understanding of how agriculture of various types fits with- in our food supply system, and more specifically it lays out the mechanism through which some-thing like direct sales and producer processing can allow smaller operators to make a living. Spanning the gap from seed to table: showing readers the system at work In a detailed article about strawberry growing ( \"Strawberries and Dreams, \" New York Times, 4/13/05), journalist David Karp carefully lays out all of the factors that go into the selection and design of commercial varieties of this fruit. While the article is critical of the food indus-try in suggesting that the taste of strawberries suffers in some of the compromises, it does notadopt a kind of \"food scare \" tone. Rather, it shows that the actual strawberry on the shelf is the result of a complicated system where consumers ' desires are only part of the equation. Grower 's needs (for hardiness and ease of harvesting), distributor 's needs (for durability and consistency of shape and size) and retailers needs (for attractiveness and flavor) all factor in,often at the expense of flavor and variety . This level of detail can also give readers a mechanism to understand that the particular com- promises that are being made aren 't the only imaginable ones. For instance, the article gives enough information to make it clear that a choice is being made between a system based uponlong-distance shipping, versus one anchored in local growers. Because they don 't sweeten after harvest, strawberries must be picked fully ripe for best flavor. But to ship berries cross-country commercial growers have to compromise and har-vest before full maturity . Local vendors can do much better. Harry 's Berries, a farm in Oxnard, grows Seascape and Gaviota, two University of California varieties with good flavor that are a bit too soft andlow-yielding for commercial growers. The owners pick the berries fully red and sell themat a premium, $4 a pint, at 24 Southern California farmers ' markets. When everything goes right, the berries are quite sweet and richly flavored. But most growers would sooner raise wombats than highly flavored but perishable straw- berries. In contrast with the marketing of industrially grown tomatoes, whose insipidityinspired a small revival of heirloom varieties, almost all California strawberry shippers focus on mainstream markets, assuming that Americans look for price more than quality . The article also works to counteract the problems of the passive consumer discussed above. On the one hand, it shows just how the consumer isn 't entirely in the driver 's seat. On the other hand, it shows the real and potential power of consumers not only to make moreinformed and satisfying choices, but also ultimately to have some effect upon the producethat they find upon the shelves. Showing the citizen making changes to the food system. Many articles show the food supply system as an evolving system, but the engines of change are always distant and outside the influence of the average citizen. Distant producers, distrib-utors or marketers come up with new strategies. Government regulators and nutrition expertsmake obscure changes from within distant bureaucracies. Consumers, in their vague, aggre-gate way , alter their shopping habits. Of the hundred plus articles surveyed for this research,only two gave a positive portrayal of citizen-consumers making intentional changes to thenature of the food system. The absence of this type of story is all the more striking, given thatgrass-roots activism is an important goal of advocates. 83Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsAn important counter-example is from the Chicago Sun Times: When Austin community organizer LaDonna Redmond began addressing her son Wade 's food allergies, she found herself traveling all over \u2014 and paying top dollar \u2014 for organi- cally grown produce and other natural foods. Austin, a largely black and relatively poorcommunity on the West Side, didn 't have its own supermarket, let alone an organic-foods emporium like Whole Foods. Redmond, who had developed programs for nonprofit organizations, put her professional skills to work. With her husband, Tracey , Redmond formed the Institute for CommunityResource Development, a nonprofit group that works on food systems for \"underserved communities. \" Their first project was the 15-year-old Austin Farmers Market, which had fallen on hard times ( \"Grass-roots group sows seeds for farmers market harvest, \" Chicago Sun Times , p. 57, 10/6/04). The article goes on to relate the vitality and economic cohesion of the local community directly to the food system, and to show how the food supply system interacts with otheraspects of life. A second example of successful citizen-consumer action is provided by a well-developed arti- cle about community-supported agriculture: \"More families get subscriptions to buy veggies from local farms \" (Pittsburgh Tribune-Review , 6/18/05). Although this article sometimes por- trays the CSA as a fringe movement motivated more by philosophy than practicality and prof-it (which is off-putting to many people), it nevertheless clearly explains the multiple advan-tages of local purchasing, including freshness, healthfulness, variety , and local economic good.It even successfully introduces the idea of food security and shows that mainstream venueslike restaurants and supermarkets are getting involved. Combating consumer complacency Although getting citizens to understand and act directly upon the food supply is an important goal, for the foreseeable future most people will continue to act primarily as supermarket con-sumers. Most articles surveyed tend to feed this tendency by taking for granted the passivenature of consumer activity (e.g. buy or don 't buy what you 're offered), and by portraying the food system as nonetheless driven by consumers and their desires. Very few articles tracedconsumer choices outward into larger social contexts. Not just price and convenience: exposing consumers to the implications of their choices A first step in getting consumers to make choices that impact the food system in constructive ways, is convincing them that their choices are not just about the quality of their dinners andthe state of their weekly budget. For example, in \"Doing good by trading fair, \" ( Providence Journal , p. 1G, 10/27/04) journalist Gail Ciampa explains how the coffee that consumers buy (i.e. FreeTrade or commercial) affects economic and environmental sustainability as well asfair wages and social justice for farm workers. The article is careful not to preach that con-sumers must let these concerns influence their shopping decisions, it simply makes the case that such decisions have far-reaching effects either way . It's the right thing to do, \" said Susan Wood, CEO for Providence 's Coffee Exchange. \"How can you make a living on the back of someone else? How could you live with yourself? \" 84Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food SystemsAnd even if you turn a cold heart to her moral argument, consider Wood 's roaster 's point of view. \"If we don 't help the farmer, we 're not going to have access to great coffee because farmers aren 't going to be able to do their job anymore, \" she said. \"Then we all lose. \" So when you see that \"Fair Trade Certified \" label, understand it 's not just food with a cause. The concept blends powerful components of sustainability (growing things thatenrich, not drain or pollute the land); artisan products (hand-tended rather than mass-produced); organics (not using chemicals and pesticides); and social responsibility . The non-accusatory tone and the careful inclusion of other issues dear to the (unenlightened) consumer 's heart, including, quality , cost, and convenience, seems well-designed to reach out to shoppers who otherwise would resist calls to join a \"social movement \" like fair trade. While appeals based on enlightened consumption do not go so far as to encourage a Citizen stance instead , they are about as close as anything we found in the sample. Conclusion Newspapers are often considered our best source of authoritative journalism - the kind that gives us the most accurate and informative picture of the world. We might therefore expectprint coverage - especially the kind provided in in-depth stories - to produce narratives that advance the public 's grasp of the issue of food systems. An analysis of more than one hundred articles suggests, however, that newspaper coverage of food issues is subject to the sameunproductive framing tendencies that we might expect from other media. 2Even if print jour- nalism is generally better than local TV news coverage, for example, newspaper articles oftenstill fall into patterns that prevent readers from deepening or broadening their understandingof food systems. Moreover, unproductive patterns of the kind discussed in this report don 't necessarily reflect bad intentions, lack of skill or any other easily-identified journalistic flaw. Instead, they reflectcommon patterns in American reasoning and discourse, or a lack of attention to the ways inwhich a perfectly reasonable story can interact with the understandings and assumptions of thereading public. Food systems present special challenges to journalists and other communica-tors - the public 's counterproductive ideas are easily evoked, and ways of framing the issue that seem productive at one level too often cut against the goals of advocates in other ways. At the same time, as a brief survey of more productive articles demonstrates, careful attention to some basic principles can make a tremendous difference in the impact on an audience 's think- ing. But there is no reason to expect journalism to move in these directions unless advocatesoffer journalists very concrete help in reframing their stories. The analysis reported in this reportoffers one tool in helping advocates work towards reshaping coverage of this critical issue. 85Harmful and Productive Patterns in Newspaper Presentations of Food Systems 2 For a discussion of unhelpful tendencies of local TV news, for instance, see Shanto Iyengar, \"Is Anyone Responsible?, \" University of Chicago Press, 1991.86About the FrameWorks Institute The mission of the FrameWorks Institute is to advance the nonprofit sector's communications capacity by identifying, translating and modeling relevant scholarly research for framing thepublic discourse about social problems.
