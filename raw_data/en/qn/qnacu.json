Organic yogurt is also a great source of probiotics, along with other sources such as saurkraut, kombucha, kefir, and fermented vegetables. Omega 3 (Cod Liver Oil) Whilst aiding healthy joints and bones, Cod Liver Oil is also highly effective against excitoxins, and at the same time repairing damaged cells. Taking Omega 3 is a fantastic way to detox from toxins and heavy metals. I highly recommend [Carlson's cod liver oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008XCD5YA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008XCD5YA&linkCode=as2&tag=creativeandhe-20&linkId=09b2f2b9151f8c27d01e43fd6c01b7f9) as a supplement for kids.
