Wouldn't you love to have boundless energy, more effective metabolism, clearer skin, brighter mood and a new healthy approach to food? Detoxification is a core concept of natural medicine as it helps to renew and refresh systems in the body that may not be working optimally. Detoxification helps to up-regulate metabolism, refresh hormonal health, slow the ageing process and restore immune system health. People feel fresher and brighter and energy improves as cellular health is revitalised. We are here to help get things underway with our exciting new online detox program packed with delicious new recipes and fresh inspiration for a clean start to your health. Why do I need a detox? Even if you think you have a reasonably good diet and lifestyle you may still need a detox. Everyday we are exposed to toxins, from our environment, food, alcohol, caffeine, medications and common pollutants like plastics and household chemicals. Toxins come in two broad categories, exogenous (toxins absorbed from outside the body) and endogenous (toxins produced within the body). Exogenous toxins may come from environmental exposure to heavy metals, chemicals and pesticides or may be absorbed into the body in the case of drugs, alcohol and chemicals and additives used in food. Endogenous toxins include hormones and other chemical messengers that are produced within the body, including chemicals produced by bacteria, yeasts and parasites in your digestive system. Even though we all try to avoid toxins and pollution, we are all exposed on a daily basis, people are often surprised at what the tests show! Have you experienced one or more of these signs and symptoms of toxicity? - Indigestion, constipation, diarrhoea, stomach pain or feeling sluggish or nauseas after eating - Recurrent headaches or migraines - Muscle aching and weakness - Nerve pain or numbness - Lowered immunity or allergies - Poor short term memory or concentration - Sensitivity to environmental chemicals and strong odours e.g. perfumes - Chronic fatigue and lethargy - Depression, anxiety and mood swings - Hormonal problems such as PMS, or heavy, painful or irregular periods. How can we assess toxicity? It is important to establish your levels of toxicity before we begin, so we use a range of tests and screening procedures to ensure we know what type of detox programme is best suited to your particular needs. We also monitor your progress throughout your program to ensure your body is effectively eliminating and reducing your toxic load so you can ultimately achieve your health goals. In clinic tests and screening for toxicity Cellular Health Screening - Examines cellular function and fluid balance and screens for indications of inflammation and toxicity Zinc Tally - Tests your levels of zinc, an important detoxification mineral Functional pathology to identify toxicity Functional Liver Detoxification Profile - Detailed assessment of the various liver pathways Comprehensive Digestive Stool Analysis - The 'gold standard' in stool testing, identifying clearly the state of your gut health and identifying any pathogenic bacteria, parasites or yeasts which significantly interferes with gut function. Intestinal Permeability - Used to diagnose leaky gut when symptoms are significant Heavy Metal Screening - Uses either hair or urine analysis to screen for the presence of heavy metals The gut is where it all begins We have always known that the state of your gut dictates the your overall health, and research has shown this to be the case. This means, of course, that you cannot successfully detoxify the body without having treated the digestive system and repaired the lining of the digestive tract first. If you don't treat the gut first it is like replacing the oil in your car without replacing the filter. Most people with toxicity develop a problem called 'leaky gut' (also known as increased intestinal permeability). In a healthy digestive system, the lining of gut is a very good filter, allowing beneficial nutrients to pass into the blood stream, whilst keeping toxic bacteria and waste products of digestion within the bowel for excretion. This filter is easily damaged by poor diet, stress, infection, medications, bad bacteria, yeasts and parasites, which then lead to the unregulated transport of large quantities of partially digested foods and wastes into the body. This places an enormous stress on other organs of detoxification including the liver and kidneys. Eventually, a percentage of this material escapes capture by the liver and kidneys and ends up entering the general circulation, where it can lead to many of the symptoms of toxicity. As a result, leaky gut causes a great deal of stress upon the immune system, liver and virtually every other organ and system in the body. Depending on the results of your toxicity screening you will be recommended either the a 2 week mini cleanse or the Comprehensive Detox Program 2 Week Cleanse - Spring Clean This programme is for those whose toxic load is proven to be relatively low and want a quick spring clean to keep themselves in top shape.
