I have been thinking of you often, writing this note to you in my head with ongoing modification throughout the past few weeks considering all recent events. Today I am sending you my present suggestions for our continued health and relationships. Though I continue to support caution vs. alarm in response to the news that is surrounding us, I also remain cognizant of the realities we are in. As providers and supporters of health care, we are committed to remaining calm and are judiciously aware of concerns to help guide ourselves and others through these very ambiguous times. However, we also hold on with faith that this will pass, and that we will be transformed as individuals and as a global society to more cohesive and healthy communities. Please note we are incorporating all measures recommended by the county and state governments regarding the SAR COVID-19 virus. This includes using and putting into practice social distancing, increasing our sanitization, limiting our travels, and more specifically implementing telemedicine/teleconferencing when appropriate. That said I am still seeing patients out of my office on a 1:1 level or having family sessions when needed. I am following all guidelines while still providing support for home visits. Please note that these changes are difficult to sustain, as the information keeps changing, making the communication between us challenging. Please know this: I remain here for you in whatever format is most comfortable for you. Though the gross numbers of those infected and the complications from the virus and death rate appear to be increasing; by remaining strong, calm and faithful we will complete our due diligence in respect for each other while managing the virus. Each loss of life is tragic and forever beyond our comprehension. However, keeping the number of lives lost to the lowest number possible appears to be related to the precautionary measures we are currently taking. We are upholding precaution and social distancing, so we will continue to do our part to support the need to contain transmission. However, we do not believe that total isolation is of value and we are working to balance those differences out by creating bridges to better manage isolation, detachment and anxiety while maintaining our communication and contact. As many of you know, I have always made myself available to patients via text, phone, and email long before this occurrence and I will continue to do so throughout this. Let's do this together. Loving you all, always... Dr. Gary Ruelas Medical Director Integrative Medical Institute Of Orange County "}
