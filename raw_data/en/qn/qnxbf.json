I had no idea people ate narwhals, or polar bear for that matter! It was interesting to see the proportion of processed food to fresh produce from country to country as well.And somewhat related to that is an article in the Atlantic about how \" [Serving Convenience Foods for Dinner Doesn't Save Time](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/03/serving-convenience-foods-for-dinner-doesnt-save-time/273729/?google_editors_picks=true).\" It makes the excellent point that home cooked meals from scratch organically bring the family together for meals since with convenience foods you can easily eat whatever, whenever, which means you most likely won't be sitting down with the family when you eat. Eating in front of the television, in the car, or on the go, tends to encourage mindless eating. Eating in a slower, relaxed setting while socializing and interacting with your family or friends actually helps your body absorb more nutrients from your meal- we tend to chew more and take our time which leads to better digestion. And of course, beyond the nutritional benefits, bonding with your family during mealtime makes home-cooked (vs convenience) meals even more worthwhile.

Recent tests conducted by EuroFins ( [www.eurofins.com/en.aspx](http://www.eurofins.com/en.aspx)), an independent analysis company, have found that 91% of the Celestial Seasonings teas contained pesticide levels higher than the US Federal Limits.These tests were initiated by Glaucus Research Group out of California, who do have a great influence on short-sale stocks. They do provide a full disclaimer that they will, in fact, benefit greatly if Hain Celestial (the mother company) stock plummets (which it has after this research). In addition to Celestial Teas, Glaucus Research exposed numerous other products of Hain Celestial as being falsely marketed. Read the full report here: [https://glaucusresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/02/GlaucusResearch-The_Hain_Celestial_Group_Inc-NasdaqHAIN-Strong_Sell_Febuary_21_2013.pdf](https://glaucusresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/02/GlaucusResearch-The_Hain_Celestial_Group_Inc-NasdaqHAIN-Strong_Sell_Febuary_21_2013.pdf).Although it is hard to sift through all of the research that is out there, when evidence such as this comes across our desks it is impossible to ignore. We do believe that we all need to do our part as consumers to push the market toward organic, pesticide free produce for an overall healthier world.What tea do we suggest? It seems that similar tests were run on Twinings Teas, and they were given an A in sustainability.The | | | [Read More](/blog-2/88) [ 2013 FLU TIPS from Dr. Molly Niedermeyer! ](/blog-2/2013-flu-tips-from-dr-molly-niedermeyer) My brother emailed me asking if I had gotten my flu shot and I quickly responded that I would not get one and do not advise it. Cancer clients are suppose to strengthen their immune systems because our white blood cells are often compromised and we cannot \"afford\" to get the flu. This is an on-going discussion with my oncologist and I tell him getting the flu vaccine is \"not negotiable with me.\" I was listening to an interview with the CDC on the radio yesterday, and they say this is the \"worst flu season in a decade.\" When asked, \"Why?\" the CDC representatvie's response was: 1. the flu virus seems to mutate and get stronger AND 2. we really do not know. I DO!!!!! First, we keep creating super bugs with vaccines. Those bugs want to survive and mutate getting smarter and smarter about tricking our immune systems. Secondly, when you get the flu vaccine you commit a portion of your immune system to only recognize the \"blue hatted flu bug\" which the CDC guessed would be the flu bug arriving this winter last spring. So, you now have less flexibility in your immune system since 80% of your fighting cells are sleeping on the job when the flu virus arrives with a \"red hat.\" I would rather have 100% of your immune system capable of responding to whatever comes. Thirdly, our immune systems are weaker and weaker from toxic exposure, poor diets, lack of sleep, stress, etc. Better prevention would be Molly's 5 Point health plan.... sleep, eat well, drink water, exercise (increases white blood cells) and commit to a basic supplement regime. Having said all that, I want you to know this has been one of the worst flus I have seen. What we have found to work right now: 1. Stay hydrated! 2. Warming sock treatment (you can find this on our website: [http://www.emeraldcityclinic.com/educational/pdfs/sock.pdf](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e47316b94c2c44a94129868/5e473748db0da778039cf1e6/5e47377fdb0da778039d030f/1581725567286/sock.pdf?format=original)) 3. Homeopathic Bryonia or Eupatorium 4. High dose chinese mushrooms like astragelus. 5. High dose lysine (2000 mg/day). If you are sick please contact your Emerald City Clinic Naturopathic physician immediately as it really makes a difference to have an ally through this process. This flu seems to have 3-4 days of high fever that weakens your immune system and turns into whatever illness has historically been your weakness: bronchitis, sinus infection, strep throat. Do not be mistaken it is a virus and will not respond to antibiotics.

I am happy to address any health issues that you would like me to. Just email the office at [frontdesk@emeraldcityclinic.com](mailto:frontdesk@emeraldcityclinic.com) and we will our best to address your concerns publicly. So here is a controversial topic of immunizations. Public Health would not like my opinion about immunizations and therefore most Naturopathic physicians shy away from a stance because it goes beyond health into the political arena. Given this environment I have never been one to shy away from an opinion. First immunizations MUST be an individual decision between a client and the best medical advice that your physician can give you individually NOT societally. It is a societal decision to immunize everyone and now it is societal health problem that everyone is allergic to eggs. So I will attempt to discuss some of the \"Fall immunizations\". First all flu vaccines are decide in the Spring as to what MIGHT show up and there is a great deal of money involved. Flu vaccines generally do NOT improve your immune system and has some potentially life threatening side effects. There are more health provoking ways to prevent the flu. Washing your hands, eating a good diet, sleeping, taking care of your immune system. Once you have been exposed we have powerful herbal and nutritional medicines to prevent the horrible systems of the flu. So generally speaking I do NOT recommend these annual flu vaccines. Pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough, is now being recommended for all adults to prevent spreading it to pediatric population. The fear based advertising out there really irritates me. If you are around infants under 2 routinely I might seriously consider getting immunized but it is NOT a given. Pertussis vaccine does NOT give life time immunity and the disease does. This is a \"hot button topic\" worthy of a John Stewart episode but I am not going to go there right now, I would just recommend that you talk to one of your Emerald City Clinic physician before accepting any immunizaitons. Pneumonia immunizaiton: Do not do it. No reason. Build your immune system. Sleep. Shingles: Boy this is really an exercise in restraint for me. A good case of chicken pox as a child will give you life time immunity. Chicken pox vaccine given to pediatric clients instead of getting a case of chicken pox is resulting in higher levels of shingles. If you never got a \"good case of chicken pox\" and you are exposed to chicken pox as an adult AND you are stressed out and nutritionally deficient you can get shingles. But shingles is easily treatable with Naturopathic care and a sign that your immune system needs some attention. The bottomline is NONE of these immunization are getting to the cause of someone's compromised immune system. For hours outside in fresh air and green spaces increase your natural killer cells which is a better protection for any virus then an immunization. An immunization commits a portion of your immune semi permanently to only responding to that virus removing flexiblity from your immune system to respond to other insults. For example if you have 100 white blood cells and 80% are committed to only recognizing a mumps virus in a blue hat, then when the mumps virus with the green hat arrives you only have 20% available to defend you. Seems like an overcommitment of your resources. Hum you can see I have returned to Emerald City feeling exuberant to get back to helping all of you optimize your health. Once again I want to reiterate that immunization decision are individual and should be addressed with your concerns with your doctor at Emerald City Clinic.

Collecting afternoon samples can lead to under diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Doctors test thyroid stimulating hormone, also known as TSH, to screen for and diagnose hypothyroidism, a condition of inadequate thyroid hormone. TSH is made in the brain and as its name implies, stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone. Thus if TSH levels increase, it the brain is telling the body to make more thyroid hormone. When TSH levels stay high it suggests that the body cannot make enough thyroid hormone. Most laboratories define 'normal' TSH as between 0.5 and 5.0 uM/L. TSH levels above 5.0 are considered hypothyroidism and those below 0.5, hyperthyroidism. A new study published in the August 2012 issue of Endocrine Research reveals that our current approach to diagnosing hypothyroidism has been too simplistic and needs change. Production of TSH follows a circadian rhythm that is it follows a 24-hour cycle with regular fluctuations. TSH production peaks at its highest level between 2:00 and 4:00 am each morning and then drops reaching its low point between 4 and 8 pm in the evening. Though this phenomenon is well known the actual extent of these fluctuations was much greater than was previously thought. In this current study, researchers from the Federal Endocrinological Research Centre in Moscow, tested 20 women with subclinical hypothyroidism. Morning and afternoon TSH levels were measured and compared. The median morning TSH value for women with subclinical hypothyroidism was 5.83 mU/L. Their afternoon median TSH dropped down to 3.79 mU/L. Following the current guidelines for diagnosis hypothyroidism would have been diagnosed in only half of these cases when tested in the afternoon. These new data explain why many people who appear to have symptoms of hypothyroidism have been told their test results were normal, that they are fine, when in truth they hypothyroid. TSH levels measured in blood samples drawn in the afternoon should be viewed with caution, as they may be falsely low and appear normal. Samples for all thyroid tests should be collected first thing in the morning. It gets more complicated than this. Many practitioners consider the current normal range for TSH values to be too broad. Rather than judging TSH levels above 5 as hypothryoidism, some consider the upper limit of normal to be as low as 3.0, while researchers looking at what is called sub-clinical hypothyroidism define the condition by a TSH greater than 2.5. Apparently that is the level at which risk for cardiovascular disease increases significantly. Combining these two bits of news, the circadian variability of TSH and the benefits of treating even slight increases in TSH, leads me to think that we should be relooking at a fair number of patients who have previously been told that their thyroids were fine. They might not be..... Reference: Sviridonova MA, with Hypothyroidism. Endocr Res. 2012 Aug 2. Duntas LH, Biondi B. New insights into subclinical risk.
