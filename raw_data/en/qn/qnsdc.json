Cleansing the body consists of brief periods of time of fasting from toxins that may be present in many of our everyday foods. Fasting simply means \"to go without\". To go without does not mean not to eat, quite the contrary in Ayurvedic Medicine the concept of cleansing really means to simplify the diet with medicinal foods so the digestive system can have a period of rest. Industrialization has come with an increase in foreign and toxic substances being produced causing an increase in toxins, also known as known as xenobiotics, in our soaps, shampoos, foods, cleaning products, etc. \" When toxins accumulate in our body over time many health issues can arise. Cleansing the body for a brief period of time by simplifying our diet allows detoxification allowing the body to work more efficiently and reverse disease.
