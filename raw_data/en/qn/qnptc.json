Missouri identied a high number of outbreaks in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) across the state with low vaccination ratesamong LTCF staff members and poor adherence to mitigation measures within localcommunities. Aim: To describe COVID-19 outbreaks that occurred in Missouri LTCFs impacting staff and residents during the surge of the Delta variant.Methods: Outbreaks of COVID-19 in 178 LTCFs were identied by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Case data from LTCFs with the highest burden of disease were analysed to assess disease transmission, vaccination status, and outcomes amongresidents and staff. Additional investigational measures included onsite visits to facilities with recent COVID-19 outbreaks in communities with substantial transmission to assess mitigation measures.Findings: During April 22 ndto July 29th, 2021, 159 COVID-19 cases among 72 staff members and 87 residents were identied in 10 LTCFs. More than 74.7% of resident cases were vaccinated compared to 23.6% of staff cases. Vaccinated residents had a lower proportionof hospitalizations and deaths reported compared to unvaccinated residents. Data analysisand contact-tracing efforts from a sample of the facilities suggest that staff members were likely a major factor in introducing SARS-CoV-2 virus into the facilities. Adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures varied at the visited facilities.Conclusion: Data showed that vaccination rates varied between staff cases and resident cases in facilities with high-burden outbreaks. Differences were identied in mitigation practices in at least two facilities. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Healthcare Infection Society.

By mid-July 2021, Delta was the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant across all Missouri health jurisdictions, and multiple sources indicated that close to 90% of cases were infected with the Delta variant. On July 16th, 2021, 92% of Missouri's counties had 'substantial' to 'high' transmission (50 e99 to /C21100 new cases per 100,000 persons respectively in the past seven days) and reports indicated that both rural and urban communitieswere heavily impacted [ 2]. Even though the Delta wave in Missouri preceded the nationwide spread, the variant quickly became the predominant strain across the USA, causing another surge in COVID-19-associated cases, hospitalizations,and deaths [ 3]. Missouri ranked between 39 thand 41stin the USA for COVID- 19 vaccination remaining relatively stable from April eMay [ 2]. As of July 17th, 2021, 40% of all Missourians, including 73.6% of the Missouri population aged /C2165 years, were fully vaccinated[2]. Vaccination rates in Missouri trailed behind the national average despite state campaigns and local efforts to educate and incentivize communities living in low-uptake areas regarding the efcacy of COVID-19 vaccinations in reducing thelikelihood of infection and severe disease [ 2,4]. The surge in the more transmissible Delta variant coupled with lower vac- cination rates contributed to a high number of COVID-19 casesthroughout the state. Residents and staff in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) were among those most severely impacted by the Delta surge. To better understand disease transmission and identifybarriers to prevention measures, case demographics, disease severity, vaccination status, and mitigation measures were analysed among a subset of COVID-19 outbreaks thatoccurred in Missouri LTCFs that reported higher burden outbreak.Table I Demographics and characteristics of infected persons among staff ( N\u00bc858) and residents ( N\u00bc560) in 10 long-term care facilities with higher burden COVID-19 outbreaks in Missouri during the Delta variant surge, April 22ndto July 29th, 2021 ( N\u00bc159) Variable Total cases N\u00bc159Residents N\u00bc72 Cases LTCF, median (range) 10 (5 e39) 6 (2 e28) 6 (2 e16) Age (years), median (range) 66 (17 e107) 82 (21 e107) 34 (17 e72) Race/ethnicity White, non-Hispanic 91 (57.2%) 52 41 1 (0.6%) 0 1 (1.4%) Hispanic/Latino 3 (1.9%) 0 3 (4.2%) Not reported 62 (39.0%) 35 (40.2%) 27 (37.5%) Gender Male 37 (23.3%) 28 9 (12.5%) Female 118 (74.2%) 59 (55.2%) Not performed 131 (82.4%) 61 70 (70.8%)Not reported 3 (1.9%) 1 (1.2%) 2 (2.8%) Type of vaccine received Moderna (61.0%) (35.4%) (40.0%) (17.6%) severity Symptomatic Yes 110 (69.2%) 55 (63.2%) 55 (76.4%) No 34 (21.4%) 21 (18.1%)Not reported 15 (13.6%) 11 (12.6%) (5.6%) Yes (10.1%) 1 140 69 (79.3%) 71 (98.6%)Not reported 3 (1.9%) (3.5%) Death 9 150 78 (89.7%) long-term care facility. aFully vaccinated is dened as at least two weeks post receiving their primary series of COVID-19 vaccines. bPartially vaccinated is dened as <14 days since completing the primary series or did not complete the series.C.C. Bennett et al. / Journal of Hospital Infection 134 (2023) 7 e10 8Methods Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) dened an LTCF outbreak as /C211 conrmed case among resi- dents or staff in a facility where no conrmed cases weredetected during the four-week period prior to the week cases were identied. During April 22 thto July 29th, 2021, at least 178 LTCFs reported active or recently resolved COVID-19 outbreaksacross Missouri, totalling 482 cases among residents and staff. To provide a snapshot into the evolving Delta variant out- breaks, the Missouri DHSS identied facilities with the highestburden of disease out of the 178 outbreaks. Data were com-piled on 11 facilities by DHSS and administrators of LTCFs and referred to a team of epidemiologists and data analysts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19response. After data cleaning, an analysis was performed on de- identied data from 10 facilities that included demographicinformation, positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or antigen test results, vaccination status, and genomic sequen- ces of positive samples. Cases with a specimen collection dateduring April 22 ndto July 29th, 2021, were identied through antigen point-of-care testing and/or laboratory-based PCR testing. Administrators at the LTCFs reported whether personsidentied as cases were symptomatic and their associatedoutcomes, including hospitalizations and deaths. For this investigation, breakthrough cases were dened as residents or staff who completed their primary series of vaccination at least14 days prior to receiving a positive COVID-19 test result. Per- sons who were partially vaccinated did not receive the last dose<14 days or complete the primary series before testing positive. c2-Testing in SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute) compared differences in disease severity among vaccinated and unvac- cinated (did not receive any COVID-19 vaccine) cases. The CDC team was invited during the assessment window by Missouri DHSS and LTCF administrators to visit Missouri LTCFs with active COVID-19 outbreaks. Two facilities were identiedand selected by Missouri DHSS based on LTCF staff availability,severity of outbreak, and location. Both facilities were locatedin rural areas with a seven-day rolling average in the com- munity of /C21100 new cases per 100,000 population during the week that the case was rst identied [ 5]. The team conducted semi-structured interviews with facility administrators tounderstand infection prevention and control and other miti-gation measures, strategies being utilized to increase vaccine uptake, and other factors that may have contributed to the observed outbreaks. These activities were reviewed by CDCand conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy (see, for example, 45 C F R. part 46, 21 C F R. part 56; 42 USC . x241(d); 5 U S C. x552a; 44 U S C. x3501). Results and discussion During April 22ndto July 29th, 2021, 159 COVID-19 cases were reported from 10 LTCFs (median: 10; range: 5 e39 per LTCF) (Table I ). The facilities had a total of 560 residents and 858 staff and experienced 87 (54.7%) cases among residents and 72 (45.3%) cases among staff. The median age of cases was 66 years (82 years for residents and 34 years for staff). Themajority of residents and staff identied as non-Hispanic White(59.8% and 56.9%) and female (55.2% and 81.9%). Due to resource constraints, genomic sequencing was only conducted on 28 specimens from four of the LTCFs; all of which identiedDelta as the infecting variant. Through testing and contact tracing efforts, staff members were identied as possible index patients in these four LTCFs and in four of the other facilities,or 80% of high-burden outbreaks. Eighty-two (51.6%) cases occurred among fully vaccinated individuals: 65 (74.7.%) residents and 17 (23.6%) staff. Suchbreakthrough cases were reported from nine of the 10 LTCFs. They occurred on average 122 days (range: 36 e168) or four months after completion of a two-dose vaccine series. Thissuggests that there may have been waning immunity amongsome of the breakthrough cases as it was later established that being up to date with COVID-19 vaccines is critical for pre- venting waning immunity in persons [ 6]. Fifty-one (70.8%) staff cases were not vaccinated, and vaccination coverage was low among all ages. DHSS noted that vaccines were available andTable II Disease severity of infected persons by vaccination status among staff and residents in 10 long-term care facilities with higher burden COVID-19 outbreaks in Missouri during the Delta variant surge, April 22ndto July 29th, 2021 ( N\u00bc151)a Variable Total cases vaccinated 16 e 9 (17.7%) (17.7%) Missing (7.3%) 9 (11.0%) 2 (11.1%) 9 (13.9%) 3 (5.9%) 0 (12.2%) 4 (22.2%) 10 (15.4%) 0.55 1 64 69 14 (77.8%) 52 (80.0%) e 50 (98.0%) 17 (100.0%) e Missing 0 3 (3.7%) 0 3 (4.6%) 0 0 Died Yes 4 (5.8%) 5 (6.1%) 4 (22.2%) 5 (7.7%) 0.08 0 0 No 65 (94.2%) 77 (93.9%) 14 (77.8%) 60 (92.3%) e 51 (100.0%) 17 (100.0%) e Missing 0 0 0 0 0 0 aEight cases with partial or unknown vaccination status were not included in the table. bc2-Test.C.C.

Overall, only ve (3.1%) cases were par- tially vaccinated: three (3.4%) residents and two (2.8%) staff. The majority of infected staff (55, 76.4%) reported symp- toms; the only staff case who was hospitalized was unvacci- nated and no deaths were reported ( Table II ). A higher proportion of hospitalizations and deaths occurred amongresident cases compared to staff, demonstrating younger age as a predominant factor against COVID-19-related outcomes [7]. Among residents, 10 (15.4%) hospitalizations and ve (7.7%) deaths occurred among those fully vaccinated, while four (22.2%) hospitalizations and four (22.2%) deaths occurred among those who were not vaccinated. Though the differencesin rates of hospitalizations and death among vaccinated and non-vaccinated residents were not statistically signicant, risk reduction of severe disease in vaccinated persons compared tounvaccinated persons has been well established [ 8,9]. Among partially vaccinated cases, one resident was hospitalized and no deaths occurred. The CDC team visited two of the 10 facilities included in the investigation. Staff at these two LTCFs anecdotally described limited staff compliance with CDC-recommended community mitigation measures, particularly inconsistent or absent maskuse outside of the workplace in public spaces. However, the visited LTCFs reported implementing facility-level mitigation measures, including routine testing and required masking.During the outbreaks, both facilities reported testing all staff and residents twice per week using rapid antigen tests to identify infected persons. In one facility, several staff wereobserved not wearing masks, or wearing them improperly (e.g. under the chin or with some straps not worn as intended) by three observers during the CDC site visits. Both facilitiesrestricted communal activities during outbreaks; one facilityallowed non-infected residents and staff to eat in a common area to facilitate food service amid stafng shortages. One facility reported educating staff and residents on the benetsand potential side-effects of COVID-19 vaccines. Neither facility mandated vaccination due to extreme stafng short- ages and concerns about losing staff should such a policy beimplemented. The ndings in this report are subject to several limitations. First, this analysis was limited to case data collected during afour-month period because of limited staff capacity. LTCFswere not able to collect and submit data on associated non- infected persons. Second, data on characteristics of sympto- matic disease and underlying medical conditions were incom-plete, precluding more detailed analyses of these features. Third, contact-tracing efforts varied per LTCF, and genomic sequencing was not available for all infected persons; thus,there is limited evidence to link residents to staff members, and vice versa. Finally, adherence to infection prevention and control measures was not assessed systematically. In conclusion, during the Delta variant surge among LTCFs in Missouri, vaccination rates varied between staff cases and resident cases in those facilities with high-burden outbreaks.Differences were identied in mitigation practices in at leasttwo facilities. Prevention measures noted in this study can help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and limit transmission [ 10].Whereas this study occurred during the Delta variant surge, the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant produced another surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections among residents and staff in LTCFs [ 9]. As COVID-19 variants of concern emerge, appropriate use of available prevention measures will benet these populations [ 9,10].
