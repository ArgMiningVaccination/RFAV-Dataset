Naturopathic Medicine is Alternative / Holistic Medicine. The main goal with Naturopathic Medicine is to address the root cause of the your health issues and symptoms, as opposed to just treating or bandaging the symptoms superficially. Once the root cause is identified through a comprehensive intake and physical examination along with a physiological assessment, if need be, using scientifically accurate testing methods for general health, nutrient, hormonal, gut health status. Treatment is suggested based on the cause of the disease or imbalance. The naturopathic approach uses the true healing nature of natural therapies such as [nutrition, diet](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/nutrition-and-diet-counselling.html), [acupuncture](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/acupuncture/toronto-acupuncture-centre.html), supplements, vitamins, herbs, and other healing therapies to treat the underlying root cause, which in turn, resolves the superficial symptoms, and also helps improve and optimize your health and wellbeing. Here is an example of how Naturopathic Medicine differs from Traditional Medicine. For a skin condition like [eczema](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/eczema/eczema-overview.html) - as opposed to just treating eczema superficially with a variety of creams to suppress the immune reaction, naturopathic treatment would be based on addressing the underlying root cause of the eczema - [Allergies](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/allergies/toronto-allergy-centre.html) and a dysfunctional immune system. Once these are addressed with natural therapies, the eczema quite often clears outs very effectively and without the use of medicated creams which can quite often cause side effects with long term use without addressing the root cause of the symptoms. What Are The Benefits Of Naturopathic Medicine? The benefits to using Naturopathic Medicine are plain and simple: - Address and Treat the Root Cause of the symptoms - Improve your health and well-being naturally - Self awareness and education of how one's body works and how imbalances can effect the body. - Prevent Illness and Disease by fostering a healthy lifestyle and reducing risk of chronic and degenerative diseases such as diabetes and heart disease - Individualized health care. [Treatments are highly individualized](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/your-first-naturopathic-visit.html) and based on improving and and optimizing the person's wellbeing - physically, mentally and emotionally, as opposed to a one treatment fits all approach. So is Naturopathic Medicine the right choice for you? If you are looking to improve your over health and wellness, take charge of your wellbeing and want to prevent disease long term - then Naturopathic Medicine is the perfect choice for you. [Naturopathic medicine](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/naturopathic-medicine-overview.html) is alternative or complementary medicine that treats various health ailments with [natural therapies](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/naturopathic-services-and-testing.html). Naturopathic care of asthma, [eczema](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/eczema/naturopathic-approach-to-treating-eczema.html) and [allergies](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/allergies/treatment-for-allergies.html#Naturopathic) is based on healing the symptom as well as identifying [the cause of the allergies](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/allergies/toronto-allergy-centre.html), asthma or eczema. Naturopathic doctors usually work to treat the root cause of the problem or symptoms, be it asthma, eczema or allergies. Natural treatments from a naturopathic doctor for eczema and asthma are based on first identifying what the person is allergic to and eliminating that item from the diet or environment if possible. With naturopathic treatments, along with diet changes, various herbs and supplements are also used to improve the overall health of the person and rebalancing an overactive / dysfunctional immune system, which usually causes the symptoms of sneezing, itching, runny nose and eyes, and rashes. In most cases that are treated with naturopathic medicine, we find that the symptoms improve tremendously and become a thing of the past as the individual adopts a healthier lifestyle and balances their immune system. [As a naturopath](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/meet-our-therapists.html), my approach to treating asthma or eczema has always been to [first get to the root of the problem](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/your-first-naturopathic-visit.html), and that usually involves [testing for allergies](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/allergies/diagnostic-testing-for-allergies.html) to various allergens, once that has been established, I usually treat by modifying the diet and use additional nutrient or herbal supplements if necessary and generally the outcome has been great in terms of resolving the health issue.

Natural medicine or [naturopathic medicine or naturopathy](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-medicine/naturopathic-medicine-overview.html) is a distinct system of health care that encompasses various [natural healing therapies](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/naturopathic-services.htm) to treat symptoms as well treat the root cause of the symptoms, and in doing so strengthening the overall body and immune function. Naturopathic medicine is an umbrella term that includes various other natural health modalities such as traditional Chinese medicine, [acupuncture](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/acupuncture/toronto-acupuncture-centre.html), [massage](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/massage/toronto-massage-centre.html), among others. [Naturopathic Doctors](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/meet-our-therapists.html) do place emphasis on getting to the root cause of the problem before treating it, as the only way to really resolve a symptom, is to first get to the cause and then treat it. Naturopathic medicine has been around for centuries, and been addressed as many things, however, it is what our forefathers used to heal their health before allopathic medicine came in. I quite often get asked the following question: [what is the difference between a naturopath and a homeopath or a nutritionist](https://www.naturesintentionsnaturopathy.com/faq.html)? So here is the answer: Naturopathic medicine encompasses both homeopathy and nutrition, among other therapies, so when we as naturopaths treat clients, its a more holistic approach based on our length of study and experience. Naturopathic Doctors generally study for up to 8 years (with undergrad studies) and are exposed to various healing modalities in their training, including lots of training in laboratory diagnosis, pathology and pharmacology, along with an internship. Natural medicine is much more gentle on the body - as it is focused to bringing back the optimum balance of the body, rather than just treating the symptoms, but remember, its important to get good quality help- when seeking out a natural medicine \"healer\"/ therapist as opposed to seeing just anyone. Naturopathic Doctors are very well educated in using natural therapeutics for healing and hence are highly sought after.
