One is traditional medicine. This is the type of medicine that utilizes medical doctors and chemical medicines to treat conditions and diseases. The other is alternative medicine, also sometimes called complementary medicine. What is alternative medicine? It is any type of medicine that doesn't fall under the umbrella of traditional medicine. Another definition for alternative medicine is any medicine that is not accepted by medical doctors. This type of medicine is sometimes called integrative medicine as well. The earliest record of alternative medicine being used dates back to the 18th century. It originated from Germany and was referred to as homeopathy. Homeopathy believes that the more dilute a substance is the better it is at helping a person heal. The field of alternative medicine continued to grow through the 19th century with more and more treatment methods being discovered such as those in traditional Chinese medicine. By the time the 20th century rolled around, alternative medicine began to be practiced less and less as there were advances and new drugs being made. Which part of the world a person is in determines which practices and treatments are considered traditional or alternative throughout history. Now in the 21st century, alternative medicine is beginning to make a comeback. It is not to the point where it is used more than traditional medicine, but it is becoming accepted more than it was in the previous century. Mainstream medicine focuses more on using drugs and surgeries to treat conditions and diseases. It is based on a more scientific approach to treatments. The treatments usually focus on one specific part of the body and the conditions affecting it. Alternative medicine focuses more on the body as a whole. It only uses naturally occurring herbs rather using manufactured drugs. It is not scientifically based or proven to be effective which is why it is not more widely accepted for the treatment of conditions and diseases. Alternative medicine focuses more on making the body able to heal itself from any ailments. The belief behind alternative medicine is that it is better to maintain health than to have to treat conditions, and it is thought that the body will stay healthy or return to health if optimal conditions in the body are met. Numerous styles and types of alternative medicine exist. They are all based on their own theories for the best way to maintain or return the body to perfect health. These will be discussed below. Mind-body techniques are a form of alternative medicine that focuses on the connection between the mind and body. The theory behind these techniques is that they are working to help put the mind and body back in sync with each other. The belief is that by putting them back in sync, then the mind will be better able to control the body. The other belief is that making the mind able to control the body means that it can tell the body how to heal itself when it is sick or hurt. This means that outside substances would not be needed to help the body heal. Some mind-body techniques include doing yoga, meditating, and doing Tai Chi. There aren't any risk factors for practicing mind-body techniques. Research has shown that there are many benefits of doing mind-body techniques. The biologically based practices are based on the theory that the body can be healed based on what is put into it. One of the beliefs is that the body can get or stay healthy by simply eating certain foods while avoiding other foods. Another belief is that a person can determine what is out of balance as far as natural chemicals in the body, and replacing those will return the body to health. The other belief is that the body can be healed using plant compounds rather than manufactured chemical compounds. Some examples of biologically based practices are a restricted diet, the use of botanicals, and taking naturally occurring [dietary supplements](https://study.com/learn/lesson/dietary-supplements-examples-abuse-uses.html). The main risk here comes in with the dietary supplements. They are not actually dosed the way manufactured medicines are. This means a person can end up taking too much of a supplement and make the condition of the body worse. Whole medical systems are total systems for treating the body that are based on their own set of beliefs about the body and disease. Each whole medical system is based on different beliefs and there is no one set of beliefs for whole medical systems in general. For instance, there is one whole medical system that is based on the belief that like cures like while another whole medical system is based on the belief that diseases only happen because there is an imbalance in the body's life force. The main risk factors here are that these whole medical systems are usually trying to address something that cannot be measured or observed so they may not be as effective as other treatments would be. A few examples of whole medical systems are naturopathy, Ayurveda, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Manipulative and Body-Based Practices are practices of making changes to the body by putting it in different positions or manipulating it externally. The belief is that the manipulations or other changes made to the body will help to make built-up toxins leave the body. The other belief is that it will cause the body's energy to increase and this will facilitate healing. The main risk here is that some of the manipulations could be done incorrectly and a person can get injured. Some of the practices can also cause bruising to occur. Some examples of manipulative and body-based practices include reflexology, cupping, and chiropractic care. Energy therapies are the therapies based on changing or influencing the universal life force believed to be in and surrounding the body. The belief is that by manipulating the life force in and surrounding the body, that the energy inside the body will shift and the body will be healed. The other belief is that external energy sources can be used to change the body and heal it. There also is a belief that there are biofields or energy fields around the body, that can be changed to cause healing. There are minimal risk factors with these therapies since very little contact, if any, happens to the body. Some examples include reiki, magnets, and Qi gong. Since there are so many techniques and practices to choose from for alternative medicine, it may be difficult for a person to decide which one is right for them. It may help to know a little bit of information about a handful of them. Some choices include: Alternative medicine, or complementary medicine is any practice of medicine that doesn't fall under the umbrella of traditional medicine. It started in the 18th century with homeopathy, which believes that more dilute substances help a person heal better and now involves many different styles and types. The types are as follows: Acupuncture is the use of very fine needles to heal the body. Chiropractic care is the manipulation of the spine to heal the body. Naturopathy is using the body's natural ability to heal itself. Biofeedback is the use of an electronic device to teach the mind how to control the body.
