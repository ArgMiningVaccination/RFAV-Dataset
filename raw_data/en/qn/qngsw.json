Summary iv Summary Malaria is major public health problem in Tanzania and increasing trends have been observed in the last two decades. A significant consequence of repeated malaria infections in high transmission areas is anaemia in very young children. The control of malaria in Tanzania includes both preventive and curative strategies. On the preventive side insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) are a promising tool. ITNs have been shown to be effective in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality in controlled trials. Large -scale implementation of the technology is currently being initiated in many African countries. We report the impact of a large social marketing programme of ITNs on malaria morbidity through a series of studies, in a population of about 55,000 people in Tanzania. The ITNs socia l marketing programme resulted in a rapid increase in any net ownership (from 58 to 83%) and an increase in ITNs ownership (from 10 to 61%) in children under two years of age within 2 years of implementation. As a result the overall mean haemoglobin levels increased (from 8.0 to 8.9 g/dl) in the study children during the successive surveys. The prevalence of anaemia in the study population decreased from 49% to 26%. Comparison between children with ITNs and those without nets showed that ITNs had a protecti ve efficacy of 63% (95% CI: 38 to 77) on the prevalence of parasitaemia, and 63% (95% CI: 27 to 82) on anaemia (haemoglobin 8 g/dl). These results endorse the wide scale implementation of ITNs in Tanzania . ITNs can only reduce the risk of malaria dis ease but cannot eliminate it. Hence, appropriate effective treatment is required. Chloroquine is a cheap and safe antimalarial and it was until recently the first line drug of choice in the National Malaria Treatment Policy. Resistance to chloroquine has b een reported with increasing frequency in Tanzania and has been linked to the increasing admissions with severe disease in hospitals. A comparative randomised, open clinical trial of chloroquine against Co -artem (fixed combination of Artemether + Benflu metol) an alternative new antimalarial, showed seven -day parasitological cure rates of 94% for Co-artem and only 35% for chloroquine. Generally, Co-artem showed a superior clearance rate, successfully cleared higher parasite densities and suppressed new infections Summary v over a longer period of time. Furthermore, Co -artem suppressed more effectively gametocytes in these children, indicating a potential benefit for reducing malaria transmission. The unacceptably high chloroquine failure rates call for an urgent review of the National Malaria Treatment Guidelines. The decision to change the first line antimalarial and the choice of a new drug depend on a number of factors that include the clinical, epidemiological and social -economical factors, as well as the he alth infrastructure. Considering all of these dimensions, sulphadoxine - pyrimenthamine (SP) was identified as a good interim replacement for chloroquine. Further Phase IV evaluation of Co -artem and other combination therapy regimens are required before con sidering their inclusion in the national treatment policy. Much work is also needed to identify suitable compounds to be used for home management of malaria, within the national treatment guidelines. Experience gained with these studies gives a descripti on of the different methodologies and tools that can be used to evaluate different components of the National Malaria Control Programme. For example, it was difficult to assess the impact of the ITNs programme using the case -control approach. Repeated cros s-sectional assessments were found to be more suitable for assessing the impact of ITNs under programme conditions, especially on malaria - related anaemia in this area of high transmission. Specific indicators for programme evaluation may need to be identif ied for specific interventions. These may be different from the ones used in randomised controlled trials. The use of molecular markers for monitoring and evaluation of antimalarial intervention programmes illustrate the need to develop and validate novel tools and approaches for programme evaluation. Better malaria control is expected by combining ITNs and an effective antimalarial, especially combination therapy. The evaluation, implementation, and monitoring of all these control activities requires a partnership between researchers, policy makers, health managers, in close collaboration with other stakeholders in the public and private domain, including the beneficiaries - the community.

In 1997, more than 40% of the world population lived in areas with a risk of malaria trasmission. Furthermore, in the last few decades there has been a resurgence of ma laria transmission in areas where it was previously under control in the Central Europe, Southern Asia and the Pacific (Trigg & Chondrachine 1998). Malaria contributes to a considerable burden in endemic communities with premature deaths, disability from i llness and it impedes on social and economic development. Each year about 300 million episodes of clinical malaria disease and about one million malaria deaths occur in the world (WHO 1999). The majority (90%) of the burden of disease is in Sub -Saharan Af rica. It is estimated that malaria contributes to a loss of 39 million disability -adjusted life years (DALYS), of which 34 million are in Africa alone (WHO 1999). The problem of malaria is also increasing in Africa. In parts of Eastern and Southern Africa malaria has extended into previously non -endemic or low transmission areas. The climatic conditions existing in many parts of Sub -Saharan Africa favour high malaria transmission potential (Snow et al. 1999). Furthermore, Plasmodium falciparum is the predo minant parasite species, and it is associated with high virulence, severe morbidity and high mortality. In Tanzania, malaria accounted for about 33% of all outpatient attendance and hospital admissions in 1996 and it is the leading cause of deaths (34%) in hospital admissions in children under five years (MOH 1998). Health facility reports indicate that there are an increasing number of admitted cases of malaria since 1982 (Kilama & Kihamia 1991, MOH 1998). Reliable data on mortality burden caused by the disease are not available as most deaths occur at home and there is no adequate vital event registration system in place Chapter 1: Introduction 3 (Kitange et al. 1996, Snow et al. 1999). Demographic surveillance data from Morogoro rural district indicate that malaria is a major ca use of death in children and even among adults (Kitange et al. 1996). Plasmodium falciparum is the main parasite species in Tanzania and it accounts for more than 90% of all infections. Other malaria species found are P. ovale and P. malariae . These frequently occur as mixed infections with P. falciparum . P. vivax is very rare in Tanzania (Kilama & Kihamia 1991). Malaria transmission in Tanzania has been described by Clyde (1967) as a sea of stable and high transmission with islands of low or no transmi ssion, especially at high altitudes (Fig1). Estimates of population at risk in Tanzania indicate that 28 million people live in malaria endemic areas, 1.3 million in epidemic malaria areas and only about 0.6 million in very low risk areas (MARA/ARMA: http: /www.mrc.ac.za/maracrt). The main vectors are Anopheles gambie complex and Anopheles funestus . The climatic and environmental factors favour the existence of an abundance of these vectors resulting in high vectorial capacity for malaria transmission. This makes malaria control difficult in many areas of Tanzania. The burden of malaria and the consequence of the disease in the health of the population has been characterised in detail in an area in the Kilombero valley, Southwest Tanzania (Tanner et al. 1991). It has been estimated that on average there are about 0.7 and 0.6 episodes per child per year of clinical malaria and severe anaemia in children under five years living in the area (Menendez et al. 1997) . Chapter 1: Introduction 4 Figur e 1: Distribution of stable malaria transmission in Tanzania (source: MARA/ARMA Collaboration) Chapter 1: Introduction 5 It is widely accepted that transmission intensity influences the prevalence and incidence of malaria infection and associated c omplications. Severe anaemia and cerebral malaria are the two major forms of severe disease leading to death. It has been observed that in areas of lower transmission the incidence of clinical disease is much more spread out in early childhood and cerebral malaria predominates as severe disease presentation. In areas of high transmission, the burden of morbidity and mortality is concentrated in the very young children and is much less in older children and adults. This is due mainly to early acquisition of functional immunity to clinical disease. In these areas severe anaemia predominates as the severe disease presentation (Marsh & Snow 1999, Schellenberg et al. 1999) . These differences in cerebral versus anaemia patterns may therefore be important in monitoring changes of transmission intensity over time and may be valuable indicators for assessing impact of control measures. Several studies have shown a positive correlation between parasitaemia and anaemia, and further demonstrated that parasitaemia is the primary cause of anaemia in very young children in Afri ca (Kitua et al . 1997, Newton et al . 1997) . The pathogenesis of malarial anaemia is complex and includes the pr ocess of haemolysis, sequestration of red cells, and dyserythropoiesis (Weatherall & Abdalla 1982) . Malarial anaemia may develop rapidly following an acute malaria attack or may develop insidiously over a period of time; many patients fall in between these two extremes (Abdalla et al. 1980) . The emergence and spread of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarials has exacerbated the problem of anaemia in Sub -Saharan Africa, since persisting parasites contribute to the occurrence of anaemia (Bloland et al . 1993) . In the Kilombero, 60% of children treated with chloroquine (the recommended first line antimalarial), fail to respond within 14 days (Hatz et al. 1998). Hospital management of the severe forms anaemia invo lves blood transfusion (Newton et al. 1997 , Schellenberg et al. 1999) and there is a n increasing concern that the transfusions are a potential risk for HIV transmission in children (Greenberg et al. 1988 , Holzer et al. 1993) . In addition, most children at risk of severe anaemia live beyond reach of hospitals able to provide such blood transfusions (Font & Nathan, unpublished data). Furthermore, severe anaemia is a silent dise ase that is less recognised in the community and therefore not easily treated (Menendez et al. 1997) . Hence, there is an Chapter 1: Introduction 6 urgent need to implement effective malaria control strategies in the Kilombero valley and Tanzani a as whole. Malaria control strategies The World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified malaria as a priority health issue in the world and initiated the Roll Back Malaria Cabinet Project (RBM) in 1998. In this new initiative the WHO, United Nations Chi ldren's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank (WB) and various collaborators join forces to fight malaria. RBM aims at achiving a 50% reduction of the malaria burden by 2010. The initiative has identified six elements to ac hieve the objective: (1) early detection of malaria illness, (2) rapid treatment of those who are ill, (3) multiple means for prevention of infection, (4) strengthening of health sector and intersectorial activities, (5) a powerful sustained social involve ment and movement, and (6) focused research for new tools and better implementation (Nabaro 1999). These main elements are an elaboration of the basic elements of the global malaria control strategy devised in 1993. The main strategy for malaria control is still early diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases (WHO 1993). Since, the increasing incidence of antimalarial drug resistance is undermining the effectiveness of this strategy, alternative cost -effective and sustainable control measures are urgently r equired. Malaria prevention strategies in Tanzania Environmental modification to control the scourge of malaria in Tanzania has a long history. In the 50's several programmes were implemented in the more populated urban areas (mainly Dar-es salaam and Za nzibar). But this is only feasible in urban areas and requires functional administrative and implementation structures (Kilama 1991). People in urban areas use several mosquito repellent measures, including aerosol insecticides and mosquito coils. In rural areas those who can afford use these insecticides and many more use more traditional preventive measures, such as burning of leaves. These mosquito repellent measures have doubtful benefits in preventing malaria. In semi -immune population chemoprophylaxis with effective antimalarials is only recommended for pregnant women (WHO 1984). Chemoprophylaxis in children is not recommended for fears of interference with the development of protective immunity and the acceleration of drug resistance. Furthermore, it Chapter 1: Introduction 7 may be impossible to achieve continuous suppression in a significant proportion of the population and it may then be better to use the scarce resources for treatment. Malaria vaccines will go a long way in reducing the burden of malaria in people in endemi c areas, especially children. However, there is limited hope for a vaccine in the near future. A recent trial of SPf66 in infants in Tanzania did not show any protection (Acosta et al. 1999). Vector control by insecticides has been implemented in both urb an and rural areas in Tanzania. In rural areas, the Pare -Taveta project in Northeast Tanzania was the most elaborated control effort. Spraying of households was conducted from 1955 to 1959 and the impact of these control measures was monitored (Bradley 199 1). Both urban and rural spraying programmes were successful in reducing the burden of malaria in short periods. In the Pare -Taveta project, the infant mortality rate was reduced by about 20% and haemoglobin levels increased about 26% during the interventi on period, compared to before the intervention (Bradley 1991). Unfortunately, problems in sustaining the spraying in these areas clearly demonstrated the difficulties of such a strategy. The programmes required high financial and human resource inputs, wh ich could not possibly be maintained. These were mainly \"vertical\" programme with specialised spraying teams and had limited community involvement, hence there was also a growing reluctance of the population to co -operate with the spraying activities. Alth ough transmission was significantly reduced in the programmes, it was not interrupted. Currently, preventive malaria control is being re -considered using insecticide treated nets (ITNs), including treated bed nets and curtains, which do not require a lar ge national programme infrastructure for implementation. Studies in Muheza indicate that ITNs have similar efficacy to indoor spraying and are cheaper to implement (Curtis et al. 1998). ITNs in Tanzania The use of protective measure similar to bed nets ca n be traced to traditional behaviours in some tribes in Tanzania. Examples are the use of 'MTUTI', a sleeping bag made of thatched palm leaves in the Rufiji delta (Mayombana et al. unpublished data) or the use of nets made of cloth 'baba kalala wapi' in th e Kilombero Valley (Minja H. pers. Comm). Only a small proportion of people in the Kilombero Valley used bed nets in the 1980's and early 1990's Chapter 1: Introduction 8 (Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo 1998). The main reason for using bed nets in this setting was protection against mosquito nuisance rather than protection against malaria disease. The treatment of these bed nets with insecticide is a revival of an old idea that was started in the Second World War with the treatment of soldiers' uniforms to prevent malaria and other vector bo rne diseases (Lindsay & Gibson 1988). The ITNs act by both being a physical barrier protecting those sleeping under them, and by killing and repelling mosquitoes hence reducing their survival and infection rates (Lines 1996) . Hence those using ITNs properly have a reduced exposure to malaria infecting mosquitoes and as a conseque nce have a reduced malaria disease burden. Different types of insecticide on the net have been shown to have slightly different killing and repellency effects although they mostly belong to the class of synthetic pyrethroids (Curtis et al. 1996) After the initial success in experimental hut trials (Lines et al. 1987) and small scale studies, large trials were implemented in Tanzania as in many other parts of Africa (Premji et al. . 1995). Large randomised controlled trials were also conducted in many parts of Africa to establish the efficacy of ITNs in reducing morbidity and mortality. A summary of the results of these randomised controlled trials showed an average protective effect on mild malaria episodes of 46% in stable malaria areas when controls did not use nets, and a protective effect of 37% when controls used untreated nets. Moreover, protective effects were shown on the prevalence of high parasitaemia (31%). A modest improvement in packed cell volume (2%) and weight gain was also observed in children sleeping under treated nets (Lenge ler, 1998) . Most importantly, the regular use of ITNs under trial conditions prevents approximately 6 deaths for every 1000 children protected every year across a large range of transmission intensities. Hence, there was a recent call by African leaders t o protect 60% of African children by 2005 and large -scale pilot programmes are underway in several areas in Africa (Anonymous 1999). Chapter 1: Introduction 9 ITNs implementation strategy The translations of promising research results into effective public health action, is a hu ge task. There are at least 60 million children living in areas at risk for malaria in Africa and their nets, once provided, will need to be treated regularly (every 6 -12 months) over many years (although there is currently hope for development of permanen tly treated nets). Various options for financing and implementation of ITNs have been tried, most of them on a relatively small scale (up to 10 villages). There are three main traditional implementation models (Feilden 1996): (1) the integration of ITNs di stribution into a community pharmacy network (eg. the Bamako initiative programme in western Kenya: Hill (1991)), (2) sales through local health units (eg. Fraser -Hurt and Lyimo 1998) or the existing PHC system (D'Alessandro et al. 1995), and (3) distribu tion through community groups (eg. Premji et al. 1995). Despite these various programmes which contributed much useful operational experience, we do not yet have sufficient experience to recommend specific large -scale ITNs implementation strategies for al l the varied social, cultural and economic conditions in Africa. Hence, launching a number of large programmes (population of over 100,000) using different pragmatic approaches will allow locally -relevant implementation approaches to be found. Social mark eting is a flexible implementation model that has proved successful in resource - poor countries for interventions such as oral rehydration salts (ORS) and condoms. In this approach commercial marketing methods are applied to a product which has a social b enefit, with the main motivation being social improvement rather than financial gain to the marketer (Andreasen 1986, BASICS 1998). Much attention is paid to the main target group (i.e. for malaria: children and pregnant women) and much effort goes into un derstanding the perception, knowledge, attitudes and practices of this group in order to optimise promotion and distribution. Social marketing entails an effective public -private partnership which may be particularly useful for ITNs: unlike drugs and vacci nes, ITNs may be seen as a commercial commodity rather than a medical product. Social marketing of ITNs has recently been started in various African countries, for example the Central African Republic (in 1996), Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya and Zimbabwe. Chapter 1: Introduction 10 Lastly, the social marketing programmes are also not large enough to allow coverage of whole countries. Hence, different strategies for up -scaling the implementation to national scale need to be developed involving public -private partnerships. Impact of ITNs under programme conditions It is still unclear whether social marketing can be used to distribute ITNs in the community while retaining the benefits of the nets seen in randomised control trials. Usually one can not assume that the results of the controll ed trials are directly translated or replicated in programme settings (Lengeler & Snow 1996). Experience with the Gambian national bed net programme that concentrated on treatment of already available bed nets showed that the coverage, compliance and perce ntage re -treatment of the nets were well below the level achieved in an earlier controlled trial. The estimated impact on overall mortality was only 25% (D'Alessandro et al.1995) as compared to 42% in the earlier controlled trial (Alonso et al. 1991). Moreover, it is not known what impact the pattern of distribution will have on the occurrence of disease in the community. Earlier work indicated that there are short range (within the same room) protective effects of ITNs on unprotected people sleeping nea rby (Lines et al. 1987) but this has not been shown everywhere (Rowland et al . 1996) . Work conducted in Ghana supports the claims of short distance protective effects on those without bed n ets. Among non-users the mortality risk increased by 6.7% with every 100 meters shift away from the nearest compound with treated bed nets (Binka et al. 1998) . More recent work in Kenya indicated the presence of a 'mass effec t' due to ITNs that confers protection to nearby non - users. While this spatial phenomenon is very important from the public health point of view, it also has bearing on the estimated effectiveness of ITNs in programme evaluations. If deflection of mosquito es to those without ITNs occur, with a resulting increase of disease in this group (Rowland et al . 1996) , then there will be an overestimation of the protective effectiveness. On the other hand, if the killing effect is predominant with a reduced risk for those near the ITNs (Lines et al. 1987) then the measured effect will be biased toward zero, as has been demonstrated in some areas (Binka et al. 1998, Howard et al. 2000) . Further to these distance effects, coverage was also shown to be an important parameter as the efficacy was observed to be highest with high compliance. The distribution pattern and coverage Chapter 1: Introduction 11 levels attained in these programmes may determine the level of protection observed in those who use them (Binka et al. 1998) Treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania The use of ITNs as a preventive measure is not going to interrupt transmission in many of the areas in Africa and therefore cannot eliminate the need for effective treatment of cases. Indeed after the collapse of the few major preventive programmes in the 1950 and 60's, early diagnosis and prompt treatment with an effective antimalarial was adopted as th e main stay of the control effort in most African countries (WHO 1993). However, the implementation of this strategy also faces many challenges. Most people who fall sick with malaria -like symptoms are given antimalarial drugs stored at home and frequently in sub -optimal or incorrect drug dosage (Mwenesi et al. 1995, Nyamongo 1999, Nsimba et al. 1999). Many factors contribute to the preference for shops and drug stores rather than existing health services. These include lack of drugs in public sector facili ties and convenience. There are more shops and drug stores than health facilities, and they may be more easily accessible, in terms of time to reach them, time spent waiting for service, and opening times. There are concerns that the wide scale use of antimalarial drugs encourages the development and spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistance and threatens the effectiveness of the early diagnosis and treatment strategy in many parts of the world. Resistance to chloroquine, the cheap and safe antimalaria l, has been reported with increasing frequency in Tanzania (Kilimali & Mkufya 1985a, 1985b, Mshinda et al . 1996). Work conducted as part of the National malaria control programme, showed that on average half of the children treated with chloroquine ended u p with inadequate clinical response within 14 days (Figure 2). The work also demonstrated the presence of resistance at a lower level of the second line drug Sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (MOH 1999).

For malaria, treatment -seeking behaviour patterns vary a great deal, with constant interchange between formal and traditional providers. Studies in Ifakara and Rufiji found that only a quarter of the mothers and caretakers came back for re-treatment, if there was no improvement after initial treatment at a formal health facility (Bjorkman 1991, Muela - Hausmann et al. 1998). Treatment failure increases the risk of development of complicated malaria, with convulsive episodes in children or severe anaemia. Perceptions of malaria disease severity vary and they reflect the perceptions of effectiveness of different treatments and services (Snow et al. 1992, Mwenesi 1995, Nsimba et al. 1999). Convulsive illness ( degedege ) is often regarded as a separate disease, for which traditional healers are considered to be a superior source of care (Makemba et al. 1996, Mwenesi et al. 1995, Minja et al. 2000). Perceptions of disease causation are of significance also for uptake of other interventions inclu ding ITNs (Minja et al. 2000). Different levels of health care necessitate the consideration of the choice of drugs to be promoted at particular level. The wide availability of chloroquine for home treatment was advantageous in facilitating early treatmen t but its indiscriminate use has lead to rapid rise of resistance. The reliance on presumptive treatment rather than diagnostic microscopy at dispensary level, and the use of diagnostic strategies such as those of the Integrated Management of the Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) have clear benefits in terms of ease and cost of implementation. But they also increase drug pressure and the risk of resistance developing in the drugs being used. Together all these factors make it necessary to develop new alternative d rugs and evaluate the optimal strategies for their introduction in the community. Evaluation of the Control tools and programmes: The description of the main malaria prevention and treatment strategies given above, highlights the continued need of develo ping and testing new tools and strategies to combat the increasing problem of malaria in many parts of Africa. On the preventive side, this will involve the development of new tools like malaria vaccines, which will take some time to accomplish. The curati ve side will involve the identification of new drug targets, as the current armoury of antimalarial drugs are based on very few targets in the parasite Chapter 1: Introduction 14 (Winstanley 2000). Once these tools have been identified, rigorous testing of the identified compounds o r tools should be done, to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans. Thereafter, operational research to explore better ways of introducing the intervention in the community should be carried out. With ITNs much effort had gone into try out differ ent delivery channels, as described above. Previously, much emphasis has been laid on the demonstration of efficacy of interventions in randomised controlled trials. Once efficacy was demonstrated the interventions were implemented in large programmes. Rec ently, more emphasis has also been laid on demonstrating that the expected benefits of the intervention are realised when the interventions are delivered in a programme setting (Lengeler & Snow 1996, Habicht et al. 1999). These evaluations aim to encourage the allocation of resources to sustain and expand the programmes to cover whole populations in endemic countries (Bryce et al . 1994 , Lengeler & Snow 1996) . The programme evaluations are further complicated by the fact that in most situations it is not possible to have a pr oper control group. Also there is often limited opportunity for establishing an elaborate evaluation system that is required to accurately assess exposure and outcome events in the target population (Habicht et al. 1999, Mohr 2000) . Therefore, relatively cheap and easy evaluation tools are required. Summary A large part of Tanzania has high malari a transmission and the burden of disease is increasing. The disease is concentrated in young children and frequently presents as malaria anaemia, especially in very high transmission areas. The emergence and spread of drug resistance are undermining the cu rrent strategy of early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore there is an urgent need to investigate and evaluate new appropriate tools for the control of malaria in Tanzania. This thesis describes a series of studies conducted in the Kilombero Valley to asse ss the value of a new preventive tool (insecticide treated nets) and a new curative tool (Co -artem\u00ae) to combat malaria. These studies also explored issues on the design and methodologies for the evaluation of malaria control. Lastly, the experience gained from this work is used to highlight the many factors that influence the translation of research results into public health policy.

Chapter 3: Design and Methods 22 CHAPTER 3 Design And Methods Study area and population: The flood plains of the Kilombero river extend 2 50kms from Southwest to Northeast, and are bordered by the Udzungwa range of mountains in the Northeast and Mahenge Mountains in the Southeast. Alluvial soils that are flooded every year support grassland vegetation. Diverse ethnic groups inhabit the plain s and the majority are either subsistence farmers cultivating rain fed rice, maize cassava and/or fish from the Kilombero River and its tributaries. Several studies have been done to describe the disease patterns and assess their impact on health indicator s of the communities living in these areas (Tanner et al. 1987, Tanner et al. 1991). These studies identified malaria and malarial -anaemia as a major public health problem in this area of high malaria transmission (Tanner et al. 1987). There is intense ye ar-round malaria transmission (Charlwood et al. 1998) . On average every person receives above 300 infective bites per year (Smith et al. 1993). The main vectors are Anopheles gambiae ss, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus . It has been estimated that on average there are about 0.7 and 0.6 episodes per child per year of clinical malaria and severe anaemia in children under five. The main malaria control measure is prompt diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases. Chloroquine is still the first line antimalarial and its consumption is high. There are reports of rising chloroquine resistance in the area with only 80% of children responding to treatment within 7 days (Mshinda et al. 1996). Further detailed st udies where conducted in Idete village (08o 5' S; 36o 30' E), which has features representative of the rural villages in the valley. The village is one of 18 in the Kilombero valley under demographic surveillance (DSS) (Schellenberg et al. 1999) . Social marketing and distribution of nets The Kilombero bed net project (KINET) was implemented in the Kilombero valley using a social marketing approach and aimed to promote and distribute insecticide treated nets and insecticide for net treatment on a large scale. \" ZUIA MBU \" branded nets and insecticides were sold and distributed in the community using public and private distribution channels, Chapter 3: Design and Methods 23 and a system of community door -to-door distributors. The implement ation was staggered, with the first phase involving 18 villages. The implementation was expanded progressively to cover the whole of the two districts by the end of 1999. Planning and progress meetings involving project staff, district authorities and expe rts were held regularly during the period of implementation. Demographic surveillance The health impact assessment was restricted to the 18 villages located in the phase one area. In order to facilitate the evaluation of morbidity and mortality a demograp hic surveillance system (IC -DSS) was established. The system was adapted from the Navrongo demographic surveillance system (Binka et al. 1999). The IC -DSS covers 18 villages in the Kilombero Valley: 6 in Kilombero District and 12 in Ulanga District. The system involves visiting every household in the 18 villages once every 4 months. During these visits demographic and vital events like births, deaths and migration, are recorded in a household record book (HRB). The information is then entered in a relation al data -base at the Ifakara Health Research and Development Centre (IHRDC) data unit. Using this system the study area was assessed to have approximately 55,000 residents and 3533 children under two years of age in 1997. Passive case detection at Idete di spensary For detailed morbidity assessment a passive case detection system (PCD) was established at Idete village dispensary. All children in the DSS database who were under the age of five on 1st February 1998 were listed, assigned a study number and prov ided with a special card bearing their name, date of birth, area of residence and DSS identifiers. This list was updated every 6 months to include new -borns and those children who had migrated into the village and who were therefore classified as new resi dents in the DSS. Children under five who were sick or had a history of illness were seen at the dispensary by a Rural Medical Aide. A clinical form was filled and information was entered in a database at the IHRDC data unit. The diagnosis, laboratory resu lts and medication given were also written on the patient cards. The drug supply and services at the Idete dispensary were improved as part of the project to reduce the need of children to seek care elsewhere. Chapter 3: Design and Methods 24 Case -control study Using the PCD at Idete d ispensary, a case control study was done between February 1998 and August 1999, to assess the impact of ITNs on mild malaria episodes. Children who were found to have a temperature of more than 37.4 OC and any parasitaemia were classified as cases. Childr en who had signs and symptoms of severe disease (e.g. haemoglobin <5.0 g/dl) were excluded from being cases. For each case, one age -matched dispensary control was randomly chosen among the children who had come for growth monitoring or attended for anothe r cause of disease, within two weeks of the attendance of the case. Separate records were kept for all the children who were not sick and had attended for growth monitoring. An additional community control was randomly chosen from the DSS database matched for age and area of residence (hamlet). If a control could not be found, then a child of an adjacent hamlet was chosen. Age was matched to within one month for infants, within two months for those between 12 - 24 months of age, and within 3 months for thos e above two years. A special Foxpro program was written and was run every week to identify cases and controls from the PCD, MCH attendance and DSS databases. Both cases and controls were then visited at home, individual verbal consent was sought from the guardian and a questionnaire applied. The use of ITNs and other risk factors was assessed, including age of the child, tribe, religious affiliation, mother's education, family's social economic status, nutritional status, vaccination status, access to cle an water, antimalarial and antipyretic use, condition of the net and its use in the previous month. A blood sample was taken from controls who had not given a blood sample at the dispensary in the two weeks prior to the day of the interview. Cases and con trols were not eligible for re-recruitment as either cases or controls for a period of one month. The sample size was calculated using Epi Info 6 for an unmatched design (matched designs need slightly fewer numbers). The sample was estimated to be able t o show a 40% effectiveness against mild malaria episodes (summary estimate is about 46% from controlled trials (Lengeler 1998)), assuming a 30 % use of ITNs in the control group, five percent significance level and 90% power, giving a total of 454 cases. T he sample was increased by 10% to allow for incomplete information and refusals, giving a total of approximately 500 cases to be recruited in one year. We used a concurrent sampling design, i.e. a case could be a control latter, and vice versa. The inciden ce of clinical Chapter 3: Design and Methods 25 episodes of malaria was estimated to be 0.92/child/ year in children aged 12 -30 months in Idete (Alonso et al. 1996). It was expected that the incidence rate would be slightly higher when taking children below 24 months. Cross -sectional su rveys The impact of ITNs on the prevalence of parasitaemia and anaemia was assessed using annual cross -sectional surveys. Three annual cross -sectional surveys where conducted in a sample of children under two years of age living in the DSS area (Schellenbe rg et al. 1999). The first survey was done at the time of launching the social marketing campaign in June 1997, and two other surveys were carried out at the same period (June to August) in the subsequent two years. This period also coincided with the end of the rainy season when malaria anaemia is most prevalent (Kitua A. pers. Comm). A simple random sample was selected from the DSS database for the first survey, and a two - stage random sampling (sampling 6 villages then sampling children from these) was d one for the subsequent surveys. Children from Idete village and Kivukoni were not included in the subsequent surveys due to participation in other studies. The demographic surveillance data provided the sampling frame. For each year a different sample of c hildren was selected from the database. The sample size for the baseline (1st year DSS cross -sectional) was calculated using Epi -6 to get a sample which could estimate the proportion of children with haemoglobin below 8 g/dl to within +/ - 2.5% (SE). Est imates from a study in the village of Kiberege (Fraser -Hurt et al. 1999) showed that the proportion of children with anaemia (Hb below 8 g/dl) was 30% for those without nets. Assuming a 95% confidence level and 2.5% standard error for the estimate, 296 chi ldren were required. Adding 10% more to account for refusals and non - availability a total of 325 children was sampled. For the subsequent DSS cross -sectional surveys, a review of the sample size was done taking into consideration the prevalence of anaemia, as estimated from the baseline survey, and the clustering of sampling. The sample size was calculated to estimate a 30% difference in the proportion of anaemic children between those who use ITNs and those who don't, assuming a 95% confidence level and 80% power. 330 children were sampled for each subsequent survey. Chapter 3: Design and Methods 26 All the sample children were traced at home, consent from the parent or guardian requested, a questionnaire applied, clinical examination and anthropometric measurements performed, and a blo od sample was taken for microscopy and haemoglobin estimation, as described below. One cross -sectional assessment was also done in Idete village in June -August 1998. All children who were under -five years of age on 1st February 1998 were visited at home a nd a questionnaire applied to assess their use of ITNs and other risk factors for malaria infection and anaemia (similar to the main cross -sectional surveys). A blood sample (for malaria parasites and Hb estimation) was taken for children who had not given a blood sample at the dispensary during the two weeks prior the day of the interview. Mapping of houses in Idete The distribution patterns of the ITNs and the effect of high coverage of ITNs was investigated in Idete village. The position of the houses and other important service outlets including the dispensary were later determined using a portable Global Positioning System (Garmin, Thousand oaks, USA). The geo -referenced points were then used to calculate the distance between houses and between the h ouses of residence and the dispensary. Demographic data was collected from the updated DSS database. Spatial positioning of events and variables was done by linking the mapped households with data from the PCD and Idete cross -sectional survey. Coverage of ITNs and untreated nets were calculated for each individual child during the cross -sectional survey. The number of nets per 1000 population living in houses other than the index child and within a specific radius were calculated. The radii of 50m (R 50), 100m (R 100), 200m (R 200) and 400m (R400) were chosen considering the indication from studies done elsewhere (Binka et al, 1998; Hii et al. 2000) . Further coverage was categorised as low (0 ITNs/1000 persons), moderate (1 -300 ITNs/1000 persons) and high (>300 ITNs per/1000 persons) Clinical trial of Co -artem\u00e2 The of Co -artem (Artemether + Benflumet ol: CGP 56697) and chloroquine a clinical trial at the 'mother -and-child' out -patient clinic at St Francis District Designated Hospital between February 1996 and September 1996 (Hatz et al. 2000). Inclusion criteria for selection were: age 1-5 years; body weight >5kg; Chapter 3: Design and Methods 27 microscopically confirmed P.falciparum infection, with parasitaemia >5,000/\u00b5L blood; fever (axillary temp 37.5oC); living within 5 km of trial site; feasibility of participation and informed consent; not participating in any o ther trial. Exclusion criteria were parasitaemia <5,000/\u00b5L; absence of fever; intolerance to oral medication; signs/symptoms of severe/complicated malaria; severe malnutrition or kwashiorkor; history other antimalarial drugs within 48 hours; known sensi tivity to chloroquine; any known chronic underlying disease. Eligible children were randomised to receive either Co -artem or chloroquine. The children in the Co -artem treatment group received 4 doses of paediatric tablets at 0, 8, 24 and 48 hours. Tr ial medication for each child was contained in an individually numbered blister pack. Children were assigned treatment upon presentation by allocating the blister pack with the lowest available number. The contents (chloroquine or Co -artem) were allocate d randomly in blocks of 6. Each paediatric Co -artem tablet contained 10mg artemether + 60mg benflumetol (\u00bd the adult tablet level) and 1, 2, 3 or 4 tablets were given at the 4 dosage times according to body weight (5 -10kg body weight, 4 doses of 1 tablet; 10-15kg, 4 doses of 2 tablets; 15 -20kg, 4 doses of 3 tablets; 20 -25kg, 4 doses of 4 tablets). Children in the chloroquine treatment group similarly received 4 doses over 3 days, according to body weight at 25mg per kg body weight as follows: 5 -10 kg: t dose; tablet each dose; 20 -25kg: 1\u00bd tablets, \u00be tablet each dose (each tablet contains 150 mg chloroquine base). Children were then visited at home for the first 3 days to a dminister medication and monitor side effects. There were then followed up at the clinic on day 7,14, 21, 28. Clinical examination and screening for malaria parasites was done during follow -up. Interview and clinical procedures A medical officer (the au thor) saw all study children in the main DSS cross -sectional surveys and the Co -artem trial. A Rural Medical Aide using similar procedures saw children who were sick or had a history of illness when attending Idete dispensary, as well as those included in the cross -sectional survey in the village. All parents/guardians were asked for consent for children to participate using information sheet prepared specifically Chapter 3: Design and Methods 28 for each study. History of illness was recorded using standard forms at the clinic for each study. A standard questionnaire was applied to all children visited at home and who participated in all the cross -sectional surveys and the case control study in Idete. A questionnaire was used to assess exposure to treated bed nets and other potential r isk factors. These factors included antimalarial treatment, anthropometric measurement, socio -economic status, tribe, religion, travel outside study area, illness in the previous month, history of blood transfusion, educational status, fostering and net us age. All study children had their axillary temperature checked with an electronic thermometer. Weight was measured with a hanging scale and height measured with a special tape with the child lying down for those under two, and with child upright for those over two years. Physical examination was done with the child on the mother's lap. Splenomegaly was palpated on the mother's lap for those children below 2 years of age, and in an upright position for those above 2. Splenomegaly was recorded as palpable or not. Information on any other abnormalities was recorded. Finger prick blood samples were made with sterile lancets and drops of blood were collected on slides, Hemocue micro -cuvette and a microtainer. Treatment of sick children was done following the n ormal good clinical practice procedures of the hospitals in Kilombero and Ulanga Districts. Children with Hb below 8 g/dl were given haematenics, folic acid 5 mg once a day for three weeks, and ferrous sulphate 200 mg once a day for three weeks. For the ho me visits, the attending clinical officer treated sick children. In the main cross -sectional survey, asymptomatic children with parasitaemia above 2000 per microliter were traced and given a standard dose of chloroquine or sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP). Assessment of parasitaemia Thick and thin films were stained with Giemsa stain. All blood films were read twice, independently, with the microscopist not knowing the intervention status (either bed net or drug treatment) of the child, and a third time if the ratio of densities from the first 2 exceeded 1.3 or was less than 0.67, or if one was positive and the other negative. A definitive result was based on a majority verdict for positivity and the geometric mean of Chapter 3: Design and Methods 29 the 2 closest positive density counts (Alonso et al.1994). 20 thick film fields were examined before the slide was declared negative. If asexual forms of P. falciparum were found, then 200 thick film fields were screened for the presence of malarial parasite species. Identification of P.falc iparum was followed by a tally counter count of asexual forms and leucocytes. Present gametocytes were counted similarly. A peer review of 282 slides was done. There was a 87% agreement in terms of negative/positive results between the 2 counts. Measure ment of haemoglobin Haemoglobin was measured using the HemoCue system (HemoCue AB, \u00c4ngelholm, Sweden) . A drop of blood was placed in a special microcuvette which contained a hemolyzing agent (sodium desoxycholate, sodium nitrite, and sodium -azide). The erythrocyte membranes are disintegrated by sodium desoxycholate, releasing the haemoglobin. Sodium nitrite converts the haemoglobin iron from the ferrous to the ferric state to form methaemoglobin, which then combines with azide to form azidemethaemoglobin. The meters measured the amount of light absorbed by the sample within the microcuvette in the 540nm range, to estimate the haemoglobin level. The method has been found to be easy and accurate for measuring haemoglobin (von Schenck et al. 1986). DNA proce ssing and PCR Five \u00b5l of blood were 50 \u00b5l GTC solution (4 M guanidine -isothiocyanate, 25 mM pH 7.0, 0.5% Na sarcosylsulphate), 5 \u00b5l -mercaptoethanol, and mixed with 50 TE saturated phenol and 50 \u00b5l chloroform. The aqueous phase was separated, precipitated with isopropanol and DNA redissolved in 30 \u00b5l H20. A nested PCR was performed for MSP2. 5 \u00b5l of DNA were used for the primary reaction and 2 \u00b5l of PCR product for the nested reaction in a 100 \u00b5l reaction composed as follows: 10 mM Tris pH 8.8, 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCI 2, 0.25% Tween 20, 0.2 mM each NTP, 0.5 pM each primer, 1.25 U taq polymerase. Primer pairs used were S2 and S3 for the primary reaction and S1 and S4 for the nested reaction as published by Foley et al. (1992). Both PCR reactions were performed in a Perkin Elmer Thermocycler 480 with the following Chapter 3: Design and Methods 30 profile: 5 min at 94 oC and 30 cycles: 1 min at 94 oC, 2 min at 55oC, 2 min at 70 oC. Negative controls were included with each set of PCR reactions. The different MSP2 alleles were genotyped as previously described (Felger et al. 1993). 20 \u00b5l of nested PCR product were subjected to restriction digests with the restriction enzymes Ddel, Rsal, Hinfl, ScrF1, respectively, and run on a gel. All digests of one res triction enzyme were loaded side by side for all samples of an individual patient and sizes were calculated using a standard commercial size marker. RFLP patterns were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and documented electronically. All gels were ana lysed by two independent researchers. Data processing All data collected in the study was double entered into a database (Foxpro) at the IHRDC data center. Consistency and logical checks were done using programs written in Foxpro (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond USA). Analysis In the case -control assessment, cases of mild malaria were compared with controls primarily with regard to their exposure to ITNs. Matched pairs were analysed by univariate analysis, then by multivariate analysis. Matched pairs mul tivariate analysis using conditional logistic regression was done using STATA\u00ae (Stata Corporation, Texas USA). Comparison was made of the attendance and incidence of episodes of anaemia and parasitaemia at the dispensary among users and non -users of ITNs. The relative rates were calculated in STATA\u00ae. Analysis was done for all the three cross -sectional surveys combined. The impact of the nets on haemoglobin level, anaemia, parasitaemia and splenomegaly was estimated using multiple linear and logistic regres sion models taking into account the village cluster sampling for year 2 and 3, using robust regression approaches in STATA\u00ae (Stata Corp. 1999). The effect of different time points of observation (surveys) was included as one of the explanatory variables. Chapter 3: Design and Methods 31 Anaemia was classified as haemoglobin level below 8.0 g/dl since this is the level that has been associated with increased mortality ( Stoltzfus 1997) and this is consistent with earlier studies in the area (Menendez et al. 1997). Parasitaemia and splenome galy were classified as either present or absent. Use of treated nets was categorised based on the respondent's answers on ownership, and if they were \"ever treated\" or \"not treated\". There are currently no simple ways to assess insecticide content on the nets in the field. Other factors considered in the multivariate models included use of the net, condition of the net, age, sex, ethnicity, religion, nutritional status, access to the dispensary, shops and covered wells. Treatment history and attitudes tow ard health seeking were also included, as were factors related to the family size and income. The cross -sectional surveys in Idete was analysed similarly. The statistical modelling part for neighbourhood or short -distance effects was done using generalis ed linear mixed models (Breslow & Clayto n, 1993) to measure the impact of categorical explanatory variables on binary outcomes of having anaemia, harbouring parasites and owning an ITN, under consideration of spatial correlation. Continuous fixed effect variables are discretisized into several categories to check their linear influence. Because this analysis showed non -linearity in all cases, they were categorised in the final models. We assume that near observations in space are likely to have the same outcome. To adjust for such a spatial dep endence structure, the correlation function takes the value of one for observations close together and it decreases with increasing distance. If pi is the probability outcome for observation i, then using a logit link function leads to the model: logit (pi) = b t Ci + ei where b is the vector of coefficients and Ci the vector of fixed effects for observation I with 1 in the first place to include an intercept term. The error term ei has the general form Cov( ei, ej) = s 2 f(dij), where dij measures t he euklidian distance between location si and sj. For f(dij) we choose the exponential type f(dij) = exp( -r dij), but compared the fit as well with models incorporating different choices of spatial covariance types. In addition to better estimates for t he fixed effects, this setting allowed us to describe the size and decay Chapter 3: Design and Methods 32 of spatial dependency through s 2 and r, respectively. Finally the analysis was done using the SAS GLIMMIX macro, which uses iteratively reweighted likelihoods (Wolfinger & O'Connel, 1993) to fit the models. To compar e the spatial with the non -spatial models, we applied likelihood ratio statistics. The macro can only accommodate one observation per location, therefore the youngest child was chosen from houses with multiple children. A repeat of the analysis using a ran domly selected child from these households yielded similar results. Quality control The medical officer (the author) did a repeat of 5% of interviews and physical examination and observed 5% of all physical examinations and interviews in the Idete surveys . All forms were checked for completeness before being accepted into the data room. Clinical data entered in the computer was checked for logical errors weekly. Standard quality control procedures for IHRDC data center and laboratory were applied. An indep endent laboratory in the United Kingdom did a review of the parasitological results and good agreement was observed. Daily Hemocue\u00ae calibrations were done. Regulatory approval This thesis describes a series of studies that were conducted in a period of fo ur years and included both hospital and community based work. Furthermore, the studies on treated bed nets were part of a larger multidiscipline evaluation. All the studies received institutional scientific and ethical approval from the IHRDC, and the Nati onal Institute for Medical Research. The KINET programme evaluation and the Co -artem trial had approval from the Ministry of Health and the Commission of Science and Technology that has the mandate of overseeing all research in Tanzania. Sensitisation, community and individual consent For the community -based studies a series of meetings were held first at district then ward and finally at village level to get consent from the authorities to implement evaluation. After the approval of the authorities pub lic village level meetings were held to sensitise and get community consent for the programme. For the hospital -based studies approval was sought from the hospital board and the staff of the St Francis Designated District Hospital. Idete village leadership and dispensary staff were consulted for approval of the dispensary studies. Chapter 3: Design and Methods 33 The Idete dispensary studies were further explained at public meetings at hamlet level. At the time of implementation of all the studies, individual verbal consent was requested from the parent or guardian of the child, and a written or finger printed consent was also asked for the hospital -based trial. All c hildren who were sick in the community studies were treated according to the good clinical practice of the Kilombero distric t health facilities and treatment guidelines of the Tanzania Ministry of Health.

Formative an d market research were conducted in order to understand community perceptions, knowledge, attitudes and practice with respect to the products to be socially marketed. We identified Zuia Mbu (Kiswahili for 'prevent mosquitoes') as a suitable brand name for both treated nets and single -dose insecticide treatment sachets. A mix of public and private sales outlets is used for distribution. In the first stage of a stepped introduction 31 net agents were appointed and trained in 18 villages: 15 were shop owners, 14 were village leaders, 1 was a parish priest and 1 a health worker. For net treatment 37 young people were appointed in the same villages and trained as agents. Further institutions in both districts such as hospitals, development projects and employers were also involved in distribution. Promotion for both products was intense and used a variety of channels. A total of 22 4 10 nets and 8072 treatments were sold during the first year: 18 months after launching, 46% of 312 families with children aged under 5 years reported that their children were sleeping under treated nets. A strong evaluation component in over 50 000 people allows assessment of the long - term effects of insecticide -treated nets on child health and survival, anaemia in pregnancy, and the c osts of the intervention. This evaluation is based on cross -sectional surveys, and case-control and cohort studies. Chapter 4: KINET 40 Introduction Despite malaria being the largest public health problem in Africa south of the Sahara, with over one million associated dea ths each year (WHO, 1997), little progress has taken place in control during the past decades. Prompt treatment with an effective antimalarial remains the basis of malaria control strategies in most African countries (WHO, 1993). Preventive transmission co ntrol is being reconsidered using insecticide -treated nets (ITNs, including treated bednets and curtains) which do not require a large national programme infrastructure for implementation. In a meta -analysis of African trials ITNs were found to reduce clin ical malaria episodes by 48% and to improve anaemia status by an average 0.5 g/dL (Lengeler, 1998). Most importantly, the regular use of ITNs under trial conditions prevents approximately 6 deaths for every 1000 children protected every year across a large range of transmission intensities. Many international agencies (e.g., UNICEF, WHO, World Bank, Organization of African Unity) have recognized that malaria control is an urgent priority in order to improve child survival and are now making plans for implem entation of ITNs (WHO, 1996; UNICEF, 1998; USAID, 1998). The translation of promising research results into effective public health action is a daunting task. There are at least 60 million children living in areas at risk for malaria in Africa and their n ets, once provided, will need to be treated regularly (every 6 -12 months) over many years. Feilden (1996) reviewed various options for financing and implementation of ITNs, most of which have been tried on a relatively small scale (up to 10 villages). Thes e fall into 3 main implementation models: (i) the integration of ITNs distribution into a community pharmacy network (e.g., the Bamako Initiative pro - gramme in Western Kenya (Hill, 1991), (ii) sales through local health units (e.g., Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo, 1 998) or the existing primary health care system (D'Alessandro et al., 1995), and (iii) distribution through community groups (e.g., Premji et al. 1995). Despite much useful operational experience, it seems premature to recommend specific large -scale ITNs implementation strategies for the African continent. The launch of a number of large programmes (population of over 100 000) using different pragmatic approaches will allow these strategies to be optimized. Social marketing is a very flexible implementatio n model that has proved successful in resource -poor countries for interventions such as oral rehydration salts (ORS) and condoms (BASICS, 1998). Social marketing is an approach where the experience and Chapter 4: KINET 41 methods of commercial marketing are applied to a produ ct which has a social benefit, with the main motivation being social improvement rather than financial gain to the marketer (Andreasen, 1995). The approach usually uses a branded product that can be marketed and advertised professionally. Much attention is paid to the main target group -sometimes called customers -and much effort goes into understanding the perception, knowledge, attitudes and practices of this group. Social marketing entails an effective public -private partnership which may be particularly u seful for ITNs: unlike drugs and vaccines, ITNs may be seen as a commercial commodity rather than a medical product. Social marketing of ITNs has recently been started in various African countries, for example, the Central African Republic (in 1996), Rwand a, Kenya and Zimbabwe (in 1997). The long -term impact of ITNs on small children in areas with high malaria transmission (an arbitrary cut -off being an annual entomological inoculation rate over 100) remains a controversial issue. The potential con - sequen ces of delaying acquisition of immunity are worrying in that in such areas it has been suggested that overall survival could be better without ITNs (Snow et al. , 1997). However, good data on the issue are scant and the discussion has been based on indirect evidence. Following the discontinuation of malaria control trials in the past no evidence for a delay or a 'rebound' in mortality was found (Molineaux & Gramiccia, 1980; Bradley, 1991; Greenwood, 1997). Further, the indirect evidence presented to support the idea of a delay in child death in areas of high transmission has been questioned (D'alessandro & Coosemans, 1997; Lengeler et al., 1997; Lines, 1997; Moljneaux, 1997). Only long -term randomized controlled trials could answer this question reliably but these would be unlikely to be ethical or acceptable to the communities involved. Not many alternative designs remain. One possibility is to compare users of ITNs to non -users in the frame of a large -scale programme: combining this estimate with information from coverage surveys would allow estimation of community effectiveness (Lengeler & Snow, 1996). Although the current debate does not warrant delaying the implementation of ITNs programmes the issue needs to be addressed and monitored by more than one lar ge-scale ITNs programme. We present an overview of the KINET (pronounced 'key -net') project in Tanzania. The project, based at the non -governmental Ifakara Health Research and Development Centre, has developed a social marketing system for getting nets an d insecticide to a scattered rural population of 350000 people. A strong evaluation component in over 50 000 people Chapter 4: KINET 42 allows monitoring of the long -term effects of ITNs on health and child survival, together with an assessment of the costs of the interventio n. Background Study area Kilombero and Ulanga Districts lie in Morogoro Region in south -westem Tanzania, about 320 km from Dar -es-Salaam (Fig. 1). Much of the area lies in the low - lying flood plain of the Kilombero River (average altitude 270 m), which divides the 2 districts. The Udzungwa mountains lie to the northwest and there is also an upland area around Mahenge town (over 1000 m). The area has a rainy season from November to May, although rain may fall in any month of the year. Annual rainfall rang e is approximately 1200 -1800 mm. 'Me population is about 350 000, with an average density of about 10 people /km2. There are 109 villages in the 2 districts, ranging in size from <1000 people to >6000. Average household size is about 5 -5 people. There is a wide mix of ethnic groups including Wandamba, Wapogoro, Wabena, Wabunga and Wahehe. Many local houses have mud walls and thatched roofs, while up to one -third have brick walls and corrugated iron roofs. Rice, maize and cassava are commonly grown for home consumption. The main agricultural exports from both districts are rice, timber and charcoal. Fishing is also common, both for local consumption and for export as smoked fish to the towns of Morogoro and Dar - es-Salaam. Many families have a second house k nown as a shamba (farm) house in low -lying farmland areas where they stay during the rice -planting and harvesting seasons. The public health system has a network of village health workers, health posts, dispensaries, health centres and hospitals with vary ing quality of care. In Ifakara town, the capital of Kilombero District, the main hospital is a large well -equipped mission Designated District Hospital. The hospital in Mahenge, the Ulanga District capital, has more limited facilities. There is a further mission hospital in Malinyi, serving the south -westem part of Chapter 4: KINET 43 Fig. 1. The KINET programme area in Morogoro Region, south -westem Tanzania. Shading indicates Phase 1 area (under demographic surveillance). The town of Ifakara is approximately 37 oE and 8 oS. Chapter 4: KINET 44 Ulanga District. The mother -and-child health (MCH) services are well developed and vaccination coverage is high with 78% children receiving all Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) vaccines by age 1 year (F. Font, persona l communication). There are no paved roads and some villages are cut off for parts of the year by flooding. Limited seasonal bus services run up to 3 times each day between the towns of Ifakara, Mahenge and Malinyi. The TAZARA railway links the towns of If akara and Mlimba. Malaria and mosquito net use Malaria is the foremost health problem as reported through the health services and as perceived by local people, both for adults and children (Tanner et al., 1991). Malaria transmission due to Plasmodium falc iparum is intense and perennial, despite marked seasonality in mosquito densities with a peak in the rains. Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus are the main vectors, with an estimated 200 -300 infective bites per person per year occurring in rural areas clos e to Ifakara (Smith et al., 1993). Life -threatening malaria in most of the area occurs largely in children, and commonly presents in those aged < 1 year (Snow et al., 1994). A baseline survey conducted in 1996 found that 37% of households (3817/10 299) had at least 1 net. The main motivation for their use was mosquito nuisance rather than malaria control, with use being widely reported as seasonal. A previous study at the Ifakara Health Research and Development Centre allowed preliminary assessment of vario us ways to distribute nets and net treatment in the area close to Ifakara town (Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo, 1998). The social marketing programme We describe here the background work preparing the social marketing campaign from July 1996 to May 1997, and then co ver the issues of product, price, place and promotion. Sensitization and market research Sensitization meetings with village leaders were held in all the 18 villages of the Phase 1 distribution area (shaded area in Fig. 1). Each half -day meeting took the form of an open discussion between project and community leaders of the health problems of the community, ways to prevent malaria including ITNs, and the issues of how to get ITNs to the community in a sustainable way. The concepts of sustainability and co st recovery led Chapter 4: KINET 45 to long discussions: most community leaders had no previous experience of projects that aimed for substantial cost recovery and found the concepts hard to understand. There was a common misconception that the Swahili term for 'project' ( mradi) involved being given things at little or no cost to the consumer. An initial survey confirmed that virtually all people in the area knew of mosquito nets and that round and rectangular white polyester nets manufactured in Tanzania were generally available in the towns. Qualitative studies on community preferences for different types of net suggested that rectangular, dark green, high -quality polyester nets were likely to be popular. They were needed in 2 sizes (180 X 150 X 100 cm and 180 X 150 X 130 cm ) in order to accommodate local sleeping patterns. People said they would prefer coloured nets to white nets since they would not need washing as often. Many people had heard of net treatment, owing to a previous UNICEF project in the area and to the avail - ability of Rotary -funded treated nets in lfakara (Fraser - Hurt & Lyimo, 1998), but very few had tried it. Further qualitative studies in 2 small villages found that malaria was often not perceived as a life -threatening problem, but as a fever -related il lness which attacked all ages. This finding was confirmed by related work carried out at the same time in Ifakara town (Hausmann - Muela et al., 1998). Severe conditions perceived as causing child deaths, such as bandama (enlarged spleen), degedege (convuls ions) and homa kali (high fever) were not widely thought to be caused by malaria. Consequently, it was decided to highlight messages related to malaria as a cause of child deaths, including those seen as bandama, degedege and homa kali, in promotion campai gns. Nuisance biting by mosquitoes was consistently felt to be a major problem and this was the main reason for people using mosquito nets. Few people were aware that malaria -transmitting mosquitoes were more likely to bite late at night than in the early evening: without this knowledge it is hard for people to understand how nets might prevent malaria. We identified Zuia Mbu (Kiswahili for 'prevent mosquitoes') as a suitable brand name for both treated nets and insecticide treatment. lUs brand name and a logo for Zuia Mbu (Fig. 2) were developed together with an advertising agency in Dar -es-Salaam and tested locally. The brand and logo are used on all products and promotional materials. Chapter 4: KINET 46 Fig. 2. The logo used for the Zuia Mbu brand used by the KINET programme. Chapter 4: KINET 47 Products: nets and insecticide Dark green polyester 100 -denier 156 -mesh nets were obtained from Siamdutch Ltd, Thailand. Each net was pre -treated at the factory with 20 mg/m2 deltamethrin, and wrapped in a clear plastic bag with an insert containing information about Zuia Mbu. The insecticide for net treatment was 2 -5% lambda -cyhalothrin CS (capsule suspension), a water -based micro -encapsulated formulation produced by Zeneca Ltd (UK). The insecticide was re -packaged by a collaborating project in Dar -es-Salaam in individual 6 -mL sachets, each conta ining enough to treat a single net of any locally available size (Miller et al., 1998). Price Village sensitization meetings and experience from a previous project (Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo, 1998) suggested that local people would be willing to pay near cost -recovery price for the nets, but rather less than cost - recovery price for the insecticide. Retail prices were set at TSh 3000 (~US$5 -0) for either size of net and TSh 250 (~US$O.42) for the insecticide treatment service. For nets, a commission of TSh 500 p er net is paid to each retailer and a further commission of TSh 250 is paid to wholesalers. Thus the project recovers TSh 2250 (~US$3.75) for each net sold, or about 66% of the replacement cost including transport to lfakara and packaging. For insecticide, a commission of TSh 125 per sachet is paid to the retailers and a f\u00fcrther TSh 25 to wholesalers. The project therefore recovers TSh 100 (~US$O.17) for each sachet sold, about 17% of the replacement cost. Price control for nets, initially a particular worr y of the community, is achieved by making the selling price clearly visible on the net packaging and by advertising the price widely. Place: the distribution system The social marketing of nets and insecticide was phased -in step -wise in 3 increasingly large areas. A flexible distribution system was chosen in conjunction with community leaders and community members in a series of open meetings. In the first phase, in each village 2 sales agents for nets and a further 2 mobile sales agents for insecticide we re chosen regardless of the size of the village. The agents were nominated by the villagers themselves, and included health workers, parish priests, community leaders and shopkeepers. Net sales agents and net treatment agents were both given a 1 -day train ing seminar, where they learnt how to treat nets and how to keep sales records. These records show the purchaser's name, balozi (local political leader), sub -village and village, and permit checks that the products have been sold within the study area. Twi ce-yearly re -Chapter 4: KINET 48 training and review sessions are also held. The net treatment agents were given a distinctly painted Zuia Mbu bicycle to assist with door -to-door sales, plastic basins, gloves, and plastic boxes for storage of sachets of insecticide. Nets and insecticide were initially supplied directly by project staff at weekly intervals, but as the project area enlarged a network of wholesalers was developed to keep agents supplied on a regular basis. Each agent has a contract with the lfakara Health Researc h and Development Centre, and is paid on a commission basis (see 'Price' above). A reward system for reaching certain sales targets is also used. Agents who do not keep the terms of the contract are replaced. Promotion and the voucher system for pregnant women and infants A range of materials to support an information, education and communication (IEC) campaign was developed, including 3 posters (Fig. 3) and a leaflet. These materials, each incorporating ideas from the qualitative studies, were drawn by a local artist and pilot - tested extensively before printing and distribution to health clinics, sales outlets, etc. Billboards were posted along the main roads and one local bus had the Zuia Mbu logo painted prominently on its side. The project worked togeth er with the District Health Management Teams in both districts in preparing the campaign. A discount system to reduce further the cost of a net for mothers of young children and pregnant women was developed for use through health clinics. This system is i ntended to increase use of treated nets in those most at risk of severe effects of malaria. All women attending antenatal clinics and those attending for routine immunizations are entitled to a discount voucher which gives them a TSh 500 (US$ O.84 or 17% r etail value) price reduction for a treated mosquito net. Their clinic attendance card is marked to show that they have received the voucher. The voucher is then presented by the women to the net sales agent in their village. The sales agent then receives a credit from the project to the value of TSh 500 plus a TSh 50 handling charge. Public -Private mix KINET uses a pragmatic mix of activities involving the public and private sectors. Such mixes have recently been advocated as an effective strategic approac h for large - scale ITNs projects (USAID, 1998). KINET social marketing involves a collaboration between public entities such as the District Health Management Teams and the Ministry of Health, the private sector such as international suppliers and local bu siness people, and the project social -marketing team. Chapter 4: KINET 49 Launching and expansion The treated nets and insecticide treatment service were launched in 2 large villages on 24 and 25 May 1997 with celebrations including community theatre, songs, a raffle and speeches from community leaders. During the following week sales of nets and insecticide started in all the 18 Phase 1 villages. The project expanded to cover a further 8 villages in December 1997, 35 in June 1998, 18 in December 1998 and will cover the remai ning 30 villages early in 1999. In order to facilitate this expansion in an efficient way, KINET is working to maximize inputs from local project partners such as local employers and mission hospitals. Project partners act as local distributors of Zuia Mb u nets and insecticide, using the same promotional materials and price structure, and as key players in the IEC campaign. Project evaluation: the effect of ITNs on child health and survival Socio -cultural aspects Quantitative and qualitative work is being done, including periodic knowledge, attitude, beliefs and practices (KABP) studies, detailed community -based anthropological studies, and semi -structured interviews with sales agents and customers. This work allows a review of how IEC messages are receive d in the community and the chance to see which new messages might be useful. In addition, it allows evaluation of the discount system and the sales agents themselves, with a view to making improvements so that customers are served better by the project.

Translation: (1) Malaria -carrying mosquitoes bite in the middle of the night, ( 2) Zuia Mbu treated nets repel and kill mosquitoes Chapter 4: KINET 51 Demographic surveillance system (DSS) This system was started in September 1996 and operates in the 18 Phase 1 villages covered by the study (shaded area in Fig. 1). This area has a population of some 55000 people living in 11000 households. A baseline census was carried out from September to December 1996. Name, sex, date of birth, and relationships within the household were recorded. Household locations were noted on sketch -maps. Rough locations of any shamba houses were also recorded. Since January 1 997 every household has been visited every 4 months by an interviewer who updates the census record by asking about in- and out -migrations, pregnancies, births and deaths. The system developed originally in Navrongo (Ghana) by BINKA et al. (1998) was used with few modifications. Special surveys are added from time to time: for example, the first census round in 1997 was used to record socio -economic status in the household, and educational level for each household member. The DSS gives a full sampling frame for the Phase 1 area, within which vital events are monitored and random samples of households or individuals may be chosen for various in -depth studies. Effect of treated nets on child survival Two studies are under way within the DSS. First, a case -control study will assess risk factors for child mortality in the area, with a particular focus on use of nets, treated or untreated. Cases are children resident in the study area who died of any cause aged between 1 month and 5 years. Four controls are chose n for each case from the same area of residence and of approximately the same age. The case -control study will give an estimate of efficacy of the treated nets among children who use them. This can be combined with the coverage estimates from periodic surv eys to estimate effectiveness in this target group. The second study to assess the effect of treated nets on child survival is a birth cohort: all children born in 1998 and 1999 will be enrolled. At enrolment a questionnaire is used to elicit information o n birth -weight, mother's age and educational level, twinning, family size, birth order and birth interval. At subsequent routine DSS visits, a further brief questionnaire will be used to gather additional information. It is planned to follow these children until their 5th birthdays. Analysis will compare mortality rates in those using treated nets with those using un - treated nets and those using no nets, allowing for any measured potential confounders. Chapter 4: KINET 52 Effect of treated nets on anaemia and malaria in you ng children Three annual cross -sectional surveys to assess the effect of social marketing of treated nets on anaemia will be carried out on a random sample of children aged <2 years from the DSS area, one at baseline before the sale of the nets and then af ter the first and second year of implementation. A questionnaire is applied, a physical examination done and a blood sample obtained. The prevalence of anaemia will be compared between users and non -users of treated nets using logistic regression analysis to control for confounding. To assess the effect of the interventions on malaria and anaemia episodes, a cohort of children aged <5 years residing in the village of Idete is being followed -up and their disease episodes documented, using a passive case - detection system at the village dispensary. Risk factors including treatment -seeking behaviour, household socio - economic status, use of treated nets and mother's education are being assessed by short questionnaires applied through routine DSS visits. Rate ra tios of disease episodes (first/only episode) between those using treated nets and those not using them will be compared using Poisson regression to control for confounding. More detailed assessment of the impact of the interventions on malaria episodes is being done within this cohort using a nested case -control study. Effect of treated nets on anaemia in pregnancy A cross -sectional survey of pregnant women with rolling recruitment over a period of 12 months is also being carried out using the DSS. The st udy is designed to determine the prevalence of severe anaemia (Hb <8 g/dl) and to identify major risk factors for this anaemia, including use of treated nets. Costing of implementation and willingness and ability to pay . Cost of the implementation to the provider is being assessed. Measures of effectiveness and costs will be combined in a cost -effectiveness analysis (CEA). The costs involved include the initial investment, recurrent costs, capital costs and opportunity costs. Each type of cost is identifi ed by associated activities such as brand creation, promotion, training, distribution, etc. Willingness and ability to pay were elicited from a sample of respondents within and outside the Phase 1 area, who were asked about household expenditure patterns. Chapter 4: KINET 53 Insecticide resistance: entomological indicators With increasing use of ITNs at community level, it is possible that the usual night -biting behaviour of the main vector of malaria in the area might change to peak in the early evening and early morning, w hen few people are in bed. Studies to assess changes in mosquito biting behaviour are therefore carried out every year together with bio -assays to monitor any trend in resistance of wild -caught An. gambiae to lambdacyhalothrin or deltamethrin. First resul ts Demography The estimated mid -year (1997) population of the Phase 1 area was 54 061 people living in 10 966 house - holds. Average household size is 4 -9 people. Almost half (44%) of the population is aged < 15 years, 16% aged <5 years, and the sex ratio (M:F) is 1:1.02. During 1997 the infant mortality rate was 95/1000 live births (181/1902), and annual mortality in children aged 1 -4 years was 14.3/1000 (98/6859 child -years). In children aged 5-9 years the annual mortality rate was 3.5/1000 (28/7944 child -years). Total fertility was estimated at 4.7 births/woman. Willingness and ability to pay Of those interviewed, 69% (128/185) claimed to be willing to pay the price of US$5 per net and 88% (163/185) were willing to pay US$O.4 per net for a net treatment service. Ability to pay assessed by median overall household expenditure in the month prior to the first survey was US$74. Excluding expenditure on food, a median of US$7 was spent on capital items and US$ 11 was spent on other small items in the previous month. Many households have a bicycle (34%) or radio (11 %). It should be noted that this survey was carried out in the harvest season, when expenditures are at their annual maximum. Further surveys are ongoing. Sales Thirty -one net sales agents and 37 mo bile net treatment agents were appointed in May 1997 in the 18 villages of the first phase. Among the net agents there were 15 shop owners, 14 village leaders, 1 health worker, and 1 village priest. After 10 months, the priest and 3 village leaders were re placed: they were inactive, mainly owing to their other Chapter 4: KINET 54 commitments. During the same period 10 (27%) net treatment agents were no longer active and have been replaced. The percentage of households with at least 1 net rose from 37% at the end of 1996 to 52 % (5913/11480) in mid -1 998, by which time 24% (2730/11480) of house - holds had at least 1 treated net and 48% (4323/9040) nets were treated. Of a random sample of families with children aged < 5 years, 46 % reported that their children were sleeping under treated nets by April 1998. A total of 22 410 nets and 8072 treatments were sold by the project during the first year. Sales records in the Phase 1 area suggest over 80% nets were sold to residents. As expected, demand peaked after the rains started, when mosquito populations rose dramatically: almost half of the total annual sales were during the months of December and January. Most net treatments were sold to owners of ordinary untreated nets: 31% of those who owned ordinary nets had treated these by Dec ember 1997, whereas only 13% of Zuia Mbu net owners who had bought their nets at least 3 months previously had re - treated their nets by December 1997. There was a good response to the discount vouchers, with 26% (1687/6489) of net sales to Phase 1 area r esidents making use of the vouchers. Ongoing surveys will reveal whether the target group, i.e., pregnant women and those with young children, are the principal users of the discounted nets. Discussion Social marketing is a novel and promising approach to promote and supply effective malaria control tools. Its excellent track record for interventions as diverse as ORS, condoms and oral contraceptives suggests that it could perform well for the large -scale deployment of ITNs (USAID, 1998). So far the KINET project has achieved good coverage in a large highly endemic rural area, reinforcing positive experiences with social marketing of ITNs in the Central African Republic, Zimbabwe and Rwanda (A. Boner and L. Jamu, personal communication). Large -scale ITNs p rogrammes will always be confronted with the problem of finding agents that are both trusted by the community and effective in selling ITNs. The initial choice of net and treatment agents rested largely with village leaders and this resulted in a great diversity of agents selling KINET products. Our early results suggest that commercial Chapter 4: KINET 55 retailers often provide a better service to their communities than village leaders. Retailers are used to selling goods and usually have a larger working capital to invest i n net and insecticide consignments. Further, they are available at most times of day and easy for potential customers to find. Future expansion is likely to increase the involvement of the private sector. The issue of whether health facilities should also sell ITNs and treatments remains open, and there are no current Ministry of Health guidelines on this matter. With the gradual introduction of cost -sharing in Tanzania the selling of ITNs could find a natural place in the system but the issue of who shoul d keep commission from the sales deserves careful consideration. An interesting contrast is seen in how sales commission is shared between 2 MCH clinics selling ITNs in the KINET area (see also Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo, 1998). In one clinic all the staff partic ipate in the sales and the TSh 500 commission on each sale is shared. In contrast, in the second clinic the rural medical aide in charge alone sells nets and keeps the commission; this has led to resentment among other staff and to less active promotion on their part. In the interests of sustainability it is important to develop a system of wholesalers that follows the existing commercial system. This allows reduction of the intensive investment needed when all agents are supplied weekly by the project. Th e apparently lower cost - recovery to the project with wholesalers is more than offset by the lower distribution cost. Once an efficient wholesale network is established monthly supplies to wholesalers should be sufficient and the project can then easily exp and to a wider area. Nets were relatively common in our area before KINET sales started. We therefore started to promote and sell insecticide for net treatment as soon as possible so that existing nets might be treated. Informal feedback from the communit y suggests that people are often uneasy about bringing their nets out in public, and that they would prefer to treat their nets themselves. We have therefore introduced a home -treatment kit developed in Tanzania (Miller et al. 1998), consisting of a single - dose sachet of insecticide packaged with disposable gloves and locally developed instructions. The relatively high cost of this packaging is offset against the problems of deliberate or accidental misuse of larger quantities of insecticide, and the advan tage that our target group prefer the freedom and privacy of treating their nets at home. Chapter 4: KINET 56 We chose to sell pre -treated nets rather than untreated nets despite the argument that this denies the opportunity of educating people at the time of purchase about t he difference between a treated and an untreated net and how to treat a net. Pilot studies with the home -treatment kit suggest that people do not need special training to treat their nets. Selling pre -treated nets may mean that some people will not realize that they have bought a treated net, but we feel their lack of knowledge is an issue best tackled through ongoing targeted IEC concerning net treatment. For example, our treatment agents can make use of net sales records in order to make follow -up visits to those who have bought a net 3 months previously. They can then offer advice on malaria prevention and a net treatment service. Two key issues remain on the promotion agenda. First, the sales are very seasonal, clearly peaking during the time of maximum mosquito densities. No detailed compliance measures are yet available but it is very likely that the net usage follows the same seasonal pattern. Since malaria transmission is perennial in the Kilombero Valley the all - year use of ITNs needs to be promoted actively. Secondly, KINET is aiming to reach a large and very dispersed rural population with 2 products: nets, for which existing demand is high, and insecticide, for which existing demand is much lower. Promotion will therefore focus increasingly on re -treatment of existing nets and new distribution channels may have to be developed to facilitate this. An optimal balance between affordability, equity and full cost -recovery is difficult to achieve. KINET has a current low level of subsidy on the treated nets (66% cost recovered) and a high level of subsidy on the insecticide (17 % cost recovered). These costs do not cover a mini - mum programme infrastructure nor the cost of promotion: the project loses a substantial amount of money on every sale. As inter national demand for insecticide for net treatment increases it seems likely that cheaper formulations will become available and the cost of insecticide will decrease. Once a stable demand for nets and net treatment exists, retail prices may be increased to wards full cost -recovery levels, with subsidies targeted exclusively through the public health sector using vouchers or in other ways. Although full cost -recovery is an important consideration, there is more to sustainability than full cost - recovery alon e. Many ITNs projects conducted in the past have not survived the end of their project status (e.g., Hill, 1991; Premji et al., 1995) despite a certain level of Chapter 4: KINET 57 infrastructure and a banked revolving fund. Often procurement and ongoing distribution have bee n beyond the capacity of the local groups. One of the strengths of a public -private mix such as that used by KINET is the inherent sustainability of the private sector distribution system. The remaining issues of procurement and promotion are likely to nee d special attention at the end of the 'project status' phase. A low -cost social -marketing support service at district, regional or even national level could provide such inputs. Virtually no other intervention in preventive health is entirely self -supporti ng: if ITNs programmes are (1) feasible on a large scale and (2) efficient through low delivery cost per net or per treatment, they should be able to attract sufficient donor support in the context of the Roll Back Malaria initiative. The question of long -term effect of ITNs on survival in highly endemic areas is important. Since randomized controlled trials are neither feasible nor ethically acceptable, we have chosen observational studies to compare users of ITNs with non -users, both through a case- cont rol study and the long -term follow -up of a birth cohort. Problems remaining include the difficulty of determining use of treated nets and the influence of potential confounders, many of which are difficult to measure. Experience from other areas of health, for example the health impact of smoking or the impact of ORS, suggests that observational studies can make a useful contribution. However, our results will need careful interpretation. Ideally, such long -term follow - up should be carried out in a number of sites. Other African projects are attempting to do this in Ghana and in Burkina Faso where the population formerly involved in the scientific trials (Binka et al., 1996; Habluetzel et al. , 1997) is being followed -up for a further 3 years in order to det ect a possible delayed increase in mortality in the former intervention group compared to the former control group (F. Binka, personal communication; E. Sanogo, personal communication). A similar study is planned in Western Kenya (P. Phillips -Howard, perso - nal communication). The KINET project represents an attempt to see to what extent social marketing is a useful tool in the fight against malaria in a rural African setting. Data are being collected on the key issues of cost and effectiveness of ITNs on child survival, but the results are some time away. In the mean time, the information available to date suggests that social marketing is a useful approach for ITNs, being innovative, popular and sufficiently adaptable to address the varied challenges of a malaria control programme in a rural African setting.

Design: Annual cross -sectional data were collected at the beginning of the social marketing campaign and subsequent two years. Net ownership and other risk and confounding factors were assessed using a questionnaire. Blood samples were taken from the children to assess prevalen ce of parasitaemia and haemoglobin levels. Study participants: A sample of children under two years of age living in 18 villages in the Kilombero river plain, Southwestern Tanzania. Main outcome measures: The presence of any parasitaemia in the periphera l blood sample, and anaemia classified as haemoglobin of less than 8 g/dl. Results: There was a rapid increase in net ownership (from 58 to 83%) and treated net ownership (from 10 to 61%). There was an overall increase in the mean haemoglobin (from 8.0 to 8.9 g/dl) of the study children in the successive surveys. Overall, the prevalence of anaemia in the study population decreased from 49% to 26% in two years of implementation. Treated nets had a protective efficacy of 63% (95% CI: 38, 77) on the prevalenc e and 63% (95% CI: 27, 82) on anaemia. Conclusions These results demonstrate that insecticide treated nets have a substantial impact on morbidity parameters when distributed in a public health setting. Chapter 5: Impact on Malaria morbidity cross -sectional study 64 Introduction Several studies hav e shown a positive correlation between malaria parasitaemia and anaemia, and that parasitaemia is the primary cause of anaemia in very young children in Africa (Kitua et al. 1997). As a result, anaemia is very frequent in young children in high transmissi on areas since malarial infections are the norm. Assessment of the impact of chemoprophylaxis in Tanzanian infants indicated that over 60% of the anaemia could be due to malaria in this age group (Menendez et al. 1997). The emergence and spread of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarials has exacerbated the problem of anaemia in Sub -Saharan Africa (Bloland et al. 1993). Hopes for malaria and malarial anaemia control have recently been revitalised by the demonstration that insecticide treated nets can reduce morbidity and mortality. A summary of randomised controlled trials showed an average protective effect of about 50% on mild malaria episodes in stable malaria areas. Moreover, protective effects were shown on the prevalence of high parasitaemia (31%) and overall mortality (19%). A modest improvement in packed cell volume (2%) and weight gain was also observed in children sleeping under treated nets (Lengeler, 1998). Large scale implementation of ITNs is underway in a number of African countries (Anonymous, 1999). It is not known whether the impressive impact of treated nets in the frame of well controlled randomised controlled trials can be replicated under programme conditions (Lengeler & Snow, 1996). We report the first impact assessment of a large scale treated net social marketing (an approach using marketing techniques to promote and distribute socially beneficial interventions rather than a commercial product) programme on morbidity indicators in children under two years of age in a highly endemic area of Tanzania. Chapter 5: Impact on Malaria morbidity cross -sectional study 65 Methods Study area and population Social marketing of treated nets started in the frame of Kilombero Net Project (KINET) (Schellenberg et al. 1999a) in 1997, covering the Kilombero and Ulanga Districts (population 350,000) in So uthwestern Tanzania. Nets and insecticide (branded \"Zuia Mbu\") are now being promoted, distributed and sold using public and private outlets, and a system of community door -to-door distributors. The retail price of the treated nets was 5.0 US Dollars. Whil e this amount was a non -negligible part of the average annual income in this community, experience shows that a majority of the residents were both willing and able to pay this amount (Schellenberg et al. 1999a). The impact of the programme on morbidity an d mortality indicators is being monitored in 18 villages under demographic surveillance (DSS). Population characteristics of this area of very high perennial malaria transmission have been described elsewhere (Tanner et al. 1991). Moderate anaemia (PCV< 25 %) and severe anaemia occur in 61% and 14% of children under five years admitted at the local St Francis District Hospital (Schellenberg et al. 1999b). Chloroquine resistance is common: 65% of malaria infections do not clear within one week of chloroquine treatment (Hatz et al. 1998). Design Three annual cross -sectional surveys where conducted in a sample of children under two years of age living in the DSS area (Schellenberg et al. 1999a) . The first survey was done at the time of launching the social mar keting campaign in June 1997, and two other surveys were carried out at the same period (June to August) in the subsequent two years. A simple random sample was selected from the DSS database for the first survey, and a two -stage random sampling (sampling 6 villages then sampling children from these) was done for the subsequent surveys. A different sample was selected for each survey. Procedures The selected children were visited at home and a verbal consent obtained from the parent or guardian. A question naire was applied to assess treated net use and other potential risk factors. A physical examination was performed, and temperature, weight and height measurements were also taken. A finger prick blood sample for haemoglobin estimation and parasitological assessment was then taken. Haemoglobin was measured using the portable HemoCue (HemoCue AB, \u00c4ngelholm, Sweden) kit. Slides were stained in Giemsa and Chapter 5: Impact on Malaria morbidity cross -sectional study 66 reading was done (without the microscopists knowing the net status) using standard procedures as describ ed elsewhere (Schellenberg et al. 1999b) . An inspection of the children's sleeping places to assess net use was only done in 1999 because this was strongly perceived as an intrusion in their privacy. Anaemia was classified as haemoglobin level below 8.0 g /dl since this is the level that has been associated with increased mortality (Stoltzfus, 1997) and is consistent with earlier studies in the area (Menendez et al. 1997). Parasitaemia and splenomegaly were classified as either present or absent. Use of tre ated nets was categorised based on the respondent's answers on ownership and if they were \"ever treated\" or \"not treated\". There are currently no simple ways to assess insecticide content on the nets in the field. Data analysis Analysis was done for all the three cross -sectional surveys combined. The impact of the nets on haemoglobin level, anaemia, parasitaemia and splenomegaly was estimated using multiple linear and logistic regression models taking into account the village cluster sampling for year 2 a nd 3, using robust regression approaches in STATA\u00ae (STATA Corp.). The effect of different time points of observation (surveys) was included as one of the explanatory variables. Other factors considered in the multivariate models included use of the net, condition of the net, age, sex, ethnicity, religion, nutritional status, access to the dispensary, shops and covered wells. Treatment history and attitudes toward health seeking were also included, as were factors related to the family size and income. Chapter 5: Impact on Malaria morbidity cross -sectional study 67 Results We identified 985 eligible children. 16 mothers refused consent and 142 could not be traced at their homes. Therefore, mothers and guardians of 827 children were interviewed during the three cross -sectional surveys. 68 children were over twenty four months old at the time of sampling, and the net status was not known for 11 children, and therefore only 748 (91%) children were included in the analysis. Children analysed and those not analysed had similar proportions of anaemia and reported ownership of nets (data not shown). We observed an increase in the mean haemoglobin level from 8.0 to 8.9 g/dl and a decline in the proportion of children with anaemia (49% to 26%), to 49%), during the successive s urveys (Table 1). The proportion of children having any net increased from 58% to 83% and those having treated nets increased dramatically during the 3 years (from 10% to 61%) indicating a rapid uptake of the socially marketed treated nets, especially in t he first year of the implementation (Table1).

This was expected as the treated nets were being sold. By the end of the 2nd year of implementation only 16% of the children were without a net. Children with no access to piped or covered wells i.e. not at the centre of the villag es, were less likely to have nets (Table 2). Mothers that mentioned that they would advise their neighbours to send their sick children to a formal health facility were more likely to have nets for their own children (OR=2.3 Likelihood Ratio Test -2, p val ue=0.048). This might reflect an association between health seeking patterns or perceptions about the value of the formal health system and the decision to have a net or not. Observation of sleeping places for 171 children in 1999 revealed that, among tho se who claimed to be using nets, 92.9% (117/126) had a net hanging at the sleeping place. For all 9 children who had a missing net at the sleeping place, we were shown a net claimed to be used. Among those that claimed not to be using nets, 17% (8/45) had a net hanging at the sleeping place. These observations indicated that reported ownership and use provided a reasonable basis for defining bed net status. Health impact of treated nets We observed a protective efficacy (defined as 1 -odds ratio \u00d7 100) on the prevalence of to 77%) and 51% (95% CI: 0 to 76) for treated and untreated nets respectively, when compared with children without nets (Table 3). Parasite prevalence was also related to ethnic group, religious affiliation, use of the net in the previous month and age of the child, with the prevalence in those more than 1 year of age being four times higher than those below 7 months. This is consistent with earlier studies in the same area, which demonstrated that prevalence of parasitaemia increased with age (Kitua et al. 1996; Smith et al. 1999).

Multiple regression analysis showed that there was an increase of haemoglobin of 1.3 g/dl (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.7) for those with treated nets and 1.1 g/dl (95% CI: 0.5 to 1. 7) for those with untreated nets compared to those with no nets. Considering the classification of anaemia, a protective efficacy of 37% (95% CI: (95% CI:27 to 82%) for treated nets was observed. Those classified as st unted or as having no access to covered wells were more likely to be anaemic (Table 4). If the cut -off level for anaemia was set at 11g/dl, untreated nets had a protective efficacy of 78% (95% CI:29 to 93%) 94%). itaemia was associated with anaemia: children with high parasitaemia had lower mean haemoglobin compared to those who had no or few parasites ( 2-trend, p<0.001). Lastly, nets had also a high impact on prevalence of splenomegaly with a protective efficacy of 71% (95% CI:39 to for untreated nets and 76% (95% CI:52 to 88%) for treated nets. For children without nets, their prevalence of anaemia remained relatively stable over the study period (between 49% and 58%) and this was also the case for the pr evalence of parasitaemia (between 68% and 71%). This suggests that there were no major changes in the malaria situation during the period under evaluation. Discussion These results have demonstrated that the social marketing approach of distributing insec ticide treated nets was very successful and resulted quickly in more than 80% of children under two years of age having access to a net. Our results suggest an overall impact of social marketing of treated nets on health outcomes in the community, with an improvement of mean haemoglobin levels (from 8.0 to 8.9 g/dl) and a decline in the total proportion of children with anaemia (from 49% to 26%), parasitaemia or splenomegaly. The treated nets had an apparent individual protective efficacy of over 60% on the prevalence of anaemia, parasitaemia and splenomegaly. In this study untreated nets were also found to be protective. Overall, most of the changes occurred in the first year of implementation. These efficacy estimates are higher than those from most cont rolled trials (Table 5). It is therefore pertinent to question whether this finding may be the result of residual confounding despite the effort made to control for it. This is especially so because our comparison group Chapter 5: Impact on Malaria morbidity cross -sectional study 74 was made up of children who did not own nets (non -adopters) in the same community. The tools used to measure confounding factors like social -economic status and health seeking may not be sensitive enough to allow for proper control of confounding. However, factors related to the dynamics of the malaria infection and the associated disease presentation may also explain this finding. For example, it has been observed that variations in transmission strongly affect the estimates of morbidity and mortality in very young children (Marsh & Snow, 1999). Therefore at a given transmission intensity the age of the study participants may be crucial in determining the level of protection. Our finding of high impact in children under two years is in line with other studies that included very young children (Table 5). Lower impact estimates than ours were observed in a randomised study near Ifakara in a similar age group (Fraser -Hurt et al. 1999). This may be due to fact that our study covered a larger geographical area and included study children with a lower average haemoglobin (average haemoglobin of those without nets 7.7 g/dl vs. 8.7 g/dl , t -test =3.9: p=0.0001). It is probable that more anaemic children are more likely to benefit from the intervention. We conclude that treated nets distributed th rough a social marketing programme setting were effective and produced a rapid and high impact on parasitaemia and anaemia prevalence in children under two years of age. This strategy has high potential in the control of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Methods: A dispensary based case -control study was carried out in one village in Tanzania. Each case of fever and parasitaemia in a child under five years was paired with one community and one dispensary control without fever and parasitaemia. Cases and controls were compared with regard to ITNs ownership and other factors assessed by a questionnaire. A cross -sectional survey of factors associated with parasitaemia, including ITN use, w as carried out during the study. Dispensary attendance rates of the study children were calculated using the passive case detection data. Results: Cases and dispensary controls had higher dispensary attendance rates compared to community controls and chil dren with nets attended more for most of the illness events. A comparison of cases and community controls showed a strong and statistically significant association between untreated net use and being a case (OR 2.1: 95%CI 1.3, 3.4). For those with ITNs the re was a smaller and weaker association between risk of being a case and ITN use (OR 1.4: 95%CI 0.9, 2.2). Comparison of cases and dispensary controls showed no association between untreated or treated nets and the risk of being a case (for treated nets OR 0.9 : 95%CI 0.5, 1.4 and for untreated nets OR 1.2: 95%CI 0.7, 2.0). These results are contrary to those from the cross -sectional assessment, where children with ITNs had a lower prevalence of parasitaemia than those with no nets (OR 0.5: 95%CI 0.3 - 0.9), and also contrary to other assessments of the health impact of ITNs in this population. Conclusion: The positive association between mild malaria and net ownership is counter -intuitive and best explained by attendance bias, since children with nets att ended more frequently for all curative and preventive services at the dispensary than those without nets. Dispensary -Chapter 6: Assessment of impact on Malar ia morbidity, case -control study 82 based case -control studies may not be appropriate for assessing impact of treated nets on clinical malaria. Introduction: Intervention pro grammes for community health problems in developing countries have usually been implemented after their efficacy was demonstrated in randomised controlled field trials. Recently more emphasis has been put in assessing the performance of such interventions under programme conditions before wide -scale use (Habicht et al. 1999) . These evaluations aim to test whether the benefits of the interventions observed under trial conditions are retained in a programme setting. Pos itive results will encourage allocation of resources to sustain and expand the programmes to cover whole populations in endemic countries (Lengeler & Snow, 1996) . Experience in the impact evaluation of health intervention programmes is limited (Lengeler & Snow, 1996) . These Phase IV assessments are complicated by the absence of appropriate control populations and biased access to interventions and health services. Also, there is usually a limited opportunity for establishing an elaborate evaluation system that may be required to accurately assess exposure and outcome events in the target population (Habicht et al. 1999; Mohr, 2000) . Therefore, inexpensive, simple and non - intrusive evaluation tools are r equired. Case -control studies have been proposed as the most convenient and appropriate tools in the evaluation of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) programmes (Lengeler & Snow, 1996) . This was further advocated after the first ITNs programme evaluation in the Gambia (D'Alessandro et al. 1997) . Case -control studies are attractive because they can be performed relatively cheaply and qu ickly after the initiation of the intervention (Habi cht et al. 1999) . But they also face well -described problems of bias and confounding, as with all observational studies (Schlesselman, 1982) . The use of \"passive case detection\" through clinics rather than through active surve illance simplifies a case -control study (Rowland et al. 1997) and may improve classification of disease status (Kirkwood et al. 1997) . However, this increases the difficulty of selecting appropriate controls. Chapter 6: Assessment of impact on Malar ia morbidity, case -control study 83 Alternatively, cross -sectional surveys can be done. These assess prevalence and lack the time sequence between exposure and disease events if a single survey is carried out (Kirkwoo d et al. 1997) . However, repeated cross -sectional studies have been used to assess impact of ITNs programmes (Barutwanayo et al. 1991; D'Alessandro et al. 1995; Bortel et al. 1996; Abdulla et al. 2001) . Here we describe a case control study relying on passive case detection in an area of Tanzania where other studies have reported a positive impact of an ITNs social marketing programme on child health and survival (Abdulla et al. 2001; Schellenberg et al. 2001) . The programme utilised marketing techniques to promote, distribute and sell pre -treated bed nets and insecticide kits for re -treatment (Schellenberg et al. 1999) . Methods: Study site and population: The study was conducted in Ide te village (08o 5' S; 36o 30' E), Kilombero District, Southeast Tanzania. The village is one of 18 in the Kilombero Valley within a demographic surveillance system (DSS) (Schellenberg et al. 1999) . The area has intense year-round malaria transmission (Charlwood et al. 1998) . Prompt diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases is the main control strategy and resistance to chloroquine, the first line antimalarial at the time of the study, was high (Mshinda et al. 1996) . Children under five years of age living in all the hamlets (vitongoji) of Idete village were included in the study. Case -control study: All children in the DSS database who were under the age of five on 1st February 1998 were assigned a study number and given a special card bearing the name, date of birth, the area of residence and DSS identifiers. This list was updated every 6 months to include new-borns a nd children who had migrated into the village. A passive case detection system (PCD) operated at the only local dispensary between February 1998 and August 1999 and all children under five years who attended the dispensary for any complaints were eligibl e. A standard form was filled out and a blood sample was taken on all children who had a history of fever in the previous 48 hours, or a presumptive diagnosis of malaria. Haemoglobin (Hb) was measured using the Hemocue\u00ae (HemoCue AB, \u00c4ngelholm, Sweden) system and thick and thin films were prepared for microscopy. Records were also kept for all children who were not sick and had attended for preventive reasons, such as Chapter 6: Assessment of impact on Malar ia morbidity, case -control study 84 growth monitoring. Children with a temperature of more than 37.4 OC and any parasitaemia we re classified as cases. For each case, one age matched dispensary control was chosen among the children who had come for growth monitoring or attended for being sick for another cause than malaria, within two weeks of the attendance of the case. An addit ional community control was chosen from the DSS database matched for age and area of residence (hamlet). If a suitable control could not be found then a child of an adjacent hamlet was chosen. Both cases and controls were then visited at home, individual v erbal consent was asked from the guardian and a questionnaire applied. A blood sample was taken from controls who had not given a blood sample at the dispensary in the two weeks prior to the day of the interview. Controls with temperature more than 37.4 an d any parasitaemia were excluded in the analysis. Cases and controls were not eligible for recruitment again as either cases or controls for a period of one month. Cross -sectional survey: In June -August 1998, all children under five years of age on 1st February 1998 were visited at home and a questionnaire applied to assess their use of ITNs and other risk factors for malaria infection and anaemia (using a similar approach to the case -control study). A blood sample (for malaria parasites and Hb estimatio n) was taken for children who had not given a blood sample at the dispensary in the two weeks prior the day of the interview. The position of all houses with children under five and the dispensary were also determined using a portable Global Positioning Sy stem device (Garmin International, Kansas City, USA). The geo -referenced points were then used to calculate the distance from each child's house to the dispensary. Dispensary attendance rates: The PCD data were linked to the DSS data to estimate dispensa ry attendance rates for different illnesses among study children. Attendance for malaria as well as for growth monitoring and other non -malaria related illnesses (including injuries, burns, fungal infestations, conjunctivitis, abscesses, etc.) was done. M osquito net ownership was ascribed from the cross -sectional data. Chapter 6: Assessment of impact on Malar ia morbidity, case -control study 85 Analysis: In the case -control assessment, cases of mild malaria were compared with controls primarily with regard to their exposure to ITNs. Both unmatched and matched pairs multivariate analysis using logistic regression was carried out using Stata version 6 (Stata Corporation, Texas USA). The risk or confounding factors considered included the number of people in the room where the child slept , sex of the child, age category, time to th e nearest shop, access to clean water source, tribe, if the mother or guardian would advise neighbour to send a child sick with fever to a formal health facility, religious affiliation, nutritional status, vaccination status, antimalarial and antipyretic u se, mother/guardian's literacy and the condition of the net in terms of the number of holes and its use in the previous month. Family income (quantiles of total family income), which was assessed by asking on the average monthly income from various activit ies of the family, was also considered. Significance testing was done using the likelihood ratio test. For the cross - sectional assessment, t he parasitaemia and anaemia were compared between users and non-users of ITNs, after controlling for confounding usi ng logistic regression. Results: Case -control study: Idete village had a total of 881 children under five in the DSS database on 1st February 1998. A total of 3389 visits of children under five years of age were recorded at the dispensary between Februa ry 1998 and August 1999. A total of 587 mild malaria cases were identified which were individually matched with 424 dispensary and 555 community controls. For some cases we could not identify a suitable control from the database and not all of the identifi ed cases and controls could be traced at their homes because of either travelling or moving to farm houses that could not be located. Those available for interview were 461 cases (78.5%), 333 (78.5%) dispensary controls and 423 (76.2 %) community controls. 7 community controls and 8 dispensary controls had fever and parasitaemia and were excluded in the analysis. 40 cases, 45 community and 17 dispensary controls were excluded due to missing information on actual distance to the dispensary. Chapter 6: Assessment of impact on Malar ia morbidity, case -control study 86 Interviewed chi ldren had an average age of 26 months (95%CI: 24 , 27) for cases, 26 months (95%CI: 25 , 27) for community and 25 months (95%CI: 23 , 26) for dispensary controls. The mean Hb was 9.2 g/dl (95%CI: 9.0 , (95%CI: for communit y controls and 10.1 (95%CI: 9.9 , 10.4) for dispensary controls. The Hb difference between cases and either controls reached statistical significance (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests: p<0.001). Important risk factors for becoming a case compared to community con trols included having a net and living far away from the dispensary. In the unmatched analysis, those with untreated nets were about twice as likely to be cases than those without nets (OR 2.1: 95%CI 1.3, 3.4). Those with ITNs also appeared to be more lik ely to be cases (OR 1.4: 95%CI 0.9, 2.2) but the relationship was not statistically significant (Table 1a). When comparison was made using dispensary controls, there was no apparent protective effect of either untreated nets nets (OR 1.2: 95%CI 0.7, 2.0) (Table1b) and only a small effect of treated nets, which did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.9: 95%CI 0.5, 1.4). Similar results were observed with matched analysis (data not shown). Distance to the dispensary was a significant predictor of being a case compared to both types of controls. Those living more than 3 kilometres away were twice more likely to be cases (community controls (OR 1.9: 95%CI 1.1, 3.1) and dispensary controls (OR 2.6: 95%CI 1.5, 4.7). There were no other risk factors associat ed with being a case. Dispensary Attendance: Cases and dispensary controls had dispensary attendance rates of 12.5 per thousand while the rate was only 10.7 per thousand for community controls. Children with nets attended more for most of the illness ev ents (Table 2). Distance from the dispensary was a limiting factor for attendance observed by the decrease in overall attendance with increasing distance to the dispensary (chi -square for trend p<0.001). Ownership of ITNs was an indicator for higher utilis ation of the dispensary for those living between 0.5 and 3 kilometres but not for those living very close or very far from the dispensary (Table 2). Cross -sectional study: In total 652 children were interviewed in the cross -sectional assessment. The anal ysis included 629 (96.5%) children for whom we had information on both the net and Hb status. The characteristics of the children included in the analysis of the cross -sectional survey Chapter 6: Assessment of impact on Malar ia morbidity, case -control study 87 showed that those without nets had a higher prevalence of parasitaemia, anaemia and splenomegaly (Table 3). Comparison of those with ITNs and with no nets in a multivariate analysis showed that those with ITNs had a lower prevalence of any parasitaemia (OR 0.5: 95%CI 0.3 - 0.9). Age of the child and distance to the dispensary were other important factors (Table 4). Positive effects of treated nets were also shown for prevalence of anaemia. Discussion: We found a positive association between risk of clinical malaria and ownership of mosquito nets using a case -control design. This finding is counter -intuitive and contradicts the results of the cross -sectional assessment the same village and a repeated cross -sectional assessment conducted in the surrounding villages, which suggested an impact of the ITNs in reducing the prevale nce of anaemia and parasitaemia by 60% (Abdulla et al. 2001) . An estimated 27% reduction in childhood deaths associated with treated nets has also been shown in the same area (Schellenberg et al. 2001). The disc repancy is likely to be a consequence of attendance bias in the Idete case -control study. Children with nets attended more frequently for all the services at the dispensary, which may be explained by the higher awareness of health issues or as a consequenc e of the dispensary being one of the ITN sales outlets. Hence, the exposure of interest pre -determined to some extent the recruitment, resulting in analysis and estimation of impact to be done on an already selected group of individuals. Those with nets wo uld be included as cases if they became sick. But those without nets were less likely to attend the health facility so although they were eligible to be community controls they were not likely to be seen as cases if they became sick with malaria. Thus, the community controls were not comparable with cases and both cases and dispensary controls were not comparable with the general population in the area. The lack of a statistically significant association between ITN ownership and being a case when consideri ng dispensary controls may be due to a lack of power or to the fact that the exposure of interest also determined the likelihood of being a dispensary control. Attendance bias is neither easily measured nor can it be corrected for in the analysis (Sackett, 1979) .

All these variables were dropped as their log-likelihood ratio test p value was more than 0.05. Chapter 6: Assessment of impact on Malar ia morbidity, case -control study 92 Case -control studies for the evaluation of an intervention, usually compares the risk of being diagnosed with the disease among the adopters and non -adopters of the intervention, which will be similar to assessments using either longitudinal or cross - sectional studies (Kirkwood et al. 1997) . For all these approaches, the adopters of the intervention are likely to differ from non -adopters in subtle but important ways that cannot be assessed or controlled for in the analysis. The comparis on of adopters vs. non - adopters answers a different type of question from intervention vs. control, with the former measuring the health benefit of those who adopt rather than health impact per se (Kirkwood et al. 1997). Therefore the results of these two comparisons cannot be directly compared. In an ITNs programme, a randomly allocated contemporaneous control group (Lengeler & Snow, 1996) would no longer be ethically acceptable or feasible, as this involves withholding nets from some groups given their proven i mpact on mortality. The comparisons of adopters vs. non -adopters in our studies illustrate an particular difficulty of assessing ITNs programme impact where ITNs use is very high. It may then be impossible to make this comparison because of the small num bers of non -adopters, who will represent a highly selected group. Furthermore, the likelihood that there is a \"mass effect\" of the ITNs (Howard et al. 2000) may give some protection to non -adopters and this reduces differences in the malaria disease burden between adopters and non -adopters. The logistical difficulty of obtaining enough cases and controls adds to the complexity of such studies. In our study the recruitment extended over 18 months and had a high rate of non-interviewed cases and controls. I n the previous study in the Gambia a difference in the timing and recruitment pattern of the community and health facility controls was thought to be the source of discrepancy in the study results (D'Alessa ndro et al. 1997) . Together, these observations call into question the usefulness of health facility based case-control studies for evaluating the morbidity impact of ITNs programmes. An alternative study design would have been to use active case detectio n in the community. All children in the village could be visited at home every week, temperature taken from all and blood slides from those with fever. The cases would then those with fever and parasitaemia and the controls would be a random sample of thos e without. However, this is logistically more complex and expensive, and hence usually unrealistic in the frame of a programme evaluation. Chapter 6: Assessment of impact on Malar ia morbidity, case -control study 93 The lack of a simple test to check for insecticide content of the nets (Drakeley C.J. et al. 1999) meant that exposure to ITNs could not be accurately ascertained as suggested by work in The Gambia (Muller et al. 1994; D'Alessandro et al. 1997) . Reported ownership of ITNs may have led to some misclassification of exposure in our studies and reduced the power. The finding that distance to the dispensary is an important predictor of attendance is in line with findings elsewhere (Stock et al. 1983) . However, it is unclear if the observation of more cases from those living far from the dispensary indicates a true occurrence of more disease in the periphery of the village, or if it is just a reflection of patterns of dispensary attendance and self -medication for malaria episodes in the village. Furthermore, the odds ratios need to be interpreted with caution as cases and controls were matched on area of residence. Every health programme implementing interventions shown to be effective in randomised controlled trials aims to demonstrate that the desired health impact is also achieved under large -scale implementation - and if not, then why. However, given that (1) programme staff are unlikely to be familiar with epidemiological studies and (2) most programmes wish to invest more of their resources in implementation rather than monitoring, a compromise with regard to the optimal study des ign will have to be made. The use of simple cross - sectional surveys seems to be an attractive option, if suitable health outcomes can be identified and relevant exposure measures are feasible.

Uniform high coverage of ITNs characterised these trials and this resulted in some protection of nearby non -users of ITNs. We have n ow assessed the coverage, distribution pattern and resultant spatial effects in one village in Tanzania where ITNs were distributed in a social marketing programme. The prevalence of parasitaemia, mild anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dl) and moderate/severe anaemia (Hb < 8 g/dl) in children under five was assessed cross -sectionally. Data on ownership of ITNs were collected and inhabitants' houses were mapped. One year after the start of the social marketing programme, 52% of the children were using a net which had bee n treated at least once. The ITNs were rather homogeneously distributed throughout the village at an average density of about 118 ITNs per thousand population. There was no evidence of a pattern in the distribution of parasitaemia and anaemia cases, but ch ildren living in areas of moderately high ITNs coverage were about half less likely to have moderate/severe anaemia (OR 0.5, 95%CI: 0.2 , 0.9) and had lower prevalence of splenomegaly, irrespective of their net use. No protective effects of coverage were f ound for prevalence of mild anaemia nor for parasitaemia. The use of untreated nets had neither coverage nor short distance effects. More efforts should be made to ensure high coverage in ITNs programmes to achieve maximum benefit. Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 99 Introduction: There is growing interest on insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) as a tool for malaria control, after randomised controlled trials showed that they reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria (Lengeler, 1998) . Large scale implementation programmes are underway focusing mainly on operational issues of delivery and distribution of ITNs in a sustainable manner (Anonymous, 1999) . The ITNs act by both being a physical barrier protecting those sleeping under the m and by killing and repelling mosquitoes hence reducing the survival and infection rates (Lines, 1996) . Hence those with the ITNs and who use them properly have a reduced exposure to malaria infecting mosquitoes and consequently reduced malaria disease burden. The distribution pattern and coverage levels attained in implementati on programmes may determine the level of protection observed in those who use them (D'Alessandro et al. 1995; Binka et al. 1998; Howard et al. 2000). Protection is highest among persons with ITNs living in areas with hig h ITN coverage and use. There are indications that people without nets sleeping nearby ITNs are also protected. Earlier work showed some short range (within the same room) protective effects of ITNs (Lines et al. 1987) while other studies did not show such protection (Rowland et al. 1996) . Work conducted in Ghana supports the claims of short distance protective effects (those near ITNs are also protected) on those without bed nets. Among non -users the mortality risk increased by 6.7% with every 100 meters shift away from the nearest compound with treated bed nets (Binka et al. 1998) . In the Kenyan coast those living up to 0.5 kilometers away had also lower hospi tal attendance rates for severe disease (Howard et al. 2000). In the randomised studies ITNs were distributed free to all the intervention groups and uniformly high coverage was ensured (Binka et al. 1998;Habluetzel et al. 1997;Nevill et al. 1996) , while in the programme setting the pattern of distribution is dependent on the many factors that determine the uptake of the ITNs intervention. These include social economic factors, distribution channels and local perceptions a bout ITNs (Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo . 1998 ; Snow et al. 1999; Minja et al. 2001) . This has lead to speculation on what might happen when ITNs a re distributed in a programme setting. Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 100 It is not clear what patterns of spatial distribution of ITNs will occur in social marketing schemes. Conceivably, market mechanisms may lead to ITNs being widely but thinly distributed, with thus a relatively low coverage. This may be a more efficient way of conferring protection for those without ITNs (Binka et al. 1998) . Alternatively, ITNs might end up being concentrated where the wealthiest people are whilemalaria transmission an d disease is more likely to be concentrated on the poorest segment of the population, who tend live on the edges of the villages and may be less likely to have nets (Bonilla & Rodriguez . 1993; Smith et al. 1995 ; Charlwood et al. 1998; Abdulla et al 2001) . Therefore, spatial effects of ITNs may be important in the understanding and interpretation of the results of impact assessments of ITNs programmes for malaria control. We report the investigation of the spatial pattern of ITNs in one village covered by a large scale ITNs social marketing programme and the consequent effects on malaria morbidity indicators in children under five years of age. Methods: Study population and design. The study was conducted in Idete villag e, South Western Tanzania (08o 5' S; 36o 30' E). The residents are mainly subsistence farmers and the main crop is rain fed rice. This is an area of intense year -round malaria transmission. The main vectors are Anopheles gambiae ss, arabiensis and Anopheles 1993; Charlwood et al. 1998) . A social marketing programme for ITNs has been implemented in this area since May 1997 (Schellenberg et al. 1999) . A cross -sectional assessment of all children under five living in all the hamlets ('vitongoji') of Idete was done at the end of the main rainy season June - August 1998. Details of the survey are described elsewhere (Abdulla et al. 2002) . In summary, children were visited at home and a questionnaire was applied to assess us e of ITNs and other risk factors for malaria infection and anaemia. A physical examination was carried out and a blood Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 101 sample was taken. The sample was screened for malaria parasites and haemoglobin level (Hb) was assessed using Hemocue (Angelholm, Sweden ). Age and sex data for the community were available from a Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) established to allow the evaluation of impact of the social marketing programme (Schellenberg et al. 1999). ITNs ownership was also assessed in the 4 monthly cycles within the framework of the DSS. Mapping: The position of the houses and other important service outlets including the dispensary, were determined using a portable Global Positioning System (G armin, Thousand oaks, USA). The geo -referenced points were then used to calculate distance between houses and between the houses and the dispensary. Coverage of ITNs and untreated nets were calculated for each individual child in the cross -sectional survey . The number of nets per 1000 population living in houses other than the index child and within specific radii were calculated. Radii of 50m (R 50), 100m (R 100), 200m (R 200) and 400m (R 400) were chosen, on the basis of the findings of other studies (Binka et al. 1998;Hii et al. 2001) . Coverage was categorised as low (0 ITNs/1000 persons), moderate (1 -300 ITNs/1000 person s) and high (>300 ITNs the cross -sectional assessment were compared between users and non-users of ITNs, after controlling fo r confounding using logistic regression analysis. The explanatory variables also included ITNs coverage and distance to the dispensary (Abdulla et al. 2002) . Logistic models were also used to assess the effect s of different risk factors on mild and moderate/severe anaemia. Random effects were added on the logit scale of these models to take into account the spatial structure of the data, that is, log(pi / 1- pi) = b t i + ei Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 102 where pi is the outcome probab ility, b the vector of coefficients and i the vector of covariates for individual i. Spatial correlation was incorporated in the random effects ei, by parameterising their covariance matrix f(dij) where dij measures the Eu clidean distance between location si and sj. We modeled an exponential decrease of spatial correlation with distance by adopting: f(dij) = exp( -r dij) but also compared the fit of this model with others, considering different choices of spatial covariance types using the Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Explanatory variables, such as age, distance to dispensary etc., were discretizised into several categories. The analysis was done using the SAS GLIMMIX macro, which uses iteratively reweighted likeliho ods (Wolfinger & O'Connell 1993) to fit the models. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess the significance of the explanatory variables on the outcomes. Results: 652 children were examined in the cross -sectional survey. Details of their characteristics and the assessment of the im pact of ITNs on occurrence of anaemia and parasitaemia have been described elsewhere (Abdulla et al. 2002) . In short, those children using ITNs had lower risk of anaemia (OR 0.47 0.75) and moder ate/severe anaemia (OR 0.66,95%CI: 0.32, 1.37) compared to those without nets at all. The relationship did not reach statistical significance for moderate/severe anaemia. A statistically significant difference was also observed on the prevalence of any par asitaemia (OR 0.53,95%CI: 0.33 - 0.85). Other risk factors identified included distance to the dispensary, which was positively correlated to the prevalence of moderate/severe anaemia, and any parasitaemia. Coverage effects: The DSS database had 941 house holds in Idete at the time of the cross -sectional assessment. 708 (75.2 %) were present in the village and their houses mapped at the time of mapping exercise. The mapped houses had significantly more members on average, a higher proportion with children u nder five and fewer single member households than those not mapped (Table 1).

Analysis presented here was restricted to 564 (90.1%) children classified as DSS members and who had information avail able on geo -location, bed net and anaemia status. The mean ITN coverage in the study area was 118.8 per 1000 inhabitants (range 0 - 1000). As defined by coverage at 100 meters (C 100), 259 (45.1%) children lived in low, 256 (44.5%) moderate and 60 (10.4%) i n high ITNs coverage areas (Table 2). Children living in the different 3 coverage levels had similar average age, average haemoglobin level, proportions with mild anaemia and parasitaemia (Table 2). But those living in moderate and high coverage had signi ficantly lower proportions of moderate/severe anaemia and splenomegaly than those living in low coverage areas (9% vs 16.2 and 22.8% vs. 33.6% respectively). Significantly higher proportions of children in the moderate and high coverage groups were living within one and a half kilometers of the dispensary (Table 2). Similar proportions of children with ITNs were observed in the three areas, indicating that coverage did not predict children's net ownership. However, those living further from the centre of th e village had a lower proportion of ITNs (173 versus 93 per thousand population for those living within 500 meters and those living over 3 kilometers respectively: extended Kruskal -Wallis test for trend, p < 0.01) The model used to explore the effect s of different risk factors on having moderate/severe anaemia (Abdulla et al. 2002) was adjusted to investigate the effect of coverage. The results indicate that coverage was an important factor for predicting the risk of having anaemia even after controlling for the other already identified factors (Table 3). There was less moderate/severe anaemia among those living in moderate (OR 0.46, 95%CI: 0.23, 0.91) and high (OR 0.33, 95%CI: 0.09, 1.16) ITNs coverage ar ea compared to those living in low coverage areas. This indicates that coverage is independently associated with the occurrence of moderate/severe anaemia in the study area. Analysis using other radii did not show significant results for moderate/severe anaemia nor other outcome variables assessed. Furthermore no coverage effects were observed for untreated nets for any radii or morbidity indicators.

Logistic regression without covariates and including or excluding a spatial adjustment, also did not show any differen ce in the residuals. The conclusion was confirmed by testing the effects of different spatial correlations structures and by variogram analysis of the residuals from the non spatial model. Multivariate logistic models incorporating spatial (exponential) ef fects estimated slightly larger standard errors for the fixed effects parameter estimates but this did not reduced the number of significant covariates (data not shown). Discussion: Relatively good coverage of ITNs in the target group (children and expec tant mothers) was achieved in the social marketing programme. About 61% of children under two years (Abdulla et al. 2001) and 52% of children under five years (Abd ulla et al. 2002) slept under a net treated at least once. This is similar to findings of an earlier exploratory study in the same area using a similar delivery mechanism (Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo 1998) and in Burundi (Van Bortel et al. 1996) . Assessment of coverage effects show that children who lived in areas with high ITNs coverage had significantly lower anaemia levels when coverage within 100 meters was considered, indicating that the prevalence of anaemia is better explained by nearby ITN coverage than by personal protection alone. This was similar to effects of ITN coverage on malaria exposure (Lines et al. 1987) , on severe disease (Howard et al. 2000) and on mortality (Binka et al. 1998) . However, unlike the studies in Papua New Guniea (PNG) (Hii et al. 2001) and in Burundi (Van Bortel et al. 1996) , we did not find any effect of bed net coverage on prevalence of parasitaemia. This may be because the prevalence of parasitaemia is not very closely linked to transmission intensity in areas of high endemicity (Thomas & Lindsay 2000) . Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 108 Figure 1A: Spatial distribution of houses in Idete village Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 109 Figure 1B: Spatial distribution of ITNs in Idete village Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 110 Figure 1C: Spatial distribution of parasitaemia in Idete village Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 111 Figure 1D: Spatial distribution of anaemia in Idete village Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 112 Unlike the work in PNG (Hii et al. 2001) , the coverage effects in our study were significant only when considering C 100. It may be that at lower radii the coverage effects are higher but we had wider confidence intervals. While at higher radii, the coverage effects are close to zero. It may also be that the effects of the other ITNs around out -weigh the effects of ITNs of the index child at this range, beyond which the coverage effects gets smaller. O r it may be that only at this distance the existing distribution structure of the ITNs makes a difference. Lastly, although some attempt has been made to control for differences in confounding factors like soc -economic status (Abdulla et al. 2002) , it is still possible that some of the coverage effects that we have observed are mainly a reflection of residual confounding effects. All these issues allow us to make only crude statements about the relationship bet ween coverage effects and morbidity indicators in children. Allowance for spatial structure with the generalised linear mixed model did not substantially alter the point estimates from the fixed effects logistic regression and there was no residual spati al pattern detectable in the models including distance to the dispensary. Hence the fixed effects models adequately described the relationship of the effects of ITNs on anaemia. The finding that the malaria indicators are related to measured distance from the household to the dispensary (Abdulla et al. 2002) presumably reflects the importance of the health seeking behaviour and treatment of malaria on these indicators. Demonstration of diversion or no diversion of mosquitoes (through entomological assessment) might have given some insights to the effects of ITNs that are not easily detectable using morbidity parameters. The lack of spatial patterns in the distribution of ITNs and morbidity parameters may be a result of imprecision in our tools and methods. Errors in ascertainment of geo -positions with non -differential GPS (Hightower et al. 1998) and net treatment with reliance on histories provide by relatives contribute to the limitations of the study. The area studied may have been too small to detect any spatial patterns. Work conducted in a wider geographical area indicated that children living on the fringes of the populated area had more disease (Abdulla et al. 2001) . A further investigation of the spatial effects in a larger geographical area is therefore required. The results indicate that the social marketing campaign has managed to make the ITNs widely available ev en to those who live on the edge of the inhabited areas, where the risk Chapter 7: Spatial effects of ITNs 113 of malaria disease is likely to be concentrated (Binka et al. 1998) . This may have led to some protection being conferred to those without nets and those with untreated nets. In Kenya, a lower risk of admission to hospital for malaria has been observed in children not using ITNs but living in areas with high ITNs coverage compared to those in areas without ITNs (Howard et al. 2000) . This phenomenon has bearing on the estimated effectiveness of the ITNs observed in programme evaluations. The reduced risk for those near the ITNs will bias the measured effect toward zero if a simple comparison is made of users and non-users. Hence, estimates of effectiveness made by our program (Abdulla et al. 2001, Schellenberg et al. 2001 ) are likely to be conservative. Data was too sparse in our study to observe any increase or decrease of dis ease in those without nets, or examine the effects of those without nets living within different coverage levels or non users living in houses with treated or untreated nets. The cross -sectional survey conducted in a larger geographical area did not show a ny change in the prevalence of anaemia nor parasitaemia in those without nets in the three years of observation (Abdulla et al. 2001) . However, a comparison of the age specific parasitaemia prevalence rates w ith historical values show that the children both those with and those without ITNs had much less malaria in current studies than a decade ago (Fig 2). This trend indicates that a substantial reduction in malaria endemicity has occurred in the last decade. This may well represent a further beneficial effect of the social marketing program which has not been accounted for in evaluations to date. We conclude that the social marketing of ITNs resulted in a relatively homogenous distribution of ITNs in the vil lage. There are indications that coverage of ITNs was important in determining the prevalence of anaemia in children and high coverage produces higher impact of ITNs. Hence, efforts should be made to achieve high coverage in ITN programmes. In order to exp lore this important aspect further, analyses should be done in a larger geographical area together with entomological assessment.

Children who had received rescue medication within the first 48 h or had a neg ative slide at the same time were excluded. Seven -day parasitological cure rates were 94% the same definition, the 14 - day parasitological cure rates were suppressed by CGP 56697 than by chloroquine. There were no major adverse events with either drug. CGP 56697 is highly efficacious against P. falciparum in th is area of Tanzania. The study contributes to the discussion on treatment strategies, particularly whether chloroquine may still fulfil its role as first -Iine drug in an area of high malaria transmission and very high levels of chloroquine resistance. Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 122 Introduction The development of Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant to currently available antimalarial drugs is a main concern and problem confronting governments and health authorities. Whereas resistance of this parasite against quinine, mefloquine, halofantrine and other antimalarials exists in South -east Asia, the situation in Africa is also alarming despite susceptibility to the newer antimalarials. The efficacy of chloroquine, the most affordable drug on the continent with the highest morbidity an d mortality due to malaria, is decreasing. The 7 -day cure rate of a standard dose of 25 mg/kg of chloroquine given over 3 days was recently reported to be at 80% in the Kilombero area (Mshinda et al. 1996). Quinine resistance is also reported from some Afr ican countries (Adagu et al. 1996). lt is estimated that the annual worldwide death rate from malaria will rise to 7 million if quinine - resistance reaches the same levels in Africa as it does in South -east Asia (Day 1996). Thus, a situation is approaching in many African countries where chloroquine can no longer be the recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria, and where clinicians may encounter problems in treating small children with acute P. falciparum malaria with 3 - days regimens of quinine (Krems ner et al. 1994). Alternative drugs must be evaluated for the potential challenges of treating this life -threatening disease in the most vulnerable groups of the African population. CGP 56697 (artemether and benflumetol) is an oral, fixed dose combination of artemether, a semisynthetic derivative of arternisinin, and benflumetol, a synthetic racemic fluorene derivative developed by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing. This combination was developed in China for the treatment of P. falciparu m malaria (Olliaro & Trigg 1995). Artemether is of proven benefit in the treatment of Malaria, but recrudescence is common when it is used as a single agent (Bunnag et al. 1995). Benflumetol is also an effective antimalarial with a high cure rate, but is s lower in action. The rationale for the combination of the two drugs is to combine the benefits of the fast onset of action provided by artemether with the advantage of the high cure rate associated with benflumetol, given as a short course of four doses ov er 48 h to foster compliance (unpublished observation). Studies with CGP 56697 on 196 Chinese adults achieved 4 -week cure rates of 97.4% (unpublished observation). A similar trial in Thailand on 252 patients which compared CGP 56697 with mefloquine gave 4 -weck cure rates of 69% and 82%, respectively (unpublished observation). CPG 56697, however, had a statistically significantly better parasite clearance time (43 h vs. 66 h), a faster fever clearance time (32 h vs. 54 h), and was more Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 123 than twice as rapid in gametocyte clearance (152 h vs. 331 h), the latter considered to be of importance in relation to containing malaria transmissibility. Limited data on the efficacy of CGP 56697 among 100 children aged 5 -14 years are available from China. A 4 -week cure rate of 93% was obtained with a reduced adult dose according to the children's age and weight. Oral CGP 56697 was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. A pilot study of CGP 56697 in West African children aged 1 -6 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria showed a good tolerance of the drug (von Seidlein et al. 1997). This communication reports on the first experience on CGIP 56697 in East Africa. Its potential as a reliable addition to the future armoury of antimalarial drugs was tested against chloroquine, the current first -Iine drug according to Tanzanian policy. Study population and methods Population The trial population comprised boys and girls aged 1 -5 years (body weight > 5 kg) with acute falciparum malaria. They were recruited f rom the 'mother -and-child' out -patient clinic at St Francis District Designated Hospital, Ifakara, Tanzania. A species prevalence of 93% for P. falciparum infections and a malaria related fever prevalence of 5% are reported in this area of permanent transm ission among this age group (Smith et al. 1993 ). Inclusion criteria for selection were: age 1 -5 years; body weight > > 5,OOO/ml blood; fever (axillary temp 37.5 oC); living within 5 km of trial site; feasibility of participation and informed consent; not participating in any other trial. Ethical clearance was obtained from ethical committees of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology and from Basel University. Exclusion criteri a were parasitaemia < 5,000/ml; absence of fever; intolerance of oral medication; signs or symptoms of severe or complicated malaria; severe malnutrition or kwashiorkor; history of other antimalarial drugs within 48 h; known sensitivity to chloroquine; any known chronic underlying disease. Each child eligible for the trial had a general medical examination and a medical history taken. The purpose and details of the trial were fully explained to the parent or guardian Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 124 and consent forms signed or fingerprint ed. 260 children were randomized equally to the CGP 56697 or chloroquine treatment groups (130 to each). Medication The children in the CGP 56697 treatment group received 4 doses of paediatric tablets at 0, 8, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Each paediatric CG P 56697 tablet contained 10 mg artemether + 60 mg benflumetol (\u00bd the adult tablet level) and 1, 2, 3 or 4 tablets were given at the 4 dosage times according to body weight (5 -10 kg body weight, 4 doses of 1 tablet; 10 -15 kg, 4 doses of 2 tablets; 15 -20 kg, 4 doses of 3 tablets; 20 -25 kg, 4 doses of 4 tablets). Children in the chloroquine treatment group similarly received 4 doses over 3 days, relating to body weight at 25 mg total per kg body weight (10, 5, 5 & 5 mg/kg) as follows: 5-10 kg, \u00bd tablet, follow ed by \u00bc tablet at each of the next 3 doses; 10 -15 kg, \u00be tablet, \u00bd tablet each dose; 15 -20 kg, 1 tablet, \u00bd tablet each dose; 20 -25 kg, 1\u00bd tablets: \u00be tablet each dose (each tablet contains 150 mg chloroquine base). The trial medication for each child was c ontained in an individually numbered blister pack. The contents (chloroquine or CGP 56697) were allocated randomly in blocks of 6. Medication was given whenever possible between meals. Mothers still breast feeding were encouraged to continue. Children who had rescue medication or had negative slides within 48 h after admission were excluded from evaluation. However, they were included in the ITT evaluation (Table 2). Trial procedure The trial was a randomized, open, parallel group, comparative, single cen tre investigation. Children were assigned treatment upon presentation by allocating the blister pack with the lowest available number. On entry (day 0), each child at the out -patient department (OPD) was screened for eligibility criteria and, following par ental/guardian informed consent, the first dose was administered, with the child observed in the hospital over 2 h to check for vomiting. Eight hours after treatment started, a field worker (FW) visited the child at home and supervised the administration o f the second dose, checked the axillary temperature (T) and completed an adverse events (AE) questionnaire. On Days 1 and 2 (24 and 48 h) the FW visited the patient at home, administered the third and fourth doses, checked T, took finger prick blood for mi croscopy and completed the AE questionnaire. On Day 3 (72 Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 125 h), the FW went to see the patient, checked T, took fingerprick blood for microscopy, haematology and PCR and documented any AEs. On Day 7, the child attended OPD for neurological examination, T was checked and fingerprick blood for microscopy, haematology and PCR was taken; AEs were also recorded. On Day 14 a further follow -up was done at OPD, and investigations were done as on Day 7. A similar examination was conducted at OPD on Day 28. Techniques Giernsa -stained thick films were used to examine and assess levels of parasitaemia (thin films were only used to confirm presence of other Plasmodium species). Prior to patients' inclusion in the trial 20 thick film fields were examined; absence of P. fal ciparum excluded them from the trial. lf asexual forms of P. falciparum were found, then 200 thick film fields were screened for the presence of malarial parasite species. Identification of P. falciparum was followed by a tally counter count of asexual for ms and leucocytes. Present gametocytes were counted similarly. All blood films were read twice, independently, and a third time if the ratio of densities from the first 2 exceeded 1.3 or was less than 0.67, or if one was positive and the other negative. A definitive result was based on a majority verdict for positivity and the geometric mean of the 2 closest positive density counts. A peer review of 282 slides was done. There was a 87% agreement in terms of negative/positive results between the 2 counts. Urine samples were tested for chloroquine at baseline. Blood samples were taken for haemoglobin, haematocrit, WBC (total and differential) platelets and PCR confirmation of parasitaemia. Casagrande's method was used for calculation of the sample size (Geo rge 1984). Assuming a 7 -day parasitological cure rate of 95% for CGP 56697 and 80% for chloroquine, this gave a minimum requirement of 113 for each treatment group ( = 5%, = 10%). The primary endpoint for the 7 -day cure rate (evaluable patients) was def ined as the proportion cleared of asexual parasitaemia within 7 days of drug initiation, without reappearance on Day 7. Failures were defined as those patients in whom (a) parasites were present on Day 7, or (b) rescue therapy was given after day 1, but wi thin the first week, when parasites were still present. The primary end point for the 14 - day cure rate was the proportion of patients cleared of asexual parasitaemia by Day 7 and without any Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 126 reappearance by Day 14. Secondary end points were defined as par asite reductions on Days 1, 2 and 3 and the proportion of children with a negative slide result. The 95% confidence intervals (C1) for cure rates were calculated by using Pearson - Clopper limits. The 95% Cl for the difference in rates (p 1 - p2) between CGP 56697 and chloroquine + [p 2(1 - p2)/n2] together with the 2 test. For the parasite reductions on Days 1, 2 and 3, the median, 25th and 75th percentiles were calculated and treatment effects tested usi ng the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test (Woolson 1987). Results Demographic and baseline data During the recruitment phase, 1132 mothers were approached for screening the blood of their febrile children. Two mothers refused to participate in the trial . 454 children had negative slides and 81 children had already been given chloroquine within 48 h. 335 children had either a parasitaemia lower than stated in the inclusion criteria or were living more than 5 kilometers from the MCH clinic. Table 1 summari zes the baseline data of the 260 patients enrolled. None of the children died during the trial period. 21 patients were admitted during the period of the trial (CGP 56697: 7; chloroquine: 14). Premature discontinuations: 118 children were discontinued prem aturely during the trial. Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (96) was the main reason, followed by adverse reactions (8), lost to 'follow -up' (6) and withdrawal of consent (3). 5 had P. falciparum counts < 5,000/ml at enrolment and were excluded from analys is. In the CGP 56697 group 18.5% (24) discontinued compared with 72.3% (94) in the chloroquine group. 8 children did not receive the complete CGP 56697 course and only 108/130 completed the chloroquine course. 118 children (CGP, 25; chloroquine, 93) were treated with other antimalarials over the 28 day observation period. 7 in each group were treated for adverse events. All children received an antipyretic (paracetamol), 250 mg, twice daily, over the first 3 -4 days. In addition, 183/260 (70.4%) received o ther medications and anaemia; erythromycin for ulcers or rashes. Co -trimoxazole was given to 2 children on chloroquine. Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 127 Efficacy of treatments Seven -day parasitological cure rates are shown in T able 2. Forty -eight of the total ITT (Intention To Treat) patients had been discontinued from the trial by Day 7, most of them due to unsatisfactory treatment response, leaving 116 evaluable patients in the CGP 56697 group and 96 in the chloroquine group. Of the former, 109 (94%, 95 % CI 88 -97.5]) were regarded as cured in terms of the primary end point of parasite clearance, as 6 patients had a positive slide on day 7 and 1 patient received rescue medication 3 days after treatment was started. 6 of the 7 c hildren had parasites only on day 7 and were subsequently found to be negative, thus not becoming new illnesses. In the chloroquine group only 34/96 (35.4%, 95% CI 26 -46) were free of parasites by Day 7. The 95% CI for the difference was [48.0, 69.1] (P < 0.001). The related parasite reduction percentages and number of patients with negative blood film slides over Days 1, 2 and 3 are shown in Table 3 and Figure 1. These data relate to the secondary end points. Thus, by day 1, 121 of the CGP 56697 group had achieved 97.8% parasite reduction, rising to 100% by Day 3 (117 patients), compared to a 59% reduction in the chloroquine group on Day 1 (118 patients) to 95.9% (96 patients) on Day 3. The related negative/positive slide relationship is shown in Figure 1. 14-day parasitological cure rates are shown in Table 2. 95/110 (86.4%) of the evaluable CGP 56697 patients had no parasites, compared with 10/97 (10.3%) of the evaluable chloroquine patients.

Those additional to the non -evaluables for Day 7 were patients who did not have a slide taken at the two week follow -up. Of the evaluable 110 patients of the CG P 56697 patients, 7 were recorded as failures from the first week, with another 8 failures by day 14. Of these 8 new cases, 3 had only one positive slide on this visit, but were subsequently negative without rescue medication. Thus only 5 children on CGP 5 6697, i.e. less than 5%, had early recrudescence. Four of the 8 children tested by PCR had confirmed new infections (Irion et al. 1998). For the chloroquine group the 62 failures from the first week had increased by a further 25 by Day 14. Gametocyte coun ts are summarized in Table 4. Twelve patients (9.2%) on CGP 56697 and 15 (11.5%) on chloroquine had gametocytes detected within the first 72 h (Days 0 -2). By Day 7 the figures were 2 (1.7%) and 8 (9.1 %), respectively. The high drop -out rate for those on c hloroquine made comparisons unreliable beyond Day 7. Clinical features and adverse events: 48 h after treatment started, the temperature was still above 39 oC in 4 children from the chloroquine group, whereas all children treated with CGP 56697 had a temp erature below 38 oC. The most frequent signs and symptoms reported at any time during the trial were unspecific signs and symptoms (abdominal pain, headache, rigors). 37% presented with coughing and 18% with diarrhoea. Sleep disorders occurred in 39% (CGP 56697) and 37% (chloroquine). These signs and symptoms tended to disappear with treatment in both groups and resolved faster in the CGP 56697 group. No serious drug -related adverse events were recorded in either group of patients. There were no significan t differences in the incidence of abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea or sleeping disorders between the 2 regimens, neither at the beginning nor with onset during the observation period. The overlap of malaria symptoms with dru g-related adverse events was apparent as were confounding symptoms due to concomitant diseases. Minor drug -related adverse events included rashes in Several laboratory parameters were affected by the patients' disease status at presentation. Table 5 lists the evolution of haemoglobin levels in the two groups. The anaemia worsened with the disease resolution, on Days 3 -7, but improved thereafter in the Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 135 CGP 5669 7 group. Only about 50% of the children on chloroquine were still on study, as the other needed rescue medication and had dropped out. 40% of all patients had below normal platelet counts at baseline (<150 \u00d7 109/L), but by day 7, 95% had normal values. The laboratory parameters were consistent with the disease status at baseline, improving with disease resolution due to a successful response to drug therapy. Of 157 children tested for chloroquine in urine at baseline, 97 (62%; CGP 56697: 59%; chloroquine: 67%; difference between the 2 regimens not significant) were positive, indicating recent medication. The presence of chloroquine in the urine at baseline was not related to the cure rates at 7 and 14 days in either group. However, it seemed to positively affect the 28 days cure rate by as much as 23% in the CGP 56697 group (14/30 children without vs. 29 of 42 with detectable chloroquine). The full evaluation of the parasite genotype dynamics using PCR technology is presented elsewhere (Irion et al. 1998 ). Discussion The efficacy of artemether -benflumetol (CGP 56697) in the treatment of acute falciparum malaria in young children (age 1 -5 years) was compared with that of chloroquine, the presently used standard drug in this area. The parasite reduction rate f ound was 97.8% at 24 h rising to 100% on Days 2 and 3 (compared to 59% at 24 h rising to 81.8% and 95.9% for chloroquine). These results were paralleled by rapid reductions of fever in the CGP 56697 group, which was slower with chloroquine, with temperatur e still elevated in some patients 24 -48 h after treatment started. The 7 -day cure rate of 94% and the 14 -day cure rate of 86.4% (compared to 35.4% and 10.3% % for chloroquine) showed a similar efficacy in young Tanzanian children to that in 100 Chinese chi ldren, aged 5 -14, where a 28 -day cure rate of 93% was recorded (unpublished data). Taking into account all parasitological and PCR findings of the children treated with CGP 56697, the recrudescence rate by day 14 was found to be below 5%. Irrespective of the type of drug, the children in this trial suffered a series of mostly mild adverse events. One common adverse event not drug -related and noted in 37% of all patients was a dry, unproductive cough at baseline, which appears to be a symptom associated wit h the disease. Interestingly, a further 40% of all patients developed this symptom after treatment onset: some of them had another episode, some newly reported this symptom after baseline. This phenomenon has been reported previously in India Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 136 (Kulkarni 199 6). Its pathogenesis may be related to cytoadherence ligands (Smith et al. 1996) but the mechanisms are unclear. The haematological figures were similarin both groups, as was the anaemia at presentation. Both are features of the disease which improved wit h response to successful therapy. Gametocyte reduction levels can be considered a very important feature of antimalarial drug therapy. The ability to rapidly suppress gametocyte formation is important in some endemic areas in reducing transmissibility. Ar ternisinin and its derivatives reduced gametocytes 8 -fold in primary infection and up to 18 -fold in reinfection, compared with mefloquine (Price et al. 1996). The authors suggested that the 50% drop in malaria on the Thai/Burmese border in 1994, coinciding with use of artesunate, reflected its antigametocyte activity rather than the benefits of its treatment efficacy on clinical malaria. In our study 12 children (9.2%) on CGP 56697 and 15 (11.5%) on chloroquine had gametocytes detected over the first 72 h ( Days 0 -2, Table 4). By Day 7,1.7% of the CGP 56697 group were positive for gametocytes as against 9.1 % of the chloroquine group, emphasizing the beneficial effect of the former in suppressing gametocyte formation. This confirms the trend observed in other studies. The epidemiological impact of this gametocidal activity remains to be established. It may merit carefully designed intervention studies in holoendemic settings in Africa. The results of this study, in relation to previous investigations (Koella et al. 1990; Mshinda et al. 1996) , confirm that chloroquine resistance is of growing concern in this area of Tanzania. These papers suggested that resistance may be a reflection of the immunological status. This is also supported in this study by the fact that recrudescent infections appeared in chloroquine -treated patients who initially showed higher parasite densities than patients who cleared parasitaemia (data not shown). In addition, a higher drug pressure in the periurban study site, and the higher pa rasite densities may have contributed to the surprisingly higher failure rate than the one found in a rural community of the Kilombero area by Mshinda et al. (1996). Hence, chloroquine may not be an efficacious first -Iine drug for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in this area of Tanzania. In conclusion, the combination therapy of artemether - benflumetoi (CGP 56697) was shown to be a highly efficacious antimalarial therapy for young Tanzanian children aged 1 - 5. It achieved a 94% cure rate, accompanied by rap id parasite reduction and clearance Chapter 8: Efficacy of artemether & benflumentol 137 rates. 6 of the 7 cases with parasites detected on day 7 were positive only on that day and had subsequently no parasites. This is an important point when considering the likely span of useful therapeutic life of this dr ug. CGP 56697 also showed some antigametocyte activity, which may be of some importance in limiting malaria transmission. lt is recommended as an efficacious antimalarial which may be particularly important to prevent the development of severe falciparum malaria.

Method Reappea ring parasites were analysed by PCR -RFLP within a randomized controlled trial. 130 patients received chloroquine and 130 patients were treated with CGP 56 697. Samples from 96 patients with parasitological failure were tested by PCR -RFLP for MSP2 of Plasmo dium falciparum. Seven days after treatment 32 patients of the chloroquine control group with reappearing parasites were tested by PCR and one infection was unequivocally determined as a new infection. After 7 days, in the CGP 56 697 group, 6 samples were tested in which one new infection was identified. Similar observations were made one and three weeks later in both groups. Results Although a high multiplicity of infections on admission was observed, there was no significant correlation between multipli city and either recrudescence or new infection. Patients in both treatment groups with subsequent recrudescent parasites had higher initial mean parasite densities than patients who cleared. Those of the patients with recrudescent parasites who were treate d with CGP 56 697 had higher initial parasite densities than those treated with chloroquine. The rate of re -infection increased with time as expected in holoendemic areas and appeared to be higher in chloroquine patients. Generally, CGP 56 697 showed a sup erior clearance rate, successfully cleared higher parasite densities and suppressed new infections over a longer period of time. Conclusion The PCR analysis confirmed that reinfections beyond day 7 are significant in areas highly endemic for malaria and showed the necessity of excluding these when estimaring 14 day clearance rates. Provided new infections are excluded, the 28 -day clearance rate can also be used to determine the efficacy of antimalarial drugs in highly endemic areas, and adds to our knowle dge of drug resistance and dynamics of infections in people living in such areas. Chapter 9:Distinction of recrudescences by PCR 143 Introduction For the last 50 years chloroquine has been an efficient drug with low toxicity for treatment of malaria in most tropical countries. Since the first report of ch loroquine resistance from eastern Africa in 1978, it spread rapidly all over the continent (Henry et al. 1994). Today about 50% of African Plasmodium falciparum strains are resistant to chloroquine, but the pattern of resistance varies with geographical lo cation (Creasey et al. 1990). In lfakara, Tanzania, where this trial took place, 20% of P. falciparum strains were reported to be resistant to chloroquine in 1988 (Koella et al. 1990). In the present trial, the 7 -day cure rate of chloroquine was found to b e only 30% (Hatz et al. 1998). Currently there is general agreement that combination treatment with two differently acting drugs should be considered (Peters 1987). One drug should be fast -acting with a short half tife to reduce parasite numbers quickly, the other should be slow -acting and possess a long half life (White & Olliaro 1996). The use of both drugs in conjunction both provides effective treatment and reduces the chance of recrudescence. The data presented here derive from an efficacy trial of su ch a combination drug made of artemether and benflumetol (CGP 56 697) (Hatz et al. 1998). Artemether is a semisynthetic chiral compound derived from the Chinese medical herb qing hao (Artemisia annua L.) which had been used as malaria treatment for centur ies (Qinghaosu Antimalarial Coordinating Research Group 1979). Since the rediscovery of artemisinin in 1972 (Klayman 1985), severat studies have been conducted with different derivatives in tropical countries (Arnold et al. 1990; White et al. 1992). The co mmon results of these studies are shorter parasite clearance times and shorter fever clearance time than with any of the other antimalarial drugs. In addition, artemisinin and its derivatives are effective against chloroquine -resistant strains (Qinghaosu Antimalarial Coordinating Research Group 1979; Bunnag et al. 1991) and antigametocydal (Price et al. 1996). Since artemisinin and its derivatives have a high recrudescence rate (Qinghaosu Antimalarial Coordinating Research Group 1979), it can only effectiv ely be used when combined with another long -acting drug, in this case benflumetol. There is little published data available on benflumetol. It was developed by Chinese scientists at the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medica l Sciences (AMMS), Beijing and registered in 1991 (Acaderny of Military Chapter 9:Distinction of recrudescences by PCR 144 Sciences 1993). Antimalarial, blood schizontocidal activity was reported (Wernsdorfer et al. 1996). A study in China with CGP 56 697 on 100 children aged 5 -14 years reported a 28-day c ure rate of 93% (Liu et al. 1995). A study of 5 to12 year -olds is in progress in Thailand, where CGP 56 697 is being tested in cornparison to oral quinine treatment. The appearance of parasites in peripheral blood after treatment may be taken as proof of failure in areas with low transmission, where reinfections are likely. However, in areas of high endemicity, appearing parasites may originate from a new infection and presence of parasites cannot be taken solely as proof of recrudescence. Microscopy can r eadily determine parasite species and densities, but is not able to distinguish between recrudescent or new infections. Hence, for drug trials in highly endemic areas, methods to identify individual parasite infections must be developed in order to disting uish between true relapses or new infections. Techniques applying PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to a polymorphic locus will allow such identification (Felger et al. 1993). In this study we applied PCR -RFLP for the MSP2 (Merozoite Surf ace Protein 2) locus, coding for a polymorphic plasmodial membrane protein, to unequivocally identify recrudescent or new infections after drug treatment. MSP2 amplification and distinct restriction patterns in conjunction with extensive sequence informati on allow the discrimination of almost all different genotypes found (Thomas et al. 1990; Smythe et al. 1991; Felger et al. 1993, 1997). Patients and methods Study design This was a randomized, open, comparative, single centre trial to compare the efficacy and safety of a new oral combination, CGP 56 697, with chloroquine, the current treatment in Tanzania for uncomplicated acute falciparum malaria. The study was conducted in lfakara, Tanzania, a holoendemic area with perennial transmission (Hatz et al. 1998). Patients were children aged 1 -5 years living within 5 km of the out -patient clinic of St. Francis Hospital, lfakara. They were treated either with chloroquine or CGP 56 697. A total of 260 children were enrolled in the efficacy study (130 in each group ). Finger prick blood samples for PCR were taken on day 0 (day of treatment), day 3, day 7, day 14, and when possible on day 28. Chapter 9:Distinction of recrudescences by PCR 145 At each of the three time points (days 7, 14 and 28) blood samples from a subset of parasitological failures were used for PCR analysis. Samples could not be analysed from all failures because many had already received rescue medication. Conversely, multiple samples were included from patients who were defined as parasitological failures at repeated surveys but who remained asymp tomatic and hence were not treated. DNA preparation and PCR Five \u00b5l of blood were lysed in 50 \u00b5l GTC solution (4 M guanidine -isothiocyanate, 25 mM pH 7.0, 0.5% Na sarcosylsulphate), 5 \u00b5l -mercaptoethanol, and mixed with 50 \u00b5l TE saturated phen ol and 50 \u00b5l chloroform. The aqueous phase was separated, precipitated with isopropanol and DNA redissolved in 30 \u00b5l H20. A nested PCR was performed as described elsewhere (Saiki et al. 1988). Briefly, 5 \u00b5l of DNA were used for the primary reaction and 2 \u00b5l of PCR product for the nested reaction in a 100 \u00b5l reaction composed as follows: 10 mM Tris pH 8.8, 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCI 2, 0.25% Tween 20, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 0.5 pM each primer, 1.25 U taq polyrnerase. Primer pairs used were S2 and S3 for the primary r eaction and S1 and S4 for the nested reaction as published by Foley et al. (1992). Both PCR reactions were performed in a Perkin Elmer Thermocycler 480 with the following profile: 5 min at 94 oC and 30 cycles: 1 min at 94 oC, 2 min at 55 oC, 2 min at 70 oC. Negative controls were included with each set of PCR reactions. The different MSP2 alleles were genotyped as previously described (Felger et al. 1993). 20 \u00b5l of nested PCR product were subjected to restriction digests with the restriction enzymes Ddel, Rsal, Hinfl, ScrF1, respectively, and tun on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. All digests of one restriction enzyme were loaded side by side for all samples of an individual patient and sizes were calculated using a standard commercial size marker. RFLP patterns were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and documented electronically. All gels were analysed by two independent researchers. Data analysis Patients were included in the efficacy analysis as parasitological failures if they were parasite -positive by microscopy or if rescue medication (quinine) had been required at or before the respective time point. They were included as treatment successes if an Chapter 9:Distinction of recrudescences by PCR 146 aparasitaemic sample (by microscopy) was available for the time point and no other parasites had been rec orded between completion of treatment and collection of that sample. Genotypes found by PCR either in samples from day 0 or day 3 were considered to be present initially and considered as baseline. Recrudescence was deemed to have occurred if the RFLP patt ern of an allele seen at baseline (day 0 and/or day 3) was detected by PCR on any consecutive follow -up day. New infections were defined as having completely different RFLP patterns in follow -up samples from those seen at baseline. Hence, new infections wi th the same MSP2 genotype would have been considered as recrudescences. Estimates of recrudescence and new infection rates were made separately for days 7, 14, and 28 (Figure 1). For each day, the recrudescence rate was estimated as the proportion of teste d samples found by PCR to contain recrudescent parasites, multiplied by the failure rate (failures/total patients included) for that day. A similar calculation was carried out for patients defined by PCR as being newly infected. Results In the population enrolled for the study in lfakara, the 7 -day and 14 -day parasitological cure rates for chloroquine were 35.4% and 10.3%, for CGP 56 697 94% and 86.4% (Hatz et al. 1998). Our analyses consider a rather more inclusive group of patients (Tab le 1) than those of Hatz et al. (1998) did: we also included patients whose parasitaemia never cleared. The numbers of patients who were thus included in the analyses, and the numbers for whom samples were analysed by PCR -RFLP for each time point are shown in Table 1. The relative efficacy of chloroquine was even poorer when these early failures were included (Table 1), and by day 28 the cure rate was only 5% with chloroquine compared to 64% with CGP 56 697. In 82.5% n = 83) of the samples tested by PCR, m ultiple infections were detected throughout the observation time.

Chapter 9:Distinction of recrudescences by PCR 151 Chapter 9:Distinction of recrudescences PCR 152 Mean multiplicity of infection (number of allele types detected) at baseline and on follow -up days in the two comparison groups is shown in Table 2. In agreement with other studies (Feiger et al. 1994; Contamin et al. 1995, 1996; Ntoumi et al. 1995; Robert et al. 1996; Beck et al. 1997) there was extensive MSP2 allelic diversity. 54 different g enotypes of MSP2 could be identified by PCR -RFLP at baseline. The most frequent of these were Wos 12 (14%), Wos 6 (6.6%), 3D7 (340) (5.8%), 3D7 (330) (5.6%), and KI (5.3%). Five additional genotypes were found only in follow -up samples. In two patients, a g enotype which was subsequently found recrudescent, was found on day 3 but not on day 0. In all other cases, recrudescent parasites were already found on day 0. Four representative examples of the dynamics of infection are shown in Table 3. The genotype pat tern specific for the recrudescent parasite persisted in 66% of patients with recrudescent parasites until day 28 (often as the most dominant PCR band). In 4% and 9%, RFLP patterns persisted until day 25 or 20, respectively. In only 7% and 13% of the patie nts the RFLP pattern disappeared without rescue treatment after day 7 or 14, respectively. However, besides recrudescent parasites, new genotypes appeared additionally during the follow -up period (new infections). The sample of these patients had to be def ined as recrudescent due to the persistence of one genotype found at enrolment. Table 1 lists the number of samples with microscopically detectable parasites, recrudescences and new infections, for both groups on each day. From these results, the estimated recrudescence and new infection rates are given in Figure 1. Initial mean parasite densities in both treatment groups were higher in patients with subsequently recrudescent parasites (Table 4). Mean parasite density at admission in patients with subsequen t recrudescences was higher in patients treated with CGP 56 697 than in patients treated with chloroquine(Table 4). Discussion An analysis of the infection dynamics after drug treatment was performed using parasite genotype date in a comparison trial of c hloroquine and CGP 56 697 treatment for nonsevere malaria. In areas with high endemicity for Plasmodium falciparum, such as in the Kilombero valley, Tanzania, where individuals receive > 300 infective bites per year (Smith et al. 1993), re -appearance of pa rasites alone after treatment cannot be taken as indicator of recrudescence. Both drugs used in the trial are known to be inactive against hepatocytic parasite stages, therefore they would not affect the development of new blood Chapter 9:Distinction of recrudescences by PCR 153 stage infections immediatel y after drug concentration decreases. Thus techniques to unequivocally identify individual parasite infections are needed. We used MSP2 -RFLP genotyping which has been proven to have sufficient discrimination power to identify most individual infections (Be ck et al. 1997). In areas, where multiple infections are frequent, this technique proved to be equal to multiloci analyses (Snounou & Beck 1998). We are aware that PCR analysis could miss some genotypes, if single samples were used to characterize each epi sode. This could happen either because of suppression of concurrent low density infections by a superimposed high density infection, or because of sequestration of infected erythrocytes at the time of sampling. We decided to use as baseline both day 0 and day 3. Although in many samples genotypes appeared at day 3 which were not seen at day 0, these genotypes recurred in only two patients and were defined as recrudescence. In all other cases, the genotypes of recrudescent parasites were already contained in the day 0 RFLP pattern. The extent of resistance against a given drug can only be estimated if re - infections can be excluded. In this trial, after chloroquine treatment only 3.3% of all parasites appearing up to 28 days were new infections, indicating th e inability of chloroquine to clear parasites completely. But recrudescent parasites, especially those with high allele frequencies, could also be reinfections with the same parasite genotype. In contrast to chloroquine treatment, 45.5% of parasites appear ing after CGP 56 697 treatment were new infections. The usefulness of analysing 28 -day cure rates has often been disputed, in particular in areas of high endemicity, where new infections are very likely to occur within 28 days. But in this study, only 22% of the observed parasites were shown to be new. The remainder still comprised recrudescent parasites and must be considered as late failures, hence making the 28 -day cure rates a useful outcome measurement. The dynamics of individual infections, with pers isting genotypes, disappearing genotypes, and new genotypes all appearing within one sample, raises the question whether the persistent or the new infection is clinically significant. Since in multiple infections, quantification of PCR products may not be correct, we can only speculate that the dominant infection would result in a dominant PCR product. In all but 8 cases, the dominant PCR product at recrudescence was already contained within the baseline samples. With caution, this may imply that in most ca ses the recrudescent infection might be responsible for the major parasitaemia and perhaps for the clinical presentation. Chapter 9:Distinction of recrudescences by PCR 154 Initial parasite genotypes able to persist after treatment might be explained by the fact that any drug, in particular artemisinin de rivates, only reduce the parasite load (White & Olliaro 1996) and remaining parasites might undergo a quiescent stage (Kyle & Webster 1996). In case of recrudescence, it has to be assumed that benflumetol, the slow -acting component of CGP 56 697, was not a ble to eliminate those quiescent stages completely It has been debated whether true resistant parasites against a given drug must exist (Nakazawa et al. 1995), but the above hypothesis would allow recrudescences without genetically manifested resistance ag ainst the drug. The mode of action of benflumetol is not yet understood, as it is not known for how long quiescent parasites can survive in the host. Nevertheless, the high cure rate and comparatively low recrudescence rate of CGP 56 697 give strong suppor t to the notion of using compound drugs in the treatment of falciparum malaria. This is supported by the fact that the mean density of initial infections was much higher in recrudescences seen in the CGP 56 697 group than in the chloroquine group. Also, th e higher initial parasite density between those who experienced recrudescences and those who cleared the infection in the CGP 56 697 group adds to the argument that CGP 56 697 can eliminate larger numbers of parasites, but apparently fails to clear very high densities, resulting in recrudescence of the remaining parasites. It may be speculated that the slow -acting compound of CGP 56 697 (benflumetol) suppresses new infections for much longer than chloroquine, as can be seen in Figure 1, where the rate of ne w infections is much higher in the chloroquine group. The fact that multiplicity of initial infections has no influence on whether a patient experienced a recrudescence, clearance or new infection, would also support the above hypothesis. The failure to o bserve any association might be due to the small size of the comparison group, since few patients had new infections only. No samples were tested from patients who were parasite -negative over the full observation period. High initial parasite densities do predict recrudescence. This is quite compatible with the absence of a correlation between multiplicity and recrudescence because densities were not correlated with multiplicity. Sometimes many parasite genotypes simultaneously persisted, so persistence can not merely be a consequence of high load of a single parasite genotype. These recrudescences might be due to insufficient resorption of the drug or drug consumption by parasites, and not to true genetic resistance. In conclusion, identification of recrudes cent parasites after drug treatment may not only help to estimate drug efficacies more precisely, it also adds to our knowledge of drug resistance and dynamics of infections in people living in highly endemic areas.

However, the worsening problems of drug resistance in many parts of the world have led to increasing difficulty in making decisions on the choice of antimalarial drugs to be used in implementing the early treatment strategy. In T anzania, the Ministry of Health is currently in the process of reviewing the national malaria treatment policy. This paper discusses some of the challenges of developing such a treatment policy. It focuses on chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) which are the main antimalarials currently being discussed in Tanzania. However, the issues raised are also relevant to other types of antimalarials. Conceptual framework Few publications are available on the issue of policy -making for malaria contr ol. A few countries in Africa have already reviewed their policies (Schapira 1989, Fevre & Barnish 1999). The World Health Organisation Regional Office for Africa, (WHO -AFRO) is in the process of developing a framework for changing malaria treatment polic y, highlighting the issues to be considered for the policy review process in a country. The issues identified include the objective of malaria treatment, efficacy of antimalarials assessed at the national sentinel sites, treatment -seeking behaviour for ma laria, and cost -effectiveness analysis (WHO -AFRO 1999). To simplify the understanding and the description of the reasoning behind the decisions in the process of changing a malaria treatment policy, we propose a triangular interactive framework (Fig 1) , which has clinical, epidemiological, and economic and health system dimensions. The clinical dimension incorporates all the factors that influence the occurrence of the disease and its complications. It also encompasses the choice of antimalarials used to treat cases of disease, and issues concerning their efficacy and safety in different populations. The epidemiological dimension refers to the question of the prevalence of different Plasmodium strains, and the status, development and spread of resistance t o antimalarials. It also includes consideration of the geographical distribution of Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 161 malaria transmission and the resultant burden of disease in a population. The economic and health system dimension comprises intrinsically intertwined factors, which includ e health -seeking behaviour patterns, costs and cost -effectiveness, levels of health care, the infrastructure of the health system, structures for decision -making, and the decision making processes. The following paper reviews information on all three dimen sions that could assist the policy review process in Tanzania. Clinical dimension Objective of malaria treatment The goal of most of the national malaria control programmes in Africa is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with malaria. But most programmes have not yet defined the objective of malaria treatment precisely. This poses some problems during the review of treatment policy (Bloland & Ettling,1999). Defining the objectives of treatment will assist in determining whether the recommended drugs reach the goal of therapy, and will also help to establish criteria for deciding what levels of resistance or failure can be tolerated. It has been suggested that the objective of malaria treatment may vary according to the level of malaria endemic ity. In this view, parasitological clearance is considered to be essential only in areas of low transmission, whereas in areas of intense transmission the aim should be clinical cure; that is, clearance of signs and symptoms and prevention of clinical recr udescence 14 days after treatment (WHO 1994). The underlying assumption is that in areas of intense transmission, clearance of acute symptoms can prevent the bulk of severe disease and mortality even without parasitological cure (Hoffman et al 1984, Brand ling-Bennet et al 1988). The problem with this view is that it underestimates the contribution of persisting parasitaemia to morbidity (for example anaemia) and mortality. Studies in the Kilombero district, Tanzania, an area of intense malaria transmissi on, have shown that the clearance of peripheral parasitaemia during treatment of children under five years is beneficial, as it reduces the risk of developing a further clinical episode (Kitua et al 1996). Kitua et al. also demonstrated the importance of l ow level parasitaemia for the occurrence of anaemia in children (Kitua et al 1997). In Bagamoyo, an area where the clinical treatment failure rate Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 162 is 50%, not only was there a severe fall in haemoglobin concentration in children who had early treatment fai lure (Ekvall et al 1998), but even in children successfully treated with CQ there was no improvement in haemoglobin concentration. Similar observations on the failure of CQ to produce haematological recovery were recorded in Kenya and Malawi (Bloland et al .,1993, Verhoeff et al., 1997, Brabin & Ganley 1997). Severe anaemia contributes directly to mortality in women and children (Stoltzfus et al 1997), though it is hard to assess the magnitude of the problem, since anaemia is not widely recognised in the c ommunity as a life -threatening disease (Mwenesi et al 1995) and most childhood deaths occur at home, so the causes are not easy to clarify (Tanner et al 1991, Slutsker et al., 1996). The hospital case fatality rate for severe anaemia for children under fiv e years of age was estimated to be 6% (Schellenberg D et al., 1999). Community case fatality figures are not available, but are expected to be higher, as the majority of children with severe anaemia in Tanzania live beyond the reach of facilities which can manage the condition, for example by providing blood transfusion. Therefore, even in areas of intense transmission, it is important that the treatment offered should also prevent the occurrence of complications of the disease such as severe anaemia. Henc e, we suggest that in Tanzania the objective of treatment should be clearance of symptoms and prevention of recrudescence of symptoms within 14 days, and also the clearance of peripheral parasitaemia. Choice of an alternative drug The useful life of the c urrent first line drug in Tanzania (CQ) is coming to an end because of high parasite resistance. About 52% of children treated with a standard dose of CQ (25mg/kg) are not cured within 14 days (MOH 1999). In several countries in Southern Africa (White 1999 ), SP was considered to be the most appropriate drug to replace CQ. Studies have shown that SP is efficacious in Tanzania, with an average clinical failure rate of 10 -15% (MOH 1999). Amodiaquine (AQ) is another possible candidate. It seems currently to be more efficacious than SP, but its acceptability has been a problem among health workers due to fears of side effects (Nevill et al 1994, MOH 1999) - although a review of studies on safety and efficacy of AQ concluded that the drug is safe provided its use is monitored (Olliaro et al 1996). There is also concern that the effectiveness of AQ may be reduced by cross -resistance between it and CQ (Olliaro et al 1996). In Tanzania, Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 163 it has already been observed that in an area of very high CQ resistance there is a lso a relatively high AQ resistance (Abdulla S. et al, personal communication) (Table 1). Malaria diagnosis Malaria diagnosis in areas of high endemicity poses a significant challenge during assesment of efficacy of antimalarial drugs and in routine p ractice. Presence of parasite in blood with or without sign and symptoms are not definitive indication of malaria disease. Epidemiological dimension Antimalarial treatment policy is formulated at the national level. A sentinel monitoring system has be en established, with 8 sentinel sites, in order to generate data that is representative of the whole country. The efficacy of CQ, SP and AQ has been evaluated using a modified WHO 14 -day test (EANMAT 1999). CQ failure rates were high in all the 8 sentinel sites, with an average of 52%, indicating that resistance is widespread in Tanzania. For SP, in contrast, failure rates below 10% were observed except at one focus (Muheza District in north -eastern Tanzania) where there was a high failure rate of 30% (MOH 1999). There are several factors that contribute to the development and spread of resistance to antimalarials. These range from host population factors such as appropriate use of the drugs, amount of use, duration of use, and time for clearance of the dru g, to parasite population factors like the biomass of parasite exposed to the drug, the duration of exposure, and the mechanism of resistance. This mechanism may affect the speed with which resistance can develop. For example, resistance to SP is apparentl y due to the stepwise accumulation of point mutations in the genes controlling the drug -target enzymes dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropterate synthetase. This may explain why resistance can develop rapidly. Resistance to CQ, on the other hand, involve s changes in the process of drug uptake and transport through the cell, which may require a more complex series of mutations. This may explain why CQ resistance only appeared after the drug had been in use for a long time.

This makes it difficult to predict the useful life of any antimalarial. In Thailand, SP became useless after about 10 years of widespread use (WHO 1994). So far, the experience in Africa is not so bleak. Clinical treatment failures in Malawi are still less than 10%, though the change was introduced 7 years ago. (Macheso A. personal communication). Resistance to the drug most commonly used can be expected to increase mortality rates. Assessments from West Africa show that this is indeed the case for CQ resistance (Trape et al., 1998). In Tanzania, the magnitude of the effect of chloroquine resistance on mortality is not known, but it is expected to be substantial in view of the widesprea d high levels of CQ resistance, and the high number of people who develop malaria. Anecdotal reports indicate that most deaths associated with febrile illness occurred at home, after attending a formal health facility (AMMP/TEHIP, unpublished data). Interestingly, most of the information collected so far is on children under five years old. Little is known about the contribution of older children and adults either in terms of the dynamics of resistance or of the burden of disease. Information from an Adu lt Morbidity and Mortality Project (AMMP) suggests that malaria is also among the important causes of mortality in those above 15 years of age (Kitange et al 1996). Work at sites with continuous demographic surveillance will provide more information in the future. Economic and health systems dimension Malaria treatment -seeking behaviour Even the best drug policy will be ineffective unless consumers and providers comply with it. Their behaviour must be considered if a rational policy is to be implemented a nd have a substantial impact on the reduction of morbidity and mortality. In East Africa, shops and drug stores rather than health facilities are the main source of antimalarials. Most people who fall sick with malaria -like symptoms are given antimalarial drugs stored at home. The course of treatment given is usually incorrect and the drugs often sub -optimal. (Mwenesi et Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 166 al 1995, Nyamongo 1999, Nsimba et al 1999). Many factors contribute to the preference for shops and drug stores. These include lack of dru gs in public sector facilities, and convenience. There are more shops and drug stores than health facilities, and they may be more easily accessible, in terms of time to reach them, time spent waiting for service, and opening times. Public facilities are o ften closed at weekends or at night. The financial cost of an illness episode can also appear to be less when drugs are bought from a shop, since shops will even sell 1/3 of a dose (Table 2). Table 2: Sources of antimalarials among 1263 interviewed people from different parts of Tanzania Drug Sources Chamwino Central -TZ When treatment is not successful, patients often look for alternatives. For malaria, treatment -seeking behaviour patterns vary a great deal, with constant interchange between formal and traditi onal providers. Studies in Ifakara and Rufiji, found that if there was no improvement after treatment from a formal health facility, only a quarter of the mothers and caretakers came back for re -treatment (Muela - Hausmann et al. 1998, Bjorkman 1991). Alte rnative sources of care included private health care or visits to traditional healers. If the response to treatment is poor, complicated malaria may develop, leading to convulsive episodes in children. These are often regarded as a separate disease, degede ge, for which traditional healers are considered more competent than hospitals (Makemba A.M et al. 1996, Mwenesi et al. 1995). Thus, in cases where the first -line drug is not effective, a significant proportion of patients do not return to health facilit ies where they might obtain treatment with second -line drugs. Even for those who do return to the health facilities for further treatment, clinicians tend to Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 167 repeat the same treatment unless the patient has severe malaria. Therefore, the drug used as first line therapy in Tanzania needs to be very efficacious. Up to now, national Malaria Control Programmes have not paid enough attention to the way that malaria and its complications are managed at household level, the importance of self-treatment and the ro le of shops and drug stores in the provision of malaria treatment. The challenge for a national programme is to ensure that effective antimalarial drugs are available easily to all (Brugha R et al. 1999 , Tanner and Vlassoff 1995). Encouraging home treatmen t may even facilitate early treatment (Deming et al. 1989). Hence, a policy need to be developed that addresses this level of care. Costs and cost -effectiveness assessments Drug -resistant malaria and the related deaths and treatment failure will carry a cost in terms of disability and loss of life. A model was developed that balanced the cost caused by drug resistant malaria and related deaths under different drug regimens in a fixed time period (Schapira et al. 1993). It was then used to find the optimu m time to change the drug regimen, and the point where CQ treatment failure reaches between 15% and 25% was proposed. Other workers used decision analysis models to compare the cost and effectiveness of CQ, AQ and SP treatments (Sudre et al. 1992). SP was the most cost - effective treatment when the prevalence of chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum at the RIII level was greater than 14 -31%, depending on compliance. A similar decision tree analysis model was developed that takes into account chang es over time (Goodman et al. 1999). This was later applied to Tanzania - specific data, and clearly demonstrates that at current levels of resistance to CQ, a policy of using SP as the first line drug is more cost effective. This was the case over a 10 -year projection. Considering changes in outpatient drug costs only, using the SP regimen rather than the CQ regimen over the 10 year period would cost US$ 0.46 per operational failure averted, or US$33 per death averted (Abdulla S. et al. . 2000). This seems to be less cost -effective. The actual choice of what strategy to implement is determined more by the ability of individuals and communities to pay the absolute costs than by assessments of cost - effectiveness. The use of a more expensive drug than chloroquin e may be assessed to be more cost -effective, but the absolute cost of implementing the treatment strategy may be beyond what the community can afford. Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 168 In Tanzania, calculations of economic benefits must also take into account the fact that the government health services do not pay for all the uncomplicated malaria cases that occur in the community, since many people buy drugs privately and treat patients at home. The little money there is must be allocated to competing priorities in health care, of which malaria is only one. Hence what is important is to have a policy which will use the small amount of money that can be invested in reducing the problem of malaria as effectively as possible. An optimal policy will be harmonised with what individuals in the community can do to help themselves. Acceptable levels of resistance: when should the drug be changed? Various attempts have been made to establish resistance levels for changing malaria treatment policy. Some were based on parasitological resistance lev els and others on treatment failure rates. Estimation parameters that included the cost of drugs, compliance and levels of parasitological resistance had the greatest effect on generating cost - effectiveness ratios. For CQ, parasitological resistance (RIII) levels of 14 - 31% have been suggested. (Sudre et al. 1992), while for treatment failures a cut -off of between 15% and 25% was proposed for the switch from CQ to SP (Schapira et al. 1993). Others have proposed that a change should be made when the median d uration of clinical response is no longer below 14 days and /or when haematological recovery is not optimal even with clearance of parasitaemia (Bloland et al. 1993). The WHO, while leaving the national programmes to establish an \"acceptable level\" based on the available options and financial position of the country, has proposed an upper limit of 25% failure as an indication for change (WHO 1994). Many questions remain. How should Tanzania set a cut - off level? Should the prevalence of RII or RIII resis tance be considered, or the proportion of early clinical failures or of failures on day 14, or the use of cost -effectiveness assessments? The dynamic nature of the problem of resistance, and of the factors that contribute to its increase or decline, calls for a more dynamic assessment, taking into account all the factors that we have described above. Hence, the upper limit for changing policy should not simply be one number, but consider the efficacy of second and third -line antimalarials, together with oth er factors like treatment -seeking behaviour, public health impact, cost -effectiveness and the perceptions of health workers and policy makers. Decisions about limits should take into consideration the public health impact of resistance in terms of subseque nt clinical episodes, effects of chronic infection like anaemia, severe disease and mortality. The availability of health and Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 169 demographic information systems in several African countries offers an opportunity to evaluate more rational approaches for settin g upper limits in different epidemiological settings. A decision could be made to change the treatment policy for all the population, or different guidelines could be established for specific groups, for example women and children only. Such a policy would have its own unique implementation demands and must be considered in the light of the existing health infrastructure. In Tanzania, it would be logistically simpler to have a policy for all the population. The decision -making process The decision -making processes involved in changing policies for malaria treatment do not show a uniform pattern. There are big differences from country to country in the structure of health systems, and in the levels at which decisions on malaria control are made. Furthermore , changes in policy and policy implementation rarely result from a linear process of generating research, laying out policy options, choosing between alternatives, and finally evaluating the implementation of the selected option. Rather, changes come abou t through a process of iterative interactions among three \"streams\" of activity: defining the problem, suggesting solutions, and obtaining political consensus (Porter R.W.1995). After the generation of technical information, like data on efficacy, treatmen t-seeking behaviour, costs and cost -effectiveness, advocacy of the results to the stakeholders and those responsible for making decisions at various levels is required. In Tanzania, a harmonious system for the transmission of research findings to policy makers is still lacking. Researchers complain that their findings are not considered in the decision -making process, while policy makers complain that they do not get a simple, understandable version of the results to translate into action. A decision to change drug policy has important implications for the Ministry of Health, the pharmaceutical sector, both public and private, public and private health practitioners, and the general population. Therefore, it is vital that the interests and concerns of al l stakeholders are taken into consideration by all those involved in the process. Case -studies - and the way forward In Thailand, chloroquine (CQ) was replaced with sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) as first-line antimalarial in 1973. About ten years lat er, the efficacy of SP diminished, and a combination of quinine and tetracycline temporarily became the first -line treatment. Later, Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 170 this was replaced by a mefloquine -SP combination. These changes were made when parasitological resistance at RI level was 15%-20% (WHO 1994). In Africa, CQ has been the drug of choice for more than forty years. However, in 1994 Malawi became the first country to replace CQ with SP, and it was later followed by several other countries in Southern Africa, namely Botswana, Swaz iland, South Africa and Kenya (White 1999). The decision to change the malaria treatment policy in Malawi was based on a comparison of the efficacy of CQ and SP. In one study, 30% and 60% of children treated with CQ became symptomatic again by days 14 a nd 28 after treatment, but none of the children treated with SP were symptomatic during follow up. The improvement of haematological symptoms was significantly better in SP -treated than in CQ -treated children, and the RIII resistance level to CQ was 33% ( Bloland et al. 1993). These data, together with others collected in 6 sentinel sites, formed the basis for changing the treatment policy. The main parameters considered were the reduction of clinical response in a 14 -day period, poor haematological recov ery, and a high level of in vivo parasitological resistance to CQ. In Malawi, CQ was replaced with SP at all levels of care, and the use of chloroquine restricted to sales on prescription only. In Zambia in the 1990s, CQ clinical failure rate in six senti nel sites range from 31% to 48% with in vivo parasitological failure of 34% - 70% (using the 14 Day test, WHO 1996. SP tested in 2 sites indicate RII and RIII failures in 3% and 17% and only one case of clinical failure in at each site. Based on these res ults it was decided to maintain CQ as firstline drug and promote the use of SP for all cases not responding to CQ. SP was made available in all health facilities, whereas before it was available only on prescription and in hospitals (Barat et al. 1998). There is consensus among Tanzanians that the problem of the high morbidity and mortality associated with the use of CQ as first line therapy needs to be addressed as soon as possible. The epidemiological and other information gathered so far also suppor ts the view that Tanzania is long overdue in changing its antimalarial treatment policy (Kitua A 2000). So the question is not whether to change or not, but what the new standard treatment should be. In addition, clear guidelines need to be developed for deciding when the next change is necessary. Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 171 On the basis of the information currently available, an immediate switch from CQ to SP would be appropriate. Other drug options are not suitable either because of their costs (mefloquine, Halofantrine etc), or because only limited information is yet available on safety, cost benefit, ease of implementation and impact on epidemiological parameters of resistance (e.g Combination Therapy). It is certainly possible that the wide introduction and use of SP as a first -line treatment may compromise future strategies which are under development (Winstanley et al. 2000), and are dependent on antifolate compounds. These include the use of combinations of chlorproguanil and dapsone (Lapdap) or SP with artemesinin derivativ es. But the high morbidity and mortality now means that delay because of possible future implications is not warranted. Furthermore, there is hope that a different range of options will be available in the future. New, cheaper efficacious compounds may be developed by initiatives like Medicines for Malaria Venture, and under the Roll Back Malaria initiative there may be a drop in prices of available compounds, and new strategies for funding malaria control. Further work is needed on guidelines for malaria prophylaxis in children and expectant mothers in the new policy. The preparations for future policy revisions need to start now by developing new tools for assessments and decision making and refining available ones. For example, there is still room to i mprove on the costs and effects models and to validate them with the results of actual experience after the change of policy in Tanzania. New aspects of the health systems also need to be explored, for instance, the role of diagnostic and treatment strateg ies. For example, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) or the improvement of laboratory diagnosis of malaria. Improvement in diagnostic and treatment procedures may reduce unnecessary treatment and hence drug pressure. Further developments a re required in identifying molecular markers of resistance, and developing the necessary technology (e.g. DNA micro -array techniques) to allow the monitoring of the development and spread of resistance in large epidemiological studies. Mechanisms need to b e developed for the advocacy of the concerns of policy makers to scientists, and the integration of these concerns in the research that is done. Ways must be found to identify solutions, and to create in all the stakeholders the political will to put them into practice. New strategies (e.g. combination therapy) need to be tested in the field. Lastly, training is needed to ensure that a \"critical mass\" of skilled personnel will be available to co -ordinate implementation, and maintain continuous monitoring o f changes in all three dimensions - clinical, economic, epidemiological and health systems - over time. Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 172 It must also be remembered that as most malaria treatment is done at home, changing the first-line drug in the public health sector alone may not have a substantial impact. Promotion of SP alone at home, and restricting the use of CQ, might even be counter - productive because it might result in many cases of malaria not being treated at all. This might happen if SP is not perceived as efficacious, becau se although it is actually more effective than CQ its antipyretic effect is slower (Nyomongo 1999, Williams et al. 1999). Furthermore, though SP is commonly available in urban areas, it is not yet widely in available in rural areas (Nsimba 1999, Masele et al. 1998). However, if a new SP policy is implemented, the private sector can be expected to respond by making SP accessible even in rural areas. Information on SP and its appropriate use must be disseminated in the community and the private sector. Fears of the inappropriate use of the drug on a wide scale, and an acceleration of the development and spread of resistance as a consequence, should not be ignored. Hence, a policy for home management and a suitable drug for use at home need to be developed. Ideally, the drug recommended for home use should be different from the ones used in the public sector. We propose that research be conducted to identify suitable compounds as a basis for home treatment. They should act rapidly, with high efficacy, low fr equency of side effects and low potential for toxicity. The products would then be promoted and distributed mainly in the private sector using social marketing strategies. The distribution channels for home products should be investigated to enhance availa bility and correct use. Simple technology like blister packaging of the antimalarials may offer some solutions to the problem of incorrect use (WHO 1998). Having a different drug for home use would reduce the potential of development of resistance to the drugs that are used in health facilities. Furthermore, if the drugs used in health facilities were not available on the home market, people would feel it was worthwhile to attend health facilities. Mothers and guardians do not want to waste a lot of time a nd money at the formal health facility, only to be given a drug (e.g. chloroquine) which they can easily get from a shop (Minja H. personal communication). Chapter 10: Development of antimalarial policy 173 New treatment policies in practice Malawi and Zambia used different approaches for changing malaria treatment policy. Malawi has replaced CQ by SP as the first -line drug in all health facilities, and restricts the use of CQ by making available on prescription only. Zambia has decided to maintain CQ as the first -line drug, and promote the use of SP for all CQ clinical failures. The Malawi approach has the advantage that operationally it is much easier; uniform health messages and information are disseminated to both the general public and clinicians. The approach is likely to cost about the same, and br ing a substantial public health gain. However, the widespread use of SP may lead to a rapid spread of resistance The Zambia approach may cost less in terms of SP costs to the provider. This will depend on the proportion of patients who come for retreatme nt. It may cost more for the patient in terms of financial and opportunity costs, and the public health gain may be lower. It may be difficult for patients to comply with health messages, as it will not be easy for individuals or staff of primary health fa cilities decide when to change to SP. Furthermore, considering that the CQ failure rate is high in Zambia - more than 31% - 48% (Barat et al. 1998) - so many patients will be treated with SP that in effect it will become the first -line drug. However, if CQ does continue to be used as well as SP, resistance to SP may spread at slower rate than in Malawi. Conclusion We have described a dynamic web of factors that need to be considered when reviewing policy. They are all interrelated. For example, changes in the health system and the economic situation may influence epidemiological pattern of the disease in a country, and the frequency of different forms of clinical presentation. Considering all the options available, replacing CQ with SP in all health faci lities, and the promotion of SP with proper health message to improve compliance, is the most appropriate policy for Tanzania at present. However, the change should be regarded as temporary, and preparations for further changes should be made. The main ch allenge of the National Programme is to ensure that effective malaria treatment and protective measures like insecticide -impregnated nets are widely available to all the people. Only by using all the measures available to us can we hope to reach the goal o f \"Roll Back Malaria\", of reducing malaria mortality by half by 2010.

This is an area of very high perennial malaria transmission. Moderately severe anaemia was highly prevalent in young children before the start of the ITNs social marketing programme, with about half of all children found to be anaemic. Malaria parasitaemia prevalence was also high with 60% of children being parasitaemic. Initial mortality assessment in 1997 ind icated that the children in the Kilombero valley had higher infant (95 per 1000) and childhood (14.3 per 1000) mortality rates (Schellenberg et al. 1999) compared to the Tanzania National average in 1996 (Demographic Health Surveys 1996). These findings m ade it essential that better preventive and curative malaria strategies be implemented. Availability of treated nets The use of untreated bed nets mainly for protection against nuisance mosquito was not uncommon before the start of the project. Initial wo rk done 1996 indicated that 37% of all households had at least one net. A few ITNs were also available from initial short -term projects and programmes including the Rotary project (Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo 1998), and the UNICEF Child Survival Protection & Deve lopment (CSPD) programme. But most of the nets that were in use in 1996 were old and some were badly damaged, thus they provided little protection. The initiation of the social marketing programme resulted in a replacement of the untreated net nets with tr eated nets and increased overall ownership of nets. Relatively good coverage of ITNs in the main target group (children and expectant mothers) was achieved in this programme. About 61% of children under two years (Abdulla et al. 2000a) and 52% of children under five years (Abdulla et al. 2000b) slept regularly under a treated net. Among pregnant women 53% were using ITNs in 1998 -1999 (Marchant et al . unpublished data). These findings are similar to results of earlier exploratory studies in same area, using similar delivery mechanisms (Fraser -Hurt & Lyimo, 1998) and in neighbouring Burundi (Van Bortel et al. 1996) . Chapter 11 : Discussion 180 The sales figures of \" Zuia Mbu \" products indicated a seasonal pattern that can be explained by both the abundance of mosquitoes and the availability of spare resources. The figures indicated high sales at the start of the main rainy season and at the end of harvest in September to October. A total of 65,000 ITNs and 25,000 insecticide sachets for retreatment were sold between mid -1997 and mid -2000 (Mponda H. unpublished data). The rapid uptake of the treated nets clearly indicates the existence of a substantial market for nets. Preliminary assessment of the willingness -to-pay and ability -to-pay for the socially marketed products i ndicated that the majority of the population was both willing and able to pay the prices charged (Schellenberg et al. 1999). At the end of the two years only 17% of children under two were without any net. For this small proportion of non -users who can probably not afford a net, the existing welfare system could be used for assistance. Impact of ITNs on malaria morbidity in children The social marketing approach for distributing treated nets had a rapid overall impact on health outcomes in the community. The increase in the level of net ownership was accompanied by a decreasing prevalence of anaemia and malaria parasitaemia in the community. Overall, there was an improvement in mean haemoglobin levels in children under two years from 8.0 to 8.9 g/dl, and a reduction in the proportion of children who had haemoglobin of less than 8 g/dl from 49% to 26%. A decline was also seen in the proportion of children with parasitaemia or splenomegaly. The treated nets had an apparent protective efficacy of over 60% on the prevalence of anaemia, parasitaemia and splenomegaly (Abdulla et al. 2000a). Furthermore, there was a gradient in protection with those owning ITNs having less anaemia compared with those with untreated nets. When age-specific malaria parasite prevale nce rates in children under two years of age observed in the cross -sectional surveys in 1997 -1999 were compared with historical data from 1991 or 1993, it was clearly seen that children in 1997 -99 had lower prevalences in all age categories, while not much difference was observed between 1991 and 1993. Hence it is likely that what was observed was a real decline in parasite prevalence and malaria disease, and not a difference due to long -term secular trends. These results over a decade increase the plausibi lity that the observed changes may be attributed to the intervention. The finding of an impact of ITNs on malaria morbidity in our studies further support the introduction and expansion of ITNs programmes to national level in Tanzania. There are indicatio ns that the social marketing campaign has managed to make ITNs widely available even to those who live on the edge of the inhabited areas, where it has Chapter 11 : Discussion 181 been suggested that the risk of malaria disease is concentrated. The lack of significant spatial structu re in the distribution of ITNs in Idete village is likely to indicate a homogeneous spread of ITNs in this village (Abdulla et al. 2000c). However this assessment was done in a small area with a small population, and a repetition of the evaluation on a lar ger scale with a larger population is required. This was also suggested by the larger cross -sectional survey we conducted, which indicated that children living far from the centre of villages had a significantly lower proportion of bed net ownership (Abdul la et al. 2000a). ITNs in high transmission areas Our studies have shown an impact of ITNs in an area of very high year -round malaria transmission. Concerns were raised by some authors that the ITNs will reduce transmission, and in doing so delay the ac quisition of functional protective immunity in children living in high transmission areas. Theoretically, this could then increase the frequency of occurrence of cerebral malaria as severe form of disease, and hence not change the overall mortality burden in these areas in the long -term (Trape & Rogier 1996, Snow et al. 1997, Marsh & Snow 1999). However, following the discontinuation of malaria control trials in the past, no evidence for a delay or a \"rebound\" in mortality was found (Molineaux and Gramiccia 1980, Bradley 1991, Greenwood 1997). Data from Burkina Faso also did not show such effects in children under five followed up for four years after the intervention (Diallo 1998). Further, the indirect evidence presented to support the idea of a delay in child mortality in areas of high transmission has been questioned (Molineaux 1997, D'Alessandro and Coosemans 1997, Lengeler et al. 1997, Lines 1997). Recent analysis of mortality patterns of children under varied transmission intensity indicated that the long-term mortality burden in children living in high transmission areas is likely to be reduced by lowering transmission intensity, especially because of the reductions in infant mortality (Smith et al. 2001). It should also be recognised that transmissio n reduction through interventions will not necessarily result in a situation identical to naturally low transmission areas. The introduction of other measures for combating malaria and other public health problems will inevitably alter the environment with in which the new and lower malaria transmission level exists. Although the current debate does not warrant delaying the implementation of ITNs programmes this issue needs to be addressed scientifically and monitored. To address this concern a long -term f ollow -up (over 5 years) of children protected under ITNs is Chapter 11 : Discussion 182 currently on going in several settings including in the Kilombero Valley (Schellenberg et al. 1999, Smith et al. 2001). Treatment of uncomplicated malaria Antimalarial drug resistance is growing and spreading at an alarming rate. There are indications that the use of antimalarials for which resistance is wide spread increases mortality (Trape 1998). In Tanzania after reports of initial cases of resistance in 1978, an increase of admissions due to malaria but not other infectious diseases was observed in hospitals (Kilama and Kihamia 1991). Increasing chloroquine resistance in our study area was reported in 1980's and early 1990's (Koella et al. 1990, Mshinda et al. 1996). The results of our clinic al study confirm the worry that chloroquine is no longer useful for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the study area, with only 35% of children having parasitological cure within 7 days of treatment (Hatz et al. 1998). Further work in Mlimba, an ar ea 180 km away from Ifakara where the initial study was done, also showed similar levels of resistance (MOH 1999). This indicated that the problem of chloroquine resistance is wide spread and hence the need of an alternative antimalarial drug. Sulphadoxine /pyrimethamine (SP) was proposed as an alternative although resistance to this drug has also started to be reported in several places in Tanzania, with an average estimate of 14% treatment failures within 14 days (MOH 1999). The mechanisms of P. falcipar um resistance to antimalarials are still not clearly elucidated. It is known that the resistant parasites accumulate chloroquine less avidly and it is now thought that the phenomenon is conferred by changes in p -glycoprotein pumps that are coded by genes i n chromosome 7 of P. falciparum . Resistance to SP is highly associated with mutations in the genes that code for enzymes dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS) (Winstanley 2000). The development of resistance is an evolutionar y adaptive process in the parasites which is related to the spontaneous mutations in the parasites and selection of parasites with resistance genotypes by antimalarials. The importance of drug pressure (related to the parasite biomass exposed to a particul ar drug) in the mechanisms of resistance is further illustrated by experiments comparing rate of resistance development for SP, which has a long half -life, and chlorproguanil -dapsone which has a short half -life. More rapid development of resistance was obs erved with the long half - life drug (Nzila et al. 2000). Chapter 11 : Discussion 183 Lastly there is still a need for developing new compounds that have varied mechanisms of action, as the current armoury of antimalarials exploits very few targets in the parasite (Wistanley 2000). T his leads to a high frequency of cross -resistance example between chloroquine and amodiaquine, or between pyrimethamine and chlorproguanil. Most of the new compounds (such as chlorproguanil -dapsone) are old products that are put together. The focus of e arly diagnosis and treatment is to get the treatment initiated as quickly as possible after the malaria attack. Studies have shown that those children treated early in the attack have a better prognosis. Furthermore wide availability of antimalarials even at home was associated with low mortality in children (Trape et al . 1987). However wide -scale availability of drugs encourages the appearance of resistant parasites, by increasing the biomass of parasites exposed to the drug. For most of Sub -Saharan Africa a trade -off must be reached between wide spread use that meets the enormous need for antimalarial treatment with rational appropriate use that safeguards the useful life of the products. Several more efficacious alternatives than chloroquine exist, for example the fast acting artemisinins. The cost of these compounds is high at present but it is envisaged that the costs could be reduced, especially with local production (for example: Tanzanian plantations of the Africa Artemesia Company). The main limita tion of these compounds is the high recrudescence rates that have been reported with short treatment regimens (for example 3 days). The use of combination therapy for malaria (CT), which entails combining an antimalarial with an artemisinin derivative, red uces the chances of this happening. The artemisinin will lower the parasite biomass and hence reduce the bulk of spontaneous mutations in the parasites that are exposed to the selection pressure of the second drug. The ideal situation is to combine two dru gs with (1) a short half -life, (2) different mechanisms of action, and (3) which have synergistic effect and matching pharmacokinetic profiles (White 1999). These CT treatments are usually more effective and are believed to have the additional advantage of delaying occurrence of resistance or even reducing transmission (White et al . 1999). Our results indicate that the combination of Artemether and Benflumetol (Co -artem ) was very effective in treating uncomplicated malaria with about 94% children having go od clinical response within 7 days (Hatz et al. 1998). This combination was also found to be very safe and well tolerated in all the studies conducted so far (Bakshi et al. 2000). Other new compounds that are under development include chlorproguanil -dapson e which promises to be relatively cheap and has very short half -life and hence is unlikely to select for resistance (Winstanley 2000). Chapter 11 : Discussion 184 The decision on the choice of drug to be used for a particular country depends on a number of clinical, epidemiologica l, social economical factors, including also the health infrastructure. Consideration of all these factors allowed the identification of SP as an interim drug to be used as the first line therapy at health facilities in Tanzania (Mshinda et al. 2000). Howe ver, there is a worry that resistance to SP will rapidly develop as was seen in South -east Asia (White et al. 1999). Furthermore, compared to chloroquine it has no antipyretic activity, a factor which may give patients a feeling of poor response to treatme nt. Therefore, evaluation of other compounds and strategies including CT are in progress to get a long -term solution for the treatment of malaria in the formal health facilities. The assessment of care at the household level, however has not been adequa tely looked into. This will entail having a product that is safe enough to be used repeatedly, with a rapid mode of action and a short half -life such that it induce have limited resistance selection. It will be wise to select a particular type of compound to be used at home and a different type with a different mode of action to be used at formal health facilities. Firstly, this will help to prevent the rapid selection of resistance to compounds used in the formal facilities, and secondly mothers will be en couraged to visit health facilities, if they know that the facilities provide medications that are not usually found at home. The implementation of such a home treatment strategy could then use social marketing techniques and organisational structures simi lar to what has been described for ITNs. The identification of a suitable branded product that will be promoted at home can be done with involvement of both the private and public sectors, including the national malaria control programme (NMCP). ITNs and efficacious drugs for malaria control in Tanzania Control of malaria in Tanzania requires a multi -sectorial and multi -disciplinary approach. Similarly, a combination of control strategies will be required to contain the problem of malaria. It is recognised that the use of ITNs confers only a risk reduction and not a risk elimination and effective treatment of cases of malaria is still required. Unfortunately, we don't have a better protective measure to -date. Candidate malaria vaccines are still a long way from being ready for wide -scale use. The overall transmission impact of the ITNs Chapter 11 : Discussion 185 programmes combined with appropriate use of an effective antimalarial may be dramatic if drugs such as artemisinin are used, as they may have an effect on transmission through their anti-gametocyte activity (White & Olliaro, 1998) . Furthermore, ITNs may help in the effort of reducing the rate of development of antimalarial resistance by limiting the spread of the parasite, and therefore further enhance malaria control (Molyneux et al. 1999). Evaluation of control tools Studies described in this thesis give a good overview of the issues and approaches involved in the evaluation of interventions. The randomised clinical trial of Co -artem was a Phase III evaluation where the main concern w as to assess safety and efficacy under ideal conditions. Before this stage of evaluation the drug had been tested in animal models and volunteers to establish biological activity and safety for experimentation using human subjects. The high efficacy demon strated in our study indicates that Co -artem merits consideration as a suitable tool for implementation on a large scale for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. However, further Phase IV or implementation programme evaluations are needed before wide scale use can be advocated. Such programme evaluations are now being emphasised (Habicht et al. 2000), because the results of the phase III can not be easily translated in programme settings (Lengeler & Snow 1996). The coverage and compliance to treatment may b e different in the routine use, and hence limit the effectiveness of the drug. Other factors related to the implementation of the intervention may also be markedly different from the randomised study. In Tanzania the majority of clinical cases of malaria a re treated by semi-qualified personnel in dispensaries, using diagnostic algorithms rather than definitive diagnosis by microscopy (Massaga et al. 1999). Furthermore, the study population in Phase III is too small to be able to detect a dverse effects which are rare, or take some time to manifest. Lastly, implications and interactions with other existing strategies is another concern that may be important to observe in a programme setting. Hence a careful assessment of the effectiveness, cost -efficiency, im plementation strategy and the particular environment has to be made in order to ensure efficient and appropriate use of the drugs. The many issues with phase IV evaluations are illustrated with the studies conducted to assess impact of ITNs. T he ITNs eval uations were mainly aimed at demonstrating that the expected benefit of the intervention is retained when the intervention is delivered in a less controlled way. These studies highlight important issues for the evaluation of programmes. Chapter 11 : Discussion 186 Two methods of ass essment were employed: cross -sectional and case control studies. Impact of ITNs was demonstrated using the cross -sectional approach but not the case - control approach. Attendance bias was the likely explanation for this difference, as those with ITNs attend ed more frequently for all the preventive and curative services offered at the dispensary (Abdulla et al. 2000b). It is likely that this observation can be explained by the high awareness of health issues and higher tendency to seek care at the dispensary for those owning ITNs, rather than more disease in this group. Furthermore, the case -control approach was thought to be simple in its design and execution but in our study it proved to be difficult to implement and took a long period of time (over 18 months). The advantage of small sample size of the case -control approach is lost when evaluating a common disease like malaria. There is also a difficulty of finding suitable controls. Therefore, it is unlikely that persons with limited resources and skills i n epidemiology, computing and database management, can repeat such an investigation. This makes the approach unsuitable for recommendation as a tool for routine programme evaluation. The studies also highlight the need of collecting several pieces of in formation in order to get an elaborate picture of the effect of the intervention in the community. Our evaluation of ITNs involved repeated cross -sectional surveys and case -control studies. A comparison was also made with historical data collected a few ye ars earlier which showed a lowering of parasitaemia prevalence after the ITNs social marketing programme was implemented. The choice of appropriate study subjects is another crucial issue. ITNs work by reducing risk of infection and transsmission of mala ria. The effects of this reduction are more likely to be observed in very young children (McElroy et al. 1994). For example, it has been observed that variations in transmission strongly affect the estimates of morbidity and mortality in very young childre n (Molineaux & Gramiccia, 1980) . Therefore at a given transmission intensity, the age of the study participants is crucial in determining the level of protection. Our finding of high impact in children under two years of age is in line with other studies that included very young children ( see Abdulla et al. 2000a for details). Hence our studies were mainly focused in children for whom the impact was expected to be apparent. Furthermore, in this group the burden of malaria anaemia is concentrated, hence they are more likely to benefit from the intervention. Chapter 11 : Discussion 187 Prevalence of anaemia as the main indicator in our studies was chosen as this is an area of high transmission, and malaria -associated anaemia is a major problem. It has been demonstrated that 60% of the anaemia in infants is due to mala ria (Menendez et al. 1997). If such evaluations were conducted in an area of low transmission prevalence of parasitaemia may be more appropriate, as was done in Afghanistan (Rowland et al. 1997) A decreased risk of admission to hospital for malaria was ob served in children not using ITNs and living in areas with high ITNs coverage, compared to those in the control areas (Howard et al. 2000) . This indicated that some protection is being conferred to those without nets and those with untreated nets. Therefore, the results of effectiveness evaluation in a programme will be reduced toward zero in high coverage rates, and it will therefore be very difficult to demonstrate impact (Abdulla et al. 2000b) . It is often argued that it is essential to achieve very high ITN coverage in order to get the full benefit of ITNs (Lines, 1997). In our studies impact was observed even when the coverage was far from 100%. We could not assess chang es in the observed impact at different coverage levels due to the small study population. Lastly, for both the case -control and the cross -sectional approaches the main comparison was between those who have adopted the intervention and those who didn't. This is because of the lack of a contemporaneous control group in this programme setting. In this circumstance some control of confounding is performed in the analysis but there may still be some residual confounding. The measures used to control for confo unding factors like social - economic status and health seeking behaviour may not be sensitive enough. The lack of a simple test to check for insecticide content of the nets (Drakeley et al. 1999) meant that this could not be verified as suggested by work in The Gambia (Muller et al. 1994; D'Alessandro et al. 1997) . The reliance on reported ownership of ITNs meant that some misclassification was possible (Abdulla et al. 2000a) . It can also be argued that those who adopt ITNs differ from those who don't by some unidentified factors that make their risk of getting malaria disease lower, hence causing an overestimation of the impact of ITNs. It should also be recognised that the comparison of those who adopt versus those who don't essentia lly estimates the health benefit conferred to those who adopted the intervention, rather than how much the health outcomes have improved in a particular setting, estimated in control trials (Kirkwood et al. 1997). Therefore, the results of the randomised c ontrolled trials can not be directly compared with the results of programme evaluations, unless there is a Chapter 11 : Discussion 188 control group as was the case in the Gambia (D'Allessadro et al. 1997). Inevitably specific indicators and programme evaluations approaches will need to be identified for different interventions. The results and indicators used in the Phase III trials may be different from those used in the Phase IV trials, and a direct comparison of the results of these two levels of evaluation cannot always be made. However, estimation and calculation of the cost - effectiveness or cost -benefit of reducing the burden of disease, especially using anaemia as an indicator can be done in both (Goodman et al. 2000) . Theoretically, it would have been advantageous to have a contemporaneous control group in our evaluations. One can argue that we could have implemented the ITNs in one district and observed the other as control. However, the problems with this design are many. Firstly, the re would have been a variable uptake of the ITNs in the intervention area and possible leakage of nets into the control area. Secondly, it should be considered unethical to withhold an intervention with a proven benefit to a population, especially if morta lity is evaluated. Finally, there are difficulties of comparability in an 'intention to treat' analysis of one intervention versus one control cluster. In this situation, analysis comparing those with ITNs and those without ITNs in the two areas will be si milar to what we have done comparing adopters and non -adopters in the same area. An extension of such an idea is to have several clusters were the intervention is applied and several control clusters hence introducing some element of randomisation in the d esign. This also has the problem of variable uptake and possible \"contamination\" mentioned above. But it also has far larger cost and logistic implications since a large enough number of clusters is required for the analysis (Kirkwood et al. 1997). Social marketing of ITNs cannot be efficiently done at household or village levels and large units are therefore required. All these alternative approaches are less practical and will not usually be possible in many implementation programmes. Most programme impl ementers want to spend their money on implementing programmes rather than pay for elaborate evaluations. Therefore more research is required on simple methods and tools for programme evaluations. Improved biomedical monitoring and evaluation tools The as sessment drug efficacy in clinical trials can also be improved. In areas of high transmission, the presence of parasites in peripheral blood cannot be taken as a proof of failure of the therapy. Microscopy can readily determine the parasite species and den sities but can not distinguish between recrudecences and re -infections. The addition of molecular aids like polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length Chapter 11 : Discussion 189 polymorphism (PCR -RFLP) allows such distinctions and hence improves the evaluation of antimalarial drug efficacy (Irion et al. 1998). More important is the role of such molecular techniques in the evaluation and monitoring of treatment strategy in malaria control programmes. Much work has gone in the delineation of the mechanisms by which pa rasites become resistance to antimalarials. The identification of markers of resistance can help in the explanation of problems in therapy but also as tools for assessing the performance of treatment strategy at population level. Examples are the mapping o f the extent of the potential SP resistance problem in Tanzania using DHFR and DHPS mutations as markers (Mshinda H. pers. Comm). And the use of the same makers to detect the effect of artemisinin derivatives in a combination therapy strategy to delay the occurrence of resistance in a programme setting (Bloland P. pers. Comm). Additional approaches are still required to get the translation of evaluation results into policy. This entails compiling and summarising relevant information, as was done by modellin g the effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of different malaria treatment strategies and drug regimens in Tanzania (Abdulla et al. 2000d). From research to policy implementation The results of all these evaluations are only relevant if the information is received by the end users (i.e. policy makers) and relevant policies are formulated. Policy makers need to be involved in the whole process of research from formulation of the relevant research questions to choosing the appropriate evaluation methods and implementation of the evaluation. Part of this is also establishing a good communication between the different stakeholders (Porter & Prysor -Jones 1997). The revision of the antimalarial treatment policy in Tanzania illustrates these issues. Research scien tists had produced data that indicated that chloroquine was no longer a useful drug for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania already in the 1980's. But the information was not well communicated to those who have the mandate to revise the National Policy. The review of the antimalarial treatment policy was initiated only after the policy makers were involved in the evaluations and provided with information that they required: representative antimalarial efficacy data from many parts of Tanzania (MO H 1999), and data on the cost implications of policy change (Abdulla et al. 2000d). For the ITNs evaluations the policy makers and health managers both at local and national level were involved in the all the steps of the evaluation. Members of the Dist rict Health Management teams participated in regular planning meetings of the KINET project Chapter 11 : Discussion 190 implementation. Progress of the implementation was also communicated to the National Malaria Control Porgramme. Hence, there was a smooth move towards using the exp erience gained at implementing small district wide projects towards setting a plan for national implementation of ITNs (MOH 2000). The up -scaling of an ITNs implementation strategy inevitably require the presence of other partners. Hence a completely di fferent framework is required in which both public, non - profit, and private institutions participate. The issues of how best to introduce the treated nets in a wide scale are then to be discussed and the strategies tailored to the specific circumstances of the country or region. Sustainability of these malaria control initiatives make it necessary that they are integrated and recognised within the formal health system, resulting in a commitment at all levels of government and non -governmental organisations . In Tanzania, much experience has been gained with the implementation of small projects. They had the dis -advantage of being small and were heavily subsidised. Subsidy allows equitable access to the ITNs for the majority of the population in rural areas who are generally poor and may not be able to afford the commercial prices of the ITNs. However, it introduces dependency on external support and limits the development of the commercial market for the ITNs. ITNs can be considered as a public health inter vention and therefore the Government and its partners and supporters should contribute towards the implementation of the strategy. Virtually no other intervention in preventive health is entirely self -supporting: if ITN programmes are (1) feasible on a lar ge scale and (2) efficient through low delivery cost per net or per treatment, they should be able to attract sufficient donor support in the context of the \"Roll Back Malaria\" initiative (Lengeler 1999). There are several ways that can be done to encourag e the commercial market despite an element of subsidy, especially if it is a subsidy limited to specific target groups. These experiences and considerations then broadly categorise the roles of the different stakeholders in ITNs implementation. The private and commercial sector produce and distribute the ITNs, and the public sector promotes the growth of the market, encourages uptake of ITNs in communities, and ensures some level of equity. Chapter 11 : Discussion 191 Conclusion Malaria control in the Kilombero Valley and Tanzani a as whole requires improvements in both preventive and curative strategies. ITNs distributed through a social marketing programme setting were effective in reducing malaria morbidity, and plans are under way to implement the strategy nation wide. There is an urgent need to implement revised antimalarial treatment guidelines using SP as the first line drug. At the same time, continue to evaluate new drugs including Co -artem in a programme setting, and try out new strategies such as combination therapy. The tools and instruments that assist in the monitoring and evaluation process, including molecular tools, need to be developed too.
