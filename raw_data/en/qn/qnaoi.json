It works by stimulating the body's natural energy pathways, known as meridians, running throughout the body. These pathways are thought to be connected to specific organs and tissues. During an acupuncture session, these energy pathways are stimulated, allowing the body's natural healing processes to flow and help restore balance and unblock any stagnant energy. This can help treat a variety of physical and even mental health issues, improving your overall health. Here are four ways that acupuncture can help your overall wellness: Reduce Stress and AnxietyStress is a normal part of life, but too much of it can be overwhelming and have a negative impact on our mental and physical health.Acupuncture can help significantly reduce stress and anxiety levels, as it can help to regulate the body's energy and reduce the physical and psychological symptoms associated with stress. Physical symptoms of stress include headaches, muscle tension, and fatigue, and psychological symptoms include irritability and difficulty concentrating.Research suggests that acupuncture can reduce the body's stress hormones, including cortisol and adrenaline. It can also help to balance the body's nervous system, allowing for a more relaxed state of mind. Also, acupuncture increases the levels of serotonin and endorphins, which are two hormones associated with feelings of happiness and relaxation.When combined with stress management techniques such as relaxation, deep breathing, and exercise, acupuncture can be an effective way to reduce stress levels and anxiety disorders and improve overall health. Boost the Immune SystemThe immune system is our body's natural defense against illness and infection. It's essential to keep it functioning at its best in order to stay healthy. Acupuncture can help boost the immune system and help the body fight off infections.Studies have shown that acupuncture can increase the production of white blood cells, which are necessary for fighting off infections. Acupuncture may also heighten anticancer immune functions by stimulating the body's natural killer (NK) cells. In addition, it can also help stimulate the production of cytokines, which are proteins that help regulate the immune system.
