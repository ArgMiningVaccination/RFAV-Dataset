In order to comply with Clery Act requirements, colleges and universities must understand what the law entails, where their responsibilities lie, and what they can do to actively foster campus safety. Michigan State University has worked carefully to ensure its Annual Security & Fire Safety R eport is co mprehensiv e and accurate. As the glob al pandemic associated with the novel coronavirus co ntinu es to evo lve internationally and domestically, MSU contin ues to strive to provide great services to its community members, though there may be some adjustments to the delivery method of resources on camp us. Please review resource-s pecific websites for virtual service op tions and also explore our Tog ether We Will website for add itional details and updated information at https://msu. edu/together -we-w ill/. MSU continues its efforts to provide a safe environment where all community members feel protected, em- powered, and aware of their rights and knowledgeable about available resources. Institutions should have ad- equate policies and programs to prevent crimes and to respond to crime reports and emergencies. MSU is committed to doing just that and works to enhan ce safety in part by thoroughly tracking crimes. This report meets required data compliance and disclosure obligations and discusses how MSU is creating a safer and healthier campus. The Clery Act requires colleges and universities participating in federal financial aid programs to maintain and disclose crime and security info rmation . The Clery Act requires institutions to co unt crimes in the calendar year in which they were reported\u2014r egardless of the year in which the in cident occu rred. Increase in Awareness = Increase in Reporting Since implemen tation of its man datory reporting policy in 2015, th e Un iversity has seen a significan t year- to-year in crease in rep orted complaints under its RVSM Policy. MSU b elieves that this increase in reporting demonstrates that more p eople now un derstand their responsibility to report and that th ey feel empowered to report sexu al miscond uct. Preventio n and Education MSU recognizes all of its community members p lay an important part in preventing and reportin g sexual assault and relationship violence. To accomplish that go al, MSU h as intensified its training of students and emplo yees in the preven tion, detectio n and rep orting of crime. In addition to online training, MSU co nducts mandatory, in-p erson RVSM prevention programming for all first-y ear and transfer students, and in-p erson bystander intervention training for all second-y ear studen ts. In 2018, MSU created the Prevention, Ou treach, and Education Department (POE), wh ich pro motes campus safety by educating students and emplo yees on sexual assault and relationsh ip vio lence, eliminating violence on camp us, empowering community members to become adv ocates for a non-v iolent commu nity, and cultu ral change. POE in cludes several full-t ime prevention specialists, a director, associate director, and over 100 peer educators who partner with u nits on campus to deliver educational prog ramming and training. POE has expanded the av ailability and variety of training prog rams, allowing POE to tailor training content to address the specific needs of particular groups. Through train ing and prevention programs, MSU is committed to building a safer campus. To learn more about how MSU is cultivating a campu s community that effectively fights discrimination, sexu al harassment and assault, visit www.civ ilrights.msu. edu and https://msu.edu /ourco mmitment/. Dear Campus Community, W e consider the safety and security of all community members at MSU a top priority. Our police force is world -class. All 80 sworn officers are commissioned as police officers under State law and have credentials that include, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree. The MSU Police Department has an international reputation for its proactive -based philosophy of policing that strives to strengthen relationships and engage community partners in developing strategies to reduce crime. The MSU Police Department strives to adhere to the highest ethical standards and reflect the diversity of its community members. The MSU Police Department also partners with numerous units and departments on -campus and numerous police jurisdictions off -campus - we believe these relatio nships are key to crime prevention. Crime prevention also includes all of us, which is why the campus provides community members with consistent messaging about reporting crime, including our \"See Something, Say Something\" campaign which encourages anyone on campus to contact the police department if they notice suspicious activity (more information can be found on our website, www.police.msu.edu). Please take the time to review this Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. MSU publish es it each year in accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act. The report includes crime data for the previous three years. It also provides comprehensive information related to safety and security, including policies on security, alcohol and drug use, sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, crime prevention, and reporting crimes. At MSU, we are all committed to making our campus a safe place in which to live, work and learn.

was founded in 1855. The East Lansing campus is part of a metropolitan area with a total population of approximately 4 77,000. The curriculum includes more than 200 programs of undergraduate and grad-uate studies in 17 degree -granting colleges taught by approx- imately 5,703 faculty and academic staff and 1,292 graduate assistants. Approximately 7,365 nonacademic employees support the instructional, research and public service activi-ties of the University. For the 2019 fall semester, 49,809 students were enrolled: 39,176 undergraduates (19,824 women and 19,352 men), 8,132 graduate students , and 2,501 in professional programs. The property holdings of MSU at East Lansing total approx- imately 5,200 acres. Of this total, 2,100 acres are in existing or planned campus development; the remaining acres are de-voted to experimental farms, outlying research facilities, and more than 700 acres of protected natural areas. There are 566 structures on the contiguous campus, 27 miles of University - owned two -lane equivalent roadways, and 114 miles of side- walks. MSU also maintains academic programs in Grand Rapids, Detroit, Macomb, and Troy, Michigan . Compliance with the Clery Act requires that the University consider these loca-tions separate campuses from the main campus in East Lan-sing for reporting purposes. 1 At the Grand Rapids campus, the MSU College of Human Medicine maintains academic, research, and administrative facilities, including headquarters at the Secchia Center, leased space the Cook -DeVos Center for Health Sciences, and th e Grand Rapids Research Center. The Secchia Center is an eight- story, 180,000 -square -foot facility that includes clinical teaching examination rooms, simulation suites, class-rooms, offices, and student areas. It is located in downtown Grand Rapids at Michigan Street and Division Avenue. The MSU Eli Broad College of Business offers an Executive MBA program at the Management Education Center in Troy, Michigan. The MSU Management Education Center is a 20-acre site that is located on the corner of Crooks Roa d and Square Lake Road in Troy. The 30,000 -square -foot building operates as a full -service conference center and educational facility with classrooms, offices, amphitheaters, and audito-rium. This location offers business professionals the oppor-tu nity to earn an MBA in an intense, compressed 19 -month accredited program that is nationally recognized. The MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine has two cam-puses separate from the East Lansing campus - one in Ma- comb Township and the other in Detroit. The Detroit campus is located on the campus of the Detroit Medical Center (DMC) in \"Midtown\" Detroit and is surrounded by several tertiary care hospitals and The Barbara Ann Karmanos Can-cer Center. The DMC has over 900 graduate medical educa- tion positions, of which 11 8 are osteopathic. In partnership with the College of Osteopathic Medicine, the College of Nursing also offers its Accelerated Second Degree BSN pro-gram to student cohorts enrolled at the DMC site. The Macomb campus is located on the campus of Macomb Comm unity College, 44575 Garfield Road, Clinton Town- ship. The campus consists of classroom, laboratory, and of-fice facilities in the Macomb Community College University Center, which are leased by MSU. While the educational program of the MSU College of Oste opathic Medicine is geared primarily to the training of primary medicine physi-cians, the curriculum and educational programs are also de- signed to meet the continuing need for medical specialists and teacher -investigators. The policies and procedures presented in this annual report are applicable to all MSU locations. To the extent any differ- ences exist in the manner the policies and procedures are im- plemented at the Grand Rapids, Detroit, Macomb, or Troy campuses, they are noted accordingly in this report. 1 The 2016 U.S. Department of Education Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting states that an additional location must be consid-ered a \"separate campus\" if: (1) the institution owns or controls the site; (2) it is not reasonably geographically contiguous with the main campus; (3) it has an organized program of study; and (4) there is at least one person on site acting in an administrative capacity. The Handbook also states that \"organized program of study\" means \"that the location offers courses in ed- ucational programming leading to a degree, certificate or other recognized credential.\" Only the five MSU locations meet these criteria. 2 | Page CRIME INFORMATION AND STATISTICS At Michigan State University (\" MSU \"), we take safety very seriously. Each member of the campus community \u2014 students, faculty, and staff\u2014 should take an active role in preventing and reporting incidents that jeopardize safety on and around campus. Please review this information carefully. MSU , in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Polic y & Campus Crime Statistics Act and the Higher Education Opportunity Act (\"Clery Act\") , pub- lishe s this document annually to provide its current students and employees and prospective students and employees with an overview of the University's security and safety resources, policies, and procedures. A hard copy of this document may be obtained by contacting Maja Myszkowski , Clery Act Compliance Coordinator email at clery @msu.edu . The Universit y also reports the annual crime and fire statistics contained in this report to the U.S. Department of Education. A searchable database containing those statistics can be found at http://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/ . This report contains general information about the campus, police and public safety resources , reporting crimes , coordi- nation between law enforcement agencies , fire and medical emergencies , crime and fire prevention , victim support ser- vices , the law and University policies , campus facilities , res- idence hall security, crime statistics , fire statistics, the crime and fire log, the U niversity's Relationship Violence and Sex- ual Misconduct Policy, and the MSU Drug and Alcohol Pol- icy. It also contains information about alcohol and other drug health risks , drug and alcohol l aws and penalties , and campus alcohol and other drug education and counseling resources . Campus crime statistics included in this report are gathered from a variety of sources, including campus and local law enforcement age ncies and other individuals referred to as Campus Security Authorities (\"CSAs\") 2. The MSU Clery Act Compliance Coor dinator prepares the report. Her contact information is: Maja Myszkowski Clery Act Compliance Coordinator Offic e of Audit, Risk and Compliance Hannah Administration Building 426 Auditorium Road, Suite 10 East Lansing, MI 48824 (517) 353- 2620 clery @msu.edu 2 Campus Security Authorities (CSAs) are: (1) A campus police department or a campus security department of an institution. (2) Any individual or in- dividuals who have responsibility for campus security but who do not con-stitute a campus police department or a campus security department (e.g., an individual who is responsible for monitoring the entrance into institu- tional property). (3) Any individual or organization specified in an institu- tion's statement of campus security policy as an individual or organization The University established a Clery Compliance Committee in 2015, chaired by the Clery Act Compliance Coordinator, to enhance efficiency and coordination to provide an e ffec- tive response to Clery Act obligations, including the drafting of this report . This committee is made up of representatives from: Student Affairs & Services, Dean of Students Office, Office for Civil Rights and Ti tle IX Education and Compli- ance, Office of Institutional Equity, Office of the General Counsel, Athletics, International Studi es and Programs , Res- idence Education and Housing Services, MSU Police Depart- ment, Student Health Services, Provost's Office, Human Re- sources , Land Management, New Student Orientation, Risk Management, Continuing Education, University Advance-ment, Sports Me dicine, Youth Programs, Infrastructure Plan- ning and Facilities, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Health Care , and Office of Audit, Risk and Compliance. The com- mittee receives annual training and meets to ensure compli- ance is cohesive and coordinated. Specifically, the commit-tee reviews policies and procedures related to the Clery Act, the Annual Security and Fire Safety report drafts , and dis- cusses ways to improve these various components of Clery Act compliance. A steering committee comprising represent- atives from Residential Education and Housing Services, Dean of Students Office , MSU Police Department, and Of- fice of General Counsel meets monthly with the Clery Act Compliance Coordinator to discuss specific Clery -related is- sues. Criminal statistics are reported by MSU Police Department to the Michigan State Police for transmittal to the Federal Bu- reau of Investigation. The information is published in the an- nual publications Crime in Michigan and Crime in the United States, available at al l public libraries and most law enforce- ment agencies in the United States . Information may also be obtained at the following web sites: FBI Uniform Crime Reporting ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/ ) Michigan State Police Crime Data and Statistics (http://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,1607,7- 123- 1645_3501_4621---,00.html ), and U.S. Department of Education and Secu-rity Analysis ( https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/ ).

Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act The Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act (CSCPA) is a fed- eral law that provides for the tracking of convicted, registered to which students and employees should report criminal offenses. (4) An official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings. 3 | Page sex offenders enrolled as students at institutions of higher ed- ucation or working or volunteering on campus. The CSC PA amends the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act to require sex offenders already required to register in a state to provide notice, as required under state law, to each institution of higher education i n that state at which the person is em- ployed, carries on a vocation, or is a student. It also mandates that state procedures ensure that this registration information is promptly made available to law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction where the institutions of higher education are lo- cated and that it is entered into appropriate state records or data systems. The Michigan State Police maintain a listing of all registered sex offenders in Michigan. This information is available online at: http://www.communitynotification.com/cap_main.php?of- fice=55242/ or through MSU Police. CHARTS OF CRIME STATISTICS This section includes five charts of crime statistics. The charts show the number of crimes reported to have occurred at MSU locations for calendar years 201 7, 2018 , and 2019 . For purposes of complying with the Clery Act reporting re- quirements, the University must consider the following as separate campus es from the East Lansin g campus : its College of Human Medicine location in Grand Rapids, its College of Osteopathic Medicine locations in Detroit and Macomb , and the MSU Eli Broad College of Business location in Troy. Ac- cordingly, each campus' statistics are reported separately in the charts that follow. Liquor, Drug, and Weapons Reporting The charts provide statistics for all Clery -reportable crimes separated by campus. This includes the number of arrests for liquor, drug, and weapons law violations at each campus. The charts also show the number of students and employees referred for campus disciplinary action for conduct that would constitute both a liquor, drug, or weapons law viola- tion, and a violation of University regulations. Not all indi-viduals referred for camp us disciplinary action were found to have committed the rules violation with which they were charged. Per Department of Education guidance, if a person is arrested or referred for discipline for multiple violations during a sin-gle incident (e.g. both drug and liquor), security officers should apply discretion regarding which arrest/referral to count. In effort of transparency and to discourage such viola- tions, MSU chooses to count all relevant liquor, drug, and weapons arrests/referrals within the same inc ident. However, in accordance with the guidance, the only exception to this is that if an arrest is counted for a single event, disciplinary re- ferrals are deduplicated and not counted. Statistics Gathering The information provided includes incidents report ed to the MSU Police, other CSAs, and local law enforcement author- ities with jurisdiction over each location. Not all local law enforcement agencies responded to the request for statistics. The statistics in each chart include all reported crimes, not just those crimes determined to have actually occurred. The reported crimes may have involved individuals not associated with the University. Clery Geography Each chart provides information about the Clery Geography3 location where the alleged crime, arrest, or incident resulting in disciplinary action occurred. For purposes of all three charts, the following definitions apply as defined by the Clery Act and its implementing regulations : \"Total on Campus\" refers to all statistics compiled for the University campus. \"Campus Residential Facilities\" refers to all on -campus Uni- versity This is a subset of \"Total on Campus.\" MSU provides student housing on the East Lansing campus. No on -campus student housing facilities are provided at any of its other sepa rate campuses (in Grand Rapids, Detroit, Ma- comb , or Troy). \"Non -campus Building or Property\" is defined as (1) any building or property owned or controlled by a student organ-ization that is officially recogni zed by the University; or (2) any building or property owned or controlled by the Univer-sity that is used in direct support of or in relation to the Uni-versity's educational purposes, is frequently used by stu-dents, and is not within the reasonably contiguous geographic area of the University. \"Public Property\" includes all public property ( i.e., property owned or operated by a governmental entity other than MSU), including thoroughfares, streets, sidewalks, and park- ing facilities, that are within the cam pus or immediately ad- jacent to and accessible from the campus. 3 The University continues to collaborate with the Department of Education with regard to the University's classification of Clery geography. 4 | PageMichigan State University - East Lansing Crimes Reported - East Lansing4 N/A Total On Campus (Includes CRF) Campus Residential Facilities (\"CRF\") Non- campus Building or Property Public Propert y5 Year 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 Murder/Non -Negligent Manslaughter 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Manslaughter by Negligence 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rape 26* 43*\u00b1 29* 14 24 6 12* 146* 2* 0 0 1 Incest 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Statutory rape 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Robbery 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 2 Aggravated Assault 14 23 9 4 6 3 0 1 1 1 0 2 Burglary 93\u00b1 48 63 81\u00b1 37 46 6 3 6 0 0 1 Motor Vehicle Theft6 30 47 35 0 0 0 7 10 11 0 0 2 Arson 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Domestic Violence 4 1 3 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 Dating Violence 24 18 19 22 9 14 0 0 0 0 1 0 Stalking 32 38 33 6 9 12 0 1 1 0 0 0 Liquor, Drug and Weapons Law Violations - East Lansing N/A Total On Campus (Includes CRF) Campus Residential Facilities (\"CRF\") Non-campus Building or Property Public Property5 Year 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 Liquor Law Arrests 198 11 9 43 0 2 5 0 1 21 5 0 Liquor Law Disciplinary Referrals 834\u00b1 836 739 832\u00b1 836 734 0 2 2 0 0 0 Drug Law Arrests 95\u00b1 35\u00b1 5 35 20\u00b1 2 6 3 0 17 24 12 Drug Law Disciplinary Referrals 503\u00b1 459\u00b1 298 503\u00b1 459\u00b1 278 0 0 0 0 0 0 Illegal Weapons Possession Arrests 15\u00b1 13 6 4 2 1 1 0 0 3 5 3 Illegal Weapons Possession Disciplinary Referrals 6\u00b1 1 1 6\u00b1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hate Crim es - East Lansing 2017: Two crimes of i ntimidation characterized by a rac e bias and one crime of intimid ation characterize d by a gender identity bias, all of which were on -campus incidents. 2018: One o n-campus i ncident o f aggravated as sault c haracterized by r acial bias an d one on -campus i ncident of i ntimidation characterized b y racial b ias. 2019: No hat e crimes reported. \u00b1 In conducting a reassessment of our crime statistics, we have identified certain human errors and are revising o ur crime statistics above accordingly. On Octo ber 8, 2020, th e following adjustments were made: -2017: oNon-campus R ape - two statistics removed. oOn Campus and On Campus Residential Facilities Burglary - one statistic removed. oOn Campus and On Campus Residential Facilities Liquor Law Disciplinary Referral - two statistics added. 4 The MSUPD unfounded five crimes in 2019. These crimes were: three reported incidents of burglary and two repor ted incidents of motor vehicle theft. For each of the incidents, a law enforcement investigation determined that the crime never occurred. MSUPD unfounded six crimes in 2018. These crimes were: three reported incidents of burglary and three reported incidents of motor vehicle theft. MSUPD unfounded two crimes in 2017. These crimes were: one fondling (law enforcement investigation determined that the crime never occurred) and one robbery (law enforcement investigation determined that the crime never occurred). A crime is considered unfounded for Clery Act purposes only if sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel make a formal determination that the report is false or baseless and only if the evidence from a complete and thorough investigation establishes that the crime reported was not completed or at- tempted in any manner. 5 The East Lansing Police Department (\"ELPD\") has informed MSU that it is unable to generate a report which fully disaggrega tes the Clery -defined public property surrounding MSU's East Lansing campus from other areas within the ELPD's patrol jurisdiction . Accordingly, MSU's East Lansing campus public property charts do not include Clery crime statistics from the ELPD unless su ch crimes were reported to have occurred on roadways . 6 Most of the motor vehicle thefts are thefts of moped vehicles. 5 | PageoOn Campus Drug Law Arrest - one statistic rem oved. oOn Campus and On Campus Residential Facilities Drug Law Disciplinary Referral - twenty -five (25) statistics removed. oOn Campus Weapons Law Arrest - one statistic removed. oOn Campus and On Campus Residential Facilities Weapons Law Disciplinary Referral - two statistics removed . -2018: oOn Campus Rape - one statistic removed. oOn Campus and On Campus Residential Facilities Drug Law Arrest - two statistics added. oOn Campus and On Campus Reside ntial Facilities Drug Law Disciplinary Referral - two statistics added. *The University employed an individual as a physician who pled guilty to sexual assault of individuals based, in large part, o n conduct that occurred under the guise of medical treatment. The individual, Larry Nassar, was terminated from his position at the University in 2016, sentenced in 2017 and 2018, and is serving a prison sentence for his crimes. For more i nformation, please see: https://msu.edu/ourcommitment/news/nassar-i nformation.html . In 2019, 8 individuals made reports against Nassar of at least one incident of sexual assault that occurred on the University 's on-c ampus property or non- campus property (i.e. Nassar's medical office). It is impossible to identify the exact number of sexual assaults for Clery purposes, however, because some of these individuals treated with Nassar on numerous occasions (in some cases, many years ago) and could not recall with precision the number of appointments they attended or the type of conduct during any particular appointment. Because the University does not have any way to provide the total n umber of unique incidents reported related to Nassar, we have reported as follows. In 2019, the numbers in the chart for rape and fondling in the on campus and non-c ampus property columns represent: 1)reports unrelated to Nassar: O n campus: 16 reports of rape and 12 reports of fondling Non -campus: 3 reports of rape and 0 re ports of fondling 2)reports relating to Nassar in which the individual reporting could recall the number of incidents7: O n campus: 13 reports of rape and 70 reports of fondling Non-c ampus: 4 reports of rape and 1 reports of fondling 3)reports relating to Nassar in which the individual reporting could not recall the number of incidents; so the count is by number of individuals reporting, not number of incidents: On campus: 0 individuals reporting rape and 0 individuals reporting fondling Non -campus: 4 individuals reporting at least one count of rape and 1 individual reporting at least one count of fondling Thus, based on this method of reporting, the total number of on-c ampus reports of crimes related to Nassar are: 13 counts of rape and 70 counts of fondling. The total number of non-c ampus property reports of crimes related to Nassar are: 8 counts of rape and 2 counts of fondling. Note that the Clery Act requires counting incidents of crime in the year reported, not the year in which the incident occurred. The Act also requires counting those crimes reported in the previous calendar year. Accordingly, the data discussed herein was reported to the University in the calendar year 2019, regardless of when the incident occurred. I n addition, note that the individuals who were not able to recall the number o f incidents of rape with precision includes (a) individuals who remember at least one count of rape with a possibility of one count of fondling within the same incident (the c ount of fondling would then not be counted under Clery per the Handbook, Chapter 3, Section 2(b), \"Sexual Assault (Sex Of fenses)\"), and (b) individuals who remember at least one count of rape with a possibility of at least one count of fondling t hat may have occurred in a different incident. In agreement with the Department of Educatio n, MSU conducted a reassessment of its crime statistics from 2015 -2019. During the reassessment, MSU identified the following: 14 additional instances of non-campus rape and 3 additional instances of non- cam pus fondling during the 2016 calendar year , i ncreasing the total number of non-c a mpus rape statistics to 82 and non- cam pus fondling statistics to 6. These additional reports pertain to individuals already known to the Uni versity and for wh om statistics were included in past annual security reports . 7 When an individual provided an estimated number of incidents, the University counted based on a reasonable interpretation of the individual's report. For example, (a) if an individual reported \"a couple\" instances of rape, the University counted 2; (b) if an individual reported \"a few\" instances, the University counted 3; (c) if an individual reported \"a handful \" of instances, the University counted 5; (d) if an individual provided a range (i .e., 3-5 instances), the Uni- versity counted the higher end of the range ( i.e., the University counted 5) ; and (e) if an individual reported an instance of rape occurred \"once a week for a year,\" the University counted 52. 6 | PageMSU College of Human Medicine - Grand Rapids Crimes Reported - Grand Rapids8 N/A Total On Campus (Includes CRF)9 Campus Residential Facilities (\"CRF\")10 Non-campus Building or Property11 Public Property Year 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 Murder/Non -Negligent Manslaughter 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Manslaughter by Negligence 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Rape 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Fondling 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Incest 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Statutory rape 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Robbery 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Aggravated Assault 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Burglary 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Motor Vehicle Theft 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Arson 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Domestic Violence 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Dating Violence 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Stalking 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 1 0 0 0 Liquor, Drug and Weapons Law Violations - Grand Rapids N/A Total On Campus (Includes CRF)9 Campus Residential Facilities (\"CRF\")10 Non-campus Building or Property11 Public Property Year 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 Liquor Law Arrests 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Liquor Law Disciplinary Referrals 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Drug Law Arrests 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Drug Law Disciplinary Referrals 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Illegal Weapons Possession Arrests 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Illegal Weapons Possession Disciplinary Referrals 0 0 0 N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 0 Hate Crimes - Grand Rapids 2017 : No hate crimes reported. 2018 : No hate crimes reported. 2019 : No hate crimes reported. 8 Law enforcement agencies did not report any unfounded crimes in 2017 , 2018, or 2019. 9 The \"on- campus\" category consists of the MSU College of Human Medicine location at the Secchia Center, 15 Michigan Street NE.

It currently has 114 full- time employees; 8 0 are posi- tions for police officers. Pursuant to Michigan Public Act 120 of 1990 and MSU Ordinances 4.0 and 5.0, the MSU Po-lice Department has law enforcement authority and jurisdic-tion over all property owned and governed by the MSU Board of Trustees. The duties of MSU Police Department employees include police and investigative services, access control, emergency management, fire safety, parking services, special events management, and traffic engineering on campus. The Police Department also provides coordinated communication to all areas of the campus in the event of natural disasters or crim-inal activity that may endanger students and staff, and con- ducts educational programs on crime reporting and safety. The MSU Police Department maintains a coope rative relationship with other local, county , state, and federal law enforcement agencies. This cooperation includes multi- jurisdictional investigations of alleged crimes, special events coordination, shared disaster exercises, and joint training programs . An Ingham County Mutual Police Assistance Agreement among MSU and the County of Ingham, the Cities of Lansing, East Lansing, Williamston, Leslie , and Mason, the Village of Stockbridge, Lansing Charter Township, and the Charter Township of Meridian permi ts the respective parties' police officers to provide supplemental police protection to each other in the event of an emergent need or a special police need of a magnitude beyond the capabilities of a single police department. Police Services Bureau The Police Service Bureau oversees the Uniform Division, the Investigative Division , and the Support Services Division providing field services for the Michigan State University Police Department. Uniform Division The Uniform Division consists of officers on patrol, field training officers, specialty teams, and cadres. Specialized ar-eas include traffic safety and enforcem ent, canines capable of explosive and narcotics detection, accident and crime scene investigations, and bicycle patrol. Uniform Division officers are assigned geographic areas of the campus in a community team policing model and are responsible for crime d etection and prevention within those areas. This Di- vision provides police services 24 hours a day and investi- gates all criminal incidents occurring on property owned or controlled by the MSU Board of Trustees. The Uniform Division is committed to providing enhanced services to the community by its commitment to Community Team Policing. Community Team Policing builds and ex- pa nds upon the community policing philosophy the Depart- ment adopted in 1986. The Community Policing Teams uti-lize a proactive approach to collaborate with the MSU com- munity to focus on community outreach and crime reduction. Furthermore, Community Policing Teams strive to reduce crime in their areas by conducting sexual assault and per- sonal safety presentations aimed at risk avoidance and crime prevention. Members are also responsible for coordinating programming for the University community on the topic of recognizing and preventing violence in the community and active violence incident response. Programming may be re-quested at any t ime by filling out the form located here: http://police.msu.edu/contact/requests/ . MSU Police Department members speak at every New Stu-dent Orientation Program, where information about personal and p roperty safety, crime awareness, emergency alert pro- cedures, and police resources are discussed. This safety in- formation is also available to students via the MSU Police Department's web page at http://www.police .msu.edu/ . Investigative Division The Investigative Division is composed of detectives, a court officer , evidence officer , and the Police Records Unit . Other specialized areas include relationship violence and sexual misconduct, behavioral threat assessme nt, fugitive team, vi- olent crimes task force and dignitary protection. The Special Victims Unit (SVU), housed within the Investi- gative Division, is committed to ensuring that all survivors are treated with courtesy, sensitivity, dignity, understanding, and professionalism. The detectives and officers assigned to the Special Victims Unit have received specialized training in trauma -informed interviewing, including the neurobiol- ogy of trauma. By understanding how trauma affects survi-vors, officers can provide an experience that supports survi- vors' healing and recovery without re -traumatizing the sur- vivor . Officers utilize a soft interview room, located at the MSU Police Department, to interview persons in a safe and supportive environment. The SVU investigates sex crimes, relationship violence, stalking and harassment, child abuse, vulnerable adult abuse, and missing persons. The Center for Trauma -Informed Investigative Excellence (Center) housed within the Investigative Division was estab- lished in 2018 to provide training to the department, local agencies and other agencies around the state on trauma -in- forme d investigations to assist survivors of sexual miscon- duct, relationship violence, stalking, harassment and child abuse. Officers working in the Center use a multi- discipli- nary approach to teach first responders, clinicians, support agencies, prosecutors a nd others about how trauma affects survivors. Officers can provide an experience that supports healing and recovery without re -traumatizing the survivor . The Behavioral Threat Assessment Unit, housed within the Investigative Division, is comprised of detectives and offic- ers who respond to reports of students, employees, or others 11 | Pageon campus who have engaged in behavior indicating a pos- sible threat of harm to self or other members of the commu- nity. Members of the Behavioral Threat Assessment Unit also serve on the MSU Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) and the MSU Behavioral Threat Assessment Team (BTAT). BIT identifies and provides resources to students who are in distress emotionally and/or whose behavior has been signif- icantly disruptive, problematic, or concerning. BTAT pro- vides a multidisciplinary, coordinated response to reports of a possible threat of harm to self or other members of the cam-pus communi ty. The Division also consists of the Department's Crime and Intelligence Analyst and the Digital Forensics and Cyber Crime Unit that are housed within the Investigative Division providing support for critical operations. Support Services Division The Supp ort Services Division oversees the Administrative Services , Emergency Management, and Special Events Units to manage support services for the Michigan State University Police Department. The Administrative Services Unit is responsible for recruit- ment, hiri ng and other personnel related duties, and internal affairs. Administrative Services also oversees the Depart- ment's Inclusion and Anti -Bias Unit. The division com- mander serves as the ex -officio to the MSU Police Oversight Committee . Emergency Management provides the MSU community with emergency management and fire code inspection services. In 2017, MSU became the fifth higher education institution in the nation to become accredited in emergency management planning. The MSU Police Fire Code Inspection Unit over- sees regulations intended to protect life and property from a fire through fire safety inspections, code compliance and training. Emergency Management is responsible for all of the Univer-sity's plans for disaster response, including the Emergency Operations Plan. That plan provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for directing resources before, during, and after campus emergencies and disasters. The Unit is very proac- tive in training and exercising all police officers and the co m- munity for emergency prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Training and exercising includes preparing first responders, University units, and coordinating with units of the local, state, and federal government. Special Events coordinates and assists with planning for any special event on campus that involves resources from the Michigan State University Police Department. In 2017, the MSU Police Department purchased magnetometers to assist with enhanced security efforts at speci al events. Management Services Bureau The Management Services Bureau houses the Access Con- trol Division, Business Unit, Technology Unit, and Traffic Engineering Unit. This Bureau handles all parking and busi- ness-related functions. Emergencies on Campus Emergency Response and Evacuation Proc edures The University is dedicated to providing a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, visitors , and guests. The MSU Police Department maintain s comprehensive information about the University's emergency management resources, includi ng active violence situations, on its website at http://www.police.msu.edu/ . All members of the MSU community are notified on an annual basis that they are required to report to the MSU Police any situation or incident on campus that involves a significant emergency or dangerous situation that may pose an immediate or ongoing threat to the health or safety of students and/or employees on campus. The MSU Police are responsible for responding to, and summoning the necessary resources to notify the community, mitigate, investigate, and document any event that may cause a significant e mergency or dangerous situation. Individuals at all MSU campuses are advised to report emergency or dangerous situations to the local police department . The MSU Police have established the Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) which describes the University's emergency management organization, policies , and response guidelines for the campus. The EOP is based o n the National Incident Management System and National Response Framework . The plan sets forth a systematic approach for managing emergencies or dan gerous situations that threaten the health and safety of the campus community or disrupt its programs or activities. In addition, MSU Police have established other plans to support managing emergencies that include: a Dis-aster Recovery Plan, Continuity o f Government Plan and various Continuity of Operations plans for key units who perform an emergency support function. The MSU Police Chief and Director, or designee , serves as the University's Emergency Management Coordinator and is responsible for directi ng the emergency management efforts. The EOP identifies other departments, units, and individuals responsible for providing emergency response and critical support services, and describes their respective roles and responsibilities. The EOP and associated plans describe the process the MSU Police use to confirm that there is a significant emergency or dangerous situation. The Emergency Management Coordinator assesses the danger and potential threat the event may pose to the safety of the campus community and determines the appropriate course of action in light of the specific circumstances. The University has Emergency Action Teams and plans for each building on campus. Each team receives extensive training on how to implement protective measures, i.e., 12 | Page evacuation , seeking shelter , and/or securing -in-place plans for its building. Evacuation , seeking shelter , and securing - in-place plans and procedures are available at www.police.msu.edu. Testing of Emergency a nd Evacuation Procedures Evacuation and seeking shelter drills and exercises are conducted annually in academic buildings in or near the month of May. Secure -in-place plans are demonstrated and discussed in all training sessions for Emergency Action Teams and drills to test those plans are offered to building occupants. Beginning in 2017, MSU Police Emergency Management Division personnel developed an d deliver a specialized drill instructing persons how to properly secure - in-place for an active violence type incident. The residen ce halls conduct a minimum of four evacuation and sheltering drills between the months of September and April each academic y ear. Drills can be either announced or unan- nounced. The purpose of evacuation, seeking shelter, and securing -in- place drills is to prepare building occupants for an organized response in case of an emergency. During each drill, occupants practice drill procedures and familiarize themselves with the location of emergency exits , safe space to secure within and the sound of alarms. This process also provides the University an opportunity to test the operation of fire and life safety system components in th e buildings. The MSU Police Emergency Management Division conducts follow -through activities designed for assessment and evaluation of emergency evacuation , seeking shelter, and securing- in-place plans and capabilities. The MSU Police Emergency Manageme nt Div ision maintains records of drills, documenting the date, time, and description of the exercise, as well as whether it was announced or unannounced. These records are available by request. The mass notification system, Everbridge, is tested three times per year: at the beginning of Fall Semester, at the beginning of Spring Semester, and again during National Severe Weather Awareness Week in March. The messaging includes a \"blast\" e- mail and a text message with links to additional information. Evacuat ion alarms are tested in all non-residential facilities during the week between the end of fall semester and summer semester. All buildings that have not had an actual evacuation occur in the previous year are tested. In addition, all residential facilit ies are required to test evacuation procedures for those facilities annually. That occurs within the first week of the fall semester and again during the spring semester. Missing Student Notification Policy In compliance with the Higher Education Oppor tunity Act, the University has established a Missing Student Notifica- tion Policy that describes the formal notification procedures to be followed when a student residing in on -ca mpus housing has been reported missing for more than 24 hours. The Miss- ing Student Notification Policy is available at https://reg.msu.edu/read/pdf/MissingStudentPolicy.pdf . At the time of registration, all students are requested to provide the Office of the Regi strar with the name and contact information of a personal emergency contact person(s). This information is maintained in a Personal Emergency Contact System and is designated as confidential. Only authorized campus officials, including designees of the Director of Residence Education and Housing Services and officers in the MSU Police Department, are provided this information in furtherance of the missing student investigation. The University encourages all students to provide personal emergency contact information. Incidents of missing students at the University should be reported immediately to the MSU Police Department at (517) 355 -2221. Upon receipt of a report of a missing student who resides in on -campus housing, the MSU Police contact the Director of Residence Education and Housing Services (or designee) and initiate an investigation. If the MSU Police determine that a student has been missing for more than 24 hours and has not returned to campus, the MSU Police will contact , within 24 hours of the official determination , the person(s) the student designated in the Personal Emergency Contact System. If the missing student is under 18 years of age and not emancipated, the student's custodial parent or legal guardian is also contac ted. Information that a student has been determined to be missing will be forwarded to other local law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in the area. The MSU Police Department actively investigates all reports of students missing from campus . The in vestigation is conducted pursuant to existing law and established policies and procedures of the MSU Police Department. Behavioral Threat Assessment Team The University has a collaborative multi -disciplinary team that provides a coordinated response to re ports of students, employees, or others on campus who have engaged in behav-ior indicating a possible threat of harm to self or other mem-bers of the community. The Behavioral Threat Assessment Team (\"BTAT\") meets regularly to assess the likelihood of risk and identify action that can be taken to potentially miti- gate the risk. It is composed of representatives of the follow-ing offices: MSU Police Department, Counseling and Psy- chiatric Services, University Physician, Student Health Ser- vices, Student Affairs and Services, Residence Education and Housing Services, ADA Coordinator, Dean of Students Office, Dean of Graduate School / Dean of Undergraduate Education, and Human Resources. BTAT's website, http://btat.msu.edu includes an online referral form by which any member of the MSU community can refer an issue of concern to the team for review. 13 | Page Reporting Crimes, Fires, Medical or Other Emergencies If you are a victim of a crime or a witness to one, or if you need to report a fire, medical, or other emergency, on or off-campus in the Greater Lansing or in any of the juris- dictions in whic h MSU has campuses, DIAL 911. MSU community members who become aware of criminal activity that represents a threat to students, employees, or campus visitors must report the criminal activity to the MSU Police immediately so that the University may issue a warn- ing to the campus community. MSU encourages individuals to report all crimes in an accurate and timely manner to both MSUPD and loca l law enforcement agencies when the vic- tim of a crime elects to, or is unable to, make a report. In a non- emergency situation, you should report suspicious people or activities, traffic accidents, or potential violations of law to the police agency serving the location where the activity occurs.

Crimes committed by MSU stude nts may also be violations of University regulations governing student conduct and may be reported to the Dean of Students Office at (517) 884 -0789. To make it as convenient as possible for students, employe es, and guests to report criminal incidents or other emergencies, the University has an enhanced 911 system for all campus telephones. This system displays the caller's number and location to the police dispatcher. In addition, over 17 0 \"Green Light\" emergency telephones are located throughout the East Lansing campus as well as over 400 emergency phones within the residence hall wings . These telephones ring directly to the Ingham County 911 dispatch center. In addition to providing voice contact, these devices pinpoint the location of the call. This Report (see Charts of Crime Statistics section) includes statistics on the following crimes that have been reported to the MSU Police: murder, non -negligent manslaughter, manslaughter by negligence , rape, fon dling, incest, statutory rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burgla ry, motor vehicle theft, arson , domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, ar- rests and disciplinary referrals for liquor law violations, drug law violations, and illegal weapons possession. This report also includes statistics on hate crimes . The list of crimes that must be reported as hate crimes include the aforementioned offenses, as well as crimes of larceny -theft, simple assault, intimidation, destruction, damage, or vandalism of prop erty that was motivated by the offender's bias against race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity , national origin, gender identity, or disability. 14 | Page This Report also includes statistics regarding those crimes that have been reported to other CSAs . Those campus officials include, but are not limited to: faculty advisors to registered student organizations, resident assistants , head coaches of Intercollegiate Athl etics, Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Teams , Director of Residence Edu- cation and Housing Services , Dean of Students Office , Assistant Director of Student Life - Greek Affairs, Assistant Director of Student Life - Student Government Advising, Assistant Director of Student Life - Student Activities, Director of Office for Education Abroad, Study Abroad Pro- gram Directors, Vice President for Student Affairs and Services, Secchia Center Security Manager, Associate Di- rector of the Broad School Executive MB A Program at the MSU Management Education Center, Associate Dean, Col-lege of Osteopathic Medicine -Detroit, and Assistant Dean, College of Osteopathic Medicine -Macomb. The University does not have a voluntary , confidential reporting system specifically for reporting crimes for inclu- sion in the annual security report. Therefore, there is no for- mal procedure for pastoral and professional counselors to inform the persons they are counseling of procedures to report crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis for i nclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics. Nonetheless, in- dividuals can report known or suspected misconduct 24/7 on MSU's Misconduct Hotline at https://misconduct.msu.edu/ or by calling (800) 763- 0764. Off-Campus Crime and Coordination with Other Law Enforcement Agencies The University does not formally monitor or record criminal activity by students at off -campus locations. The MSU Po- lice Department has Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with neighboring police departments. The MOUs accomplish a number of things including building on the pre- vious collaborations to provide services to, in particular, vic-tims of sexual assaul t and relationship violence. The MOUs memorialize the ongoing practice of agreeing to share infor-mation with the MSU Police Department about crimes that may pose a serious threat to the health and safety of the MSU campus community in order to facilitate the issuance of timely warnings and emergency notifications. The MSU Police Department monitors local, state, national, and international concerns that may affect the campus. The MSU Police have a detective assigned to work with the FBI as members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and they work closely with the Michigan Intelligence Operations (Fusion) Center in obtaining timely intelligence. The MSU Police also have one detective assigned to the FBI Cyber Crime Task Force who also works on intelligence related to cyber and technology threats. In cases of misconduct and criminal acts in East Lansing, victims are urged to contact the East Lansing Police or other community agencies to help resolve disputes. Communication about Campus Crimes and Safety In the event of an emergency that poses an immediate threat to the safety of the MSU campus , the MSU Police Depart- ment is responsible for developing and distributing emer- gency messages to alert the community. Distributed through the MSU Alert system, emergency messages inform sub- scribers about incidents and provide direction and infor-mation to prevent similar crimes and promote safety. To add additional communication methods to your MSU Alert pref-erences, visit http://alert.msu.edu . The University has a variety of ways of disseminat ing emergency information to the community if a threat or emer- gency occurs . The notification systems include the following: Public Media o Local radio and television stations are notified of any disasters or emergencies occurring on the University campus. WKAR, the public broadcasting station in East Lansing, serves as the primary contact for the Emergency Broadcast Network. o The University Communications Office coordinates connections with all major media outlets to provide emergency notifications. o Includes Residential and Hospitality Ser- vices systems. MSU Web Site o The University Communications Office can activate a website with pertinent information and instructions in the event of a disaster or emergency. The University conducts several emergency respo nse exercises each year and tests of the emergency notification systems on campus. These tests are designed to assess and evaluate the emergency plans and capabilities of the University. Desktop Alerting Software o Emergency messages can be sent to your computer desktop by downloading a free application from alert.msu.edu. When an emergency message is launched, the appli- cation will pop -up on your desktop notify- ing you about the alert message. Building Evacuation Alarms o Every campus building has an evacuatio n alarm. Newer systems are also equipped with a voice PA system by which instructions may be given. CodeBlue Speaker Systems 15 | Page o CodeBlue speakers are located in each resi- dence hall and on GreenLight phone kiosks across campus. They provide audible mes- sages to the community and provide direc- tions to follow. Police Vehicle Public Address o MSU Police patrol cars are equipped with public address systems that can be used to give emergency action instructions. Mass Calling and Notification o The MSU Alert system allows authorized personnel to send a recorded voice message, e-mail, and/or text message simultaneously from a remote site. The messages contain important information about the emergency and are created upon the MSU Police learn- ing o f the event. Employees and students automatically receive the messages through their most current email and cell phone in- formation on file. MSU also has an option for visitors to campus to sign up to receive the messages. Visitors may receive MSU Alert n otifications by subscribing to the MSU Police Department NIXLE Channel. Text MSUALERT to 888777. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies. When the system is activated, one or more of the following alerts are sent, de- pending on the type of emergency, timely warning, and/or contact information the re- cipient has provided. Phone Call o Individuals who have provided their phone numbers and/or who have a phone number registered with MSU are called and an auto-mated voice message is played. E-Mail o An e -mail about a disaster or emer- gency is sent to all individuals who have provided e -mail ad dresses or who are registered within the MSU systems. MSU email addresses (@msu.edu) are already imported into the system. The message is sent from \"MSU Alert [alert@msu.edu ].\" SMS Text Message o Individuals who have provided cell phone numbers are sent a text mes- sage about the alert. Facebook and Twitter o The system can disseminate infor-mation using the department's Fa- cebook and Twitter accounts to post information about actions to take or information that is critical. You can follow the MSU Police Departm ent on Facebook and Twitter at @msupolice. o RSS Feeds and Desktop Alerting Entities that receive RSS feeds from MSU and those that have downloaded the desktop alerting software from http://alert.msu.edu will receive a message for display. o Outdoor Speakers and Warning Sirens o Eight outdoor speakers that can make public address announce- ments and/or a warning siren are strategically placed on the MSU campus to sound in the event of an emergency. That includes a tor-nado or severe weather warning using sirens. The sirens and audi- ble speaker announcements are tested on the first Saturday of every month at 1:00 P.M in con- nection with the county- wide test of sirens. Timely Warnings The MSU Chief of Police or designee is responsible for de- termining whether criminal activity reported to the MSU Po- lice or other campus security authorities warrants the issu-ance of a timely warning to the campus community. When the MSU Police Department determines that there may be a serious or continuing threat to the health or safety of on-cam- pus students, employees, or visitors, it will provide a timely warning campus -wide in a manner that is intended to enable campus community members to protect themselves and aid in the prevention of similar crimes. Timely warnings are is- sued only in the event that a Clery reportable crime occurs on University -owned or controlled property. The particular method of communication by which the timely warning is provided may vary depending on the spe- cific circumstances of the crime and the potential threat to safety. Timely warnings are issued by e-mail, phone, or text message sent to students, faculty, and staff informing them of the crime. Alerts may also be posted to Facebook or Twit- ter. An announcement of the crime may be posted on the MSU Police website at www.police.msu.edu . The Univer- sity may also make formal press releases to various media outlets in the surrounding area. Depending on the incident, particularly in situations that pose an immediate threat to the community, the MSU Police will coordinate with the Uni- versity Communications Office to post a notice on the MSU website at www.msu.edu . 16 | Page Emergency Notifications Emergency Notifications are issued when the Chief of Police or designee has confirmed a significant emergency or dan- gerous situation (e.g., tornado/severe weather warning, chemical spill, fire, active violence , natural gas leak, or ter- rorist incident) is cu rrently occurring on or imminently threatening the campus . MSU will, without delay, and taking into account the safety of the community, determine the content of the notification and initiate an alert via the notification system, unless issuing a notification will, in the professional judgment of responsi-ble authorities, compromise efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency. The MSU Chief of Police or designee evaluates information available on a case- by-case b asis and determines whether an emergency notification is necessary. The Chief or designee determines who will receive the notification based on the lo- cation and type of emergency. The entire campus community may be notified where there is the potential tha t a large seg- ment of the community will be affected. MSU Police deter-mine the content of the notification based on what infor-mation is available and relevant to ensure the safety of the campus community. MSU Police will continue to assess the situation and notify additional segments of the community, if necessary. MSU Police initiate the emergency notification system using text message, email, social media, desktop alerting, sirens/speakers, and/or telephone. MSU Police Ser- geants, Lieutenants, Captains, Dep uty Chiefs, Assistant Chief, the Chief of Police, and the trained Professional Emer- gency Managers are responsible for carrying out these pro- cedures. This warning is different from a Timely Warning because it is not limited to Clery crimes or Clery geography and it may target certain segments of campus. Public Safety Notices Public Safety Notices are issued when neither a Timely Warning nor an Emergency Notification is warranted, but the MSU Police Depart ment nevertheless believes that it has im- portant public safety information that should be made avail- able to the campus community. Examples of instances when a Public Safety Notice could be issued include: providing general crime prevention information, a request for public assistance in solving a crime, or distributing specific safety information in a situation that does not reach the threshold for a Timely Warning or an Emergency Notification. Clery Crime and Fire Log MSU Police Department maintains a daily log of crimes (and fires) that occur on campus. The log is accessible to the pub-lic and can be accessed at: http://police.msu.edu/re- sources/clery -crime -fire-log/. It contains the most recent 60 days' worth of reports of crimes and fires. Each incident is posted within two business days of the report. Each entry in the log contains the nature, date, time, and general location of each crime and the disposition of the complaint, if known. An y portion of the log that is older than 60 days can be made available within two business days of a request for public in-spection. Programming Programs regarding securi ty procedures and practices are provided at least 24 times a year at student orientation in or- der to reach all new students before classes begin . These pro- grams also encourage the campus community to look out for themselves and one another. The program provides students with instructions on the Spartan ID card used to enter resi- dence halls and other secured areas, locking their door when they leave their rooms , using \"Green Light\" emergency phones located around campus, and calling 911 for emergen- cies. A 1 -2 hour training session is conducted annually with facility representatives, known as Emergency Action Team Leaders, who assist faculty, staff, students, and patrons in the event of a campus security emergency, such as a person ac- tively shooting, suspicious persons, secur ing a building from theft, etc. Each session has between 50 -75 representatives in attendance and the sessions are conducted 8-10 times during the summer months. MSUPD conducts direct delivery \"Ac- tive Violence Training\" programs w ith faculty, staff and stu- dents upon request . These programs are offered to depart- ments as needed throughout the academic year and during summer break. Crime Prevention programs are provided for both students and employees through our Community Policing initiative. Community Police Officers, with offices located strategi- cally throughout campus, provide tailored programming as needed. These trainings are conducted in -person and include information on securing your belongings and personal prop- erty, locking doors, reporting suspicious persons or activity, the \"See Something, Say Something\" cam paign , MSUPD's anonymous texting tip line, personal safety for moving around campus, and instruction on review ing online crime logs. A variety of c ommunity programs are aimed at bringing awareness of issues to the community and offering training. These pr ograms include information on ac tive violence i nci- dents, alcohol and d rug issues, car seat inspections and in- stallations, canine demonstrations, \"RAD\" (Rape, Aggres- sion, Defense) training for students , and safety and security surveys of campus work areas. MSUPD partner s with the Michigan Office of Highway Safety and Planning to promote seatbelt usage and to reduce and eliminate incidents of driv- ing while impaired by alcohol or drugs. MSUPD has also conducted responsible awareness campaigns regarding safety and alcohol and drug use during holidays and celebra- tions . Safety and Security: Campus Facilities University facilities are well maintained and their security is given regular attention. Many cultural and athletic events held in University facilities ar e open to the public. Other facilities, such as the bookstore, library, and residence hall convenience stores, are also open to the public. Access to academic and administrative facilities on campus is 17 | Page generally limited to students, employees, and visito rs who are present to conduct University business. Administrative buildings are generally open from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and academic buildings are generally open from 7:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m. Academic buildings are scheduled to be open on weekends only as needed. Building access hours are posted on each facility. Access to individual classrooms, laboratories, and programs is limited to those enrolled. Access to University residence hall and apartment living areas is limited to resi-dents and their invited guests. Landscaping and outside lighting on campus is designed for pedestrian safety and security. Sidewalks are designed to provide well -traveled, lighted routes from parking areas to buildings and from building to building. Landscape personnel trim shrubs from sidewalks, walkways, and building entrances to enhance lighting and visibility. Campus walkways are inspected regularly to ensure adequate lighting and replacement of burned -out lights. The \"Green Light\" Emergenc y Telephone System follows major walkways. Maps showing the walkways and emergency telephones are available at the MSU Police Department, 1120 Red Cedar Road, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, or by calling (517) 355 -2221. Safety and Security: Residence Halls All living areas in the residence halls are locked and can only be accessed by residents using their MSU identification card. Public spaces in residence halls and university apartments are locked by midnight each night. Residents entering after midnight must scan their MSU ID at designated doors through the use of electronic key ac- cess. Guests must be escorted and must always be accom- panied by a resident of the building . Each residen t is lim- ited to three guests. Access protocols are outlined in the On-Campus Housing Handbook with which students agree to comply. At the start of each semester, a Safety Awareness Cam- paign titled Live On Live Safe is launched by Residence Education and Housing Services ( REHS ) Communications. Materials are posted in each lobby of the residence halls and apartments to remind students and guests of important safety reminders including but not limited to alcohol safety, being mindful of friends behavior, rem aining in groups when possible, locking your door, securing belongings, be- ing aware of surroundings and reminders of whom to con- tact if help is needed. RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT MSU prohibits the crimes of dating violence, domestic vio- lence, sexual assault, and stalking. Under Michigan law, these crimes are defined as follows: Stalking is a willful course of conduct involving re- peated or continuing harassment of another individ- ual that would cause a reasonable person to feel ter- rorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, har-assed, or molested and that actually causes the vic- tim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested. Domestic violence is defined as an assault or assault and battery of: 1) a current or former spouse, 2) an individual with whom the assailant has or has had a dating relationship, 3) an individual with whom the assailant has had a child in common, or 4) a resident or former resident of the assailant's household. o \"Dating rel ationship\" means frequent, in- timate associations primarily character-ized by the expectation of affectional in- volvement. This term does not include a casual relationship or an ordinary fraterni-zation between two individuals in a busi- ness or social context. o Dating Violence is a form of domestic vi-olence under Michigan law. Michigan criminal laws regarding sexual assault are separated into four degrees of criminal sexual con- duct. For each of those criminal offenses, the fol- lowing definitions apply: o \"Sexual con tact\" includes the intentional touching of the victim's or actor's intimate parts or the intentional touching of the clothing covering the immediate area of the victim's or actor's intimate parts, if that intentional touching can reasonably be construed as being for the purpose of sex- ual arousal or gratification, done for a sex-ual purpose, or in a sexual manner for: (i) revenge, (ii) to inflict humiliation, or (iii) out of anger. o \"Sexual penetration\" means sexual inter-course, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal in ter- course, or any other intrusion, however slight, of any part of a person's body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another person's body, but emission of semen is not required. Consent is not defined by Michigan law. MSU's Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct Pol- icy defines consent as the \"voluntary, willful, and unambiguous agreement to engage in a specific sex- ual activity during a sexual encounter.\" The University encourages all witnesses of relationship vio- lence or sexual mis conduct to engage in bystander interven- tion when safe to do so. The role of a bystander is to inter- vene or interrupt a situation that could violate someone's au- tonomy or safety. 18 | Page Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX Policy The MSU Relat ionship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX (RVSM) Policy , which can be found at https://civil- rights.msu.edu/_assets/docu- ments/RVSM%20and%20Title%20I X%20Policy.pdf, applies to all members of the University community \u2014 faculty, staff, and students \u2014and applies to all types of RVSM, including same -sex RVSM . The policy defines prohibited behavior and outlines procedures for submitting a complaint about sexual misconduct and relationship vio- lence, including with whom to file a complaint. Specifically, the policy defines domestic violence, dating violence, stalk- ing, sexual harassment, non-consensual sexual contact, non - consensual sexual penetration, rape, incest, sexual exploita- tion, retaliation, and consent. The policy also covers privacy and confidentiality, complaint procedures, and provides re- sources. Offices providing information regarding relation- ship violence and sexual misconduct are listed in th e policy . The MSU Office for Civil Rights and Title IX Education and Compliance, through its Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) , has primary responsibility for the enforcement of the RVSM Policy at MSU. MSU produces periodic reports, which can be found on the Office for Civil Rights and Title IX website at www.civilrights.msu.edu , summarizing University's in- vestigative efforts, advocacy services, and education and awareness programs. Note that there are a n umber of key dif- ferences in the way data is reported in this Annual Security and Fire Safety Report and in the Title IX reports . For ex- ample, the Title IX report s include reports of crime outside of jurisdiction under the Clery Act . The Clery Act, howeve r, requires reporting only those Clery Act crimes occurring on \"Clery geography\" . In addition, the Title IX reports includes incidents of sexual harassment , which would not constitute sex offenses under the Clery Act. Finally, some reports of crime are m ade without a report of where the crime occurred. If the University cannot determine the crime occurred in or on its \"Clery geography, \" it cannot count it under the Clery Act as a Clery Act crime ; however, those numbers are in- cluded in MSU's Title IX report s. Immediate Considerations for Survivors Sexual Assault Survivors are encouraged to consider getting immedi- ate medical care for their health needs (such as possi- ble injuries, pregnancy, sexually transmitted infec-tions (STIs), or HIV) and evidence collection. Survi- vors should try to preserve evidence even if they are unsure at the time whether to press charges. Evidence collection can be important for proof in a criminal or university investigation as well as in obtaining a pro-tection order. Survivors should not shower, douche, urinate, brush their teeth, or change/discard their clothes until evidence can be collected by the by the MSU Sexual Assault Healthcare Program (SAHP) program and/or the police. SAHP is a program that provides survivors with the services of a registered nurse specially trained to care for sexual assault pa- tients. The specially trained nurse conducts medical forensic examinations and can serve as an expert wit- ness in a court of law. Survivors should s tore evi- dence in a paper bag. Survivors can call the confidential Sexual Assault Cri- sis Line at (517) 372- 6666, available 24 hours and seven days a week. Survivor s can contact the Center for Survivors (https://centerforsurvivors.msu.edu/ ) for confidential counseling, survivor advocacy assistance, and safety planning. The Center for Survivors notifies survivors of the MSU and Police reporting process. Survivors are encouraged to consider contacting the police. Even if a survivor does not know whether they want to make a criminal complaint, the police can still document the information and collect evidence. The MSU Police Department encourage s all survivors to file a report. University personnel will assist the sur- vivor , at the survivor's request, in notifying the au- thoriti es. For suspected drug- induced assaults, survivors should seek medical attention including drug testing as soon as possible. The presence of drugs in blood or urine is short -lived, sometimes as short as six hours. If nec- essary, a survivor should save ur ine in a clean con- tainer and refrigerate it until it can be tested. Survivors are encouraged to seek support from a sex- ual assault advocate/counselor, close friend, family member, or another supportive, safe person. Relationship Violence / Stalking Survi vors are encouraged to seek medical attention if needed. Survivors should try to preserve evidence even if they are unsure at the time whether to press charges . Evi- dence collection can be important for proof in a crim-inal or university investigation as well as in o btaining a protection order. Survivors are encouraged to engage in safety planning with an advocate, if possible, before leaving an abu-sive relationsh ip or serving legal documents. Survi- vors are encouraged to consider obtaining a Personal Protection Order if they are being stalked or abused. For a dditional information including office contacts, see Orders of Protection and No- Contact section be- low. Survivors should consider that an abuser might be monitoring cell phone, e -mails, odometer, financial statements, etc. Survivors are encouraged to consider contacting the police. Even if a survivor does not know whether they 19 | Page want to pursue criminal proceedings in court, the po- lice can still document the information and collect ev- idence. The MSU Police encourage all survivors to file a report. University personnel will assist a survi- vor, at the survivor's request, to notify the authorities. Survivors are encouraged to document abusive behav- ior in a journal, with dates, times, and other details. Survivors are encouraged to seek support from an ad- vocate, counselor, friend, or other supportive, safe person. Survivors can contact MSU Safe Place, which pro- vides advocacy, emergency shelter, counsel ing, sup- port groups, safety planning, referrals, and other in- formation to survivors of relationship violence and stalking. Services are available to students, faculty, staff, and their spouses/partners and to non- affiliated members of the surrounding comm unities. All ser- vices are free and confidential. MSU Safe Place noti- fies survivors of the MSU and Police reporting pro- cess. Call MSU Safe Place at (517) 355 -1100 or visit www.safeplace.msu.edu . Reporting Pursuant to the RVSM Policy, most University employees are obligated to bring reports of relationship violence and sexual misconduct to the attention of the Office of Institu- tional Equity and to the MSU Police. All individuals are en- couraged to report promptly to the University conduct that may violate the RVSM Policy. In addition, all individuals are encouraged to report conduct that may also violate crim- inal law both to the University and to local law enforcement. These processes are not mutua lly exclusive, however. The reporting mechanisms for University student s, employ- ees, or third party community members who seek to make a complaint or report of sexual misconduct or relationship vi- olence are: Make a report to OIE 24; Contact the MSU Police for assistance in filing a criminal complaint and preserving physical evidence; and/or Contact local law enforcement to file a criminal com-plaint if the conduct occurs off campus. Claimant s 25 may pursue some or all of these steps at the same time (e.g., one may simultaneously pursue an internal com- plaint and a criminal complaint). When talking to one of these offices, Claimants do not need to know whether they wish to request any particular course of action. Claimant s do not need to know how to label what happened. Choosing to make a complaint and deciding how to proceed after making the complaint can be a process that unfolds over time. Be-fore or during this decision -making process, Claima nts are encouraged to seek support and information from a c onfiden- tial resource. Persons who experience relationship violence or sexual mis-conduct may decline to notify authorities. The MSU Center for Survivors , MSU Safe Place, the University Ombudsper- son, MSU Counseling and Psychiatric Services, and the MSU Employee Assistance Program offices can provide a confidential space where University community members may explore their options as well as possible outcomes . Whether parties opt to report or not, members of the Univer- sity community are encouraged to seek support from confi- dential counselors, on or off campus. Campus authorities can assist survivors in notifying law enforcement authorities if the survivor so chooses. Reporting Contact Information Anyone may make a report using any method ( online, phone, email, in -person, etc.) Following is the contact information for both reporting units on campus: Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) 408 W. Circle Dr, Suite 4, Olds Hall East Lansing MI 48824 (517) 353- 3922 www.oie.msu.edu oie@msu.edu MSU Police Department Lansing, MI 48824 (517) 355- 2221 Emergencies: 911 Interim Action for Survivors and Orders of Protection and No- Contact Interim and Supportive M easures The University may take interim or supportive measures it deems necessary during an investigation and adjudication . Interim and supportive measure s are those services, accom- modations , and other forms of assistance the University puts in place after receiving notice of alleged relationship vio- lence or sexual misconduct, but before any final outcomes (investigatory, disciplinary, or remedial) have been deter- mined. Supportive Measures: The University offers non- disciplinary, non -punitive individualized services as appropria te, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to a Claimant or a Respondent before or af- ter the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal 24 OIE includes the Title IX Coordinator, Director of OIE, Deputy Direc- tors of OIE, and its investigators. 25 An individual who may have been subjected to prohibited conduct re- gardless of whether that person makes a report is referred to as a \"Claiman t\" and an individual again st whom a complaint is filed is referred as a \"R espondent.\" 20 | Page complaint has been filed, and regardless of whether the Claimant chooses to speak with MSU PD or other law enforcement. Supportive measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to MSU's educa- tion programs or activities, including but not limited to protecting the safety of all parties or the Univer-sity's educational or employment environment or to deter conduct prohibited under this policy. Supportive measures will not unreasonably burden the other party. Supportive measures may include referrals to counsel ing; extensions of deadlines or other course - related adjustments; modifications of work or class schedules; mutual no contact directives; ASMSU Safe Ride services; changes in work or housing locations; leaves of absence; increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus; and other similar measures. To the extent possible, the University will not disclose the provision of supportive measures to a Claimant or R espondent unless necessary to provide the supportiv e measures. Emergency Removal of Students: The University may remove any student from its program or activity on an e mergency basis if there is an immediate threat to the physical safety of any students or other individ-uals arising from allegations under this Policy. Prior to removal, the University must undertake an individ- ualized safety and risk analysis, and, where such anal- ysis determines a credible safety risk exists, provide the party with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal. Adminis trative Leave of Employees: The Univer- sity may place non -student employees on administra- tive leave prior to or following the filing of formal complaint and through final resolution of the formal grievance process. More information regarding ad-ministrative leave of faculty and academic staff may be found at https://hr.msu.edu/policies -proce- dures/faculty -academic- staff/faculty -handbook/ten- the MSU O ffice of Em- ployee Relations. Other Interim Measures: Other interim measures may be available on a case by case basis. Any interim employment action will be taken consistent with the University's rights as an employer. Orders of Protection and No-Contact OIE may decide to issue a \"no -contact directive \" as a protec- tive measure. For example, a no -contact directive may pro- hibit the C laimant and Respondent from having contact with one another. It can also limit or block the Claimant's or Re- spondent's access to certain areas of campus or require the Claimant or Respondent to move to a different residential lo- cation and/or class section. No- contact directives are issued on a case -by-case basis and are enforced at the University level. A Personal Protection Order (PPO) is different th an a no - contact directive or another order issued by the University. A PPO is issued by the state court system - not by the Uni- versity. A PPO is an order that forbids an individual from doing something or requires an individual to do something. A PPO is enforced by the police. The Center for Survivors and Safe Place offer advocacy services , including assistance in obtaining a PPO.

The process will be prompt, fair, and im- partial to the final result. The University has an obligation to determine what o ccurred and then to take appropriate steps to resolve the situation. In fulfilling these obligations, the University will respond to complaints, reports, or infor- 21 | Page mation about incidents of sexual misconduct and relation- ship violence to stop the prohibited conduct, eliminate any hostile environment, take steps to prevent the recurrence of the prohibited conduct, and address any effects on campus or at University- sponsored programs and activities off -campus. Trained professionals 26 conduct investigations under the oversight of the Title IX Coordinator or their designee. Upon receipt of a report (verbal, in- person, electronic, in writing, or other means), OIE will conduct an initial assessment to determine coverage under the policy. If after the submission of a report, a formal complaint is signed by a claimant or the Title IX Coordinator and the information in the formal com- plaint meets either the University RVSM coverage criteria and/or the Title IX coverage criteria, the University will fol- low the formal grievance process. A formal complaint may be dismissed for various reasons outlined in the policy, in- cluding if coverage requirements are not met, the claimant requests withdrawal, lack of affiliation with the university, or specific circumstances prevent gathering sufficient evi-dence. If a formal complaint meets both the University RVSM cov- erage and the Title IX coverage, Title IX regulations require that the formal grievance process include all of the proce- dural requirements specific to the Title IX regulations, as set forth in the Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX Policy. If jurisdiction under the policy is estab- lished, investigations typically include interviews of the Claimant , Respondent , and any witnesses. A review of evi- dence, such as electronic and written material, will be con- ducted if any such evidence is available. The University uti- lizes a preponderance of the evidence standard during the in-vestigation process, as well as in all related proceedings, in-cluding disciplinary hearings. At the conclusion of the fact- finding portion of the inve stigation, b oth the C laimant and the Respondent will be provided with an opportunity to re- view all evidence that directly relates to the allegations and provide feedback to the information gathered. A hearing may take place, if the reported conduct falls w ithin Title IX or if credibility is at issue and material to the outcome, to allow for cross- examination of the other party and requested wit- nesses. The Resolution Officer conducts the hearing and will issue a written decision determining whether Universit y pol- icy was violated. If a hearing does not occur, the investigator will issue a final investigation report and make a determination whether Uni-versity policy was violated. The University will use its best efforts to complete the fact -finding portion of investigations of relationship violence, stalking, or sexual misconduct within 90 calendar days, although this timeframe may be ex- tended for good cause . Throughout the process, C laimants and Respondents may have an advisor or support person of their choice present at any meeting related to Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct and Title IX Policy . Appeals If a formal complaint is dismissed, claimant and respondent shall receive notice of the dismis sal, including notation as to the reason for the dismissal and an explanation of their rights to appeal to the University Equity Review Officer or designee within five (5) calendar days of the notice of dis-missal. Claimants and Respondents may file a writt en appeal re- garding the determination of responsibility with the Univer-sity's Equity Review Officer within ten (10) calendar days from the date that a written decision is issued on any of the following bases: 1. Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter; 2. New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; 3. The Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or deci- sion-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against claimants or respondents generally or the in-dividual claimant or respondent that affected the out-come of the matter; and/or 4. The written decision was arbitrary and capricious. If an appeal is filed regarding t he determination of responsi- bility, the other part(ies) will have ten (10) calendar days to respond to the appeal in writing. The response may include a written statement in support of, or challenging, the deci-sion. The Equity Review Officer 27 will review the appeal and any response(s) and issue a written decision within eighteen (18) calendar days of receiving the appeal docu-ments, including any responses. The appeal decision will be issued simultaneously to all parties. Disciplinary Proceedings Student If a student is found responsible for an RVSM Polic y viola- tion, the Associate Director for the Office for Civil Rights and Title IX or designee will determine the appropriate sanc- tion(s) after consultation with the decision- maker and con- sideration of the sanctioning factors. If either party ( Claim- ant or R espondent) wishes to challenge the sanction(s), they may do so by submitting a written challenge to the Dean of 26 Annual training is provided by the University and outside organizations that covers MSU's policies and grievance procedures; issues related to da- ting violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking; how to con- duct an investigation and hearing process that protects the safety of the vic- tims and promotes accountability ; the role and duties of the OIE office and the Title IX Coordinator; h ow to recognize and appropriately address inci- dents and complaints under Title IX, including where and with whom to report such incidents; how to identify sex discrimination, sexual and gender -based harassment, assault and violence; the University's responsibilities un- der Title IX to address such allegations; confidentiality requirements; infor- mation on the relevant resources available to victims; and trauma -informed investigation practices. 27 The Equity Review Officer is a neutral individual appointed by the Title IX Coordinator to adjudicate appeals under this process. 22 | Page Students Office within ten (10) calendar days after the dete r- mination of responsibility becomes final. The Dean of Stu- dents Office may modify a sanction if it determines that the sanction is clearly inappropriate or incommensurate with the seriousness of the conduct. MSU will, upon written request, disclose to the alleged victim of a crime of violence or a non- forcible sex offense, the report on the results of any discipli-nary proceeding conducted by MSU against a student who is the alleged perpetrator of such crime or offense. If the al- leged victim is deceased as a result of such crime or offense, the next of kin of such victim shall be treated as the alleged victim for purposes of this paragraph.

Employee If a non -student is found responsible for violating the Policy, the sanction will be referr ed to the appropriate process for discipline or corrective action facilitated by the Office of Employee Relations, Academic Human Resources and/or unit leadership to determine the appropriate personnel action or other corrective measure. Remedies, sanctions, and disci-pline as to faculty, staff, and academic staff will be deter- mined and implemented consistent with the University's rights as an employer and applicable collective bargaining agree ments . Institutional discipline for a finding of responsi- bility may be informed by the nature and the gravity of the misconduct. Staff, academic staff, and faculty may be subject to discipli- nary action up to and including discharge. The following policie s set forth options available to employees at MSU to challenge sanctions imposed because of a finding of viola- tion of the RVSM Policy. The policies include descriptions of the parties' right to adv isors, right to information, timeframes, notifications, and other matters: Faculty and Academic Staff Grievance System For employees, appeals of the OIE or Resolution Officer de-cision are governed by the Appeal Procedures under the RVSM and Title IX Policy. Appeals of sanctions are gov- erned by the Faculty Grievan ce Policy for faculty and aca- demic staff. A faculty member or an academic staff member who is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement may file a for-mal grievance against an administrator that alleges a viola- tion of University, college, department, school, or unit policy or an established practice. Thus, if a faculty or academic staff member is disciplined under the RVSM Policy, he/she may file a grievance with the Faculty Grievance Officer claiming the disciplinary action violated a University, co l- lege, department, school or unit policy or established prac-tice. For more information on the Faculty Grievance Policy party to a number of collective bargaining agree-ments with unions covering MSU employees. Each collec- tive bargaining agreement will govern how the employees subject to that agreement may challenge a disciplinary ac-tion: https://hr.msu.edu/contracts/index.html . Other MSU has a grievance system for non -union support staff. The policy specifics are contained in the Non- Union Regu- lar Support Staff Grievance Procedure: https://hr.msu.edu/ua/discipline/support -staff/.

Confidentiality/Privacy Investigations - confidentiality Complaints and information gathered during the investiga-tion process are kept private to the extent permitted by law , except insofar as information needs to be disclosed so that the University may eff ectively investigate the matter or take corrective action. Public Reporting - confidentiality The University has a number of public reporting obligations. Nevertheless, the University endeavors to protect confiden- tiality to the extent permitted by law. For example, public reports and the Crime Log do not include any personally identifying information about a survivor. Additionally , MSUPD's t imely warnings and emergency notifications do not contain personally identifi able information about the sur- vivor . The Office of Institutional Equity, Office for Civil Rights, and MSUPD work with the University's FOIA Coordinator to appropriately identify and redact documents subject to public records requests in order to remove personally identi- fying information not required to be shared pursuant to law and University policy. Interim and Supportive Measures - confidenti- ality The University will maintain the privacy of any interim and supportive measures provided under this policy to the extent practicable and will promptly address any violation of the interim mea sures. The Office of Institutional Equity and Of- fice for Civil Rights limit the sharing of information to Uni-versity officials who assist in carrying out such accommoda-tions and protective measures. Written Notification Complaint Submission Each employee and student who files a RVSM claim with the University receives written notification of: 24 | PageThe availability of supportive measures28, interim measures, confidential resources, and other resources with or without the filing of a formal complaint; the availability of University -provided advisors; the pro- cess for filing a formal complaint; and the oppor-tunity to meet with OIE to discuss options .

The MSU Police also publish and distribute personal safety awareness brochures that may be obtained by contact-ing the MSU Police Department, 1120 Red Cedar Road, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, or by calling (517) 355- 2221. MSU Police officers speak at every Family Orientation Program . Information about personal and property safety, crime awareness, emergency procedures, and police resources is distributed to students through Spartan Life OnLine, on bulletin boards in every residence hall; in orientation newsletters, housing newsletters, and the campus newspaper, The State News; and on the MSU Police Department's web page at http:// www.police.msu.edu/ , as well as by communications to Facebook and Twitter accounts. Educational Programs The University has several methods of providing education about RVSM to campus , including online and in -person training , educational and awareness campaign s and other ed- ucational opportunities through out the academic year . These are described further herein . The University's RVSM edu- cational programs make clear that RVSM is prohibited at MSU. For more information on MSU 's education and awareness programs visit the MSU Office for Civil Rights Prevention, Outreach and Education department (POE) web- site at www.poe .msu.edu . First year, second year, and transfer students are required to complete in- person training. All other students are required to complete an annual online training program. Students will not be able to access important academic information in the StuInfo sys tem, including grades, until they complete this training. All employees are required to complete an online training program within 30 days of hire and biennially thereafter. Failure to complete the required online training will result in notification to Hu man Resources or Academic Human Re- sources, which may result in disciplinary action. The online RVSM training programs for students and em-ployees are designed to provide information on the follow- ing: Information to identify sex discrimination and sex- ual har assment, including relationship violence and sexual misconduct; Raise awareness of the impact of these issues on thecampus community and encourage community members to engage in efforts to end these types ofviolence; Advise members of the MSU community about their rights and reporting options; Communicate behavioral expectations for all mem-bers of the MSU community as outlined in the pol-icy; 28 Supportive measures may include requests regarding academic situa- tions, living situations, transportation situations, working situations, and protective measures. 25 | Page Connect community members with support, re- sources, and information on how to support others who have experienced violence; Provide safe and effective strategies for bystander intervention; Share strategies for risk reduction; and Train employees on their role in administering the policy and their obligations as mandatory reporters. For more information on MSU's o nline RVSM training pro- grams visit the POE website at www.poe.msu.edu . POE offers a variety of prevention programs to educate MSU Community members regarding RVSM. The Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Prevent ion Program (\"SARV\") workshop is a two-hour, peer- facilitated workshop for first year students and transfer students. The SARV program of- fers a forum for students to engage in conversation and be educated about sexual assault and relationship violence on campus, and empowers these students to become active members in keeping the MSU community safe. POE also offers a LBGTQ SARV Specialized Workshop. During this workshop, the format is slightly changed so all scenarios are gender neutral. There is no gender breakout for the second half of the workshop, as there are for other SARV programs. Additional information will be provided regarding unique challenges LBGTQ survivors of sexual assault and relationship violence may face, as well as resources to ad-dress ne eds specific to LBGTQ individuals. POE provides an International Student SARV Workshop is designed to accommodate a wide range of cultural back-grounds, social norms, and education regarding issues of sexual assault and relationship violence. This workshop pro- vides more definitions of terms, education regarding Ameri- can university culture, and additional information about legal issues and resources for international students. For more in- formation or to register , visit the POE website at www.poe.msu.edu . POE provides specialized workshops for Greek- affiliated students, called Greeks Take the Lead. The focus of this pro- gram, which was developed collaboratively with the Greek community, is to raise awareness about issues of relationship violence and sexual misconduct, recognize ways to inter- vene, understand the intersection of alcohol and sexual vio- lence, discuss positive tools for supporting survivors, and tips for making their environment safer. MSU teaches bystan der intervention in a multitude of pro- grams. Bystander intervention education teaches people to intervene or interrupt a situation that could violate some- one's autonomy or safety. Bystander intervention techniques may include speaking up if you hear someon e harassing an- other person, interrupting something you think might be sus- picious or calling 911 when you see someone in immediate danger. Because every situation has unique circumstances, similar situations may require different methods of interven-tion. Th e trainings not only discuss various bystander inter- vention options, but also help participants understand when it is appropriate to intervene. POE also provides a Bystander Network Program designed for upper -level students as a way to continue the convers a- tion of preventing and ending sexual violence through by- stander intervention, notions of consent, and challenging rape culture. This specialized, MSU -specific workshop is de- signed to engage upper -level students in conversations and content that encourage open and honest dialogue on taking action in their communities and stepping up to end sexual violence. The Bystander Network Program is mandatory for all second year MSU students. Similarly, multiple programs discuss safety and risk reduc- tion. MSU focuses on reducing risk of sexual assault and re- lationship violence by educating students on the dynamic and tactics of relationship violence ; educating students on common misconceptions, such as strangers perpetrate most sexual assaults , (when, in fact, most are actually from people that an individual know s/trust s); teaching how alcohol is uti- lized to coerce someone into having sex; \"fight, flight or freeze\" response information ; and how other tactics, such as isolating a victim, are used to make someone more vul nera- ble. Educating students, staff and faculty in identifying and un- derstanding the problem, taking action safely and knowing resources to help impacted people is critical to creating a safe campus environment. Bystander intervention and other risk reducti on education is incorporated into many campus trainings including: - The Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Pre-vention Program (mandatory in- person training for incoming students) - The Bystander Network (mandatory in- person training for second year students) - Greeks Take the Lead training for risk managers and chapter presidents in MSU fraternity and soror- ity communities - Residential Assistant staff trainings - Online faculty/staff training (mandatory) - Third year and above student online training (man-datory) - Assorted community -specific trainings and work- shops MSU offers a Self Defense Program, which is a free, two - hour self- defense workshop that provides common sense and practical information regarding sexual assault preven- tion. Learn verbal, non -verbal, psychological, and physical techniques for defending potentially violent encounters. Par-ticipants will also practice basic self -defense skills to help ward off an attack. The program is interactive and fun while open to both women and men for no cost. 26 | Page The MSU Center for Survivors (\"CFS \") provides crisis in- tervention, counseling, and advocacy services to survivors of sexual violence. Services available include a 24 -hour hot- line, online crisis chat (7 days a week 10am -10pm), individ- ual and group counseling, and legal, institutional, academic and personal advocacy. These services are available to sur- vivors of sexual assault and non -offending co- survivors. Resources Below are a few of the resources available on campus.

The MSU Drug and Alcohol Policy applies to all members of the University community \u2014faculty, staff, and students. The Policy defines prohibited behavior and outlines conse-quences for violations. Also described are educational and counseling resources. Additional regulations specifically addressing student behaviors related to alcohol and other drugs can be found in Spartan Life OnLine . As outlined more fully in the Policy, General Student Regu-lations 2.11 -2.14 prohibit the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students on Uni- versity property or as part of any of its activities, including University -sponsored or student group -sponsored activities off campus. Alleged violations of MSU regulations are ad- judicated through the student conduct process. Conse-quences for violations may include, but are not limited to, some form of disciplinary probation, required attendance at educational programs, referral for assessment and treatment, relocation to a new living environment, and suspension from MSU for sale of illegal drugs or repeated violations of the regulations. In addition, students can expect to be arrested and prosecuted for unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol on campus. Consistent with Michigan and federal law, MSU maintains a workplace free f rom the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, pos-session, or use of controlled substances, illicit drugs, and al- cohol are prohibited on any property under the control of and governed by the Board of Trustees of MSU, and at any site where work is performed by individuals on behalf of the Uni- versity. Pursuant to applicable University procedures gov- erning employee discipline, any employee involved in the unlawful use, sale, manufacturing, dispensation, or posses- sion of controlled substances, illicit drugs, or alcohol on Uni- versity premises or work sites, or working under the influ- ence of such substances, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and referral for prosecution. MSU enforces all local, state, and federal laws regarding the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, posses- sion, or use of controlled substances, illicit drugs, or alcohol, including state un derage drinking laws. Michigan State University is a tobacco -free campus. For more information, please visit http://tobaccofree.msu.edu/ . Alcohol and Other Drug Resources Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, there may be some adjustments to the delivery method of resources on campus (i.e. telehealth and virtual resources). Alcohol and Other Drugs (\"AOD\") Health Promotion Program (517) 884- 6598 The AOD Health Promotion program is committed to reduc-ing the negative impacts associated with substance use, while cultivating a health- affirming environment in which students can flourish personally, civically, and academically. The overall strategies u sed and promoted by the AOD program are based in sound research and scholarship, and are implemented in a manner that is both respectful , non -judg- mental, self -reflective and engaging. To that end, the AOD program coordinates a Social Norms campaign (also known as \"The Ducks\") to promote a better understanding of alcohol use by th e student population and challenge the prevailing myths and misperceptions that often lead to high -risk consumption. Social N orms messages are developed using student use and perception data from NCHA's National College Health Assessment and Michigan State University's UCelebrate! survey instrument. In partnership with the B.R.A.D. (\"Be Responsible About Drinking\") Foundation, the AOD program reaches out to all students on their 21st birthdays to wish them a happy, safe birthday, and to educate them about the risks associated with some 21st birthday celebration practices . This birthday ca rd also contains information on specific tools and strategies for effectively managing and reducing those risks. In conjunc-tion with the mailed birthday cards, the Responsible Hospi- tality Council of East Lansing has adopted best practices to help safely m anage 21 st birthday celebrations that occur within local alcohol -serving establishments. The AOD program offers Spartan Smart , an interactive alco- hol and drug education and risk management class . This class is for any student who has been referred from the Dean of Students Office , Residence Education and Housing Ser- vices, or Michigan courts/probation officers for a violation of university policy or Michigan law, relating to alcohol/s ub- stance use. Through didactic group process, students partic- ipate in guided discussions and activities focusing on the ef- fects of substances neurobiologically, psychologically , and behaviorally . Risk management tools, bystander interven- tion, education abo ut the disease of addiction, and values clarification are explored in the context of how substances may affect the student's academic, career, and personal goals. Additionally, students are asked to identify specific strategies and changes in behavior that they may take to ef- fectively manage those risks. Spartan Smart is evaluated an- nually to ensure that i t consistently meets o r exceeds estab- lished outcomes. The AOD program also provides interactive educational ses- sions to between 1,500 and 4 ,000 students a nnually through 28 | Page classroom infusion, presentations to student groups and or- ganizations, and engagement with Fraternity and Sorority Life. The primary emphasis of these presentations is on knowledge around the neurobiological and physiological ef-fects of sub stances on the human body, harm reduction tools, and risk management strategies. The AOD program also provides two -evidence -based, online prevention and intervention tool s that are free and accessible to students at all times . The e -CHECKUP TO GO for alc o- hol and e -CHEC KUP TO GO for marijuana, are personal- ized programs designed to motivate individuals to reduce their consumption using information about the student's own use, behaviors, and risk factors. Programs are individualized and specific to Michigan State University and explore stu- dent's quantity and frequency of use, physical health infor-mation, amount and percent of income spent, individualized negative consequences feedback, normative comparisons, behavioral alternatives and harm reduction strategi es, and lo- cal referral information. Freshman and transfer students are encouraged to complete e- CHECKUP TO GO for alcohol as part of their orientation to MSU and students who complete Spartan Smart also complete e -CHECKUP TO GO programs for either alcohol or marijuana . The AOD program develops and distributes a variety of print information available to both on and off- campus students, REHS staff , and staff and faculty regarding alcohol , other drugs, and tobacco. Printed information is available in the form of informational and educational brochures, cards and stickers highlighting how to connect with resources or sup-port, medical amnesty, how to identify signs and symptoms of alcohol poisoning, how t o arrange for a safe ride home, recovery resources and a variety of substance specific edu- cational brochures including, but not limited to cannabis/ ma- rijuana, vaping, alcohol, stimulants, and tobacco.

Health Risks and Medical Consequences of Alcohol and Drug Use High risk alcohol and illegal drug use can cause serious prob- lems. Illegal drug use includes the use of illicit drugs, as well as mis use of prescription drugs. Combining alcohol and drugs can greatly increase health risks. Major health risks of alcohol and drug use include acute and chronic illness, psychological and emotional impairment, substance -use dependency, and death. Other health risks in- clude short -term memory problems, learning impairments, sleep disruption, immune compromise, and mood swings. Side effects such as impaired judgment, slowed response time, mental confusion, and decreased motor coordination can lead to accidents, motor vehicle crashes, physical alter- cations, loss or damage to personal belonging s and injuries. Use of alcohol and illegal drugs presents significant short - term and long- term health risks and medical consequences: Marijuana comes with significant r isks that can im- pact a person's life and health and includes substan- tial risks to an individual's brain health, mental health, athletic performance, risks during preg- nancy and to the unborn fetus, and the development of an addiction. Approximately 1 in 10 people who use marijuana will become addicted and if individ- uals start using before the age of 18, the rate of ad- diction increases to 1 in 6 (SAMHSA, CDC, 2020). Marijuana directly affects the brain, specifically the areas responsible for memory, learning , attention, decision making, coordination, emotions and motor coordination and reaction times. These e ffects can make it difficult to learn and retain information, may interfer e with driving skills , and increas e the risk of injuries and potentially harmful behaviors. Marijuana use in developing brains of children and adolescents can reduce attention, memory and learning functions , and affect how the brain builds connections between the areas necessary for these functions. This can result in poor education al out- comes, cognitive impairments, diminished life sat- isfaction and achievement . These effects can be long lasting or even permanent. Physical effects of marijuana can include breathing and respiratory complications including chronic bronchitis, in- creased heart rate, problems with child develop- ment during and after pregnancy, sleep interfer- ence, intense nausea, and vomiting. Marijuana has been linked to mental health problems such as de-pression, anxiety, paranoia and suicidal thoughts as well as an increas ed risk of psychosis and psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) in persons with a genetic predisposition to those disorder s. Marijuana edibles, or food and drink products in-fused with marijuana and eaten, have some differ- ent risks than smoking marijuana, including a greater risk of poisoning. Unlike inhaling mariju-ana, ingesting marijuana can take 30 minutes to 2 hours to take effect. Overconsumption can lead to poisoning and/or serious injury. The effects of edi-bles may last longer than expected depending on the amount consumed, the individual's last meal, and medication , alcohol , or other substances used at the same time. The amount of THC, the active ingredi- ent in marijuana, is very difficult to measure and is often unknown in edible products. Many users can be unprepared for the strength and long -lasting ef- fects of edibles. Marijuana effects children and adults differently. Marijuana products that look like candy or treats have posed significant risks to chil- dren, who have required emergency medic al care as a result of consuming such products. According to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (\"NSDUH \"), 14.4 million adults ages 18 and older and 401,000 adolescents ages 12 - 17 have an Alcohol Use Disorder. An estimated 88,000 people die e ach year due to alcohol related causes, making alcohol the third leading preventa- ble cause of death in the United State s. In 20 18, al- cohol -impaired driving fatalities accounted for 29% 30 | Page of the overall driving fatalities ( 10,511 deaths). Al- cohol is a central nervous system depressant and af- fects every organ in the body and can impair brain function and motor skills. Alcohol interferes with the brain's communication pathways, affecting how the brain looks and works. These disruptions can change mood and behavior and make it harder to think clearly and move with coordination. Heavy use can increase the risk of certain cancers includ-ing head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Drink- ing heavily over a long time, or on a single occasion can damage the heart causing problems including cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, stroke and high blood pressure. Alcohol causes the pancreas to pro-duce toxic substances that eventually lead to pan- creatitis, a dangerous inflammation and swelling of the blood vessels in the pancreas and liver diseases include steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Alcohol also weakens the immune sys- tem, making chronic drinker smore susceptible to diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis an d drinking on a single occasion slows your body's ability to fight infections up to 24 hours after use. (NIAAA, 2020). Club drugs (MDMA, GHB, Rohypnol, Ketamine, and LSD (Acid)) can cause serious physical and mental health problems including long -lasting con- fusion, depression, increased anxiety, aggression, impulsiveness, cell and organ damage, heart and brain problems and in some cases, death. Because some club drugs are colorless, tasteless, and odor-less, they can be added to beverages to s edate or in- toxicate, with the intent to facilitate sexual assaults. Stimulant medication, including Amphetamines like Adderall\u00ae, methylphenidate like Ritalin/Con- certa, and illicit substances like methamphetamines and cocaine, can cause irritability, mood d isorders, acute and/or chronic anxiety, elevated blood pres- sure, and cardiac arrest, particularly in those with preexisting heart conditions. Long- term use of some stimulants may cause permanent damage to the brain, heart, lungs, and other organs. Opioids include prescription pain relievers like ox- ycodone, morphine, fentanyl and heroin. When misused, opioids can lead to addiction, fatal over-dose, spontaneous abortion, and infectious diseases associated with injection drug use like hepatitis and HIV. They also can cause serious health conditions including pulmonary complications, infection of the heart lining and valves, liver and kidney disease. Nearly half of the individuals who inject heroin re-ported using prescription opioids before starting to use heroin. Opioids can also greatly increase the risk of accidents and automobile crashes because they affect vision, depth perception, coordination, and other physical skills. Psychological side effects include poor concentration and impaired judgment. Driving under the influence of legal medication may result in a DUI violation. Long- term or heavy use of depressants like opioids, benzodiazepines and alcohol can lead to a profound physical addiction, requiring medically monitored detoxification in order t o discontinue use safely. In- dividuals who are physically addicted to depres- sants can experience serious medical complications when attempting to discontinue use, including sei-zures, hallucinations, stroke, and death. Almost all drugs, carry the potential risk for over-dose. Chronic, high -risk use of alcohol and drugs can also have psychological and social consequences, including loss of in-timacy and significant relationships, pervasive feelings of unhappiness, a lack of motivation, drive and interest in the things that were once important, academic and employment impairments, financial losses, estrangement from family and other social support, inability to meet responsibilities and ob- ligations, and significant legal issues.

Federal and State Penalties for Drug Sale and Possession The federal government decides if and how a drug should be controlled. Psychoactive (mind -altering) chemicals are categorized according to Schedule I to V. This schedule designates if the drug must be prescribed by a physician and under what conditions. Factors considered in this categorization include a drug's known and potential medical value, its potential for physical or psychological dependence, and risk, if any, to public health. Penalties for the illegal sale or distribution of a dru g are established using the designation of Schedule I to V. The State of Michigan designates con- trolled substances as Schedule I through V, using similar def-initions to those employed by the federal government. The State of Michigan's schedule designations of individual drugs are similar, but not identical to those of the federal government. Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abus e, have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, and lack acceptable safety for use under medical superv ision. Exam- ples of substances listed in -hydroxybutyrate) can be a Schedule I or III drug, depending on its form. Schedule II drugs have a currently accepted medical use in the United States, despite a high potential for abuse that may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. Exam-ples include c ombination products with less than 15 milli- grams of hydrocodone per dosage unit (Vicodin), and State of Michigan penalties for selling Schedule I and II drugs vary with the type and quantity of the drug. Additionally, if death, rape, or serious injury is associated with the use of the drug and/or if it is a second offense, penalties are more severe. Unless otherwise specified by federal law, the federal pen- alty for the first offense involving a Schedule I or II con-trolled substance, GHB, or 1 gram of flunitrazepam (Sched- ule IV) is imprisonment for not more than 20 years. If death or serious bodily injury results from the use of such sub-stances, the penalty is imprisonment for not less than 20 years or more than life, a fine not to exceed $1 million for an individual, or both. The State of Michigan's penalty for other Schedule I or II controlled substances is imprisonment for not more th an twenty years, a fine of not more than $25,000, or both. The State of Michigan's penalty for unlawful manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to deliver less than 50 grams of a Schedule I or II controlled substanc e is imprisonment for up to 20 years, and/or a fine of up to $25,000. Use of a Schedule I or II controlled substance is a misdemeanor that has a penalty of imprisonment for up to one year, a fine of up to $2,000, or both. Michigan law also provides for up to seven years imprisonment a nd/or a fine of not more than $5,000 for individuals who manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver gamma -butyrolactone (GBL), a compound related to GHB. For less than 50 kilograms of marijuana, except in the case of 50 or more marijuana plants regardless of weight, 10 kil- ograms of hashish, or one kilogram of hashish oil, the federal penalty is imprisonment for not more than 5 years, a fine not to exceed $250,000 for an individual, or both. In Michigan, with the exception of manufacture, possession, use, or sale consistent with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act and Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act, the \"unlawful manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to deliver\" of less than 5 kilograms of marijuana or a mixture containing marijuana, or fewer than 20 marijuana plants, is a felony punishable by imprisonment for up to four years, a f ine of up to $20,000, or both. Schedule III drugs have a potential for abuse that is less than Schedule I and II substances, and abuse may lead to moder- ate or lower physical dependence or high psychological de- pendence. Examples include products containing less than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit such as Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anaboli c steroids such as oxandro- lone, or testosterone . Schedule IV drugs have a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule III. Examples include propoxyphene (Darvon\u00ae Schedule V drugs have a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule IV and consist primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcot-ics that are used for antitussive, antidiarrheal, and analgesic purposes, Motofen, Lyr- ica, Parepectolin . Except as otherwise provided by federal law, t he penalty for first offense sale of a Schedule III drug is imprisonment for not more than ten years, a fine of not more than $500,000 for an individual, or both. The federal penalty for first offense sale of Schedule IV drugs is imprisonment for not more than five years, a fine of not more than $250,000 for an individual, or both. The federal penalty for first offense sal e of Schedule V drugs is imprisonment for not more than one year, a fine of not more than $100,000 for an individual, or both.

MSU complies with this regulation by including all man- datory fire safety information as part of this annual report. The University provides on -campus student housing only at the East Lansing campus. Accordingly, discussion of fire safety information in the fire safety report is limited to the East Lansing campus. The MSU Police Fire Inspector's Office is charged with all aspects of fire safety for the University except the suppres-sion of active fires. The East Lansing Fire Department i s responsible for the suppression of active fires. The Fire Inspector is tasked with monitoring compliance with fire codes, fire safety inspections, and fire/arson investigations. Fire Statistics and Fire Log The MSU Police Fire Inspector's Office maintains fire statistics and a fire log of all fire -related incidents that occur on campus in East Lansing. This annual report contains statistics concerning the number of fires in the University's on -campus student housing facilities; the cause of each fire (unintentional, intentional, or undetermined); the number of injuries and deaths related to each fire; and the value of the property damage caused by each fire. The MSU Police maintain a daily log that includes both the crime log and fir e log.

Fire Safety Education and Training Programs At the beginning of each fall semester, Residence Education and Housing Services (REHS) staff members who live in and supervise on -campus residence halls receive comprehensive fire safety and emergency action plan training organized by the Health and Safety Office of the Division of Residential and Hospitality Services (RHS). This training includes review of fire safety prevention rules, fire evacuationprocedures specific to each residence hall, and fire alarm system operations for staff who conduct evacuation drills twice a semester . The training program is a collaborative effort among REHS , Assistant Director for Coordination and Planning , the RHS Health and Safety Coordinator, MSU Police Emergency Management, and Infrastructure Planning and Facilities. Upon residential students' arrival on campus in the fall, man- datory floor meetings are conducted providing residents with education around fire safety and prevention rules, informed of fire drills , fire safety hazards, evacuation routes specific to their floor in the residence hall, and operational guidelines for hall evacuation. The RHS Health and Safety Office also conducts a poster campaign in each residence hall focused on fire and life safety. A se ries of four posters address topics such as fire alarm use, fire drill participation, and education about automatic sprinklers. Basic fire safety instruction is also offered to professional staff and faculty members. Emergency Action Teams, consistin g of designated employees in each building, receive extensive training on how to implement evacuation and sheltering plans specific to their building. Almost 200 employees are trained as Emergency Action Team leaders. The MSU Police annually train Emergen cy Action Teams on how to advise first responders in emergency situations, assist with evacuation, notify building occupants, and provide information about special considerations for their building. All students, faculty , and staff are encouraged to ta ke the time to familiarize themselves with the fire evacuation plans for each building that they work in, live in, or frequent; know their Emergency Action Team leaders and coordinators; and participate in building evacuation drills. If a fire occurs, st udents are instructed to leave hazardous areas by the evacuation routes and get to a predetermined location. They are to remain in that location so that Residence Hall Resident Assistants may confir m each student has left the building. R EHS staff members are instructed to pull a 45 | Page fire alarm as they exit the building if they can do so without risking their safety. Fire Drills In accordance with State of Michigan fire safety regulations, the residence halls conduct a minimum of one (1) fire drill each semester of each academic year. Two drills are sched- uled during fall and winter semester to ensure a make -up day in the event of a cancellation. All drills are announced in advance to allow for the safety of those involved. On occasion, unannounced drills o ccur due to unanticipated activation of the evacuation alarm systems. In 201 9, MSU conducted four fire drills at Case, Emmons, Shaw and Won- ders Halls; five fire drills at Mason -Abbot, Akers, Arm- strong, Butterfield, Campbell, Holden, Holmes, Hubbard, Landon, McDonel, Rather, Williams , Wilson and Yakeley -Gilchrist halls; and six fire drills at Bailey, Bryan, Owen, Van Hoosen, and Snyder -Phillips Halls . Fire drills were not conducted in University Village Apartments, 1855 Place Apartments, or Spartan Village Apartments. Mandatory supervised fire drills are also conducted annually in all academic buildings in May of each year. The evacuation drills are conducted in cooperation with the MSU Police Fire Marshal's Office, MSU Police Emergency Management Division, REHS , Infrastructure Planning and Facilities , and the Emergency Action Teams. Following every drill, a review is conducted to assess compliance w ith the MSU Emergency Action Plan. The MSU Police Emergency Management Unit maintains records of drills, documenting the date, time, and description of the exercise, as well as whether it was announced or unannounced. These records are available for inspe ction upon request. State law requires that all individuals evacuate immediately when a fire alarm sounds. Students failing to vacate during a drill are subject to disciplinary action. Evacuation Procedures and Guidelines Every building/unit on campus has a written Emergency Action Plan that contains the evacuation procedures all students, employees, and visitors must follow in the event of an emergency. The plan identifies evacuation routes and accountability locations in the event of a fire. A sho rt version of each plan is posted at key locations in the respective buildings. All MSU buildings also have posted notices and floor plans that include: the building's emergency exits and rally points; location of fire extinguishers and pull stations; fire rated stairwell locations; locations of emergency showers, eyewash stations, and gas shutoff; emergency phone locations; and locations of exit/entrance doors for people with disabilities. An evacuation route and destination map, specifying the locatio n of the nearest stairwell and exits, is posted on the back of each residence hall room door. Students should become familiar with multiple evacuation routes out of their residence hall and leave immediately from the nearest safe exit in the event of a fir e. The REHS st aff members on duty are responsible for the supervision and coordination of the evacuation of students in their assigned residence hall until fire and public safety personnel arrive. It is the student's responsibility to remove himself or h erself from the building as quickly and safely as possible. Elevators are not to be used during a fire alarm evacuation of the building. If someone cannot be evacuated due to an injury or disability, students and staff are advised to notify the first emergency responder they encounter as they leave the building. Persons with disabilities who are unable to evacuate on their own should remain near a window in their unit and emergency personnel will evacuate them. Evacuating students are instructed to rep ort to Residence Hall Resident Assistants who will be stationed in designated areas at least 200 feet away from the building. The Residence Ed-ucation team will account for residents at the rally site. No occupant is allowed to re -enter a building until cle arance is given by fire or public safety personnel. Additional information on evacuation and sheltering plans and procedures is available at police.msu.edu under the Homeland Security tab. Fire Safety Violations and Prohibitions All University policies related to on -campus housing are located on Spartan Life OnLine and in the On -Campus Hous- ing Handbook located at Live On - Residence Education and Housing Services . Each student must acknowledge receipt of and review all policies upon registering for on -campus housing. The fire safety guidelines and prohibitions, as provided in the Spartan Life OnLine , University Housing Regulations (2.0 Safety of the Individual and Community), are listed below. Fundamental to the protection of the individual is the maintenance of an environment that is physically safe and predictable. As members of a group, each individual has a special responsibility to insure that safety hazards are eliminated, fire equipment is maintained, and fire procedures are established and followed. o 2.1 No person shall create, or help to create, a safety hazard. o 2.2 No person shall throw or drop anything out of or off of a window or balcony. o 2.3 No person shall possess or use firecrackers, fireworks, firearms, or other dangerous weapons or explosives. (NOTE: Legal weapons must be stored at the Michigan State University Police Department .) o 2.4 No person shall possess or use in a university housing, without proper authorization, any chemical or other dangerous substance, compound, or container of such substances, which may injure, molest, or cause damage. 46 | Page o 2.5 No person shall set a fire in residence halls or areas immediately associated with resid ence halls. o 2.6 No person shall falsely report a fire, nor interfere in any way with emergency services or procedures, nor fail to conform to established safety regulations. o 2.7 No person shall tamper with fire equipment, nor use such equipment for other t han the prevention or control of fire. (Fire equipment shall include, but not be limited to thermal detectors, fire alarms, fire extinguishers, fire extinguisher boxes, fire hoses, and any other fire-fighting devices.) o 2.8 No person shall use unauthorized cooking appliances in his or her room, suite, floor study room or other unauthorized hall facilities in a residence hall - residents of University -owned apartments may use appliances as outlined in their lease. (Unauthorized cooking appliances include hot plates, toasters, toasters ovens, rice cookers, woks, crock pots and other electrical devices (excluding microwaves) intended for the preparation, heating or cooking of substantial food items.) The fire safety guidelines and prohibitions listed in the On- Campus Housing Handbook including those on smoking, open flames, and portable electrical appliances, are as fol- lows: No Smoking . 29 Michigan State University's tobacco - free ordinance prohibits the use of products derived from or containing tobacco on University property. The ordinance applies to all property governed by the Board of Trustees and includes not only the main cam-pus but also all MSU sites across the state, nation and globe. In addition to traditional tobacco products such as cigarettes and chewing tobacco, the ordinance also prohibits the use of e -cigarettes and vaporizers. All FDA -approved nicotine replacement therapy products are permitted for cessation use. For more inf ormation, visit tobaccofree.msu.edu . Drills . Residents are required to cooperate with staff and participate in fire, tornado and other emergency drills. Residents should tour their floor and the hall to know the location of all fire exits and alarm boxes. Fire Safety . Pulling false alarms, causing a fire, tam- pering with or misusing safety devices, interfering with firefighters, and tampering with or removing fire-fighting equipment is a violation of the Contract, stu- dent group regulations, university ordinances and state law. This includes, but is not limited to, covering or tampering with smoke detectors and sprinkler heads. Offenders will be removed from on -campus housing, prosecuted to the full extent of th e law, referred through the university conduct process and face the loss of student status. Each corridor entrance is protected by a special fire door that, in the event of a fire, will help prevent the fire and smoke from spreading and are prohibited from being propped open. Fire and safety regulations re- quire corridors be kept clear and unobstructed at all times. Candle warmers are not permitted in residence halls and apartments. Setting fires is prohibited. Lighted candles are prohibited: they are one of the major causes of fires. No incense of any kind may be burned in the housing unit, except in special circumstances , such as religious observances, with prior approval from the REHS staff. Room decorations are to be limited to non -flammable materials. Wooden or fake board paneling is highly combustible and is not allowed as decoration in stu- dent rooms. Residents may individualize the outside of their doors, but they must take responsibility for the safety of other residents and will be held accountable for damages that may be caused by any decorations, including dam-ages to the finish of the door. No paper materials may be attached to the door unless covered by a clear, self - adhesive plastic. Loose, flammable materials may be maliciously ignited, and the resulting fire may cut off the exit. Combustible items should not be attached to doors or in doorways (e.g., memo boards, cork boards, dry erase boards, chalkboards). Appliances and Electrical Items . Radios, televi- sions, computers, video games and music sound sys-tems are permitted, but each resident is responsible for keeping the volume low enough to avoid disturbing others. No antennas may be installed inside or outside a residence hall. All printers must be installed according to the manu- facturer's requirements, university policies and MSU facilities recommendations. Residents may use mini -refrigerators of five cubic feet or less, compact microwaves, coffee makers and fans in their rooms. Appliances must carry the UL -listing mark. The university strongly recommends the use of appliances with the Energy Star\u00ae rating.
