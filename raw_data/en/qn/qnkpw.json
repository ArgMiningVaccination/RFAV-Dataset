Why? My coworkers insist seeing a chiropractor was the best thing they ever did\u2014and we've been chatting about it all day. Because we at [DaVinci Laboratories ](http://www.davincilabs.com/)are huge advocates of chiropractic care and supplements, we often find places where the two connect. In fact, we've designed formulas specific to chiropractic care for your patients. DaVinci presents: Our top 4 supplements for the chiropractor's shelves....and patients. If we've left any out, tell us on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DaVinciLabs)! 1) [Disc-Discovery\u00ae](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=200440180) We are huge fans of this supplement because of its specificity. DaVinci formulated [Disc-Discovery\u00ae](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=200440180) to support the health of the spine and the intervertebral discs.* It contains 14 synergistic nutrients that focus on the synthesis and restorative processes of spinal connective tissue.* With bovine tracheal cartilage, manganese, calcium, magnesium and other nutrients, this formula is a cut above the rest. 2) [Perna\u00ae Plus](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=200365180) DaVinci's been working with Perna for over 35 years. The green-lipped mussel from New Zealand provides nutrients that support joint function.* We include the whole food organism, so all of the health-building factors are present in the [Perna\u00ae Plus ](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=200365180)formula.* Plus, there's added DMG, MSM, glucosamine and manganese to support mobility and comfort.* That should capture your patient's eye. 3) [Omega 3 1000](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=200368090) Omega fatty acid supplements are an important facet of a good supplement regimen. [Omega 3 1000](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=200368090) is from deep cold water fish that are caught wild. The yielded EPA and DHA fatty acids are supportive of whole body health; they support joint comfort, a healthy immune response, cognition, cardiovascular health and cellular energy.* 4) [Enz-Flame](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=20017) [Enz-Flame](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=20017) includes 13 synergistic ingredients to support overall joint and muscle comfort, especially those occasional aches you get after exercise.* If you have active patients who want added support for comfort and mobility, [Enz-Flame](http://www.davincilabs.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=20017) is a sure bet.* The drink mix formula has a few stars and supporting characters, but Cetyl Myristoleate takes the lead. CMO supports cell membrane lubrication.* It also supports the production of prostaglandins that have positive effects on the enzymes that support joint comfort.* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
