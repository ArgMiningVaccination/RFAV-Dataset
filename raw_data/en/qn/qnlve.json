Immunotherapy has previously failed in lung can-cer but has recently emerged as a very effective new therapy, and there is now growing worldwide enthu- siasm in cancer immunotherapy. We summarize why immune checkpoint blockade therapies have generated efcacious and durable responses in clinical trials and why this has reignited interest in this eld. Cancer vac- cines have also been explored in the past with marginal success. Identi cation of optimal candidate neoantigens may improve cancer vaccine ef cacy and may pave the way to personalized immunotherapy, alone or in com-bination with other immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade. Understanding the steps in im- mune recognition and eradication of cancer cells is vital to understanding why previous immunotherapies failed and how current therapies can be used optimally. Wehold an optimistic view for the future prospect in lung cancer immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION Worldwide, lung cancer is one of the most deadly of the solid cancers.1Around 95% of lung cancers are classi- ed as either non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC). With advancing stage,survival decreases progressively down to four monthsin stage IV disease, 2so early intervention is important. Systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy has been the main- stay of treatment for advanced stage NSCLC, but thebenet of chemotherapy has reached a plateau. And new forms of treatment are required. Although thereis now a better understanding of the role of driver mu- tations in NSCLC and how to target these mutations in treatment of NSCLC, for example, epidermal fusion oncogene, 3-5success re- mains limited. Without a doubt, the most powerful new therapy for lung cancer is immunotherapy. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF LUNG CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY Cancer growth and spread are not only dependent on tumour cell characteristics but are also affected bythe interaction with the immune system.6,7The use of immunotherapy for treatment of malignancy was described more than a century ago by Dr William B. Coley. He used what was later known as 'Coley 'st o x i n ', a streptococcal vaccine, which incorporated Serratia marcescens , to treat a variety of malignant diseases. He later observed that the best response was achieved in patients with inoperable soft tissue sarcomas, where long-term (more than 5 years) disease-free survival wasachieved for approximately 50% of these patients.8 Despite the success of several immunotherapies in some solid cancers, immunotherapy in lung cancer has not, until recently, shown signi cant survival be- net.9Lessons were learnt however, and recently, there has been a renewed interest in lung cancer im-munotherapy following positive results using immune checkpoint inhibitors, which work by modulating theCorrespondence: Antonius Steven, U niversity of Western Australia, (M503) Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.

WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE IMMUNE ATTACK ON TUMOURS? Immune destruction of tumours by tumour-speci c cluster of differentiation 8 T (CD8 T) cells is a seven-step process (Figure 1). Each of these steps is required,and each can be regulated to strengthen or reduce the response and to avoid 'collateral damage 'to normal tissues. Tumour neoantigens must be present in a tu-mour (Step 1), and these antigens must reach/load'professional 'APCs, such as dendritic cells (DC) where they can present the antigen to immune cells in the draining lymph node (dLN, Step 2). Tumour-speci c T cells must then 'see'these antigens via T-cell recep- tor (TCR) recognition of major histocompatibility(MHC)::peptide complex, and receive the right co- stimulatory signals and any additional 'help '(e.g. CD40 ligation) before they become activated and pro-liferate (Step 3). Activated tumour-speci c T cells then exit the dLN and circulate through the periphery be-fore entering the tumour (Step 4). Once inside the tu- mour, these T cells encounter a number of local immune-suppressive mechanisms, which they needto overcome (Step 5), and probably also require re-stimulation by the APCs within the tumour (Step 6). Fi-nally, once these activated T cells have passed these sixsteps, they need to attack the tumour (Step 7), a pro- cess that involves recognition of antigen expressed bythe tumour and the release of potent molecules suchas perforin and granzymes that ultimately kill the tu- mour cell. Memory cells can also be generated from this process, which may be important in control ofemerging micrometastases. Importantly, each of the steps can be modulated, for example, suppressed by regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg), which normally control autoimmunity but can restrict anti-tumour responses or boosted by 'helper 'CD4 T cells. WHY HAVE PREVIOUS IMMUNOTHERAPIES FAILED? Lung cancer immunotherapy has failed in the past at any one or several of these steps. It is dif cult to be cer- tain exactly where the failures have occurred, but fromwhat we now know about these seven dif cult steps, it is not surprising that immunotherapy has failed so of- ten. Reasons for failure include a lack of a suf cient load of mutated tumour antigens (Step 1), consistent withthe recent observation that neoantigenic load parallelsthe success of immunotherapy, 10a restriction in cross presentation (Step 2) due to suppressed APC traf cf r o m the tumour11or lack of the necessary signals such as CD40, largely delivered by CD4 T cells.12Active speci c immunotherapy of lung cancer has probably also failedhere in that the lysed tumour cells used in the vaccines Figure 1 Tumour antigen cross- presentation and induction of anti-tumour antigen Tumour-specific antigens dots) arepicked up by professional antigen- presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, and migrate from the tumour site to the draining lymph node. (2) Antigen presentation: As the APCs migrate, they mature during which time the tumour antigen is processed into small peptides,which are then presented on the surface of the APC in the context of a MHC-peptide complex to lymphocytes. (3) T-cell activation: Recognition of the MHC peptide complex by cognate T-cell receptor constitutes signal 1. However, a second co-stimulatory signal (CD28::B7.1/B7.2) isrequired before a na\u00efve T cell can become fully activated cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL). T cell activation can be enhanced by CD4 helper T cells. (4) T-cell trafficking: Activated T cells leave the dLN and traffic through the peripheral blood vessels back to the tumour site. (5)Overcoming local suppression: Activated CTLs need to be able to overcome tumour mechanisms et al. Respirology (2016) 21,8 2 1-833 \u00a9 2016 Asian Pacific Society of Respirologywould not have been effectively presented.13There may also be a limitation in the number of responding CD8 Tcells (Step 3), which is one of the reasons why adoptiveimmunotherapy using T cells obtained from the tu- mours was rst used in lung cancer. 14Af a i l u r eo fT - c e l l trafc to tumours (Step 4) and the presence of local intratumoural suppressive in fluences (Step 5) are both well described.7,15One way the balance between in- flammation and suppression occurs is by altering the lo- cal cytokine milieu. Cytokine therapy in lung cancer probably failed because the concentration of cytokinesthat could be achieved within the tumour following sys-temic administration was never high enough to achieve this change in balance. A limitation in re-stimulation by APCs within tumours (Step 6) is a more recent notion. 16 Finally, tumours can escape by immunological selectionby losing antigen or the antigen-presenting moleculeMHC class I, something noticed recently when lung squamous carcinomas were rst sequenced. 17As each of the steps can be modulated, the status of those mod-ulatory in fluences may also explain immunotherapy failures, for example, an excess of regulatory CD4 T cellsor a lack of helper CD4 T cells. The development of as- says to analyse each of these seven steps in animal models has been a key to understanding how surgery,chemotherapy and immunotherapy interact. Our discussion of current immunotherapies in lung cancer, described later, can be understood by reflecting on these seven steps. IMMUNE CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE To prevent any unwanted damage caused by activated T cells to surrounding tissues, the immune system has evolved a variety of inbuilt mechanisms, or 'check- points 'that are used to modulate the duration and amplitude of the immune response. This dampens theimmune response and protects against damage be- cause of in flammation and autoimmunity. This is achieved primarily by upregulation of 'co-inhibitory ' receptors that act to 'turn off 'activated T cells. Ulti- mately, it is the balance between co-stimulatory andco-inhibitory signals that dictates the fate of activated T cells (Figure 2). The receptor/ligand nature of T cell activation/ inhibition means that these interactions can bemanipulated by the use of agonistic or antagonistic antibodies. Indeed, over the last decade there has been signicant advancement in the use of antibody- mediated immune checkpoint as a cancerimmunotherapy. CTLA-4 inhibition Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) protein is expressed on the surface of T cells and competes with CD28 for B7 binding in an inhibitory fashion, thereforeacting as suppressor of T-cell activation. CTLA-4 inhibi-tors have been well studied and are among the earliestimmune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical develop- ment. 18-20Antibodies to CTLA-4 in effect block the inhi- bition of CD28/B7 T-cell activation and in turn (Figure 2).Ipilimumab Ipilimumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and prevents it from binding to its ligand. In a phase II study of chemotherapy-na\u00efve NSCLC patients ( n= 204), phased ipilimumab (two doses of placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatinfollowed by four doses of ipilimumab plus paclitaxeland carboplatin), but not concurrent ipilimumab (four doses of ipilimumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by two doses of placebo plus paclitaxel andcarboplatin), improved immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS) versus the control group Figure 2 Mechanism of immune checkpoint blockade. T-cell activation is ultimately dictated by the balance of co-stimulatory versus co-inhibitory signals. (a) Upon T-cell activation (signal 1 + signal 2), co-inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 are upregulated. CTLA-4 binds with greater avidity the B7 molecules CD80/CD86 and outcompetes binding of CD28 leading to inhibition of T-cell activation. (b) Monoclonal antibodies directed against inhibitory receptors block their ability to bind to their respectiveligand, favouring the co-stimulatory signal and thus prolonging T cell activation and the anti-tumour immune response.Immunotherapy for lung cancer 823 \u00a9 2016 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology Respirology (2016) 21,8 2 1-833(chemotherapy alone) (median 5.7 vs 4.6 months, HR (hazard ratio) 0.72, P= 0.05) and progression-free sur- vival (PFS) versus group (median 5.1 vs4.2 months, HR 0.69, P= 0.02). Overall survival (OS) in the phased group appeared to be higher than the control group (median 12.2 vs 8.3 months, log rankP= 0.23). Immune-related best overall response rate (irBORR) and best overall response rate (BORR) versusthe control group were 32% versus 18% and 32% versus 14%. In a post hoc analysis based on histology, both PFS and OS were improved in the phased ipilimumabgroup for Overall incidence of treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) was similar acrossgroups (control, 37%; concurrent, 41%; phased, 39%).Serious immune-mediated events included rash (4%),colitis (10%) and hypophysitis (one case). 21 There is currently an ongoing phase III trial compa- ring chemotherapy alone to chemotherapy withphased ipilimumab in patients with squamous histol-ogy NSCLC (NCT01285609). PD-1 checkpoint blockade One of the mechanisms for immune resistance inNSCLC is the expression of inhibitory molecules in the tumour microenvironment. There are three classes of these molecules, namely, cytokines, membraneligands and metabolites. 22PD-L1 (B7-H1) is the most studied membrane inhibitory ligands in NSCLCalthough there are others, which are found to be up- regulated in lung cancer. PD-L1 is expressed on tumour cells in approximately half of NSCLC, and itsexpression could contribute to poor prognosis by sup-pressing T-cell function promoting tumour PD-L2 (B7-DC) bind to induced by different in flam- matory cytokines. PD-L2 is largely expressed on DCsand can be expressedon diverse epithelial and haematopoietic cell types,although as mentioned previously, PD-L1 expression is predominantly con ned to the tumour microenvi- ronment. 22,24 -27PD-L2 expression has been found on Th2 helper cells28and thus may also have a role in cancer immunotherapy.29 Programmed death-1 checkpoint blockade uses an- tibodies directed against either the receptor, PD-1 ori t sl i g a n dP D - L 1 .I nc o n t r a s tt oC T L A - 4i n h i b i t o r s ,which only seem to work in lung cancer when used incombination with chemotherapy, PD-1 checkpoint blockade has shown activity as a single agent treatment in NSCLC. Nivolumab Nivolumab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody to PD-1. In a phase I trial with a large expansion cohortsof patients with NSCLC, melanoma and renal cell carci-noma (RCC), 129 patients with NSCLC receivednivolumab (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks). Fifty-four per cent of these patients had received greater that or equal to three previous systemic therapies. Twenty-two out of 122 (17%) patients with NSCLC had a partialresponse (PR) based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.0 criteria, and 10% had stabledisease at 24 weeks. Anti-tumour effect was particu- larly observed at the 3 mg/kg dosing level so this dose was selected for further study. At this dose, the response rate was 28% (5/18) for non-squamous and 27% (4/15)for squamous histology. side were fatigue (24%), decreased appetite(12%) and diarrhoea (10%). Fourteen per cent of pa- tients experienced grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events. The most concerning toxicity observed waspneumonitis (8 patients or 6%), which resulted in twodeaths. 30In patients who had signi cant response and disease stability with nivolu mab, durability of responses was common with a median duration of 74 weeks. Themost recent results from the ASCO Meeting 201431re- ported prolonged survival with a median of 9.2 - 14.9 months across the cohorts. The median OS for the 3 mg/kg cohort was 14.9 months, 1-year OS of 56% and 2-year OS of 45%. In a randomized phase III study ofn i v o l u m a bv e r s u sd o c e t a x e li na d v a n c e ds q u a m o u sNSCLC involving 272 patients, the median OS was9.2 months (95% CI: 7.3 -13.3) with 5.1 -7.3) with docetaxel while the median PFS was 3.5 months with nivolumab versus2.8 months with docetaxel (HR for death or disease pro-gression, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.81; P<0.001). At 1 year, the overall survival rate was 42% (95% CI: 34 -50) with related adverse events and treatment-related serious adverse events occurred less frequently with nivolumab than with docetaxel. 7% of patients in the nivolumabgroup had grade 3 or 4 adverse events in comparisonwith 55% of those in the docetaxel group. In this group,the expression of PD-L1 was neither prognostic nor pre- dictive of bene t from anti-PD-1 therapy. 32In general terms, although the expression of PD-L1 by immunohis-tochemistry was associated with response to therapy,patients who were PD-L1 negative could respond tonivolumab but at lower rates. 33The FDA has recently approved the use of nivolumab in advanced squamous and non-squamous NSCLC with progression on or afterplatinum-based chemotherapy. There are other agents utilizing PD-1 checkpoint blockade, and they seem to have similar ef cacy in pretreated advanced stage NSCLC. Selected ongoing clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockade in tho-racic malignancy are summarized in Table 1. Pembrolizumab Pembrolizumab, another PD-1 inhibitor is also ap- proved as second-line treatment for NSCLC afterchemotherapy. In a phase I study of pembrolizumab in advanced NSCLC, the objective response rate in all patients was 19.4% (95% CI: 16.0 -23.2), with median duration of response of 12.5 months (range, 1.0 -23.3). Median PFS was 3.7 months (95% CI: tients, 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.2 -4.0) for previously treated patients and 6.0 months (95% CI: 4.1 -8.6) for previously untreated patients. Median OS was12.0 months (95% CI: 9.3 -14.7) for all patients,824 et al.

In patients with a PD-L1 proportion score of 50%, re-sponse rate was 45.2%, with median PFS of 6.3 months (95% CI: 2.9 -12.5) and median OS was not reached. Common treatment-related adverse events were fa-tigue, pruritus and decreased appetite. 9.5% had grade3 or higher adverse events. Immune-mediated adverseevents successfully treated withmedical therapy while one patient died withpneumonitis. 35 Anti PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A is a human Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody to PD-L1. A phase I study that was conducted in advanced solid cancers revealed activity in NSCLC, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma,colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and head and necksquamous cell carcinoma. PD-L1 expression and prev-alence were assessed by immunohistochemistry and were graded 0 to 3. 43The result in NSCLC was updated in ASCO 2015, showing that adverse events occurred in73% of patients and 11% had grade 3 -4 adverse events, mostly dyspnoea, hypoxia, fatigue and hyponatraemia. Objective response rate (ORR) in all patients was 21% (95% CI: 13 -30). Patients with PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 positive tumour cells 3) or IC3 (tumour-in-ltrating immune 3) had 23-68) TC 0/1/2 and IC 0/1/2. One-year 82% (95% CI: 72 -91). 38 MEDI4736 is a human IgG1 antibody, which binds specically to PD-L1 preventing binding to PD-1 and CD80. In the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 2014 Meeting in, Brahmer et al. reported the early up- date of a phase I MEDI4736 study of a NSCLC cohortthat included 155 patients, with 29% experiencingtreatment-related adverse events, none experiencingtreatment-related colitis of any grade and none experiencing grade 3/4 pneumonitis. Of the 58 patients who had 12-week follow-up, 16% had partial response, with the duration of response ranging 5 -54+ weeks, disease control rate 35%. 44 Programmed death-1 checkpoint blockade seems to be conferring a durable response and a favourable sideeffect pro le. It remains to be seen, however, if the responders will continue to bene to v e rm a n yy e a r s . If the data on melanoma are also replicated in patients with NSCLC, then the outlook is very promising indeed.45 Biomarkers in PD-1 checkpoint blockade There is a need for a biomarker to predict the responseof PD-1-directed therapies, and association betweenPD-L1 expression in NSCLC and treatment responsehas been investigated in multiple studies. In non-squamous NSCLC treated with nivolumab, positive PD-L1 expression across all cut-off points was asso- ciated with better clinical response. The ORR andmedian OS are 31% and 17.7 months in PD-L1 positive(1%) patients while only 9% and ( <1%) patients. withclinical response.32A meta-analysis exploring the predictive role of PD-L1 expression in advanced melanoma, NSCLC and genitourinary cancer, whichincluded 20 trials (1475 patients), found a signi cant difference in the ORR of patients with PD-L1 positiveversus PD-L1 negative patients (34.1% vs 19.9%, P<0.0001). 47It is worth noting however that some PD-L1 negative patients respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1antibody. The role of PD-L1 expression in predicting response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade is controversial. Some issues include reliability of detection methods, diffe-rences in cut-off values in determining positivity,heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression and site of PD-L1expression (tumour cells and/or immune cells). Addi- tionally, PD-L1 expression has a dynamic nature, and it can vary with tumour microenvironment; therefore,PD-L1 expression at a single time point may not bethe most useful as a predictive biomarker. 48,49The complex landscape associated with using PD-1/L1 ex- pression as a predictive biomarkers has been recently reviewed,50and further studies are needed to clarify the suitability of PD-L1 expression as a predictivebiomarker. More recently, there was evidence that treatment re- sponse to PD-1 checkpoint bl ockade is associated with higher nonsynonymous mutation burden, molecularsmoking signature, higher neoantigen burden andDNA repair pathway mutations. 51In this paper, Rizvi et al . hypothesized that the mutational landscape of NSCLC would in fluence the response to PD-1 blockade. They sequenced the exomes of two independent groupsof patients treated with pembrolizumab and theirmatched normal DNA and found that higher somatic nonsynonymous mutation burden was associated with the clinical response to pembrolizumab. In the discov-ery cohort, patients with durable clinical bene t( D C B ) (partial or stable response lasting >6m o n t h s ) h a d a median number of nonsynonymous mutations of 302 versus 148 in those with no durable bene t (NDB) (P= 0.02). There was a high concordance between nonsynonymous mutation burden and DCB, and byapplying a cut-off point o f nonsynonymous mutation burden 178, which combined maximal sensitivity with best speci city in the discovery cohort, to the validation cohort, the rate of DCB in patients with tumours with178 mutations was 75% versus 14% in those with <178 (sensitivity 86% and speci city 75%). The authors then applied a previously validated binary classi er to identify the molecular signature of smoking 52to diffe- rentiate transversion-high (TH, smoking signature) fromtransversion-low signature) tu-mours. They found that ef was greatest in pa- tients with tumours har bouring the smoking signature. TH tumours were associated ORR of56% versus 17% 0.004). The observation that higher mutation burden is associated with PD-1 blockade ef cacy is consistent with the hypothesis that recognition of neoantigen s is crucial for the activity of PD-1 blockade. Predicted candidate neoantigens,826 A Steven et al. Respirology (2016) 21,8 2 1-833 \u00a9 2016 Asian Pacific Respirologywhich have binding af nity for patient-speci cc l a s sI human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, were identi-ed. Not surprisingly, they found that tumours from patients with DCB had signi cantly higher candidate neoantigen burden compared with those with NDB and that high candidate neoantigen burden was associ-ated with improved median PFS (14.5 vs 3.5 months). Itis tempting to speculate that patients who have tumours with high nonsynonymous mutation burden and consequently high candidate neoantigen burden could be ideal candidates for personalized vaccinationprotocol. OTHER NON-SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY Toll-like receptors are a family of pattern recognition re-ceptors (PRR), which recognize pathogen-associatedmolecular patterns (PAMPs) to induce antigen-speci c innate immunity. TLR agonists have been investigated for their ability to enhance anti-tumour immuneresponses. TLR9 is expressed by human Syntheticunmethylated ODN) can activate TLR9 to reduce immune tolerance and promote anti-tumourresponse. Two international phase III trials evaluatingTLR9 agonist PF-3512676 in combination with rst line paclitaxel/carboplatin and gemcitabine/cisplatin, re- spectively, in advanced NSCLC were terminated aftertherst interim analysis because of lack of ef cacy and increased toxicity. 53,54Other TLR9 agonists, such and MGN1703, are still early develop- ment.55,56We and others have demonstrated anti- tumour potential for TLR7 agonists in pre-clinicalstudies.57-59In a of imiquimod (a TLR7 agonist) and anti-CD40 produced anti-tumour response in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner.57,58TLR7 also ap- pears to have a dual role in lung cancer microenviron-ment. TLR7 ligands promote anti-tumour immunityvia activation of pDCs, 60,61whereas TLR7 expression on lung cancer cells and its stimulation by TLR7 agonists promote tumour progression and resistance to chemotherapy.62,63Similarly, TLR3 agonists can enhance tumour-speci c T-cell responses and are currently used as adjuvants for cancer vaccines (reviewed in64). Talactoferrin alfa, a recombinant human lactoferrin, is an orally active dendritic cell-mediated immunotherapy. It is thought to interactwith DCs in the gut wall and stimulate their migrationand maturation as tumour antigen-presenting DCs. 65-67Despite demonstrating anti-tumour a variety of different pre-clinical models,65,68,69 these ndings were not validated in the FORTIS-M study, an international randomized trial oftalactoferrin alfa versus placebo in patients with ad- vanced NSCLC who had failed two or more prior regimens.70 CANCER VACCINES Vaccine therapy results are not always encouraging(see review by Freeman-Keller et al.71). Despite this fact, the trials have played a signi cant role in sheddinglight on what challenges need to be overcome to suc- cessfully employ tumour vaccine therapy. There aremultiple lung cancer vaccine therapies that have beentrialled clinically, with most being utilized for NSCLC and a much smaller proportion being developed for SCLC. Antigen-speci c vaccines aim to induce speci c anti-tumour immunity directed against associated autol- ogous or allogeneic tumour cells expose the immune system to a variety of often unknown tumourantigens.9,72 Non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumours express the TAA melanoma associated antigen-A3 (MAGE-A3) are often associated with poorer prognosis.The MAGE-A3 vaccine is a recombinant MAGE-A3 pro-tein combined with immunostimulant AS02B thatwas assessed in a large, double-blind, randomized phase III trial (MAGRIT) in patients with stage IB, II or IIIA MAGE-A3 positive NSCLC. Unfortunately, thiswas a negative study as there was no increase in DFSin the vaccine group compared with placebo in eitherthe overall population or in the patients who did not receive chemotherapy. 73 TG4010 is a vaccine targeted against Mucin1 (MUC1) antigen composed of a recombinant vaccinia virus(modi ed virus of Ankara or MVA) that encodes human MUC1 and IL-2 (MVA-MUC1-IL-2). In a phase IIb of TG4010 and rst line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC (TIME), TG4010 group had a median PFS of5 . 9 m o n t h sv e r s u s5 . 1 m o n t h si nt h ep l a c e b og r 0.74 . W h e n t a k i n g into account of the baseline value of CD16, CD56 and CD69 triple-positive was signi cantly improved by addition of TG4010 to chemotherapy, whereas there was no bene ti np a t i e n t s with TrPAL value >Q3. The highest bene tw a sn o t e di n patients with non-squamous histology and TrPALvalue Q3. 74 Belagenpumatucel-L is an allogeneic tumour cell vaccine containing four NSCLC cell lines and an anti- sense plasmid of TGF- . The vaccine aims to increase the immune response to NSCLC through downregu-lation of TGF- expression. In a randomized phase II trial in patients with stage II-IV NSCLC, no signi cant adverse events were observed with the vaccine, and a dose related survival difference was observed in those who received 2.5 \u00d7 107cells/injection ( P= 0.0069).

Lung cancers (especiallythose caused by tobacco smoking) carry high num- bers of nonsynonymous mutations, with molecular smoking signature, tumour is therefore highly speci c and carries a unique antigenic pro le. This so-called tumour mutanome can be revealed of mutated peptides predictedin silico . These peptides then can be used to track tu- mour-speci c T-cell responses and be incorporated into an individualized vaccine. 78,79The peptide neo- antigen vaccine may not be enough in inducing aneffective tumour-speci c immune response, and a combination therapy approach may be needed. Forexample, combination of checkpoint blockade and vaccine is a logical next step in cancer immunother- apy. 22,71,80Despite the advances with checkpoint blockade, not all patients respond, and the additionof vaccine therapy may further enhance T-cellproliferation. In a murine melanoma model (B16 melanoma), which was but immunogenic, combinationof GM-CSF-expressing tumo ur CTLA-4 blockade induced tumour eradication in 80% of the cases while each treatment by itself produced little or no effect. 81 IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR LUNG CANCER: LIMITATIONS Immunotherapy in lung cancer has become a reality, and it is now used in clinical practice. However, thereare a number of aspects that have the potential to limit the acceptance of immunotherapy for lung cancer. For instance, it is still uncertain how best to predict re-sponse from PD-1 blockade. Using PD-L1 expressionin tissues as a biomarker is promising although the dynamic expression of PD-L1 and the fact that some patients who did not exhibit PD-L1 responded toPD-1 blockade make it somewhat less reliable as a pre-dictive biomarker. Like any cancer drug, there are adverse effects that clinicians have to deal with when they do arise. For CTLA-4 inhibition, one of the more serious side ef-fects is colitis, whereas PD-1 checkpoint blockadecan result in pneumonitis, a rare event but neverthe-less potentially fatal. Grading of immune-related side effects has been used in clinical trials, and treatment with cessation of immunotherapy and if necessarycorticosteroid administration has been applied.Pneumonitis is a particular concern in lung cancerpopulation as patients with lung cancer not infre- quently have poor lung reserve because of current or past smoking history. Thus, pneumonitis can seri-ously impair their already poor lung reserve and inTable 2.

Despite this concern, pneumonitis is a rare event. RECIST VERSUS IRRECIST: HOW DO WE BEST ASSESS THE RESPONSE TO IMMUNOTHERAPY? As early as the ipilimumab trial on melanoma, it was suggested that conventional response assessment criteria such as RECIST and WHO criteria are insuf - cient in fully characterising patterns of tumour re-sponse to immunotherapy. In 2009, irRECIST criteria were proposed based on the discussion by 200 oncolo- gists, immunotherapists and regulatory experts. Theimmune-related Response Criteria (irRC) were evalu-ated in large multinational studies, involving 487 pa-tients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab. 82It is possible that irRC will replace RECIST or WHO criteria in future clinical studies inimmunotherapy. FUTURE PROSPECTS OF LUNG CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY The path to successful immunotherapy in lung cancer has not been straightforward, but valuable lessonshave been learned from both animal and human stud-ies. Armed with better understanding of lung cancer immunoescape and immunosubversion, along with cancer immunosurveillance, immunoediting and waysto reactivate cancer immunity, we can now embark onaf u t u r e lled with possibilities in utilizing immuno- therapy as reliable lung cancer therapy. The logical combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab in melanoma and NSCLC is showing prom-ise although with substantial side effects. 45,83There are multiple studies investigating the effect of combining nivolumab (anti PD-1 antibo dies) with various anti- cancer agents chemotherapy, TKI,bevacizumab and lirilumab ( targeting killer- cell immunoglobulin-like eceptors (KIR) on NK cells) and other combination immunotherapy involving checkpoint blockade (Table 2). Epigenetic therapy could also be utilized to prime the tumour to be more respon-sive to immunotherapy. 22The long-term of im- mune checkpoint blockade remains unknown, andclinicians are faced with the problems of how best to identify patients for treatment (i.e. biomarker issues) and how best to manage the toxicities that occur andthe costs of these therapies. We predict that future NSCLC therapies will include neoantigen vaccines (personalized therapy) combined with chemotherapy (which 'uses the tumour as its own vaccine ') and with multiple checkpoint inhibitors. CONCLUSION It is an exciting time for lung cancer immunotherapy as our understanding of immune response to control,and eliminate tumour cells have greatly expanded in the last few years. This area is expanding rapidly, and we expect to see further development in it in the nextfew years.The Authors A.S. is a research fellow at the School of Medicine and Pharmacology, UWA with interest in lung cancer, tumour immunology and immuno- therapy.
