Modern living is increasingly putting our body pH buffering systems under pressure, often leading to slight deviations of body pH towards acidity. This can negatively impact us in multiple ways and is often initially reflected in fatigue or poor immunity. However, one of the damaging effects of prolonged deviation of pH towards acidity is the fact that this will make it more difficult for the body to detoxify, as excess acidity in body tissues results in toxin accumulation. The products in this section are great complements to a diet which seeks to limit acid-forming foods. The majority of our products focus directly - or indirectly - on facilitating optimum body pH balance. In our view, maintaining alkalinity is vitally important if we are to enjoy high levels of energy and immunity. More and more of us are beginning to appreciate that good health depends greatly on our acid/alkaline balance, and we are passionate about continuing to spread the word. "}
