This includes using the layers of protection that we know help keep ourselves and others healthy: - staying up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines and flu shots - wearing a tight-fitting, well-constructed mask in indoor public settings, especially anyone at higher risk of severe infection - screening daily for signs of illness and staying home when you are sick - washing your hands often - covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze - regularly cleaning high touch surfaces For more information on how to protect yourself and others, [read Public Health Ontario's fact sheet](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/nCoV/Factsheet/2021/06/lp/fact-sheet-covid-19-preventive-layers.pdf?la=en&sc_lang=en&hash=35EAD841BDE13ACF4EC3EB1B9155542B). Vaccines and other routine immunizations It is important to get the COVID-19 vaccine when you are eligible and stay up to date with routine immunizations. Vaccines are safe, effective and the best way to protect you and those around you from infectious diseases.

Stay home If you are sick, stay home to prevent transmission to others, except to seek testing or medical care if required. You should stay home until all of the following apply to you: - your symptoms have been improving for at least 24 hours (or 48 hours if you had nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea) - you do not have a fever - you do not develop any additional symptoms When your symptoms are improving and you are no longer isolating at home, doing the following can provide extra protection against the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses circulating in the community. For 10 days after your symptoms started: - wear a [tight-fitting, well-constructed mask](#section-3)in all public settings - avoid non-essential activities where you need to take off your mask (for example, dining out) - avoid non-essential visits to anyone who is immunocompromised or may be at higher risk of illness (for example, seniors) - avoid non-essential visits to highest risk settings in the community such as hospitals and long-term care homes COVID-19 health advice Symptoms of COVID-19 and its variants range from mild \u2014 like the flu and other common respiratory infections \u2014 to severe. If you feel sick, it's important that you stay home and talk with a primary care provider or doctor if necessary. If you have the symptoms of COVID-19 listed below, assume that you may have the virus and may be contagious. - Any one or more of: - fever or chills - cough - shortness of breath - decreased or loss of taste or smell - Any two or more of: - runny nose or nasal congestion - headache - extreme fatigue - sore throat - muscle aches or joint pain - gastrointestinal symptoms (such as vomiting or diarrhea) If you develop severe symptoms requiring medical attention, such as shortness of breath or chest pain, call 911 and inform them that you may have COVID-19.

If you test negative for COVID-19, you can stop isolating at home once your symptoms are improving for at least 24 hours (or 48 hours if you had nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea) and you do not have a fever. You can then take [additional precautions for up to 10 days after your symptoms started](https://www.ontario.ca/page/public-health-measures-and-advice#additional-precautions) as extra protection against the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses circulating in the community. If you work in a high-risk setting If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have tested positive for COVID-19 and work in a high-risk setting (such as a hospital, a long-term care home, or a retirement home), you should speak with your employer and follow your workplace guidance for return to work. Inform others of their exposure Tell your household members and similar close contacts that you are sick and refer them to [the additional precautions section below](#additional-precautions). A close contact is anyone you were less than two metres away from for at least 15 minutes, or multiple shorter lengths of time, without measures such as masking, distancing, and/or the use of personal protective equipment in the 48 hours before your symptoms began or your positive test result, whichever came first.

COVID-19 antiviral treatments COVID-19 antiviral treatments are available to those with symptoms and a positive test result (PCR or rapid antigen test) who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. [Find out if you're eligible for testing or antiviral treatment](https://www.ontario.ca/page/covid-19-testing-and-treatment) or talk to your health care provider to learn more.

These treatments must be taken immediately within the first five to seven days (depending on the treatment) of symptom onset. Masking Ontarians may consider wearing a tight-fitting, well-constructed mask in indoor public settings, especially anyone at higher risk of severe infection. Setting-specific masking policies should be followed. Long-term care and retirement homes The Ministry of Long-Term Care and the Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility have their own guidance that outlines masking requirements in their facilities.
