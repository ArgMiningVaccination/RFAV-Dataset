On the contrary, we can only see the past in its true light when we study the differences in human souls during the various historical eras. Consciousness, he says, evolves constantly and we can only comprehend the present by understanding its origin in the past.Delivered in the evenings during the course of the 'mystery act' of the Christmas Foundation Meeting - when Rudolf Steiner not only re-founded the Anthroposophical Society but for the first time took a formal role within it - these lectures study world history in parallel with the ancient mysteries of initiation, showing how they are intimately linked. Steiner describes consciousness in the ancient East and follows the initiation principle from Babylonia to Greece, up to its influences in present-day spiritual life. He also discusses Gilgamesh and Eabani, the mysteries of Ephesus and Hibernia, and the occult relationship between the destruction by fire of the Temple of Artemis and the burning of the first Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland.Published for the first time with colour plates of Steiner's blackboard drawings, the freshly-revised text is complemented with an introduction, notes and appendices by Professor Frederick Amrine and an index.", "sitename": "Scribd", "date": "2013-05-17", "cleaned_text": "World History and the Mysteries: In the Light of Anthroposophy By [Rudolf [Rudolf Steiner Press](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/665949905/Rudolf-Steiner-Press) Reviews for World History and the Mysteries 0 ratings0 reviews Book preview World History and the Mysteries - Rudolf Steiner WORLD HISTORY AND THE MYSTERIES IN THE LIGHT OF ANTHROPOSOPHY WORLD HISTORY AND THE MYSTERIES IN THE LIGHT OF ANTHROPOSOPHY Nine lectures given in Dornach between 23 December and 1 January 1924 during the Foundation Meeting of the General Anthroposophical Society TRANSLATED BY GEORGE AND MARY ADAMS, FREDERICK AMRINE AND DOROTHY OSMOND EDITED BY FREDERICK AMRINE INTRODUCTION BY FREDERICK AMRINE RUDOLF STEINER Rudolf Steiner Press Hillside House, The Square Forest Row, RH18 5ES www.rudolfsteinerpress.com Published by Rudolf Steiner Press 2021 Originally published in German under the title Die Weltgeschichte in anthroposophischer Beleuchtung und als Grundlage der (volume 233 in the Rudolf Gesamtausgabe or Collected Works) by Rudolf Steiner Verlag, Dornach.

Ita Wegman Notes Rudolf Steiner's Collected Works Significant Events in the Life of Rudolf Steiner Index PUBLISHER'S NOTE THESE lectures on world history in the light of anthroposophy were presented to members of the Anthroposophical Society in the evenings during the Christmas Foundation Conference, when Rudolf Steiner refounded the Anthroposophical Society. Rudolf Steiner's reasons for doing this, the resolutions, speeches, discussion and the Articles of Incorporation and the complete proceedings of the Christmas Conference can be found in GA 260, published in English under the title The Christmas Conference for the Foundation of the General Anthroposophical Society 1923-1924 (Anthroposophic Press, 1990). INTRODUCTION The cycle World History and the Mysteries In the Light of Anthroposophy was given on the evenings of the Christmas Conference. Indeed, the last two lectures in the cycle are also included in the separate volume that records that Conference. Thus, it is safe to assume that the two events were all of one piece, and that the separation into two volumes is quite arbitrary. In order to do justice to World History, we have to view it as integral to the Christmas Conference. Therefore, let us reconstruct the entire event. This will give us a much fuller picture of what is actually going on in the cycle. * 24 December, 1923 Morning: A separate Society for the young? Treatment of the lecture cycles, 'a tragic chapter in the development of our Anthroposophical Society.'\u00b9 Reading of the Statutes of the Society. Rudolf Steiner proposes to adopt the presidency of the new Society: Out of all this, my dear friends, two alternative questions arose. In 1912, 1913 I said for good reasons that the Anthroposophical Society would now have to run itself, that it would have to manage its own affairs, and that I would have to withdraw into a position of an adviser who did not participate directly in any actions. Since then things have changed. After grave efforts in the past weeks to overcome my inner resistance I have now reached the realization that it would become impossible for me to continue to lead the Anthroposophical Movement within the Anthroposophical Society if this Christmas Conference were not to agree that I should once more take on in every way the leadership, that is the presidency, of the Anthroposophical Society to be founded here in Dornach at the Goetheanum. [49] Evening: GA 233, Lecture One. Three kinds of memory: localized, rhythmic, temporal. 25 December, 1923 Morning: The first reading of the Foundation Stone meditation. General Secretaries from various countries report. Afternoon: Questions and answers on the Statutes. Evening: GA 233, Lecture Two. The dreamlike Asiatic experience of the world. Conquest and enslavement: Asian consciousness of life versus Greek fear of death. 26 December, 1923 Morning: Interpretation of the Foundation Stone meditation. Reports and discussions. Evening: GA 233, Lecture Three. The reality underlying the Epic of Gilgamesh. Biographical hints: Eabani reincarnates as Aristotle and Gilgamesh as Alexander the Great. 27 December, 1923 Morning: Interpretation of the Foundation Stone meditation. Discussion of the Statutes. Evening: GA 233, Lecture Four. The Hibernian and Ephesian Mysteries. The tragic destinies of Aristotle and Alexander the Great. The medieval Song of Alexander. Aristotle teaches Alexander the doctrine of the four elements. 28 December, 1923 Morning: Interpretation of the Foundation Stone meditation. Further discussion of the Statutes. Evening: GA 233, Lecture Five. The decline of the Ephesian Mysteries. The shadowy but still divine consciousness of Greek culture. The torching of the Temple of Ephesus on the day of Alexander's birth. 29 December, 1923 Morning: Meeting of the General Secretaries. Interpretation of the Foundation Stone meditation. Evening: GA 233, Lecture Six. Further descent into Roman civilization. Julian the Apostate is the exception that proves the rule. Human thinking becomes abstract. Exclusion of the spirit. Aristotle's works, saved in the East, returned to Europe with Scholasticism. The centrality of Aristotle as a spiritual guide. 30 December, 1923 Morning: Interpretation of the Foundation Stone meditation. Discussion of practicalities. Evening: GA 233, Lecture Seven. The rise of the consciousness soul, 'an unfruitful period in the evolution of the human spirit'. [109] The actual forces at work in human beings. 31 December, 1923 Morning: Interpretation of the Foundation Stone meditation. Lecture: The Idea of the Future Building in Dornach. Afternoon: Meeting of the Swiss Delegation, discussion of practicalities. Evening: GA 233, Lecture Eight. The solemn oath. But there is a word \u2014 a word that has come down to us in history and that can speak powerfully to the human heart even in external historical tradition, but that speaks with peculiar force and earnestness when we see it shape itself out of strange and unparalleled events, when we see it written with external letters in the history of humanity, though the writing be only visible for a moment in the spirit. I declare to you that, wherever the eye of the spirit is turned to the deed of Herostratus, to the burning of Ephesus, then, in those flames of fire may be read the ancient words: The jealousy of the gods. [116] And so in a certain sense we may say that in the Goetheanum we had something that could awaken in an altogether new form of memory of the old. [123] Whoever looked upon this Goetheanum with feeling and understanding could find in it a memory of the Temple of Ephesus. The memory, however, grew to be terribly painful. For in a manner not at all unlike what befell Ephesus in earlier time, exactly at the moment in its evolution when the Goetheanum was ready to become the bearer of the renewal of spiritual life, in that very moment there was flung into it a burning brand. [124] 1 January, 1924 Morning: Interpretation of the Foundation Stone meditation. Lecture: The Rebuilding of the Goetheanum. Evening: GA 233, Lecture Nine. The Guardian of the Threshold. The fact of the matter is this: the impulse that must be working in what is now to go out from Dornach must - as I emphasized from every possible point of view during the Conference itself - be an impulse originating in the spiritual world, not on the Earth. Our striving here is to develop the strength to follow impulses from the spiritual world. That is why, in the evening lectures during this Christmas Conference, I spoke of manifold impulses at work in the course of historical evolution in order that hearts could be opened for the reception of the spiritual impulses which have yet to stream into the earthly world, which are not derived from that world itself. Everything from which the earthly world hitherto has rightly been the vehicle, proceeded from the spiritual world. And if we are to achieve anything fruitful for the earthly world, the impulses for it must be brought from the spiritual world. [129] We must leave this Conference which has led to the founding of the General Anthroposophical Society, not with trifling, but with solemn thoughts. But I think that nobody need have experienced any pessimism as a result of what took place here at Christmas. We had, it is true, to pass the tragic ruins of the Goetheanum every day, but I think that those who climbed the hill and pass the ruins during the Conference have become aware of what our friends have understood in their hearts and that the following thought will have become a reality to them: Spiritual flames of fire will go forth from the new Goetheanum that will come into being through our activity and devotion. And the greater the courage with which to conduct the affairs of anthroposophy that we take with us from this Conference, the more effectively we have grasped the spiritual impulse of hope that pervaded the Conference. [135-136] * On studying the progress of the Christmas Conference, we can see that there are three tremendous climaxes: Steiner's assumption of the leadership of the Anthroposophical Society, the speaking of the Foundation Stone on Christmas morning, and the solemn oath that he asks the assembled members to take on New Year's Eve. Steiner barely divulged it to the membership, but assuming leadership of the Society was actually enormously daring. Heretofore, Rudolf Steiner had strenuously separated himself from the Anthroposophical Society. He had served only as a spiritual advisor, and had not even joined as a member. He was unsure whether the spiritual world wanted him to unite his personal karma with the karma of the Society. The spiritual world does not respond in principle to such a question in advance: the spiritual researcher must act freely, and then await the response. Rudolf Steiner presented his decision to the members with unqualified assurance, but it was actually a question posed to the spiritual world. How would it respond? He did not know. The stakes were the highest imaginable: the spiritual world might respond favorably, increasing his esoteric insight, but it might also respond unfavorably, putting his entire clairvoyant faculty in jeopardy. The reading of the Foundation Stone culminated in the following words: Let us ever remain aware of this Foundation Stone for the Anthroposophical Society, formed today. In all that we shall do, in the outer world and here, to further, to develop and to fully unfold the Anthroposophical Society, let us preserve the remembrance of the Foundation Stone which we have today lowered into the soil of our hearts. Let us seek in the threefold being of man, which teaches us to love, which teaches us the universal Imagination, which teaches us the universal thoughts; let us seek, in this threefold being, the substance of universal love which we lay as the foundation, let us seek in this threefold being the archetype of the Imagination according to which we shape the universal love within our hearts, let us seek the power of thoughts from the heights which enable us to let shine forth in fitting manner this dodecahedral Imagination which has received its form through love! Then shall we carry away with us from here what we need. Then shall the Foundation Stone which has received its substance from universal love and human love, its picture image, its form, from universal Imagination and human Imagination, and its brilliant radiance from universal thoughts and human thoughts, its brilliant radiance which whenever we recollect this moment can shine towards us with warm light, with light that spurs on our deeds, our thinking, our feeling and our willing. [72-73] It is perhaps significant that the oath did not fall within the morning's proceedings, but rather during the evening lectures. Here are the key moments: Our pain and grief cling to the old Goetheanum. But we shall only show ourselves worthy of having been permitted to build this Goetheanum if we fulfill the task that yet remains to us, if we take today a solemn pledge, each one of us before the highest, the divine, that we bear within our soul, a pledge to hold faithfully in remembrance the spiritual impulses that have had their outward expression in the Goetheanum that is gone. [126] My dear friends, you receive me by rising in memory of the old Goetheanum. Let us now rise in token that we pledge ourselves to continue working in the spirit of the Goetheanum with the best and highest forces that we have within us. So be it. Amen. [127] * Moreover, something enormously consequential happened that was not on the schedule. In the afternoon of 1 January, Rudolf Steiner became extremely ill at a social event. Somehow he managed to summon the strength to finish his ninth and last lecture. However, Steiner never fully recovered. This mysterious illness plagued him until finally he had to cease lecturing on 28 September, 1924. He was confined thereafter to what would become his deathbed on 30 March, 1925. We can only speculate about the origin of this mysterious illness. On the one hand, the spiritual world responded affirmatively to Steiner's decision to assume leadership of the Society. He spoke of floodgates of insight opening to him, and his supra-human productivity in the year 1924 confirms this. But the illness may also have been a consequence of his assuming leadership of the Society. It may be that both developments happened simultaneously: physical decline, accompanied by a tremendously heightened spiritual activity. In that case, Steiner was granted a unique form of grace for a relatively short period, but then he had to die. * Taking this all together, one sees a single overarching theme in the events of the conference, and that is tragedy. By tragedy, I mean spiritual progress purchased at an unspeakably high price. In order for the Foundation Stone and the Spiritual Goetheanum to be laid in the hearts of the members, the physical Goetheanum had to go up in flames. In order for Steiner to achieve a breakthrough, in order for him to give the First Class and to fulfill the mission of his incarnation by teaching karma, he had to perish. On a larger scale, the wisdom of the Mysteries had to die out completely in the outer world so that it could be renewed within. That is what lies at the heart of this cycle of lectures on World History. Progress, but at a nearly unbearable cost. Tragedy.

LECTURE 1 DORNACH, 24 DECEMBER 1923 IN the evening hours of our Christmas Conference, \u00b9 I should like to give you a kind of survey of human evolution on Earth that may help us to become more intimately conscious of the nature of present-day humanity. At this time in human history, when we can see already in preparation events of extraordinary importance for the whole civilization of humanity, every thinker must be inclined to ask: 'How has the present configuration, the present make-up of the human soul arisen? How has it come about through the long course of evolution?' For it cannot be denied that the present only becomes comprehensible as we try to understand its origin in the past. The present age is however one that is peculiarly prejudiced in its thought about the evolution of humanity. It is commonly believed that, as regards his life of soul and spirit, we have always been essentially the same as we are today throughout the whole of the time that we call history. True, in respect of knowledge, it is imagined that in ancient times human beings were childlike, that they believed in all kinds of fancies, and that we have really only become clever in the scientific sense in modern times. But if we look away from the actual sphere of knowledge, it is generally held that the constitution of soul which humans have today was also possessed by the ancient Greek and by the ancient Oriental. Even though it is admitted that modifications may have occured in detail, on the whole it is supposed that throughout the historical period, everything in the life of the soul has been as it is today. We go on to assume a human prehistoric life, and say that nothing is really known of this. Going still further back, we picture the human being in a kind of animal form. Thus, in the first place, as we trace back in historical time, we see a life of soul undergoing comparatively little change. Then the picture disappears in a kind of cloud, and before that again we see ourselves in our animal imperfection as a kind of higher ape. Such is approximately the usual conception of today. Now all this rests on an extraordinary prejudice, for in forming such a conception, we do not take the trouble to observe the important differences that exist in the human constitution of the present time, as compared even with that of a relatively not very far distant past\u2014say, of the eleventh, tenth, and ninth centuries CE. The difference goes deeper when we compare the psychic constitution in the human being of today and in contemporaries of the Mystery of Golgotha,\u00b2 or in a Greek. And if we go over to the ancient Oriental world of which the Greek civilization was, in a sense, a kind of colony, a late colony, we find there a disposition of soul utterly different from that of the humanity of today. I should like to show you from real instances how humans lived in the East, let us say, ten thousand, or fifteen thousand years ago, and how different they were in nature from the Greek, and how still more different from what we ourselves are.\u00b3 Let us first call to mind our own lives of soul. I will take an example from it. We have a certain experience; and of this experience, in which we take part through our senses, or through our personality in some other way, we form an idea, a representation, and we retain this representation in our thought. After a certain time the idea may arise again out of our thought into our conscious life of soul as memory. You have perhaps today an experience of memory that leads you back to experiences in perception of some ten years ago. Now try to understand exactly what that really means. Ten years ago you experienced something. Ten years ago you may have visited a gathering of men and women. You formed a representation of each one of these persons, of their appearance and so on. You experienced what they said to you, and what you did in common with them. All that, in the form of pictures, may arise before you today. It is an inner psychic image that is present within you, connected with the event which occurred ten years ago. Now not only according to science, but according to a general feeling\u2014which is, of course, experienced by us today in an extremely weak form, but which nevertheless is experienced\u2014according to this general feeling, we localize such a representational memory which brings back a past experience in our heads. We say: 'What lives as the memory of an experience is present in my head.' Now let us jump a long way back in human evolution, and consider the early population of the Orient, of which the Chinese and Indians as we know them in history were only the late descendants; that is, let us really go back thousands of years. Then, if we "}
