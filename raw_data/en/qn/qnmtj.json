Rehak, Stacey A. Cecco and Gyorgy Csako Clinical Chemistry Service, Clinical Pathology Department, Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA The biochemical composition of \"unstimulated\" whole saliva was determined in healthy adult subjects. Based on their relative concentration, salivary ana - lytes could be classified into three arbitrary categories: concentration lower than in serum (saliva/serum ratio < 0.5; 12 analytes), similar to serum (ratio = 0.5-1.5; five analytes), and higher than in serum (ratio > 1.5; five an - alytes). Consistent with local production, an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the saliva was associated with a non-serum like LDH isoenzyme pat - LDH2 > LDH1. Com - pared with serum, the concentrations of hydrogen (as reflected in the pH), potassium and inorganic phos - phorus were much higher (saliva/serum ratio \u00b83), whereas that of sodium, total magnesium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide were lower (saliva/serum ra - tio \u00b70.3). The concentration of ionized calcium was similar in saliva and serum (saliva/serum ratio = 0.8), while ionized magnesium was unmeasurable in saliva. The salivary ionized calcium fraction was higher (0.76) than previously suggested (0.51). The difference be - tween the main salivary cations (potassium, sodium), and anions (phosphate, chloride) was similar to serum (anion gap: 4 v s .11 meq/l). Highly significant (p \u00b70 . 0 1 2 ) correlations occured among salivary pH, dihydrophos - phate, total calcium, and potassium. Our data suggest that calcium, potassium, chloride and phosphates are the major salivary complex-forming ions. The major compositional differences between serum and saliva show that saliva is not a passive \"ultrafiltrate\" of serum and salivary constituents may play a distinct role. of mono- and dihydrophosphate; PHH, total phosphate in meq/l as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pK 2=7.2); Pi, total CO2; TMg, total magnesium.Introduction The oral fluid of whole saliva is a complex mixture of salivary gland secretions, gingival crevicular fluid, cel - lular debris, and microorganisms, and provides the chemical milieu to the teeth and oral tissues (1, 2). Be - cause saliva can be easily, non-invasively and inexpen - sively collected, it is increasingly used in diagnostic tests as a natural \"ultrafiltrate\" of plasma (3-6). How - ever, in addition to being transferred from the plasma, salivary constituents may also originate from the sali - vary glands and, possibly, from other oral tissues, re - sulting in significant differences between the biochem - ical profiles of plasma and saliva (7). I n i t i a l l y , we investigated saliva as a possible contami- nant causing unexplained increases in serum potas- sium concentrations. Subsequently, we extended our investigations because we found that the existing infor- mation in the literature about the composition of saliva is limited for a number of reasons. On one hand, most of the studies were performed at the time when testing with high-precision modern automated instruments and high-quality specific methods were not yet avail- able (8, 9). In fact, some presently used chemistry meth- ods had not even been developed at that time ( e . g ., ion- ized Ca (Ca2 +) (10) and ionized Mg (Mg2 +) (11)), whereas some others were not routinely available ( e . g ., osmolal- ity (12)) or g ., lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme testing (13)). On the other hand, recent studies primarily focused on the use of saliva as a convenient sample for \"free\" (non-protein bound) drugs, \"free\" (non-protein bound) hormones, and toxicology testing (3-5, 14). Therefore, we re-exam- ined the biochemical composition of \"unstimulated\" (resting) whole human saliva with special respect to previously unmeasured analytes and the electrolyte balance. We used whole (\"mixed\") saliva because it is more relevant to physiology and pathology of oral cav- ity than individual gland secretions (6, 7). Materials and Methods Specimens Approximately 1.5 ml of \"unstimulated\" ( i.e., no specific gus - tatory or masticatory stimulation (7)) whole saliva was col - lected by the spitting method from apparently healthy adult subjects between 8 and 9 a. m. There were 43 females and 17 males aged 20 to 65 years (85% middle-aged (30-64 years old) as defined in reference 15) and all had a good oral hygiene. Only one volunteer was a smoker (male, 1 pipe per day). In the spitting method, the saliva first is collected with closed lips within the oral cavity, then it is expelled into a tube.

After centrifugation (6 min at 3000 g), the su - pernatant (clarified saliva) was analyzed undiluted or, when analyte concentration was above the reportable range of the method, diluted with saline (NaCl = 145 mmol/l). There was only a single specimen that could not be analyzed due to ex - treme viscosity. Upon recollection on a different day, the new specimen was, however, amenable to analysis. Measurement of pH, Ca2+ and Mg2+ The pH, Ca2 +, and Mg2 +were determined with Nova CRT (Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA, USA) in undiluted saliva specimens. The Ca2+ and Mg2+ results were not normalized to pH=7.40. The- o r e t i c a l l y , the ionic strength affects the response of an ion-se- lective electrode (ISE). Based on our observations with un- buffered CaCl2/ saline solutions, the ionized Ca results indeed may be up to ~7% higher for solutions with \u00b5 0.075, but this in- crease is close in magnitude to the between-run imprecision of the method (CV 3%). Addition of small amounts of protein (e . g ., 350 mg/l albumin) to aqueous solutions had no effect on the measured Ca2 +. The within-run imprecision (CV) 0.82 to 1.05 mmol/l) ranged from 1.2 to 3.0% and 0.3 to 1.0%, respectively (each of five dif- ferent specimens analyzed 10 times). For comparison, the re- spective within-run imprecision for human serum specimen analyzed 10 times.Measurement of other analytes Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) were measured in undiluted saliva specimens with flame photometer (IL 943, Instrumenta - tion Laboratory, Lexington, MA, USA). Using diluted speci - mens, potassium was also measured with ion-selective elec - trodes (ISE1: concentrations of Na and Cl were below the reportable range of the ISE serum methods, their concentration on the Delta CX3 (ISE1) was determined with the respective urine methods. Total cal - cium (TCa) and total CO2(TCO2) were measured with ISE on the Delta CX3. Total magnesium (TMg), inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and other common chemistry tests were measured with Hitachi 917 (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA). For measurement of amylase, the specimens were diluted. Osmolality was measured with Multi-Osmette (Precision Sys - tem, Natick, MA, USA). LDH isoenzymes were determined by the Rapid Electrophoresis System (REP; Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX, USA). Data analysis For all analytes, results below the reportable range but within the instrument low range were converted to the number near - est to the lower limit of the reportable range. Using this ap - proach, 12 Cl results were converted from <15 to 14 mmol/l, 13 Na results from <10 to 9 mmol/l, 1 TMg result from <0.12 mmol/l, alanine aminotransferase results from <4 to 3 U/l.

The fraction of free Ca2+ (fCa2+ ) was calculated as ratio of ionized to total Ca (fCa2+=Ca2+/TCa), whereas the bound Ca (bCa) was calculated as the difference between the total and ionized Ca (bCa= TCa-Ca2+). For study - ing the relationship between salivary electrolytes the concen - trations of cations and anions were expressed in terms of mil - liequivalents/l (meq/l). Since the mean salivary pH was closest to the dissociation constant of the mono- and dihydrogen phosphate anions (pK2=7.2), for samples with a known pH (n=34) the concentration of each anionic form was calculated using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pHmeasured = 7.2 + log (HPO42-/H2PO4-)) and PHH = HPO42-+ H2PO4-(meq/l). For assess - ment of the electrolyte balance, the measured TCO2was as - sumed to be present as a HCO3-anion. Mean saliva/serum ra - tios were calculated by using previously determined in-house serum reference intervals for apparently healthy adults of both sexes. The analytical methods were the same for serum and saliva testing. Results are expressed as mean\u00b1SD range. Additional statis - tical analyses included paired t-test, simple and debiased lin - ear regressions and Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho), as deemed appropriate. A p<0.05 was considered statis - tically significant. Results Biochemical composition of saliva The biochemical composition of \"unstimulated\" whole saliva relative to serum concentrations of commonly measured analytes is summarized in Table 1. Under the conditions applied, the salivary glucose, total protein, albumin, creatinine and Mg2 +were unmeasurable and their concentrations are listed as below the reportable range of these methods. Other analytes with concentra- tions much lower in saliva concentrations saliva and serum (0.5 saliva/serum ratio 1.5) included uric acid, total and ion- ized Ca, aspartate aminotransferase and urea nitrogen.Analytes that occurred with much higher concentration in saliva than serum (saliva/ serum ratio > 1.5) included LDH, pH (based H+concentration), Pi, K, and amy- lase. The fCa2 +was higher in saliva (0.76\u00b10.11) than in serum with a saliva/serum ratio of 1.6, whereas the bCa was lower in saliva (0.33\u00b10.20 mmol/l) than in serum isoen - zyme patterns saliva and normal human serum.

It was characterized by a vir - tual absence of the LDH1 fraction and a presence of LDH4 (Figure 1). The unusually low salivary Na obtained by flame photometry was also seen by shows the relationship between the K results determined with flame photometry and those obtained with the ISE methods. While statistically significant dif - ferences (paired t-test p<0.001) were found between flame photometry and those measured by any of the three ISE methods, the intermethod correlations were relatively strong (r2>0.75). Electrolyte balance in saliva The concentration of total phosphate anions calculated by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (PHH) in a sub - set of saliva specimens (n = 34) was = 8.4\u00b13.2 meq/l, range 2.1-16.4, with a mono- to dihydrophosphate an - ion ratio of 1.4\u00b10.1, range 1.1-1.6. This ratio closely ap - proximates an equimolar presence of the two phos - i.e.PCALC (meq/l) ~-1.5 x (mmol/l). equimolar presence of the two phosphate anions, the recalculation of total phosphate anion concentration in the same subset of saliva speci - mens gave a PCALC=9.2\u00b13.8 meq/l, range 2.0-19.8, and in the total of 60 saliva specimens gave a P CALC=9.0\u00b14.0 meq/l, range 2.0-19.8. The difference between the twocalculated total phosphate concentrations was pH de - pendent: PCALC-PHH= 0.01 (H+)-0.5. For saliva speci - mens with a pH of 6.8 (n=26) the difference was less than 1 meq/l, whereas for saliva specimens with a pH <6.8 (n=8) the difference ranged from 1.1 to 3.5 meq/l. Further, the difference between P CALCand P HHwas sta - tistically significant (paired t-test p<0.001), - sults strongly correlated (PCALC= 1.2 PHH-0.9, r2=0.94). The summary of all statistically significant (p<0.05) correlations is shown in Figure 3. Figures 3and 4 show that significant correlations occurred between the sali - vary concentration of PHHanion and several cation species such as Na, K, TCa and bCa, and between the Cl anion and K cation. The salivary concentration of P HH and fCa2+ also significantly correlated even though the correlation between PHHand Ca2+was not significant (p>0.8). Figures 3 and 5 show that the concentrations of PHH, K, Mg, TCa, bCa and Ca2+all decreased with in - creasing pH, whereas the concentrations of Na and Cl were not affected by pH changes (p>0.45). The calculated difference between measured equiv - alents of cations and anions (anion gap (AG)) in saliva (mean = 4.4 meq/l) was similar to that in serum (mean = 11 meq/l) only when PHH was included in the calcula - tion (Figure 6A). Assuming equimolar concentrations for the two phosphate anions had negligible effect on the calculated AG values (mean = 3.7 meq/l) but pro - duced falsely low results for specimens with pH 6.8. Inclusion of TCa and TCO2(as HCO3-) in the formula barely affected the salivary AG (4.4 vs.4.4 meq/l). Fig - ure 6B shows that the salivary AG was only marginally dependent on the pH (p > 0.74).

Brought to you by | New York University Bobst Library Technical Services Authenticated Download Date | 5/28/15 12:58 Rehak et al. : Biochemistry of saliva serum. -Amylase is known to be the dominant sali - vary protein with a reported concentration of 0.6-1.2 g/l in the parotid saliva and 0.25 g/l in submandibular saliva (1). Because chloride activates amylase, the chlo - ride content of the solution used for sample dilution af - fects the amylase results (23). Using saline as a diluent and the Boehringer Mannheim defined-substrate - amylase method, we observed an over 1000-fold ex - cess of amylase activity in saliva compared with serum. Our finding of undetectable salivary creatinine and glucose concentrations is in apparent disagree - ment with previously reported reference ranges for creatinine (24). But we used an enzymatic creatinine method which is known to give up to 26.5 \u00b5mol/l (3 mg/l) lower results than the conventionally used Jaffe reaction. Further, our finding of undetectable glucose concentrations (<0.1 mmol/l (<20 mg/l)) is supported by recent observations of W e- ber (25) who reported similarly low salivary glucose concentrations (<0.15 mmol/l (<27 mg/l)) during intra - venous glucose load in healthy men. Besides confirming high salivary amylase levels, we detected the presence of the enzymes alkaline phos -phatase, transaminases, and LDH alkaline phosphatase and transami - nases have been reported for infants and young chil - dren (26) but, because of analytical differences, they cannot be directly compared to our results. There are no published data about salivary LDH. Theoretically , the elevated LDH levels could have originated from the oral cavity ( i.e., contamination with bacterial flora and/or traces of blood). However, isoenzyme analysis revealed that all saliva specimens have virtually the same isoenzyme pattern (making contamination as a major source unlikely) and this pattern (LDH5 >> LDH4 > LDH3 >>LDH2 > LDH1) was very different from of - zyme pattern, and the higher-than-serum total enzyme activity all indicate local origin of salivary LDH. Phosphate and K were the only inorganic compo - nents of saliva with a mean saliva to serum ratio of greater than five. The high salivary K results were method-independent: the results obtained with an \"in - direct\" method that measures ion concentration (ISE1) Fig.5Relationship between pH (x) and major ion species (y) in \"unstimulated\" whole saliva specimens.

Because of the high Pi and K saliva/serum ratios, saliva should be con - sidered as a potential source of preanalytical error for both analytes in serum. Comparatively small (as little as 2-5%) contamination of blood or other body fluids with saliva may cause not only clinically important er - roneously high amylase results but also clinically im - portant increases in K and, to a lesser extent, in Pi. Similar to serum, Ca and Mg may occur in saliva as bound (either proteins or soluble complexes) or as a free ion (Ca2+, Mg2+); likely the most important fractions (7). Currently available information on the Ca2+ concen - tration in saliva is limited regarding the type of saliva analyzed, assessment of pH effect, and methodology . The first methods used for the measurement of sali - vary Ca2+ were based on murexide complexing in pro - tein-free filtrate (27, 28) or gel filtration (29). Using ISEs, the concentration of Ca2+ in the stimulated parotid saliva was found to increase from 0.56 to 0.88 mmol/l as the salivary flow increased from 0.1 to 0.6 ml/min, but the Ca2+fraction (fCa2+=0.54\u00b10.04) remained almostconstant (30). With the same methodology, the concen - tration of Ca2+ was reported to be 0.53 \u00b10.07 mmol/l (es - timated fCa2+=0.51) in unstimulated whole saliva (31) and 0.66\u00b10.15 mmol/l in stimulated whole saliva (32). We found no published data for salivary Mg2+.With Nova ISEs, we observed Mg2+ concentrations below the usable range of the method (< 0.1 mmol/l) in all saliva specimens, resulting in a very low saliva/serum ratio (<0.2). In contrast, the salivary and serum Ca2+ concentrations were similar (saliva/serum ratio = 0.8) in our specimens. Since the TCa concentration in saliva is only about half of that in the serum (saliva/serum ra - tio = 0.6), the fCa2+is much higher (saliva/serum ratio = 1.6) and the bCa is much lower (saliva/serum ratio = 0.2) in saliva than serum. Compared to a previous re - port (31), we found a higher fCa2+in \"unstimulated\" whole saliva (mean: 0.76 vs.0.51). In blood, albumin is the major binding protein of Caand Mg and the extent of binding is pH dependent as they compete with H+for binding sites. Because saliva contains only traces of al - bumin (20) and the H+concentration in most \"unstimu - lated\" whole salivary specimens is relatively high when compared to serum, the bound Ca and Mg ions in saliva are most likely present in the form of soluble complexes as previously suggested (33). Salivary Ca and Piare considered important in pre - venting dental caries by remineralising enamel sur - faces of teeth via formation of hydroxyapatite at alka - line pH (1, 16). However, the relationship between salivary Ca and phosphate, as well as between the other major salivary cations and anions, has not been fully elaborated. Our data indicate that Na and K as cations and Cl and phosphates as anions account for most of the electrolyte balance in saliva, resulting in an AG (4\u00b18 meq/l) that is similar to that of serum (11\u00b12 meq/l). In \"unstimulated\" whole saliva specimens, TCa and TCO2appear to be minor constituents. Un - measured anions may include thiocyanate (from di - etary sources and smoking), fluoride (from fluorinated water and toothpaste), lactate, and possibly some other organic anionic species. The lack of correlation between the AG and pH is consistent with an exoge - nous origin of at least some of the unmeasured sali - vary anions. The pH of \"unstimulated\" saliva has been reported to be acidic (<6.4) and to increase rapidly with increas - ing salivary flow rate (22). The flow rate is apparently much higher for \"unstimulated\" whole saliva (mean = 0.32, range: 0.1 to 0.5 ml/min) than for \"unstimulated\" parotid saliva (mean = 0.04, range 0.01 to 0.07 ml/min) (1). The difference in flow rates is reflected in different pH values and, consequently, different compositions of the two saliva types. At the pH range (6.42-7.41) of our \"unstimulated\" whole saliva specimens, the Piis ex - pected to be present as a mixture of mono- and dihy - drophosphate anions (pKa ~ 7.2). The of the pH with dihydrophosphate anion, TMg and K are consistent with the previously observed effect of flow rate on the composition of stim - ulated parotid saliva (22). However, in contrast to re - ported increases in Na and TCO2and, to a lesser extent, Fig.6Anion gap (AG) in \"unstimulated\" whole saliva speci - mens.

We also found nega - tive correlations of the pH with TCa, Ca2+, and bCa. A decrease in TCa with increasing salivary flow rate has been observed previously but only for the \"resting\" parotid saliva of children (16) and the salivary concen - tration of Ca2+ was reported to be unrelated to the pH (28). We observed that in \"unstimulated\" whole saliva the Ca2+ concentration decreased in direct proportion to the TCa concentration so that the fCa2+was not af - fected by the pH value. Indeed, at any observed pH, like in a previous in vitro pH titration study (33), the fCa2+ ranged from about 0.3 to 0.9. However, the fCa2+, as well as the TCa and bCa concentrations, decreased with decreasing concentrations of the phosphate an - ions. Since we found no relationship between Cl and any of the Ca forms (p>0.3), H2PO4-and, to a lesser de - gree, HPO42-, can be considered important complex- forming anions of salivary Ca. In conclusion, K, Na and Ca are the major cations, whereas Cl and different forms of phosphate are the major anions in \"unstimulated\" whole saliva. The main complex-forming ions are Ca, K, and phosphates. While our study addressed the normal (physiologic) status of \"unstimulated\" whole saliva, further studies with saliva specimens collected from patients with var - ious diseases of the oral cavity are warranted to ex - plore possible diagnostic utility of salivary Ca2+and, possibly, Mg2+measurements. We showed that these measurements are both feasible and practicable with currently available methodology . Acknowledgements We thank Mr. Rene Costello for constructing Figure 1.
