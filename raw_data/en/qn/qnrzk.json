This timely piece on support for the feminine through herbs, plants and self-care is just what's needed... The use of pharmaceuticals for pregnancy, fertility, hormone regulation, menopause, and more, has become excessive in modern day history, and not without risks. While a wide array of pharmaceuticals and allopathic practices have been a lifesaver to many, it is vital that we integrate holistic practices that can help prevent a wide array of side effects, potential complications, and are supportive to our wholeness\u2014mentally and physically. Millions of women suffer from uterine fibroids, PMS, [PCOS,](https://new.thechalkboardmag.com/?s=pcos) [endometriosis](https://new.thechalkboardmag.com/endometriosis-recovery-story), fertility issues, menopausal problems, hormonal concerns, and more. And sadly, many common medications that treat these common imbalances cause a wide array of harmful side-effects. I'm a huge advocate of integrating the best of both worlds. Medications, herbs and diet can all play an important role. The ten herbs and three self-care practices below are an invitation to educate, recognize, and deepen your connection to your body and the Earth. Many of these traditional herbs are included in [our Womb Tea](https://animamundiherbals.com/products/womb-tea?rfsn=1908470.98dd8&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1908470.98dd8), a careful blend that has lovingly sold out many times since we first released it a couple of years ago! These herbs have served many across centuries, and can be useful add-ons to your current routines. Please be mindful and dive deeper when combining with other prescription medications. Although most here are generally safe, please consult your herbalist, healthcare practitioner, midwife and/or doctor to better asses what's right for you and your unique body type. 10 Helpful Herbs For The Womb In All Its Stages 1.

According to master herbalist Rosemary Gladstar, \"Because of Red Clover's phytoestrogens, it is commonly used by women to support common menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and night sweats. The isoflavones in [Red Clover](https://animamundiherbals.com/products/womb-tea?rfsn=1908470.98dd8&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1908470.98dd8) appear to bind with estrogen receptor sites, preventing certain forms of estrogen such as estradiol and/or excess estrogen from accumulating.\" Red Clover is often used for fertility, and as a tonic to prepare the uterus for pregnancy.

Many of the rituals below are inspired by ancient traditions that practiced self care to return the body to its original healthy state. Self care rituals weren't practiced solely to diagnose a specific symptom, or to look good - the general aim was to re-enliven life force in the body, the very essence of our health and well-being. There are many ways you can practice self care, from jumping into a body of water, to sitting in silence, to a walk in nature, or a simple foot massage. The practice of filling your own cup daily allows you to be more present and thrive. 1. SELF MASSAGE\u2014In modern Western culture we consider a massage to be a special treat, but for many healers in the East, Africa, and in Latin America, massage was and is a daily practice to free the body of stagnation. In Latin America for example, there are specific shamans called \"sobaderos\" that literally heal through moving, agitating, or massaging the body. This is believed to free the body of what I would call somatic impressions, memories, and emotional programming. In Eastern, African, and Latin American traditions, there is a common ritual where women get daily massages for a period of days, or up to forty days (also called \"cuarentena\") after giving birth. This is often done by a midwife, doulas, or family members. In modern day reality\u2014where we all live busy lives and don't always have family nearby\u2014we have become accustomed to massages being an expensive luxury. Therefore a great alternative, if you're seeking this therapy, is self-massage, which can be equally as effective. To practice self-massage: + Apply warm oil generously to your body, beginning with your limbs. Use long strokes on your arms and legs, and circular motions on your joints. Massage clockwise to release tension, and include areas like your neck and under your arms to target lymph nodes. + Massage your abdomen and chest in broad clockwise, circular motions. Follow the path of the intestine on your stomach, moving up on the right side, then down on the left. + Apply oil to your crown, working outward in circular motions. + Dip your fingertips in the oil and massage your ears. + Massage your feet, but make sure to wipe off the oil before you walk. + Throughout the massage, send loving intentions to your organs and show gratitude to your body for everything it does for you. + Allow yourself enough time so that the oil soaks into your skin before you dress. If you don't have time for a full massage, you can always do a foot massage before bed. Try it with warm oil, or thicker oils like shea butter or even mallow, for deeper hydration. 2. HERBAL BATHS\u2014Baths are deeply cleansing and can enhance physical and mental energy, remove negativity, and relax your body and mind. They're also a wonderful way to soak up the deeply therapeutic medicine of essential oils and other good-for-the-skin ingredients. If you're a cold plunger, enjoy a cold bath this summer. This is known to greatly restore the nervous system and activate the almighty parasympathetic nervous system for rest and restoration. For those of you that love warm baths, make a big pot of tea using your herbs of choice. Add these into your bath for an extra cleansing effect. Incorporate epsom salts, magnesium salts, or essential oils of preference, to exalt the therapeutic activity. 3. BANOS FLORALES\u2014This is different from bathing, and involves pouring flower water, ceremonially, over your head to cleanse and purge the physical and psychic bodies. In Latin American traditions, shamans prepare flower waters by using spring water, and adding in flowers that match the vibrational feel of what they sense for you and your life path. This can be as detailed as the amount of petals, flowers, and colors present. A prayer is recited to the water, and then poured over the person's head gently. This practice purges the body of psychic stagnation, and seals the aura with the vibrational power of flowers. This story is brought to you in partnership with Anima Mundi.
