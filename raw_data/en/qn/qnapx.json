Credits Bredesen to the General Assembly............................................................... xii i Transmittal Letter, Commissioner of Finance an d Administration to Governor Bredesen ..........................xxi Administration Priorities ...................................................................................................... ......................xxix The xxxiii TENNESSEE PHILBREDESEN GOVERNOR xivSuccess in managing the TennCare budget allows me to recommend the following investments with no new taxes and no statewide budget reductions: K-12 Basic Education Program - The Basic Education Program (BEP) is fully funded for the 10th straight year. At-Risk Students and English Language Learners - An additional $20 million BEP appropriation will allow state funding of approxima tely 30 percent of K-12 at-risk students for grades K-12 and will reduce the teacher-student ra tio from 1:50 to 1:45 for the English Language Learner component of the BEP. At-risk student s need enhanced and costly educational support because of economic circumstance, neglect, disability, or academic or family problems. Pre-Kindergarten - I recommend expanding the voluntary pre-kindergarten program in 2006- 2007 with an additional $20 million of genera l fund revenue and continuing the $25 million appropriation of excess Lottery for Educati on proceeds for another year. The $20 million increase will provide the state share of funds for 250 additional pre-K classrooms. The excess from the lottery is available, considering the amount required to fund higher education scholarships next year. Math and Science Excellence - To help prepare top high school math and science upper-class students for college and work, I recommend that we locate a residential math and science high school at the UT Space Institute in Tullahoma. Nothing in education is more important than math and science in preparing our hardworking citizens for the knowledge-based, high-technology future. The proposed math and science prep school will number 85 to 120 students and, as a laboratory for innovation in teaching high-achieving students, will benefit all school systems. The budget provides start-up funds for th e program, with the intent to open the school in fall 2007. I also recommend funds to continue expanding the Books from Birth Foundation program throughout the state; for the an increased numbe r of infants and toddlers with disabilities who need in-home educational services; for grants to Future Farmers of America and the 4-H Foundation; and for a grant to Save the Children for the literacy program, focused on grades 1-3 in under-served schools. Higher Education - Science and Engineering Distinguished Scholars - From recurring funds, I recommend second-year funding of a plan to attract national academy-level faculty to the University of Tennessee (UT). State funds w ill be matched by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) funds, creating a pool of recurring funds to recruit distinguished scholars in the fields of science and engineering, who will be jointly appoi nted at UT and ORNL. Appointments will be targeted in the neutron, biological, computati onal, and materials sciences. The National Academy of Sciences includes 1,800 members a nd the National Academy of Engineering, 1,900, elected by peers in recognition of distinguished achievement in those fields. xvThe capital outlay budget includes state funds to match federal funds for construction of a facility for research in materials science, the Jo int Institute in Advanced Materials in Knoxville, a joint project of the University of Tennessee and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Capital outlay for higher education reaches the first 10 projects recommended by the Higher Education Commission, including a new University of Memphis Law School building and a new Middle Tennessee State University science buildi ng, and also provides for capital maintenance. The higher education capital outlay budget totals $202.3 million, funded from current funds and bonds. In addition, I recommend for higher education the continuation of the non-recurring operating budget support for another year. I also recommend funds to maintain the current level of financial support provided for many years for equity and access in higher education. As Geier desegregation settlement commitments are met and funding requirements are reduced, the state should redirect Geier funds into areas that have been most effective in making progress toward unitary status. Within the current base level of funding, the budget maintains minority fina ncial aid programs in both university systems and accelerates completion of Geier settleme nt agreement funding commitments during 2006- 2007. During the 2006 calendar year, the Admini stration and higher education staff will evaluate the effectiveness of the Geier progr ams and recommend a plan for use of the Geier funds in a post-Geier unitary status in 2007-2008 and succeeding fiscal years. Jobs and the Economy - From mostly non-recurring funds, I recommend continuing two approaches that create jobs and stimulate economic opportunity. One is a further investment in the jobs package of the Department of Ec onomic and Community Development, which will provide grants for job training and infrastructure development; will continue the efforts of the Tennessee Leadership Center, which complements the Three-Star community preparedness program by offering training opportunities to comm unity leaders; and will provide additional funds for the Three-Star community grants. In addition, non-recurring funds are provided to support the relocation of the Nissan headquarters to Tennessee. The second part of the jobs and economy initiativ e will provide additional non-recurring funds to continue efforts begun last year to advertise and promote the state in the markets having the highest potential for increasing Tennessee t ourism. In addition, recurring funds are recommended for opening of a new I-26 welcome cente r at Erwin, in Unicoi County, in spring of 2007. Safe Communities - Support of local and state law enfo rcement and of first responders to disaster and homeland security threats is v ital to maintaining a high quality of life for Tennesseans. While continuing the crackdown on me thamphetamine abuse that we began in the current year, I recommend in the new budget recurring funds for the Davidson County residential drug court program; for similar drug court pr ograms in Shelby, Knox, and Hamilton counties; and for some additional drug courts in other ar eas of the state. In the Office of Homeland Security, funds to staff and equip an inte lligence fusion center, combining and analyzing information from state and federal agencies, will support the rapid iden tification of emerging xvithreats and enhance the state's ability to disse minate terrorism information to local first responders and state agencies. I recommend funds to begin solving the communications interoperability issue that exists among state and local agencies, in law enforcement, disaster response, and homeland security. Non-recurring st ate funds for this purpose will be available to match a larger share of federal grant funds. I also recommend funds for a public education campaign on Internet stalking. In the capital outlay budget, funds for renovation of the state emergency operations center and state operations control center in Nashville, will improve the workplace of the Tennessee Emergency Manageme nt Agency and other state officials in managing disaster and homeland security response. In the prisons budget, I recommend funds for the cost s of an increased number of felons in local jails; for increased state prison operating costs, including inflators in the three prison service agreements and in health and mental health se rvices contracts; and fo r staffing and operational expenses required during the expansion of th e Brushy Mountain prison complex in Morgan County. For the District Attorneys General offices in Shelby, Davidson, Knox, and Hamilton counties, I recommend additional operational, non-payroll stat e support, which has been minimal and not increased in many years. This will provide bette r parity in state support of urban and rural DAs offices. I also recommend more funds for forensic services essential to fighting crime, allowing the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to add positions for completing forensic examinations more quickly and to retain positions that otherwise would be lost with an expiring federal grant. Child Welfare - Child Advocacy Centers are community-organized, community-supported, and invaluable in coordinating local and state servi ces in the investigation and prosecution of child- abuse cases. I recommend that the state provide $50,000 grants to an additional five centers, bringing the total now supported with these grants to 34, an increase of 23 receiving state support since 2003-2004. In addition, I recommend that the state support Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) programs in nine more counties with $15,000 grants, bringing the total receiving state funds to 23. CASA program s recruit, train, and supervise volunteers to serve as court-appointed advocates for children in state custody who are abused, neglected, or dependent. In addition, the budget includes funds for the third step of the plan to bring Department of Children's Services case manager salaries in lin e with the Southeast average; to provide an average 2 percent rate increase for residential se rvice providers; to provide a 6.2 percent increase in foster care and adoption assistance reimburse ment rates; to address adoption assistance caseload growth; to improve training of child we lfare case workers; and to assess, develop, and deliver community resources necessary for services to children in state custody, based on each child's level of need. I also recommend that th e state provide financial assistance for attendance at public post-secondary institutions in Tennessee to children who are aging out of state foster care. This assistance will partially fill the gap be tween the cost of attendance and other financial aid programs. Senior Citizens - Our senior citizens have contributed most of a lifetime to our well-being. As they age, we ought to support their needs for co mfort of community, a sense of security, and xviifreedom for personal fulfillment. The state needs to look at our long-term care future for senior citizens, and I intend to do that, with your help. In this budget, I recommend some interim steps. In the Commission on Aging and Disability budget, I recommend funds to serve an additional 200 individuals in home and community based services for the non-Medicaid eligible and additional funds for senior citizens center opera tions. In the TennCare budget, I also recommend additional funds for home and community base d services, including a reimbursement rate increase for PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), 250 additional slots for the Senior/Shelby waiver, and 225 more slots for the ADAPT waiver (American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today). Mental Retardation - Through reductions in the state-only funding mechanism for services to the mentally retarded and the transfer of Me ntal Retardation Services Division savings to TennCare, the budget includes additional federa l match funds for an increased number of Medicaid waiver slots for the mentally retarded. In addition, the TennCare budget includes a non-recurring appropriation to facilitate the trans ition to TennCare-funded waiver services, as the Division of Mental Retardation Services deve lops and implements plans to control costs. Public Health - TennCare costs are under control in this budget. While the TennCare budget includes significant program improvements, TennCar e program costs are within the goal I set: TennCare consumes 25.6 percent of estimated Depa rtment of Revenue tax collections in the recommended 2006-2007 budget, compared with 26.3 percent in the current year. On a recurring expenditure and revenue basis, the comp arison is 25.3 percent in both the current year and 2006-2007. The TennCare budget includes improvements to open enrollment in the medically-needy program and to allow less restric tive criteria; to extend eligibility for children under age one by increasing the federal poverty le vel criterion from 185 percent to 200 percent; for home and community based services; for en rollment growth; for growth in costs of intermediate care facilities for the mentally reta rded; for a long-term care reimbursement rate increase; and for the TennCare share of improveme nts in the departments of Children's Services and Human Services and in the Division of Mental Retardation Services. The Health Care Safety Net, established to ease the transition of persons losing TennCare coverage due to reform and cost-control effo rts, continues with additional recurring and non- recurring funds in this budget. Additional recurri ng funds are provided to annualize the cost of 234 Health Department primary care positions estab lished in the current year, for safety net case management and a call center, and for the Sh elby County health care program. Non-recurring funds are recommended for donated bulk pharmac y, regional specialty networks, and other transitional costs. Human Services - I recommend additional recurring funds in the Department of Human Services to fund the increase in the Families First (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) standard of need, a 2.2 percent inflationary increase in the standard, which will allow 924 families to remain qualified or qualify for the program. From non-recurring funds, I recommend continuation of the family assistance service center in Memphis for another year. xviiiConservation - In addition to restoration of the real estate transfer tax to the land acquisition and soil conservation funds at the $24 million leve l, discussed above, I recommend an additional non-recurring $10 million appropriation to the Herita ge Conservation Trust Fund. Together with the non-recurring $10 million appropriated for the current year, this will provide state funds to the foundation established under the law you enacted in 2005, in order to leverage federal and gift funds for land purchases and easements re quired to conserve and protect our natural heritage. In addition, I recommend funds in this budget to eliminate State Parks access fees, returning these woods, lakes, and streams to the free access that the people had enjoyed for most of their lives. To promote principles of conservati on and environmental management among our youth in high school and college, I propose to estab lish a Tennessee Youth Conservation Corps, a summer program focused on environmental re search, resource management, conservation construction projects, and other educational activities. In addition, I recommend additional funds for state historic site operation and ma intenance and historical markers and for a non- recurring grant to the Country Music Hall of Fa me and Museum in Nashville, for collection preservation and exhibition. In the capital outlay budget, I recommend additional f unds for new visitors centers at the historic Carter House in Franklin and the New Johnsonville State Park and for new cabins at the David Crockett State Park in Lawrenceburg; for a gran t to the East Tennessee Historical Society in Knoxville, to assist in completion of a regional history museum; for a grant to assist in preservation of the Stencil House at the Heritage Village in Fayette and Hardeman counties; and for a grant, matching significantly more local a nd federal funds, to construct an Appalachia regional civic arts center in Maryville. Agriculture - Along with the additional funds to provide a full allocation of soil conservation funds from the real estate transfer tax, I r ecommend an additional $1 million in recurring funds for the farm improvement program. Along with the recurring $3 million provided in the base budget, these funds will promote herd health, alternative crop production, agribusiness, and marketing. Information Systems - I recommend additional funds for the enterprise resource planning project, a modern, integrated information system necessary for the administrative functions of state government, including human resources, payroll, financial management, and procurement. Salaries and Benefits - The salary policy recommendation for employees has three parts: a pay raise, salary compression adjustments for st ate employees, and classification-compensation adjustments in state job classes. The combinati on of salary policy funds for state employees is equivalent to the cost of a 3.1 percent salary in crease, if simply implemented across-the-board. But instead, I recommend that we invest two-thir ds of the funds in addressing the compression and classification-compensation issues. For state employees, the budget includes funds fo r a 1 percent salary increase on July 1, 2006. The second component will begin the process of a lleviating salary compression in a systematic manner, providing about one-third of the funds need ed to complete the plan. Salary compression xixexists in instances in which the salary diffe rence between newly hired employees and longer- term employees is too small. The additional cl assification-compensation salary adjustments will address the highest priority specific job classes that should be adjusted based on comparison with other state positions, other governmental units, and market salary rates. For higher education employees and K-12 teacher s and staff funded through the BEP formula, the budget includes funds for a 2 percent salary increase on July 1, 2006. In the higher education systems, the pay raise in the academic formul a units will be funded by tuition or other budget adjustments. Under the Tennessee Constitution, salaries of stat e judges may only be rebased at the beginning of a new eight-year judicial term. The budget includes funds to raise the pay of judges on September 1, 2006, to $140,000 for trial court judge s, to $145,000 for appeals court judges, and to $150,000 for justices of the S upreme Court. In addition, I recommend that the salaries of district attorneys general, public defenders, and the post-conviction defender be raised to $124,900 on September 1. I believe their salaries shoul d remain at the same ratio to trial judge salaries as now exists. The existing statutory inflationary pay adjustment for judges and the Attorney General is funded for two months, and the statutory step raises fo r assistant district attorneys, assistant public defenders, assistant post-conviction defenders, investigators, and Troopers are funded. In addition, the salary survey pay increases for Troopers and wildlife officers are fully funded. Recurring funds also are provided for the retiremen t system rate increase affecting state, higher education, and local education agencies on behalf of employees and for the state share of the group health insurance premium increases. Capital Outlay - Aside from the $202.3 million provided for higher education capital outlay projects and from the conservation capital outlay projects discussed above, the capital outlay budget includes a grant for the Memphis BioWorks research park; a grant for a new regional forensic center in Shelby County; and funds fo r prison expansions, a career development center in Carroll County, residential group homes for th e mentally retarded, planning to replace Lakeshore Mental Health Institute in K nox County, military facilities and renovations in Davidson, Decatur, and Blount counties, and maintenance of state facilities. Revenue Fluctuation Reserve - I am pleased to recommend an increase in the revenue fluctuation reserve for the fourth straight year. We were able to avoid any drawdown of this reserve at the close of the past three fiscal years. The rainy day fund stood at $178 million on June 30, 2003, at $275.4 million on June 30, 2005, a nd is budgeted to grow to $324.7 million on June 30, 2006. The $57.1 million deposit to the fund in 2006-2007 will raise this reserve to $381.8 million on June 30, 2007, which is $203.8 million more than four years earlier. Expanding this fund is an important priority in maintaining our fiscal credibility. The revenue fluctuation reserve allows services to be main tained when revenue growth is slower than estimated in the budget, mainly during economic downturns. We should maintain the fund for xxthat economic circumstance and use the opportunity we now have to build the reserve during an economic recovery. This budget is built from reasonable revenue estimates, based upon Funding Board advice and on careful program analysis and restraint. It is balanced, as the people have required through the Tennessee Constitution, and addresses our common prio rities and other issues of concern to the people. My staff and I look forward to working with the members of the General Assembly on this budget, the Appropriations Bill, related legislation, and other issues of interest to you. Sincerely, Phil Bredesen Governor of the State of Tennessee xxiiIn addition to the recurring state revenue growth and the funds available from base adjustments, other state revenues are expected to grow in th e current and next years, and a revenue surplus from 2004-2005 is available to help fund appropriation requirements in 2006-2007. The recommended budget fulfills your commitment to restore state-shared taxes to cities and counties and the real estate transfer tax to th e four land acquisition and soil conservation funds. The final share of the recurring state-shared taxes restoration requires $22 million. The budget proposes to take the third step in restoring th e real estate transfer tax to its intended land acquisition and agricultural conservation purposes. Along with the recurring funds in the base budget, an improvement of $6 million recurring and $6 million non-recurring funds makes a total of $24 million available to those funds in 2006-2007, of which $18 million is recurring. Although a transfer from the highway fund still is necessary, the recurring transfer to the general fund is reduced by $11 million to $54.8 million in 2006-2007, and the budget includes a transfer back to the highway fund of $11 million from non-recurring general fund availability. For K-12 education, the improvement from the general fund is $195.5 million, including $89.2 million to fully fund the Basic Education Program (BEP) formula for the 10th straight year, $6 million for the BEP 2 percent growth factor, a nd $20 million to fund additional at-risk students and English Language Learner programs through the formula. In addition, from the general fund, $20 million is added to further expand the pre-kindergarten program to an additional 250 classes for at-risk students; and the $25 m illion appropriation from the lottery for education account is continued fo r another year. The excess lottery proceeds are available after funding of higher education's proj ection of the scholarship requirements under the current lottery-funded scholarship program. Also for K-12 education program improvement s, the budget includes $1 million for start-up costs of a residential math and science high sc hool to open in fall 2007 at the University of Tennessee Space Institute in Tullahoma. The recurring $500,000 will provide debt service on bonds for dormitory construction, and the non -recurring $500,000 will fund start-up costs, such as lab and other equipment. An additional $3 million is recommended for growth in the number of disabled infants and toddl ers receiving early education intervention services; $680,000 is provided to expand the Governor's Books from Bi rth program to additional counties; and grants of $500,000 each are recommended for Future Farm ers of America, the 4-H Foundation, and Save the Children, for a literacy program. For higher education, the budget includes a recurring $4 million improvement, along with $2.5 million in the base budget, for the University of Tennessee (UT) research initiative, in 1:1 funding partnership with the Oak Ridge Nati onal Laboratory (ORNL), that will attract distinguished scholars in the sciences and e ngineering. The joint UT-ORNL appointments to these positions will be focused on neutron, biological, computational, and materials sciences. This is a multi-year initiative to upgrade the research strength of UT so that the 1,800 members of the National Academy of Science and the 1,900-member National Academy of Engineering will recognize distinguished achievement among UT faculty. Funding also is included in the xxiiicapital outlay budget for UT's research initiativ e. At the UT Knoxville campus, funds are provided for a new Joint Institute in Advanced Materials, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Aside from research, the operating budget in cludes non-recurring funds of $6.4 million to continue operating budget support of both university systems at the current level. Within the base level of funding available fo r several years, the recommended budget includes funds sufficient to fulfill Geier desegregation settlement commitments in 2006-2007. A base budget reduction of $1,870,900 is offset by an improvement recommendation of the same amount, in order to continue for a year the minority financial aid and stipend programs begun under the Geier program. As Geier funding is phased out, the Administration intends to recommend the continuation of the level of fi nancial support provided under the Geier program on a recurring basis, in order to provide funds directed toward equity and access initiatives in a unitary system of higher education. During the 2006 calendar year, the Administration and higher education staff will evaluate the effec tiveness of Geier programs and recommend a plan for use of the Geier funds in a post-Geier unitary status in 2007-2008 and succeeding fiscal years. The capital outlay budget for higher education provides $202.3 million from current funds and bonds to fund the first 10 projects recommende d by the Higher Education Commission and to fund maintenance of existing facilities. Cap ital projects are funded at $150.4 million from bonds and state current funds, and campus maintenance at $51.9 million. For economic development, the budget includes $20.7 million from non-recurring funds to support the jobs initiatives. From this amount, $6 million is to support relocation of the Nissan headquarters to Tennessee and $14.7 million is fo r the jobs package, including $14 million for the FastTrack infrastructure development a nd job training program and $700,000 for community development initiatives. The budget also pr ovides $4.75 million from non-recurring funds to continue in high-impact markets the advertis ing and promotion of Tennessee as a tourist destination. For safe communities, the budget includes a recurring improvement of $3.5 million for drug court programs. This includes $500,000 for th e Davidson County residential drug court program; $500,000 each for similar programs in Shelby, Knox, and Hamilton counties; and $1.5 million for other drug court programs. In add ition, $4 million from non-recurring state funds is recommended to match federal funds for communi cations interoperability, which will enhance homeland security and disaster response. The budget also includes $1.1 million to staff and equip an intelligence fusion center, which will provide the state the ability to analyze and disseminate to first responders information on emerging threats. The District Attorneys General budget includes an improvement of $1 million to provide additional operational, non-payroll funds to the DAs offices in Shelby, Davidson, Knox, and Hamilton counties. The state operating support in these urban districts has been minimal and has not been adjusted for many years. The Dist rict Public Defenders budget includes funds to maintain nine positions that otherwise would be abolished with expiring federal grants. xxiv The Correction Department budget requires a dditional funding of $13.8 million, including the $5 million for the cost of additional state felons in local jails; $5.5 million for prison service, medical, and mental health contract inflators; $1.8 million for the security staffing requirements of the new prison in Morgan County during th e construction; and $1.5 million for additional prison operational costs. In the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation budget, $1.3 million is added for forensic services, which will allow the TBI to retain nine positions that otherwise would be lost with expiring federal grants and to add nine positions to comple te forensic examinations more quickly. In the Military Department, $927,800 is recommended for maintenance and utility costs at National Guard armories and Air National Guard facilitie s and to fund overhead costs disallowed for federal reimbursement. The Department of Sa fety budget includes funds for additional police officers who will receive training-incentive pay s upplements, for increased facility lease costs, and for reimbursement to county clerks for the increased number of vehicle titles being issued. For child welfare, the budget includes $250,000 for grants of $50,000 each to five additional Child Advocacy Centers, bringing the total suppor ted with grants to 34. These centers are locally supported and coordinate local and state ag encies in the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases. In addition, $135,000 is reco mmended for $15,000 grants to nine additional counties wanting to participate in the Cour t Appointed Special Advocate program, which recruits, trains, and supervises volunteers who assist children in state custody. In the Department of Children's Services budge t, an improvement of $13.2 million from state funds and $25.7 million including federal and Te nnCare funds, is recommended, including funds for the third year of the plan to increase case mana ger salaries to the Southeast average, for foster care and adoption assistance reimbursement rate in creases of 6.2 percent, for adoption assistance case growth, for a residential provider rate incr ease averaging 2 percent, for social worker training, for community resource assessments, for psychologist services, and for higher education financial aid to children aging out of state foster care. For senior citizens, the budget includes a state-funde d improvement of $800,000 in the Commission on Aging and Disability to serve an additional 200 individuals in the home and community based services program for the non-Medicaid eligible and $250,000 for additional operating support of the senior citizen centers . In the TennCare budget, an additional $6.4 million, including $2.3 million from state funds, is recommended for the home and community based services program. This includes funds for a 4.17 percent increase in the per diem rate for PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), 250 additional slots for the Senior/Shelby waiver, and 225 additional slots for the ADAPT waiver (American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today). In the Mental Retardation budget, the base state appropriation is reduced by the transition of some clients from 100 percent state-funded servi ces, and the savings are transferred to TennCare in order to provide Medicaid waiver services to the clients. In addition, the TennCare budget includes a non-recurring improvement of $66.4 million, including $24.1 million from state xxvappropriations, to facilitate the transition to TennC are waiver services, as the Division of Mental Retardation develops and implements plans to control costs. For public health, the budget includes significant improve ments in the TennCare budget, but the budget recommendation for 2006-2007 is within the goal you set for the share of state revenue that TennCare consumes: In 2006-2007, TennCare consumes 25.6 percent of estimated Department of Revenue tax collections compared with 26.3 percent in the current year. On a recurring expenditure and revenue basis, the comp arison is 25.3 percent in both the current year and 2006-2007. TennCare improvements for ne xt year total $324.8 million, including $115.4 million from state appropriations. The improveme nts include funds for open enrollment in the medically needy program and to allow less restric tive eligibility criteria, to extend eligibility for children under age one by increasing the fede ral poverty criterion from 185 percent to 200 percent, for a 2.5 percent rate increase for provi ders, for growth in expenditures in private intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, for 2.2 percent enrollment growth, for a 1 percent rate increase for long-term care, for the home and community based services discussed above, and for the TennCare share of improvement s in the departments of Children's Services and Human Services and the Division of Mental Retardation Services. The Health Care Safety Net, established in th e current year to ease the transition of persons losing TennCare coverage due to reform and cost -control efforts, includes recurring base funds of $76.9 million in 2006-2007 and an improvement of $23.4 million, including $13.18 million recurring and $10.25 million non-recurring. The additional recurring funds include $11.3 million to annualize the cost of 234 primary care positions established in the Department of Health and additional funds for safety net case management and a call center and for the Shelby County health care program. The additional non-recurring funds are for donated bulk pharmacy, regional specialty networks, and other transitional costs. In the Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, $319,100 is recommended to continue a housing program and a school-based violence prevention program, despite the loss of federal funds. In the Department of Human Services, the budget includes a recurring improvement of $2.5 million for the standard of need inflationary in crease in the Families First (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) program. This is a 2.2 percent increase in the standard of need, which will allow 924 families to remain qualified or qualif y for the program. The Human Services budget also includes a non-recurring improvement of $5.2 million, including $2.3 million from state funds, to continue the family assistance center in Memphis for another year. From federal funds, the budget also funds four additional rehabilitati on instructor positions to provide independent living services to older blind individuals. For conservation, in addition to the restoration of the real estate transfer tax to the land acquisition and soil conservation funds at the $24 million level, discussed above, the budget includes an additional non-recurring appropriation of $10 million for the Heritage Conservation Trust Fund. In addition, the budget includes $1.1 million, including $924,000 recurring, to eliminate State Parks access fees, effectiv e July 1, 2006; $350,000 to establish a summer xxviTennessee Youth Conservation Corps for high sc hool and college-age youth; $1 million for the cost of environmental testing in the state laboratory; $368,400 for the Historical Commission for historic site operation and maintenance and historical markers; $251,000 to begin addressing State Parks housing policy; and $100,000 each for Tims Ford State Park and the Natural Heritage program to maintain operations that are losing federal and other departmental revenues. The total operating budget improvement recommendation for the Department of Environment and Conservation is $18.1 million from state appropria tions, including its share of the real estate transfer tax funds for land acquisition. In th e capital outlay budget, the recommendation for this department is $6.1 million from current funds and bonds, including funds for new visitors centers at the historic Carter House in Fra nklin and the New Johnsonville State Park, for new cabins at David Crockett State Park, and fo r work at the Cordell Hull Birthplace and Montgomery Bell State Park. For agriculture, along with a full allocation of soil cons ervation funds from the real estate transfer tax, the budget includes an additional recurring $1 million for the farm improvement program. Combined with the $3 million provided in the base budget, these funds will promote herd health, alternative crop production, agribusiness, and marketing. For information systems development, the budget includes an appropriation of $28.1 million for the enterprise resource planning project, whic h will provide a modern, integrated system for the administrative functions of state government , including human resources, payroll, financial management, and procurement. The appropr iation includes $15.1 million in non-recurring funds and $13 million in recurring funds, which will pr ovide debt service on $81.3 million in 10-year bonds. In addition, in the budget of the Comptroller of the Treasury, $1.6 million in non-recurring funds is provided for re-development and integration of a statewide property tax assessment and appraisal information system, supporting current state and local government functions. Salary improvement for employees has three parts: a pay raise, salary compression adjustments for state employees, and classification-compensa tion adjustments in state job classes. The combination of salary policy funds for state employ ees is equivalent to the cost of a 3.1 percent salary increase, if simply implemented across- the-board. But instead, this budget invests two- thirds of the funds in addressing the compression and classification-compensation issues. For state employees, the budget includes funds fo r a 1 percent salary increase on July 1, 2006. The second component will begin the process of a lleviating salary compression in a systematic manner, providing about one-third of the funds need ed to complete the plan. Salary compression exists in instances in which the salary diffe rence between newly hired employees and longer- term employees is too small. The additional cl assification-compensation salary adjustments will address the highest priority specific job classes that should be adjusted based on comparison with other state positions, other governmental units, and market salary rates. For higher education employees and K-12 teacher s and staff funded through the BEP formula, the budget includes funds for a 2 percent salary increase on July 1, 2006. In the higher education xxviisystems, the pay raise in the academic formul a units will be funded by tuition or other budget adjustments. The complete salary package described above costs $88.8 from general fund revenues. The percentage pay raises cost $61.8 million, including $19.4 million for state and higher education employees and $42.4 million for K-12 teachers. For the salary compression adjustments for state employees, the budget includes $20 million, and fo r the classification-compensation salary adjustments, $7 million. Under the Tennessee Constitution, salaries of stat e judges may only be rebased at the beginning of a new eight-year judicial term. The budget includes funds to raise the pay of judges on September 1, 2006, to $140,000 for trial court judge s, to $145,000 for appeals court judges, and to $150,000 for justices of the Supreme Court. The recommendation also includes an additional $5,000 adjustment for the Chief Justice and an additional $2,500 adjustment for the presiding judges of the two appeals courts. Funds also are included for the associated raises for the Attorney General and Reporter and the Administrativ e Director of the Courts. In addition, funds are provided to adjust salaries of district attorneys general, public defenders, and the post- conviction defender to $124,900 on September 1, keeping their salaries at the same ratio to trial judge salaries as now exists. The cost of this recommendation is $6 million, which is the recurring annual cost when combined with the funds from the two-month statutory pay raise these positions will receive on July 1. The statutory step raises for assistant district attorneys, assistant public defenders, assistant post- conviction defenders, investigators, and Troopers are funded. In addition, the salary survey pay increases for Troopers and wildlife officers are fully funded. Recurring funds of $63.6 million are provided for the July 1, 2006 retirement contribution rate increase affecting state, higher education, and local education agencies on behalf of employees. For the state share of group health insurance premium increases, the budget includes $20.7 million for state employees and higher education, and in the Department of Education budget, $11.3 million. The capital outlay budget totals $354.6 million, including $61.8 million from non-recurring state current funds, $248.9 million from bonds , $19.9 million from federal funds, and $24 million from other sources. This includes the $202.3 million for higher education and funds for the State Parks capital outlay, both discussed above . Other capital projects include additional minimum security housing at the West Tennessee State Prison and Turney Center, planning of a new Lakeshore Mental Health Institute, 25 resi dential group homes for the mentally retarded, renovation of Tennessee Emergency Management Agency operations and control centers in Nashville, and a new Army aviation support facility in Blount County. Capital maintenance for state facilities requires $34.4 million, excluding higher education maintenance cited above. In addition, the budget includes capital outlay grants of $3.5 million for the Memphis BioWorks research park; $5 million for a regional forensic center in Shelby County; $2.5 million for the East Tennessee Historical Society regional hi story museum; $2 million for an Appalachia regional civic arts center in Maryville; $1 m illion for the Country Music Hall of Fame and xxviiiMuseum, which will be reallocated in the appr opriations bill as a non-recurring operational grant to support preservation and exhibition of th e collection; and $100,000 to the Hobart Ames Foundation for preservation of the Stencil Hous e, at the Ames Plantation in Fayette and Hardeman counties. The facilities revolving fund capital budget provide s an additional $72.2 million for projects and maintenance of state office buildings and sim ilar facilities maintained through agency rent payments. ` Recommended program improvements and capital outla y projects are explained in detail in the Budget Document. In addition, volume 2 of the budget, presents the performance-based budget of nine agencies and supplementary information about the budget and about many programs. The overappropriation - or the amount by which ge neral fund agencies must underspend - is set at $76.6 million in both the current year and the 2006-2007 recommended budget The revenue fluctuation reserve currently is at $275.4 million and is budgeted to increase to $324.7 million at June 30, 2006. The 2006-2007 Budget pr oposes that this reserve be raised by $57.1 million to $381.8 million at June 30, 2007. The proposed deposit satisfies the statutory requirement that the recommended budget include an amount equal to 10 percent of state tax revenue growth for deposit to this reserve. The re venue fluctuation reserve allows services to be maintained when revenue growth is slower than estimated in the budget, mainly during economic downturns. With a recovering econom y and spending under control, we should use this opportunity to continue building this rainy day fund. I recommend that you advise the General Assembly to remain conservative in estimating revenues and to retain the recommended increase for the revenue fluctuation reserve. Respectfully Submitted, M. D. Goetz, Jr. Commissioner of Finance and Administration xxix Administration Priorities During his first three years as Governor of the State of Tennessee, Phil Bredesen has established the state's fiscal footing through budget discipline and tighter management of our state's resources. For the fourth year in a row, he is submitting to the General Assembly a balanced, sensible and well-rounded budget with no new taxes. A fiscally balanced budget is important, but so is a budget that balan ces all of the state's priorities for the benefit of all Tennesseans. This budget does that. With the completion of difficult reforms to TennCare, the state ha s finally turned a corner and moved from a fiscal crisis to financial stability. For the second cons ecutive year, the Governor's Recommended Budget includes more new m oney in education than in TennCare. The Governor's priorities again focus on making education our state's fundamental priority. In addition, the Governor will make continued improvements in the way Tennessee provides health care coverage to t hose who need it; continued investments in job creation and economic development; and add itional investments to ensure the safety of our communities. He believes strongly that state government cannot do everything and that it must continue to develop innovative partnerships with local governments, businesses, civic groups, religi ous groups and individuals to better serve our citizens. Education One year after kicking off a new initiativ e to expand voluntary Pr e-K classrooms across the state, Governor Bredesen will conti nue building upon that pr ogress with significant new investments toward a longterm goal of a strong, high quality Pre-K program for all 4-year-olds in Tennessee. Governor Bred esen believes that pr oviding all children - particularly at-risk children - the opportunity to learn basic skills earlier can change the course of hundreds of thousands of lives. The Governor will also continue his focu s on improving K-12 education by fully funding the Basic Education Program. Governor Bred esen believes we must continue to fully fund K-12 education and focus on teacher pa y, meaningful professional development, and intensive intervention for struggling students. With this in mind, Governor Bredesen will in crease BEP funding for at-risk and English language learning students acro ss the state; continue inve stments in the Governor's xxx Books from Birth Foundation to promote early childhood reading; and continue investing in Teach Tennessee - a program he created to recruit highly trained professionals to the teaching profession. Governor Bredesen also will take the first steps in establishing a residential school for math and science in Tennessee. Math and science education is critical to recruiting and reta ining high-quality jobs for hardworking citizens in an increasingly knowledge-based, high-tech economy. Health Care Last year, the Governor ma de significant reforms to TennCare, the state's expanded Medicaid program providing health insura nce coverage to more than one million Tennesseans. While the final reform proposal was not the one the Governor initially fought for, he was left no choice and he t ook the most responsible path given the legal and economic circumstances facing the state. Governor Bredesen has worked during the last year, with bipartisan support from the Tennessee General Assembly, to maintain he alth insurance coverage for the state's sickest and neediest citizens, and taken steps to dramatically improve the state's health care safety net program. After three years of dealing with the fiscal realities of TennCare, we have turned a corner in addres sing health care in Tennessee. With this progress, the state is now in the process of developing an entirely new health care program - one which would be completely autonomous from TennCare - aimed at addressing the needs of 600,000 Tennesseans currently without health insurance. Jobs and the Economy Governor Bredesen believes creating more and better job opportunities is a key to improving life in Tennessee. He will conti nue to focus on job creation with a goal of \"modernizing the tool kit we use to sustain and build new industry in Tennessee.\" That includes continued investments in Tennessean s through training and re-training workers for the jobs of tomorrow, creating new initi atives for small busi nesses, and by expanding the state's broadband infrastructure to foster co mpetitiveness for new industry statewide. Tennessee must diversify in order to compet e in a rapidly changing economy. Governor Bredesen created a Jobs Cabine t to coordinate efforts at the highest levels of state government to create better-paying, higher- skilled jobs for working Tennesseans and created an Office of Diversity Business Enterp rise to serve as a point of service and information clearinghouse for small busine sses, including minority- and women-owned businesses. These initiatives continue to bear fruit in our state with 71,000 new jobs created in the last three years. Safe Communities One issue Governor Bredesen will put a renewed focus on during the next year is preparedness. In Tennessee, we have seen a number of emergencies on both the local and statewide level. But in the wake of Hu rricane Katrina and the devastating impact it had on people, individual states and the nation, we must add focus to preparing xxxi Tennessee for potential large-scale disasters. An adequate emergency response, whether the cause is manmade or natural, requ ires coordination and cooperation between stakeholders at the local, state and federal levels. The Governor ha s included significant state money to ensure that all of our firs t responders can communicate immediately in a disaster. Methamphetamine abuse is a clear and present danger to the future of our state and we are working quickly to defeat this plague . Governor Bredesen signed comprehensive legislation in 2005 to broaden the state's at tack on methamphetamine abuse. We have seen significant result s since this legislation took effect , including a 50 percent decrease in the number of meth lab busts across the state. Governor Bredesen will continue his focus on reducing the meth problem in Tenne ssee, ensuring the health and safety of Tennessee communities. State of Tennessee The Budget Document Introduction xxxiii Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 9-4- 5106, requires that the financial plan of Tennessee's state government be presented in four parts: 1. Financial Policy - The state's financial policy, contrasting the relationships between expenditures and revenues from all sources that are estimated for the ensuing fiscal year, with the corresponding figures for the latest completed fiscal year and the fiscal year in progress; and a budget summary; 2. State Appropriations and Taxes, Excluding Dedicated Funds - Appropriations and tax estimates from general state tax sources, excluding appropriations from dedicated tax sources; this is the so-called \"State Taxpayers Budget\"; 3. Detailed Budget Estimates - Estimates of expenditures and revenues, including all funding sources; program statements and performance measures; statement of the state's bonded indebtedness, detailing redemption requirements until retirement, the net and gross debt of the state, and condition of the sinking fund; and 4. Appropriations Bill and Other Budget Bills - The General Appropriations Bill, through which the General Assembly gives legal sanction to the financial plan it adopts. Upon passage, this bill appropriates by agency and fund the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year. The revenues by which these expenditures are financed also are detailed in this bill. In addition, other bills required to give legal sanction to the financial plan must be filed. Parts one, two, and three are included in the Budget Document. The format of the Budget Document is reviewed annually for clarity and content. Part four, the Appropriations Bill and other budget legislation, such as the Bond Authorization Bill, are separate documents. The \"Introduction\" section of the Budget Document begins with transmittal letters from the Governor to the General Assembly and from the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to the Governor. These letters summarize the policy and financial recommendations included in the document. Following the transmittal letters is a statement of the Administration's priorities. The next section of the Budget Document, entitled \"Budget Overview,\" is a brief summary of the total budget. This overview is a series of charts and schedules that summarize the Budget. The total state budget and the General Fund budget are represented by pie charts that detail each major tax and each functional area for the recommended budget. Tennessee's current tax structure has the majority of its tax revenue coming from the sales tax, the largest portion of which funds education. The overview schedules clarify and detail the expenditures, revenue sources, and personnel requirements of state government. The Budget Document has several total budget schedules comparing programs by funding source and showing how those funds are derived. Also included are tables that list, by department, the improvements proposed for the next fiscal year. There are two charts that provide the total fund balance available, indicating the appropriation requirements and the General Fund and Education Fund revenues and The Budget Document xxxiv reserves available to meet that need: \"General Fund and Education Fund, Comparison of Appropriation Requirements and State Revenues\" for the current year and next (or recommended budget) year. The two charts show how the budget is balanced against General Fund and Education Fund tax revenues for the two fiscal years. Because of its dedicated funding sources, the Department of Transportation's appropriation requirements and revenue sources are stated on a separate chart. All agencies and departments are included in the summary comparison schedules by program and funding source. Other schedules provide detail on the supplemental appropriations required to maintain programs in the current fiscal year, the Constitutional spending limitation requirement, and a summary of personnel and funding for all state agencies and higher education institutions. The Budget Document also includes an historical analysis of the effect on the state budget of federal aid tr ends and federally mandated costs. The section entitled \"State Tax Revenues\" presents state tax revenue estimates for the ensuing fiscal year, compared with actual collections for the previous year and the revised estimate for the current year. This section explains the various sources of revenue, by collecting agency, and the statutory apportionment among the various funds: the General Fund, Education Fund, Highway Fund, Sinking (or Debt Service) Fund, and Cities and Counties Fund. Included in the \"Financial Statements\" section are the comparative balance sheets for the General Fund, Education Fund, and Highway Fund as of June 30 for the two prior years. This schedule is followed by the expenditures and requirements of the Debt Service Fund for the previous, current, and subsequent fiscal years. A Debt Service Fund comparative balance sheet also is included.The status of the various authorized and unissued bonds is given in a schedule of bonds and appropriations made for capital purposes in lieu of bond issuance. The statement of bonded indebtedness presents the retirement schedule for the state's bonded debt. The cost of outstanding bonds is reflected as principal and interest. The proposed capital outlay for the ensuing fiscal year is included within the \"Capital Outlay Program\" section. Specific projects are shown for each department impacted, along with capital maintenance. Whether from current funds of the general fund, the sale of general obligation bonds, or from other sources, the proposed funding for each project is indicated. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" section is included to distinguish between state appropriations from general state taxes and appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees, which are narrowly levied and earmarked for specific purposes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes the dedicated funds, federal revenues, and other departmental revenues; it reports only appropriations from general state tax sources, along with estimates of the general taxes. Except for the \"State Taxpayers Budget,\" all of the other summary charts and program statements in this Budget Document that deal with appropriations in clude appropriations from all state sources, both general taxes and dedicated taxes and fees. The major portion of the Budget Document is \"Program Statements by Functional Area.\" For presentation in the Budget Document, departments and agencies with related missions, programs, goals, and objectives are grouped, resulting in six functional areas. This enables legislators, policy-makers, and citizens to have a better concept of the magnitude and costs of services provided through the various functional areas of state government. At the beginning of each functional presentation is an introduction to the The Budget Document xxxv associated agencies, followed by a list of the improvement items that are recommended for that area of state government. The improvement list is followed by tables that show the total expenditures, funding sources, and personnel of each functional area. The activities and responsibilities of the departments and agencies are explained through narrative descriptions of each program. Following this narrative, fiscal and personnel data are provided for the last completed year, the current year, and the next year. The next-year estimates include the level of funding and number of positions for the recommended base budget, program improvements, and the total recommended. Volume 2 of the Budget Document, \"Performance-Based Budget for Selected Agencies and Supplementary Information,\" includes a budget process explanation; a basis of budgeting and accounting explanation; a Tennessee characteristics chart; and a Tennessee program history, focused on children, education, economic opportunity, public health, homeland security, and natural resources; the performance-based budget for agencies officially ph ased into performance- based budgeting; program performance measures for most agencies not officially phased into performance-based budgeting; and other program information for most agencies.

The Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current economic conditions and expectations for short-term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" This brief section places the budget outlook in the context of state and national economic conditions. Strong economic conditions generally translate into improved revenue performance and less pressure on government programs like welfare, while a weak economy has the opposite effects. For more information on the outlook for the state and national economies, please see \" An Annual Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee .\" Recent Economic Conditions - The two most recent calendar years have helped solidify growth for both the state and national economies following an anemic period of expans ion in the aftermath of the 2001 recession. Most indicators now point to broad-based growth across most areas of the economy. The most important economic news for the last year was the incr ease in energy prices and a record-breaking hurricane season. These two events will have a lasting impact on the economy. While gasoline prices have retreated from their peak in the fall, natural gas prices remain high and are eating into business profits and household disposable income. Rebuilding in the wake of the hurricanes that hit the US has contributed to rising building material costs. And states like Tennessee have made a concerted effort to provide relief to those displaced by hurricanes. Higher interest rates certainly warrant attention even though they did not grab the headlines. The Federal Reserve once again raised interest rates in December, the thirteenth increase dating back to summer of 2004. These rate increases will help stave off acceleration in the rate of inflation over the next couple of years. State fiscal affairs finally stabilized in calendar year 2005 following several years of revenue weakness. Most states had little difficulty bringing budgets into balance at the close of fiscal year 2004-05. Since that time revenue performance generally has been quite strong. The nation enjoyed job growth of 1.6 percent in 2005, well ahead of the 1.0 percent pace of job growth for the state economy. Tennessee's rate of job loss in manufacturing was, however, better than the rate of decline for the national economy. Job growth has generally been concentrated in the various service sectors which continue to rise in relative importance. Nominal personal income growth for 2005 totaled 5.7 percent for Tennessee and 5.4 for the US. Short-term Economic Outlook - The overall outlook for the state and the national economies calls for continued expa nsion through 2008. US nominal gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity available, is projected to advance at a 6.0 percent rate in 2006, slightly lower than the 6.4 percent rate of growth that prevailed in 2005. Growth is expected to slow to 4.8 percent in 2007. Job growth for the nation is expected to be up 1.5 percent in 2006 and yield an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent. The nation's manufacturing job base will continue to contract with a 0.3 percent setback, matching the decline in 2005. The prime interest rate is forecast at 7.7 and 7.8 percent in 2006 and 2007. Inflation, as measured by the chained price index for gross domestic product, will slow to 2.5 percent in 2006 relative to 2.7 percent growth in 2005. The Tennessee economy will be buoyed by the performance of its national counterpart. Expect nominal personal income to grow 5.5 percent in both 2006 and 2007. On a fiscal year basis personal income is projected to rise 5.3 percent in 2005-06 and 5.6 percent in 2006-07. Tennessee's rate of nonfarm job growth in 2006 (1.2 percent) will lag the nation. The state unemployment rate should fall to 5.3 percent in 2006 versus the 5.6 percent rate that prevailed in 2005.

State of Tennessee Federal Aid Trends and Federal Mandate Costs Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2006 - 2007 Since fiscal year 1979-80, federal aid to Tennessee excluding Food Stamps, Medicaid, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) grants, formerly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), has declined from 27 cents of every dollar in the state budget to 21 cents in 2006-2007. If the state were still receiving 27 cents of every budgeted dollar as federal aid, an additional $866.1 million would be available in federal funds. In constant (2006-2007) dollars, federal aid has increased by 91.7 percent, or $1.7 billion, from 1979-80 to 2006-2007 for state programs other than Food Stamps, Medicaid, and TANF/AFDC grants. Figure 1 and Table 1 show the constant (2006-2007) dollar trend in federal aid in the state budget since 1979-80 for all programs, including transportation. Amounts for fiscal years 1979-80 through 2004-2005 are based on actual federal aid collections; amounts for 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 are based on estimates included in the recommended state budget. Current dollars have been converted to real (constant) dollars using the gross domestic product implicit price deflator, as reported by the University of Tennessee, Center for Business and Economic Research. The decline in federal aid in the early 1980s (Figure 1) reflects the elimination of federal revenue sharing for states, new federal restrictions on eligibility for the TANF/AFDC program, and the con-solidation of several federal grant programs into block grants at reduced levels. From 1988-89 to 2006- 2007, all the programs other than TANF/AFDC have had real growth. This reflects congressional decisions in the late 1980s to relax the earlier federal deficit-control statutes, which had restrained the growth of domestic discretionary programs during the 1980s. As shown in Figure 1, not until 1992-93 does \"all other\" federal aid, excluding Medicaid, TANF/AFDC grants, and Food Stamps, return to the real-dollar level available to the state in 1979-80. Reflecting recent domestic initiatives, the growth rate for this federal aid category had steadily increased 1980 82 84 86 88 1990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04 06TANF/AFDCFood StampsMedicaidAll OtherTotal0123456Figure 1 Federal Aid Trend in State Programs FY 1980 through FY 2007 in Billions of Constant (2006-2007) Dollarsthrough 2005-2006, in spite of federal budget-balancing efforts. In 2006-2007, \"all other\" federal aid, excluding Food Stamps, Medicaid, and TANF/AFDC, shows a constant dollar decrease compared with 2005-2006. This decline is because of non-recurring federal aid for Hurricane Katrina relief in the current year ($100 million) and the completion of some major federal aid highway projects ($92.3 million decline). Excluding these two areas, other federal aid programs generally are experiencing modest growth. Over the 27-year period, Medicaid, the major federal entitlement program in the state budget, has had real growth well above the rate of inflation. Although total federal aid has increased in constant dollars by 187.8 percent from 1979-80 to 2006-2007, the 670.1 percent real growth in the Medicaid program is accompanied by real growth of only 91.7 percent in federal aid for all other state programs, excluding Food Stamps and TANF/AFDC. A constant dollar increase of 66.0 percent in federal aid for the Food Stamps program since 1979-80 is related to recent trends in caseload and inflation. TANF/AFDC had a constant dollar decrease of 18.1 percent. Over the 27-years, as shown in Table 1, real growth for all federal aid to state programs has averaged 4.0 percent per year. This growth above the rate of inflation has been led by the 7.9 percent annual-average real growth in the Medicaid program. TANF/AFDC decreased by 0.7 percent, while Food Stamps increased by 1.9 percent and all other federal aid increased by 2.4 percent on an annual- average basis. Over the last 18 years of the period, from 1988-89 through 2006-2007, real growth in total federal aid has increased above the longer-term growth rates. Total federal aid to state programs has grown at an 18-year annual-average rate of 5.8 percent. Real growth in this period has averaged 7.5 percent per year for Medicaid and 4.3 percent per year in Food Stamps, while TANF/AFDC decreased by 0.9%. All other federal aid has grown at a real-dollar rate of 5.0 percent per year. The 2006-2007 decline in the Medicaid match rate will result in increased state costs for federal mandates (Figure 2). Medicaid accounts for 82 percent of the $473.6 million state mandate cost in the 2006-2007 fiscal year.

While federal aid as a percentage of discretionary program funding has declined in the state budget since 1979-80, federal legislation in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and mid-2000s has imposed increasingly costly mandates on state government. By fiscal year 2006-2007, provisions imposed since 1986-87 will cost $473.6 million per year in recurring state appropriations from General Fund tax sources. The cumulative state cost in 2004- 2005 was $295.4 million and in 2005-2006 is $390.9 million. Figure 2 illustrates the annual recurring state cost, from General Fund tax sources, of new federal mandates beginning in fiscal year 1986-87. Costly major Medicaid mandates imposed since 1986-87 (Figure 3) are expanded services under the 1988 catastrophic health care law; coverage of children aged one through 18 under 1989 and 1990 laws; payment of premiums and deductibles for poor Medicare clients under a 1990 law; Medicare premium increases beginning in 2002-2003; Medicare cost sharing affecting the state in 2005-2006 and 2006-2007; increase in the minimum wage for the nursing home program under a 1989 law; increases in the state Medicaid match rate as personal income increases; expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the 1988 federal welfare reform law; drug purchasing reform under a 1990 law; and the loss of federal funds matching institute for the mentally diseased (IMD) expenditures for acute inpatients aged 21 to 64. Other Medicaid mandates include the 1988 nursing home reform initiative and the expansion of the child disability standard under the 1990 \"Zebley\" court ruling on supplemental security income regulations. Major federal mandates imposed in other programs since fiscal year 1986-87 (Figure 4) include expansion of AFDC eligibility and support services under the 1988 federal welfare reform law; exemption from the sales tax of food stamps and supplemental foods for women, infants, and children; increases in the state match rate for the former AFDC program; intervention services for handicapped infants and toddlers in the K-12 education system; extensions of federal social security and Medicare payroll taxes under the 1990 federal budget act; national standards under the commercial drivers license law; and other items of lesser fiscal impact affecting several state agencies. For purposes of this analysis, the term \"federal mandates\" is limited to provisions of federal law or regulation which require state government implementation, without option to the state. This includes mandatory new programs, changes in existing federal programs, and increases in state financial participation in jointly funded federal programs resulting from decreases in federal match rates.

A-76 State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Introduction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2006-2007 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources. The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, forfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long-run forecasts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid-summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October a nd November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates are based on estimated retail sales activity, which is provided by the Center for Business and Economic Research. Corporate excise tax estimates are made as late as possible in the year to take advantage of the latest available corporate profit forecasts for the nation and the October state tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue, which provide information useful in projecting quarterly estimated corporate tax payments through the next year. Estimates for selective excise taxes are commonly based on long-run consumption trends for the selectively-taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Long-run trend analysis is also used as a basis for projecting corporate excise and franchise tax collections and Tennessee Valley Authority in lieu of tax payments. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees are estimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles (especially the truck-related components of both taxes). The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires using national and state economic forecasts, developing an official revenue estimate, monitoring and monthly reporting on revenue coll ections, and revising estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9-4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transmitted to the General Assembly in the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, his own staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Board. The Funding Board, which is composed of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is assisted in preparing its range of revenue growth estimates by economists from the state's universities, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff of the Department of Finance and Administration, Department of Revenue, and the Treasurer's Office. The Funding Board prepares and recommends a range of revenue growth estimates using the information provided by the economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff. The Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The growth estimates provide a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, recommendation of revenue estimates in the Budget is the responsibility of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letter notifying the Governor and the chairmen of the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included in the following subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This letter states the economic assumptions affecting the Funding Board's recommendations. A more detailed economic overview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\" section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the Budget Document are shown in a following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" These taxes include not only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes), but also those collected and deposited to the General Fund by some other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. In the revenue estimate charts, the latter are shown by collecting agency and are subtotaled as \"other state revenue.\" Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years, three charts are included to show the collections distributed by fund. The funds on the distribution charts, for Budget Document presentation, are General Fund, Education (Trust) Fund, Highway (Transportation) Fund, Debt Service Fund, and Cities and Counties (Local Government Fund). (For information about the inclusion of certain Special Revenue Fund taxes and fees in the General Fund estimates, see the \"Budget Overview\" subsection entitled \"Basis of Budgeting and Accounting.\") Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, with the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, institutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departmental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non-governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and charges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants-in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations , corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmental revenues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. Information presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencies, based on current law. The tax revenue estimates proposed in this Budget are provided in the following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by law as it existed last year for 2004-2005 actual revenue and as it exists currently for 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 estimates. Following that subsection is a subsection detailing so-called tax expe nditures, which reports on major tax exemptions provided by law. Comparison Statement of State Revenues Actual and Estimated July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2007 Revenue apportionment in this section is based on current law. The 2006-2007 Budget and related revenue legislation propose the full restorat ion of state-shared taxes to the cities and counties fund.

This section of the Budget Document is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the tax expenditure report is required to \"...identify all exemptions, to the extent that it is practical, and estimate the amount of revenue which would have been collected by the state in the fiscal year commencing on July 1 next succeeding such report had each exemption not existed.\" The report on vendor compensation is required to show the amount paid to vendors for the collection of the sales tax. No format or reporting period is specified. Both reports are to be made no later than February 1 of each year. Vendors compensation for collection of the sales tax was repealed, effective July 1, 2000, by Public Acts of 2000, chapter 983. Thus, no report is made on vendors compensation. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non-profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramatically. Such institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individua l retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1-A and 1-B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for FY 2006-2007. Table 1-A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1-B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code.

It was created by the 45th General Assembly through passage of Public Chapter 126, Public Acts of 1887, codified as Title 9, Chapter 9, Section 101 of the Tennessee Code. By statute, the state's full faith and credit, as well as specific tax revenues are pledged for the payment of principal and interest on state bonds. Additionally, the law covenants that such pledged revenues shall not be less than 150 percent of the amount necessary to service the state's outstanding debt and any debt proposed to be issued. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, the debt limit calculation produced a maximum annual debt service debt limit of $517,857,356. The annual debt service requirement on the state's outstanding debt, authorized but unissued debt, and proposed bond authorizations in the fiscal year 2006-2007 budget, total $217,126,000, well below the maximum legal limit. The statutory debt limitation, therefore, provides for a substantial amount of additional debt capacity. Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conservative debt management practices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. Such practices include funding a portion of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancellation of bond authorizations in lieu of issuing debt, creating and maintaining a \"Rainy Day Fund\" to offset unanticipated revenue shor tfalls, and the adoption of state statutes designed to control the issuance of excessive debt. The state continues to maintain a relative low debt burden, and access to the capital markets remains strong. Tennessee's commitment to conservative and prudent debt ma nagement is widelyrecognized by the nation's leading debt-rating agencies. Current ratings on the state's general obligation long-term debt are: Fitch AA, Standard and Poor's AA, and Moody's Investor Service Aa2. The state sold $145 million in general obligation bonds in the second quarter of this fiscal year. No additional general obligation bond sales are anticipated prior to the close of this fiscal period. As of June 30, 2005, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtedness was $903,239,000, excluding the Facilities Revolving Fund. This debt was issued entirely for institutional and building construction. The first session of the 104th General Assembly approved new authorizations in the amount of $413,390,000. Of this amount, institutional and building bonds accounted for $257,390,000 and highway bonds for $156,000,000. The practice of using the state's cash flow to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the key fact ors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long-standing policy, the Funding Board, cancelled $82.5 million in highway bond authorizations and $2.3 million in institutional and buildin g construction bonds in the first six months of this fiscal period. The increase in bond authorization coupled with the Funding Board's action on bond cancellations reduced the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1,683,009,000, which includes $800,000,000 in highway authorizations, $727,092,000 in capital construction bonds, and $91,416,000 in Facilities Revolving Fund bonds. The 2006-2007 proposed capital budget recommends the authorization of an additional $83.5 million in highway construction bonds, $248.9 million in institutio nal and building bonds, and $43.8 million in F acilities Revolving Fund bonds. It also includes $61.8 million in surplus cash to fund capital maintenance and projects.

A-116 State of Tennessee Capital Budget Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2006 - 2007 The Capital Budget process begins with the receipt of departmental and agency capital main-tenance and project requests. The various agen-cies and departments annually submit their capi-tal requests in priority order to the Department of Finance and Administration, Division of Budget. Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, three phases of review are undertaken by the Di-vision of Capital Projects and Real Property Management and the Division of Budget. The initial phase allows for an understanding of the need by the Capital Projects and Real Property Management and Budget review teams. Phase two is built upon the technical requirements of the capital request, involving on-site visits by the review teams. The final phase involves financial review. The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are reviewed within projected avail-ability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insuffi-cient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The Administration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the impetus for all capital outlay requirements. Facilities funded through the capital budget process should sup-port program and service requirements. There-fore, funding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs. The goal is to find the best mix of new capital outlay and facility maintenance in order to sustain and implement programs and services. The management of facilities should be flexible enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and fu-ture capital expenditures through better design and more flexible layouts, as has been done in the state's new prisons. In the event that a capi-tal project creates the need for additional opera-tional funding, the operating costs are identified during the capital budget review and further re-viewed in the development of the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occu- pied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission, comprised of seven ex-officio members: the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Treasurer, and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Build-ing Commission, in addition to supervising im-provements to real property, oversees leases by state agencies and the demolition of structures located on state property. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly consist of projects meeting the requirements and policy guidelines of the State Building Commis-sion. The capital project recommendations are itemized by department. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non-routine repairs and replacements un-related to new constr uction and costing $100,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are addressed within the depart-ments' operational budget major maintenance programs. Capital maintenance projects include items that appreciably extend the life of the fa-cility, such as alterations to rectify code defi-ciencies, modifications to improve utility sys-tems, repaving, roof repair s, exterior fencing and lighting, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former condition and do not result in changes in facility use. Funding for these pro-jects is included in the amount allocated to the Department of Finance and Administration, and projects are selected for completion according to the review process outlined above. Capital outlay projects are defined as those providing new facilities or materially extendingCapital Budget the useful life and improving or changing the function of an existing facility. These projects include facility renovation, new construction, new utility or service systems, land with or with-out buildings, appurtenances, site improvements or permanent betterments, and initial equipment to furnish and operate a new or improved facility which require the assistance of a design profes-sional or cost $100,000 or more. For fiscal year 2006-2007, the capital outlay budget recommends a total of $354,600,000, di-vided between capital outlay projects and capital maintenance requests. Capital Maintenance \u2014 Capital maintenance projects are recommended at a level of $110,321,000. A State bond authorization of $61,490,000 and state appropriations of $24,451,000 are requested. Federal and other sources equal the remainder of the total amount. These projects focus on maintaining current fa-cilities, primarily through repair and renovation of roofing, mechanical, and electrical systems. Funding is also included to bring state facilities in line with federal standards for underground storage tanks, asbestos, and citizens with dis-abilities. The Tennessee Board of Regents and the University of Tennessee are also funded for modifications to assist in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Capital Outlay Projects \u2014 Capital outlay pro- jects recommended for this fiscal year total $244,279,000. Of this total, $187,410,000 in bonds and $37,349,000 in state appropriations are requested. Federal and other sources equal the remainder of the total amount. Projects from dedicated sources of revenue are also recommended for the Department of Transportation and the Tennessee Wildlife Re-sources Agency. Facilities Revolving Fund \u2014 Capital projects and maintenance for the Facilities Revolving Fund are recommended at a funding level of $72,200,000. Facilities Revolving Fund capital projects are listed in the Facilities Revolving Fund section, which follows the Capital Projects section of this document. Operating Costs \u2014 Included within this section is an estimate of the first year operating costs resulting from proposed new construction. Dif-ferences in operating costs can be the result of efficiencies from better designs and energy sys-tems or program requirements. Renovation pro-jects, which do not have an impact on operating efficiencies, are considered to be cost neutral. Only those projects which will have increases or decreases in operating costs from the current budget are included in the schedule. New Bond Authorizations \u2014 Capital mainte- nance, capital outlay, and Facilities Revolving Fund requests will require new bond authoriza-tions totaling $292,700,000. The chart below compares the bond authorizations recommended with those approved by the General Assembly during the past several years.

2007 The Facilities Revolving Fund (FRF) was established in 1988 to provide efficient management of the state office and warehousing facilities. State agencies are charged a fair market rate for the space they occupy. These revenues, along with any necessary current services revenue and reserve funds constitute the operating funds for FRF. The fund pays for facilities management costs of state-owned and leased office and warehouse space. These costs include debt service on buildings financed with bonds, routine and major maintenance, relocation expenses and furniture for state agencies, and payments for leased office space not owned by the state but occupied by state agencies. While FRF is administered by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, daily operations of the fund are jointly managed by the Department of General Services and the Department of Finance and Administration. General Services operates, maintains, and manages FRF facilities. Finance and Administration constructs and renovates facilities through its Division of Capital Projects and Real Property Management, with approval of the State Building Commission. The division also assigns space to agencies, handles lease acquisitions, and provides relocation services and furniture to agencies. The Department of General Services maintains the daily upkeep of FRF facilities through Operational Maintenance. Items such as contr acts for janitorial and security services are funded through this allotment.

A-135 State of Tennessee State Taxpayers Budget The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" section is included to distinguish between state appropriations from general state taxes and appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees, which are narrowly levied and earmarked for specific purposes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes the dedicated funds; it reports only appropriations from general state tax sources, along with estimates of the general taxes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes appropriations from dedicated tax and fee sources, all federal revenues, and all other departmental revenues. This section begins with a departmental summary of state appropriations from general tax sources. The chart entitled \"Tennessee Taxpayer Budget, Departmental Summary of State Appropriations,\" includes this departmental summary information and a grand total for the State Taxpayers Budget appropriations. The chart then shows a single line-item for appropriations from dedicated state tax sources and a grand total state appropriation for the Budget Document, which reconciles to the total state appropriations in the remainder of the Budget Document. Following the departmental summary of state appropriations is a summary of appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees. This schedule summarizes the various departmental appropriations from dedicated state sources that are excluded from the State Taxpayers Budget. Examples of appropriations from dedicated state sources are the appropriations to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) from hunting and fishing license fees and from real estate transfer taxes supporting the Wetlands Acquisition Fund, administered by TWRA, and appropriations to regulatory agencies from fees imposed on health professions, other professions, banks, and environment-impacting industries. The third schedule in this section is a more detailed breakdown of the state appropriations from general tax sources. \"State Taxpayers Budget, State Appropriations by Program,\" itemizes these appropriations by program. As with the departmental summary, this schedule includes a single line item for appropriations from dedicated sources to balance to the total state appropriations elsewhere in the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the State Taxpayers Budget follow the appropriations by program. The chart entitled \"State Taxpayers Budget, Comparison Statement of State Revenues,\" includes taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes) as well as those collected and deposited to the General Fund by other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. This chart excludes taxes and fees collected and deposited in the General Fund which are earmarked or dedicated for specific use. Distributions of taxes by fund for last year, the current year, and next year are on the following three charts. Except for the \"State Taxpayers Budget\", all of the other summary charts and program statements in this Budget Document that deal with appropriations in clude appropriations from all state sources, both general taxes and dedicated taxes and fees.

The Department of Education coordinates the educational programs of the local public school systems that operate Tennessee's kindergarten, elementary, secondary, and vocational schools. The department also operates the four special schools: Tennessee School for the Blind, Tennessee School for the Deaf, West Tennessee School for the Deaf, and Alvin C. York Agricultural Institute. Beginning in fiscal year 2005-2006, additional funding for locally sponsored after-school programs will be available to the department from the state's 50% share of the unclaimed lottery prize money. These programs provide academic enrichment activities designed to help students meet state and local standards. With assistance from the Department of Education, the State Board of Education formulates the policies, standards, and guidelines governing K-12 public education. The department is responsible for implementing these policies, standards, and guidelines. Higher education is governed by two independent systems: the University of Tennessee System and the State University and Community College System, more commonly known as the Tennessee Board of Regents System. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission is responsible for coordinating academic, fiscal, and policy issues between the two systems. The Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC) is the state's designated agency to administer financial aid programs designed to help students obtain a post-secondary education at colleges, universities, and technical and career schools. Among the programs TSAC administers are the Education Lottery-funded scholarships, implemented in fall 2004, and the Tennessee Student Assistance Awards (TSAA), the latter funded from general tax revenues. TSAA grants provide non-repayable financial assistance to financially needy undergraduate students who are residents of Tennessee and are enrolled at a public or an eligible non-public post-secondary educational institution in Tennessee. The lottery scholarships are funded through the Lottery for Education Account. The majority of these funds are made available for post-secondary scholarships, which include the Tennessee HOPE Scholarship, the General Assembly Merit Scholarship, the Need-Based Supplemental Award, the Tennessee HOPE Access Grant, and the Wilder-Naifeh Technical Skills Grant. In the event that net lottery proceeds exceed scholarship needs, excess lottery funds may be appropriated to pre-kindergarten and early childhood education programs.

The agreement sets forth commitments for higher education in middle Tennessee, statewide issues in both university systems, and implementation. Major ingredients of the plan require a nnual appropriations for a TSU Endowment for Educational Excellence over 10 years; capital im provements and revitalization of the TSU Avon Williams Downtown Campus; consideration of merg er of the Nashville School of Law with TSU, which has been ruled out; creation of new, high-demand academic programs at TSU as an alternative to the law school merger; statewide recruitment and retenti on initiatives for African American students, faculty, and administrators, including scholarships, pre-doctoral fellowships, visiting professorships, pre-university summer programs, and minority financial aid; and recruitment of other-race and non-traditional students to TSU. The first appropriation for the state's commitment to this settlement agreement was made in the 2001 General Appropriations Act, a nd administrative initiatives began in the last half of fiscal year 2000-2001. Major program initiative spendi ng began in fiscal year 2001-2002 and continues in the current year and next fiscal year. This agreement when fully implemented will result in a system of public higher education that preserves and enhances access and educational oppo rtunities at Tennessee's public colleges and universities. As Geier funding is phased out, the Administrati on intends to recommend the continuation of the level of financial support provided under the Geie r program on a recurring basis, in order to provide funds directed toward equity and ac cess initiatives in a unitary system of higher education. During the 2006 calendar year, the Administration and higher education staff will evaluate the effectiveness of Geier programs and recommend a plan for use of the Geier funds in Higher Education B-101 a post-Geier unitary status in the 2007-2008 an d succeeding fiscal years. The base state appropriation reduction of $1,870,900 is accomp anied by an improvement recommendation of $1,870,900 for post-Geier minority financial aid, which can be found at the beginning of the Education functional area, in the section titled \"I mprovements for Fiscal Year 2006-2007,\" under \"Higher Education - State Administered Programs.\" The improvement funds are recommended in the THEC Grants program.

Judicial power is vested in the various levels of courts that compose the state's court system. The court system can be grouped into the following functional areas: The Supreme Court Intermediate Appellate Courts Trial Courts Courts of limited jurisdiction Court services and support. The Supreme Court is composed of five justices; each is elected to an eight-year term. The workload of the court consists of cases app ealed from lower courts. Cases may be further appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court only on grou nds of federal constitutionality. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising out of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The Intermediate Appellate Courts are composed of the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in civil cases from the lower courts. The Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction to hear most felony and misdemeanor appeals from general trial courts as well as post-conviction petitions. The state's trial courts include Chancery, Crimin al, Circuit and Probate Courts. Chancery Courts are the traditional equity courts used when co mmon law and/or statutory law proves inadequate for cases. Circuit Courts, which sometime overlap with the Chancery Courts, have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. Criminal Courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases and hearing misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Probate C ourts primarily have jurisdiction over probate of wills and administration of estates. Courts of limited jurisdiction are funded locally and include General Sessions, Juvenile, and Municipal Courts. Jurisdiction of General Sessi ons Courts vary from county to county based on state laws and private acts; they hear civil, cr iminal, and juvenile cases, except in counties where the legislature has established separate Juvenile Courts. Municipal Courts have jurisdiction in cases involving violations of city ordinances.
