She is a most compassionate and intuitive healer, with an uncanny ability to zero in on what's ailing them.\" \u2014Jane Lynch, actress and animal advocate \"Anything you've ever wanted to know to enhance the health and happiness of animals can be found in Energy Healing for Animals. Joan Ranquet's knowledge, wisdom, and experience with animals is rounded out with explanations of modalities, techniques, science, and practices of vibrational healing\u2014and much more. Get your highlighter ready! You will want this book for your library. Very impressive.\" \u2014Margaret Ann Lembo, author of Chakra Awakening: Transform Your Reality Using Crystals, Color, Aromatherapy and the Power of Positive Thought \"I know Joan Ranquet to be a master animal healer, trainer, teacher, and communicator. I have the greatest love and respect for her unusual gifts and talents. Joan's voracious quest for healing has led her to the very best practices of 2,000 years of human energy healing, which has only gone mainstream in the last 30 years. Because of her special bond and gifts with our four-legged, winged, and even finned animal friends, Joan has taken 2,000 years of healing wisdom and adapted it for our most beloved animal companions. I once heard healing with energy medicine described as simply 'giving love.' Animals, with their capacity for unconditional love, often respond far better than humans to energy treatments. Joan's new book, Energy Healing for Animals, is crystal clear in its writing and teaching. It allows any two-legged human to easily learn these time-tested energy medicine techniques and 'share love' with all your beloveds. I highly recommend it to you.\" \u2014Alan Davidson, creator of Enlightened Tapping, founder of ThroughYourBody.com, author of Body Brilliance: Mastering Your Five Vital Intelligences \"Everything you've ever needed to know about energy healing for the precious souls that journey the earth with us\u2014animals\u2014is here in Joan Ranquet's book, Energy Healing for Animals. As an energy practitioner and long-time companion animal owner, I've needed a book like this for decades. Like us, animals are composed of a series of energy systems. How can I use love, intention, and 'emotional leadership,' one of Joan's key phrases, to balance and support the animals in my world? How about energy techniques, nutrition, and telepathy? Every tool is here in the book that can change the way we perceive and bond with our animals.\" \u2014Cyndi Dale, author of The Subtle Body \"Joan Ranquet's love for animals shines through on every page of this carefully crafted and thought-provoking book. She has left no stone unturned as she explains the myriad of healing modalities available for dogs, cats, and horses. From the mundane (nutrition) to the more esoteric (Reiki), her descriptions are clear, thorough, and engaging. Save yourself time, heartache, and frequent trips to the vet by getting a copy of this book! I know I will be referring to Energy Healing for Animals again and again. I now have a user-friendly, treasured set of new tools at my disposal to create health, wellness, and happiness among the animals in my household. Thank you, Joan!\" \u2014Meadow Linn, author of The Mystic Cookbook: The of Food \"A potent offering . . . affirming that love and the intention we hold in our heart is the basis of all healing.

Whether you are a newbie to the concept of healing animals with energy or thoroughly acquainted with the possibilities that exist when we recognize the healing power of thought, emotion, and vibration\u2014you will find a treasure trove in this integration of ancient concepts of energy with the latest understanding of quantum science. I give it five stars!\" \u2014Linda Tellington-Jones, PhD, founder and president of Tellington TTouch Training \"With respect, passion, and compassion for the animals, and humorous professional experiences, Ms. Ranquet is a natural storyteller as she guides us through vibrational healing techniques to soothe all of our souls.

They are in every way to me my children. There is nothing I would not do for them\u2014nothing I would not give them to ensure their happiness, well-being, and safety. After 30 years of working within the spiritual and metaphysical world, I have experienced many healers and intuitives. And in all of that time I have never come across anyone as gifted, in tune, and connected to the animal kingdom as Joan Ranquet. She has conversed with every 'four-pawed child' of my adult life with undeniable accuracy. The result has been happier and longer lives for all of them. And now Joan has brought all of her knowledge, experience, and spiritual gifts together into the creation of Energy Healing for Animals. "}
