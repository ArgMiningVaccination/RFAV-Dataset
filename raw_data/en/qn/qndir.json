In fact, our first generating plant was hydroelectric, producing clean energy from Alabama's rivers. We believe renewable resources are crucial to our present and future. Whether it's by generating hydroelectric power at home or investing in wind farms and solar energy projects throughout the U.S., we're committed to unlocking their unlimited potential. That's why we launched Greener State in efforts to make renewable energy easy and affordable for our customers. Greener State allows you to power your home with renewable energy through purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). RECs represent energy generated from renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Purchasing RECs is a way for individuals and businesses to support renewable energy development. You can choose one of three plans based on the renewable source - wind, solar, and biomass energy. You can also customize your plan to match your electric usage for as little as $1.25 a month. The cost of your Greener State plan is added to your monthly power bill, so you enjoy the convenience of one payment. You're using 100% renewable energy from existing wind, solar, and biomass sources\u2014and making the world greener. You're supporting the movement that employs people who work every day to harness our planet's renewable resources in new ways. It costs as little as $5 per month to go green. That's less than the cost of a cup of coffee! And it only takes a minute to sign up. To learn more and to sign up for the Renewable Energy Certificate program, visit [Greener State](http://greenerstate.com/). More information about RECs is available from the [EPA's website](https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/renewable-energy-certificates-recs). The billed amount for your REC purchase will be shown on the back of your power bill as a separate line item. The cost of each REC is $15, and will be billed at the rate of $1.25 per month for 12 months. You may choose to end your participation before the end of the 12-month billing period. By doing so, you will not receive a certificate. You must call us at [1-800-990-APCO (2726)](tel:+1-800-990-2726) to cancel your participation. The program automatically renews for another year after the 12-month period unless you notify us of your wish to cancel. Rate PAE applies to customers with distributed generation units, such as a solar panel array or a wind turbine, and would like to sell the excess energy back to Alabama Power.
