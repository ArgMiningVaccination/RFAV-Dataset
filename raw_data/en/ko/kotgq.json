They are connected to our nervous system, and therefore also to consciousness and wisdom, but they also nourish the metabolic and rhythmic system and contain all the food groups that we need: protein, carbohydrate, fat and minerals. All grains are seeds. The cycle of a plant's life includes the seed in the earth, the sprout, the leaf, the flower, the fruit and the seeds in the fruit. The seed contains, in its compact form, everything that is needed to build the next plant. The creation of seeds is the climax and the end of the plant's life cycle. Because they carry within them all the forces of the cosmos (earth, air, water, warmth and the influence of the planets), seeds are very rich in energy. Seeds have important functions: through them the plant multiplies; they are food to human beings and animals; and they contain oils, which have many uses, from food products to soap and paints. All grains are seeds of a plant, but not all edible seeds are defined as grains; for example, beans, lentils, peas, quinoa and buckwheat are seeds but not grains. We now know many different types of grains, including seven principal grains that were depended upon in the past and remain central in human nourishment today: wheat, rice, millet, corn, rye, oats and barley. According to an old legend, in their flight from Atlantis, before the big flood that covered it with water, the people of that ancient continent took Germinating pulses or seeds There are hard pulses (all the different kinds of bean, chick pea and soya) and there are soft ones (all the different kinds of lentil, mung bean and dry pea). The hard beans have to be soaked in water before cooking overnight, and the soft ones don't. T o get the most nourishment from them, though, it is recommended to germinate them. The dry seeds are dormant and can keep that way for a long time. When germinated, they 'wake up' to life and whoever eats them gets the nourishing life forces that are released. I use mung beans because they never let me down! 1. Soak the mung beans overnight using three times more water than beans. 2. Drain and pour out the water. Don't reuse the water, as it contains all the poison extracted from the beans. For cooking:3. T o sprout for cooking, leave the beans in a sieve for 24 hours. Wet them occasionally. Then use them for cooking. In this process, the beans start to soften. or for salad: 3. T o make bean sprouts for salad, keep wetting the beans in the sieve for a few days (we do it once a day) until a short white leaf appears. The speed of the process depends on the temperature. Sometimes two or more days are needed. The easiest pulse to germinate is mung bean. 64 65 Cooking grains and seeds grain serves ingredients directions Brown rice 4-6 200 g (1 cup) brown rice 480 ml (2 cups) water1/2 tsp saltBoil, lower the heat and simmer for 1 hour with the lid on.

The cooked oats are not separated like rice; they are wet and rather sticky. their seven grains to different parts of the world: corn to America, millet to Africa, oats to the northern countries, rice to the East, rye to central and eastern Russia, and barley and wheat to Europe. This legend contains within it the connections, which were known in past cultures, between the seven grains and different parts of the world. The seven days of the week are connected to seven planets, as their ancient Latin names suggest. Similarly, each grain has a connection to a planet. Out of this knowledge, a system of nourishment was created, based on eating a different grain every day of the week. Eating grains according to days of the week is an almost impossible mission in the fast pace of modern life. However, it is the ideal, and we can hold it as a goal to aim for. In places that consider food as medicine, such as anthroposophical hospitals, and in caring for people with special needs, these guidelines are strictly followed. I personally try to eat as many types of grain as possible. I do not always manage to do it according to the correct order of the days. Pay attention to which grain you tend to use more than others - usually this is wheat (bread, bulgar or cracked wheat, couscous, semolina) or rice. The grains of the week will help you to diversify your nutrition and unite with the whole world. 66 67 Some useful things to know about... Rice Each kind of rice has a different nutritional and culinary value. The most common kinds used are round rice, long rice, basmati rice, wild rice (which is not really a rice but an aquatic grass), sweet rice (also known as sticky rice mostly used in East Asian cuisines) and white rice. Round rice is stickier and chewier than long rice, which is fluffier - and more popular for this reason. I personally prefer round rice, also for its taste and for its higher nutritional value than long rice. In order to get more nutrients you can mix different kinds! Millet It is possible to improve the taste of millet by adding saut\u00e9d onion and garlic to it. It is possible to add a few drops of tamari (a kind of soy sauce) as well. Buckwheat Buckwheat is a very healthy seed. It revitalises our blood system, lowers blood pressure and cleanses our veins. I advise you to introduce it to your regular menu. grain serves ingredients directions Rye 4-6 200 g (1 cup) rye 480 ml (2 cups) waterAnother 60 ml (1/4 cup) water1/2 tsp saltBoil the rye in 2 cups of water, take off the heat and cover with a lid. Wrap the pot in a cloth towel and leave overnight. Add 60 ml (1/4 cup) water and the salt. Cover the pot and cook 20 minutes on low heat, until the seeds are soft.

Makes 7 cups (cooked) 2 onions, chopped olive oil for frying 1/2 tsp cardamom seeds, ground 1/4 tsp ground 1/4 tsp coriander seedsFry the onions in oil until golden. Add the spices, fry and stir, for 2 more minutes. 1 tsp turmeric 100 g (1/2 cup) brown rice100 g (1/2 cup) oat groats 100 g (1/2 cup) barley 1 litre (4 cups) boiling water1 tsp salt (or to taste)Add, cover the pot and let it cook on a low heat for 20 minutes. 50 g (1/4 cup) millet 40 g (1/4 cup) quinoaAdd and stir. Cover the pot, cook for 40 minutes more. For me, this grain stew is a basic meal. It is always in the fridge and I eat it in the morning, afternoon and evening with salad, stir-fry or cooked vegetables.Improving the taste of grains Here is a simple recipe you can add to any cooked grain: olive oil for saut\u00e9ing1 medium onion, finely chopped 1 medium carrot, grated 1 celery stalk, finely sliced Saut\u00e9 the onion in olive oil until golden. Add the carrot and celery, saut\u00e9 for 10 more minutes. Mix this into any cooked grain. With buckwheat, for example, the delicious taste will make you forget the not-so-pleasant smell of the buckwheat. A note for health freaks: in order to fully waken the life forces of grains, we should soak them for a night. My recipes use unsoaked grains, for I believe in hectic modern life, most of us forget to soak. I myself eat unsoaked grains. 70 71 Sunday menu hungarian tomato soup mujaddara with bulgar broccoli or cauliflower salad rich salad with olive oil (see page xx) date and tahini parf\u00e9 Sunday in Israel is the first working day of the week, so this is not a festive meal.Whea T Sunday A Sun - Sol, dies Solis Sunday, as the name suggests, is connected to the sun, which is the centre around which our living planet moves. The planets, including the Earth on which we live, rotate around the sun whose force of gravity holds them in their path. Sunday's grain is wheat, which needs the sun to ripen and turn golden. Wheat grows in summertime in every part of the world. The amount of sun that the grain receives differs from country to country and therefore there are differences in the quality of the wheat flour. The more sun the wheat absorbs, the harder the seed becomes and the higher the amount of gluten it contains. Hard wheat has the properties of glue; it is a uniting material. It is good to use it for baking bread and pastries. Gluten is also the component of wheat to which many people have a sensitivity, and even an allergy in the case of celiacs. Spelt is a good substitute for people who find eating wheat problematic, but for celiacs other flour types should be used, especially rice flour. The light and warmth of the sun are essential for life processes. They nourish and activate life. The sun is the 'I' of the world, holding it all together, harmonising all activities, feelings and thoughts. People look for the sun just as plants look for light. We usually eat too many wheat products, often without noticing. Wheat flour is found in pastries, bread, pies and cakes; couscous, bulgar and pastas are also made from wheat. It is advisable to diversify your grain consumption. It is, for example, possible to buy pastas made from different grains! 70 72 73 You can add dumplings to this soup (see page xx). My grandmother always added them and we all loved this dish, partly because of the dumplings and partly because it was a light summer soup, which meant that there would be dessert that day as well. The tomato - a little demon The tomato belongs to a family of plants called nightshades. Peppers, aubergines (eggplants), potatoes and tobacco also belong to this family. Nightshades are regarded as mildly poisonous foods that are edible but can also cause harm. It is important to recognise this fact and understand that these plants should be used with moderation. The poisonous material in nightshades is concentrated in the green part of the fruit that we eat (from a botanical perspective tomatoes, aubergines (eggplants) and peppers are fruits). For this reason it is better not to use green peppers, and to cut off the light green part on the top of tomatoes and the green bits that sometimes occur on potatoes. Some approaches to nutrition avoid eating nightshades; my approach is that you can eat them but not too often and definitely only one kind in any one meal. It's interesting to note that Mediterranean countries' menus and eating habits are heavily based on nightshades. If I go to an Arab restaurant (which I do), I will get on the table: aubergine (eggplant) salad, cherry-tomato salad, peppers (bell peppers) baked in the oven and, of course, potato chips. Next to these, though, there will be a tabbouleh, green leaves, hummus, tahini, cucumber salad and many more surprises.hungarian tomato soup My grandmother often cooked this light soup in summertime, because tomatoes grew in abundance in our garden and we needed to use them. The soup is suitable for summer tomatoes, because they are the ripest and sweetest. My grandmother thickened the soup with roux; I prefer it without. I often think about the changes food cultures go through in one generation. As a child I loved this soup as it was served, with the roux. (Children were less fussy than today's kids.) But now I do not want either the fat of the roux or its flour in my soup. Serves 6 -8 1 kg fresh tomatoes 1 litre (4 cups) waterCut the tomatoes in two. Cut out the white bottom part. Boil the water and throw in the tomatoes until their peel can easily be removed (about 8-10 minutes). Remove the peel and put the tomatoes back into the water. 2 large sticks celery (with the leaves) 1 large onion, cut into quarters 5 cloves of garlicAdd the chunky celery, onion and garlic to the tomatoes and cook for 20 minutes. Then take out the celery stalks, the onion chunks and the garlic cloves. Blend the tomatoes and the liquid with a hand blender. 4 tbs brown sugarsalt and pepper to tasteAdd the sugar, salt and pepper to the soup and boil for 2-3 minutes. Serve with chopped fresh parsley or basil. chopped fresh parsley or basil for garnish 74 75 Mujaddara with bulgar I recommend sprouting all of the pulses (see page xx), and therefore I suggest starting the preparation of this mujaddara two days before you cook it. If you forget to sprout, you can still go ahead and make this simple but extremely delicious dish. The result is just as great. But most lentils like being soaked, even if it's only for a few hours. Serves 4 -5 olive oil for saut\u00e9ing 3 medium onions, finely sliced 100 g (1/2 cup) lentils (brown, black or green), soaked for 6 hours or sprouted 200 g (1 cup) rough bulgar 1/4 tsp cumin powder salt and pepper720 ml (3 cups) of boiling water 4 cloves of garlic, crushed 1. Saut\u00e9 one of the sliced onions in olive oil until golden. Add the lentils, bulgar, cumin, salt and pepper. Stir. Add the water and cook for half an hour on a low heat until the lentils are soft. 2. Meanwhile, saut\u00e9 the remaining two onions in olive oil until golden. Add the garlic and stir for one more minute. 3. Add the onion and garlic to the soft bulgar and lentil mixture and stir. Instead of the bulgar, you can use brown rice, buckwheat, barley or a mix to your taste. Remember that the cooking time for harder grains is longer! (For the quantity of water other grains need, see page xx.) When I prepare a meal with a recipe containing a large quantity of tomatoes (such as pasta, pizza or lasagna), the salad will definitely not include any vegetable from the nightshade family. You can also be sensitive to your digestive system. If you habitually eat healthy food, it will tell you everything that you need to know. When I was younger, aubergines (eggplants) caused a strong physical reaction in my body. After I stopped eating them for a number of years, the reaction stopped completely. Perhaps growing old and eating a lot of good food gave my digestive system a better ability to cope with these demons and others like them. Besides, without demons, life in this world would be boring! 76 77 Date and tahini parf\u00e9 As a Hungarian who would dedicate hours to preparing a good dessert, I was surprised by this simple and delicious recipe that I learned from my cooking class partner. It is very rich in taste, texture and nutrition, so I suggest small portions! You need to make this dish the day before you are going to serve it. It can stay in the freezer as long as you wish. Serves 8 120 ml (1/2 cup) coconut milk (look for one that does not have loads of additives) 230 g (1 cup) tahini (this is a sesame seed paste; you can buy it in Middle-Eastern stores) 75 g (1/2 cup) crushed dates (sometimes there are nice additive-free date spreads!) 3 tbs honey (optional)Mix together in a blender or food processor. Pour the mixture into the holes of a small muffin pan and freeze for one day before serving. Broccoli or cauliflower salad Serves 6 -8 500 g broccoli or cauliflower - only the florets 80 g (1/2 cup) sesame seeds salt to taste Sesame sauce 1 tbs sesame oil 5 tbs olive oil 3 tbs lemon juice 1 tbs soya sauce 1 clove of garlic, crushed 1/2 tbs honey (optional) 1. Steam the broccoli or cauliflower for approximately 15 minutes in a pot with a little water in it. I suggest not over-steaming the florets: let them stay crispy and let the broccoli keep its fresh deep-green colour. Cool the florets and place them in a bowl. 2. T oast the sesame seeds and the salt in a frying pan or skillet on a low heat for 10 minutes, without any oil, stirring constantly. If you have a mortar, crush the toasted sesame and salt mixture into a rough powder. If you do not have one, just use the seeds as they are this time and ask someone to buy you a pestle and mortar for your birthday. Set aside. 3. Mix together the ingredients for the sauce. 4. Pour the sauce over the broccoli and sprinkle the sesame and salt mixture on top. 78 79 Monday menu round brown rice (see page xx) mediterranean vegetable stew baked fennel house salad carrot cakeRICe Monday, xMoon - Luna, dies Lunae The name of Monday in many languages of the world points to its connection to the moon (for example, chandra in Hindi, lunedi in Italian). After the sunny Sunday, Monday is moony: introspective, absorbed and reflective. The grain related to this day is rice, which grows in water. The moon influences the movement of water over the earth. Rice has a weak root system and draws almost no substances for its nourishment from the earth. Thus it does not contain many minerals. As described earlier in 'Human beings as upside-down plants' , see page xx, plant roots support our most mineral part, our head. As a result of rice having a very weak root, it gives almost no nourishment to the nerve-sense system of human beings (the head with its thinking quality). Rice awakens the systems of liquids in our bodies: it helps heal problems with the flow of liquids, like high blood pressure, weak kidneys or the accumulation of phlegm. According to the anthroposophical viewpoint, there are four human temperaments: phlegmatic, sanguine, melancholic and choleric. The moon and rice belong to the watery phlegmatic temperament, which goes with the flow, and can adapt to and accept any situation. Rice is the grain of the East - India, China, Thailand and Japan - and the qualities that it brings are associated with the East: inner contemplation, meditation and tranquility. 78 80 81 Baked fennel In order to allow the special taste of the fennel to be enjoyed, I add very few other flavours! Serves 4 -6 Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F). 2 fennel bulbs, each cut lengthwise and then again crosswise (cut again if the bulbs are very large) 80 ml (1/3 cup) olive oil 4 cloves garlic, sliced 120 ml (1/2 cup) water 1. Place the fennel into a baking dish. 2. Mix the rest of the ingredients and pour on the fennel. 3. Bake. From time to time, pour some of the 'juice' over the fennel. Take out after 20 minutes or when a knife goes through the fennel easily.Mediterranean vegetable stew I suggest serving this stew with brown rice, or pasta made from brown flour. Children tend to like it. If they are fussy and don't want to eat vegetables, you can blend the stew after it's cooked. In our restaurant this recipe, without the cauliflower, is the sauce for lasagne and moussaka. Serves 6 -8 2 big onions, chopped olive oil for saut\u00e9ing half a garlic bulb, crushed 2 big carrots, sliced1 red pepper, cut into strips 1 celery stick with its leaves, chopped 1/4 cauliflower, broken into small floretsSaut\u00e9 the onions in the olive oil until golden. Add the garlic. Add the other vegetables and saut\u00e9 for 2 more minutes. 1 tbs thyme 2 bay leaves 200 ml (1 cup) stock or water 2 tomatoes, chopped smallAdd and cook for 15 minutes. 1/2 cup tomato paste1 cup fresh crushed tomatoesAdd and cook for another 15 minutes. salt and pepper to taste1/4 tbs hot paprika (optional)2 tbs sugarAdd and cook for half an hour, until the stew thickens a bit. 1 big courgette (zucchini), slicedhalf a bunch parsley, chopped 4 tbs fresh basil, chopped 2 tbs fresh oregano, chopped, or 1 tbs dried oregano3 tbs dry red wine (optional)Add after you have turned the heat off, stir, and cover the pot. 82 83 Toasted sunflower seeds These keep well for months without refrigeration and elevate every salad! Preheat oven to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F). 200 g (1 cup) of sunflower seeds 2-3 tbs soy sauceMix seeds and sauce well. Roast for 20 minutes on a baking dish or tray, stirring from time to time. Cool, then store them in a jar. You can toast pumpkin seeds as well. You can also sprinkle toasted seeds on stir-fried vegetables and - my favourite - on our mixed grains (see page xx).house salad Serves 8 -10 half a lettuce, broken to pieces 3 cucumbers, sliced 3 tomatoes, dicedCombine in a bowl. 1 avocado, peeled and cut into cubes 1 hard-boiled egg, slicedAdd and gently mix. a handful of bean sprouts toasted sunflower seeds (see page xx)croutons (see page xx, below)Sprinkle on the top. Add the house dressing (see page xx) a minute before serving. home-made croutons 1. Preheat oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F). 2. Cut bread (preferably wholewheat bread that has no pieces of seed or wholegrain in it) into cubes of the crouton size you desire. Place the cubes in a baking tin. 3. Mix olive oil or melted butter with crushed garlic, sesame seeds and finely chopped dill or dried marjoram. In Israel we use a herb mixture called zatar instead of the dried herbs above. You could try to find it in Middle Eastern stores. 4. Pour the oil and herb mixture on the bread cubes and, using your hands or a wooden spoon, turn until the oil and herbs cover all of the bread. 5. Bake for 20 minutes or until the cubes are golden. You must stir with a wooden spoon from time to time. 84 85 Tuesday, p Mars - Mars, dies Martis After the reflective, internal Monday, Tuesday arrives, full of vigour and activity. In Latin it is the day of Mars ( dies Martis ), who was the god of war. The grain connected to this day is barley. Barley is rich in phosphorus, zinc, iron, magnesium and B vitamins. It is highly beneficial for muscle activity and for the function of the digestive system. Eating barley strengthens general weaknesses, supports the heat processes in the body, and therefore assists with different kinds of inflammations. The temperament connected to barley is choleric - which is hot, active and full of life. Barley is the grain of Eastern Europe. Some people connect oats with Tuesday and barley with Friday. You are free to choose. As far as I am concerned, the important thing is to vary your grain consumption! Carrot cake Prepare a round, 28 cm (11 in) diameter cake tin or 2 loaf tins about 30 cm (12 in) in length. Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0 C (320\u00b0 F). 4 eggs, beaten 180 ml (3/4 cup) sunflower oil 200 g (1 cup) brown sugar 1 tbs honey1/2 tbs cinnamon 1 tbs bicarbonate (baking) soda 1 tbs vanilla essence (extract) (good quality!)Mix in a bowl. 300 g (2 cups) wholewheat flour 75 g (1/2 cup) raisins 30 g (1/4 cup) walnuts or pecan nuts, choppedMix in a separate bowl. Add to the egg mixture and combine. 300 g (3 cups) of finely grated carrots 180 ml (3/4 cup) of orange or apple juiceAdd and mix well. Pour the cake mix into the prepared tin or tins. Bake for 75 minutes. 85 BaRLey 86 87 Warming winter soup with barley This soup is a perfect meal in itself since it contains a pulse, a grain and lots of vegetables. Note that the lentils need to be pre-soaked for an hour. Serves 10 - 12 olive oil for saut\u00e9ing 3 big onions, chopped into small pieces 1 leek, sliced 1 tbs caraway seedSaut\u00e9 until golden. 2 litres (4 U.S. pints) stock or water100 g (1/2 cup) red lentils (pre-soaked for 1hour) 100 g (1/2 cup) barley 1/4 cauliflower, broken into florets1 big carrot, sliced round 1 small sweet potato, cubed 1 medium potato, cubed1 celery root or parsley root, cubed 1 kohlrabi, roughly grated 2 celery stalks with the leaves, finely cut1/2 tbs sweet paprika 1 bunch of dill or parsley, finely chopped salt and pepperAdd and cook for 40 minutes until the barley is soft. lemon juice (optional) When you serve, add a dash of lemon juice. You can substitute dumplings (see page xx) for the barley. If you do, put them straight into the soup just before the end of the cooking time. Boil the soup for another 5-8 minutes, to cook the dumplings through.Tuesday menu warming winter soup with barley bulgar rolls served with givetch (a rich transylvanian vegetable spread) labane (see page xx) with olive oil refreshing salad home-made ice cream 88 89 hungarian givetch (vegetable spread) This recipe is given in a large quantity, suitable for the sweet red pepper (bell pepper) season. Excess can be stored in sterilized jars or frozen in small containers to be used all year round. Of course it is also possible to prepare only a quarter of the quantity specified, store it in a container in the refrigerator and use it within a month. Givetch tastes good on sandwiches with feta cheese, garlic-dill cheese or omelette. I recommend you also add cucumber slices to the sandwich to counteract the spiciness of the givetch . Note that the beans need to be soaked for 2 days before the givetch is prepared. Makes approximately two 500 g (1 lb) jars of givetch. olive oil for saut\u00e9ing 400 g (2 cups) dry white beans (or chickpeas) 3 medium onions, chopped 5 large red peppers (bell peppers), slicedhot paprika or chilli (optional) quarter bunch of celery, stalks and leaves, chopped 200 g (1 cup) passata (tomato pur\u00e9e)salt and black pepper 1. Soak and sprout the beans for 2 days (see page xx). Put them in a cooking pot, cover well with water and cook for 2 hours until they are soft. Strain and cool. 2. Meanwhile saut\u00e9 the onions in plenty of olive oil until golden. Add the red pepper (bell pepper) and celery, then the hot paprika or chilli according to taste. Saut\u00e9 until all the vegetables are soft. 3. Take the saut\u00e9d vegetables off the heat and put them into a food processor together with the beans. Blend them together until they turn into a paste. 4. Pour this paste back into the cooking pot, add the salt, pepper and the passata (tomato pur\u00e9e) and cook on a very low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Take care not to burn the paste.Bulgar rolls Makes 15 -20 rolls 200 g (1 cup) fine bulgar (there is a rough type too)240 ml (1 cup) boiling water 4 tbs oil 4 tbs molasses or honey Pour the water on the bulgar and mix. After half an hour add the molasses or honey and the oil. Cover with a kitchen towel and cool. 1 tbs dry or 25 g (1 oz) fresh yeast 240 ml (1 cup) lukewarm water 2 tbs molasses or honey225 g (1 1/2 cups) wholewheat flour plus 450-600 g (3-4 cups) more wholewheat flour melted butter for brushing on the rolls 1. Mix the yeast, water, molasses and 225 g (1 1/2 cups) of flour in a big bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel and let it rise for 30-40 minutes. 2. Add the bulgar mixture and the extra of flour. Knead well for a few minutes. If it needs still more flour, add more gradually until you get an elastic dough that does not stick to your hands but is not too dry either. 3. Let it rise again for half an hour. 4. Preheat oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F). Pull off a small piece of dough, form a roll, brush it with melted butter, let it rise again for 10 minutes, then sprinkle sesame or sunflower seeds, or rolled oats, on it. 5. Place the rolls onto a greased baking tray (sheet) and bake for 20-30 minutes.There are many varieties of givetch . For example, you can substitute courgette (zucchini) or peeled aubergine (eggplant) for some of the peppers (bell peppers). 90 91 home-made ice cream I learnt this recipe from Suzanne Hillen, whose family I cooked for when I lived in Forest Row. In a way, she is the person responsible for me becoming a cookery teacher. As I was cooking in her gorgeous kitchen with its big Aga, its huge old wooden table, and her two year old, Rose, helping me with an apron on, she asked me to tell her about the deep meaning of food. I had been studying this subject with all the cooks of the area so I happily shared my understandings with her. One day she surprised me by saying, 'Why don't you give my friends a short cooking course?' Quite apprehensively I agreed - and enjoyed it so much that I am still doing it today, twenty years later. This recipe amazes me with its simplicity. Also, it requires no special equipment, just a hand mixer. Once you eat this exquisite ice cream, you won't buy commercial ice cream ever again. Makes 2 litres (4 U.S. pints) 4 eggs 50 g (1/4 cup) and 100 g (1/2) cup brown sugar 500 ml (1 U.S. pint) whipping cream Your choice of flavouring from the list that follows this recipe. 1. Separate the eggs, keeping both yolks and whites. 2. Whip the egg whites with 50 g (1/4 cup) of sugar. (There's no need to wash the mixer the whole way through making the ice cream!) 3. Whip the cream. 4. Whip the egg yolks with 100 g (1/2 cup) of sugar and the desired flavouring from the list that follows this recipe. 5. Fold the whipped egg white and the whipped cream into the flavoured yolk mix. 6. Pour the mix into a plastic box and freeze for at least 24 hours.Refreshing salad Serves 8 -10 quarter head of white cabbage, chopped finely2 cucumbers, sliced 2 carrots, cut into matchsticks half a red pepper (bell pepper), sliced finelyhalf a green pepper (bell pepper), sliced finely 2 tomatoes, chopped as you like 1 pickled cucumber, slicedMix in a bowl. 5-8 tbs French dressing (see page xx) or 5-8 tbs house dressing (see page xx) fresh chopped basilPour on the salad and mix. 92 93 MILLeT Wednesday, Mercury o Mercurius, dies Mercurii Wednesday is the day of Mercury, the messenger of the Gods, connected to healing and communication. In Latin-based languages the name of Wednesday is Mercurii, which is the closest planet to the sun. Wednesday's grain is millet. It grows well in dry regions, almost without irrigation. The protein content of millet is similar to that in an omelette, but it is gluten-free and therefore is suitable for those who suffer from gluten allergies.

The name of this day in a number of European languages comes from the Latin 'Jovis' . Rye grain is connected with Thursday. Rye loves light, air and cold. It has a strong root system and can grow well in acidic soil. It can survive storms, rain and snow, as well as rainless seasons. Of all the grains, rye seeds are the hardest to chew and to digest. Therefore rye helps to strengthen the digestive system and the building forces of the body. This grain is recommended for teenagers, who are in a stage of accelerated growth. Rye is the grain of Northern Europe: of Russia and the Slavic countries. 100 102 103 Multicolour stew When planning your cooking, take into account that about 2 hours will be needed for marinating the vegetables. Serves 6 -8 3 medium beetroots (beets), washed but not peeled, cut into cubes 2 carrots, cut lengthwise once and then crosswise into three 2 large onions, cut into quarters 1 celery root, cut into large chunks The marinade 1/2 tbs fresh ginger, grated3 tbs apple juice concentrate (or pomegranate juice concentrate, if you can source it) 2 tbs lemon juice 5 tbs olive oil600 ml (1/4 cup) water 1. Put all the vegetables into an iron pot. (If you do not have one, you really should get one, or use a ceramic pot that can go into your oven.) 2. Mix the marinade and pour it onto the vegetables. Let it stand for two hours. 3. Bake for two hours with the lid on at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F). Or you can cook the stew on the stove: the result will be just as delicious. Check from time to time and add water if necessary.Leek and potato soup Serves 6 -8 50 g (2 oz) butter or 60 ml (1/4 cup) olive oil1 tbs caraway seeds or 1/2 tbs caraway powder 2 medium leeks, chopped 2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes1 1/2 litres (3 U.S. pints) vegetable stock or water 1 bunch of dill, chopped well salt to tastea bit of pepper 1. Melt the butter or heat the olive oil, add the caraway seeds and fry gently for 1 minute. 2. Add the leeks, potatoes and the stock or water, and cook until the potatoes are soft. 3. Add the salt and pepper. 4. Blend the soup with a hand blender until smooth. If the soup seems too thick, add more stock or water. 5. Add the dill, more salt and pepper if needed, and cover. 6. Serve with yogurt or sour cream. If you like 'biting into' a soup, take some of it out before blending, then add it back before serving. W ashing leeks is a special job. I chop the bottom and a bit of the green end off, slice the leek lengthwise, hold it at the bottom with one hand and separate leaf after leaf with the other hand, washing out all the leftover mud. I always feel sorry that people chop so much of the green end of the leek off. It can be chopped finely and included with the white rings. 102 104 105 Love what is good for you The rye grain requires serious chewing. Even after lengthy cooking it is still quite hard. Lovers of healthy food will easily take to this dish; however I especially recommend it for those who are addicted to fast, pre-prepared meals. It will help to accustom their taste buds to healthy, nourishing food. Every one of us needs healing, since we all hurt ourselves, each differently. For one person it may be a craving for sweets or pre-prepared foods, for another it may be cravings for alcohol or drugs, and others are addicted to hurting their bodies, to unhealthy relationships and more. There is no limit to the ways in which we injure ourselves. In the area of food I always knew what was good for me, but in other areas I have needed to work hard to choose what nourishes me. Everyone is in a different place with the processes of their inner work. Once I wrote a note to myself and left it on the desk, so that I would see it many times a day: 'Love what is good for you. Do not desire what harms you.' For me, this message was about the kind of men I chose - they were always the 'wrong' ones. But I believe that we only choose what we need in order to develop inwardly, and there had to be an end to these 'wrong' men, because I was utterly fed up with my love affairs. I came to understand that I was choosing men who would leave me or who I would leave, because in some way this was what I wanted. Then I had to find out why I was doing that. henrietta's rye stew Henrietta, a Dutch anthroposophical psychologist who was my guest, turned out to be an excellent cook. She taught me how to create this special dish. Prepare the rye one day before. Serves 6 200 g (1 cup) rye grain 480 ml (2 cups) water and 60 ml 1/4 cup waterBring the rye to the boil in the water. Put a lid on the pot and turn off the heat. Cover the hot pot with a big towel and let it stand overnight. Add the extra water to the pot the next day and cook for 20 minutes or more on low heat, until the grains are soft. olive oil for saut\u00e9ing 2 medium onions, finely choppedSaut\u00e9 on low heat for 10 minutes, until golden. 1 celery root, well washed and cut into cubes.1 tbs honey1 tbs fresh ginger, grated5 dates, without the seeds, cut into cubes.In a separate pot, cover the celery root with water and cook for 10 minutes. Strain and add the honey, ginger and dates. Mix all the ingredients together: the cooked rye, the fried onions and the celery root and honey mixture. You can prepare this dish without the honey and dates if you don't like sweet tastes. You can also serve this with Mediterranean stew. (see page xx) 106 107 Tofu and lettuce salad Note that the tofu needs to marinate for 5 hours before preparing the rest of the salad. Serves 6 -8 300 g (10 oz) tofu, cut into cubes 60 ml (1/4 cup) olive oil 1 tbs dried marjoramMarinate the tofu cubes for 5 hours half a lettuce, broken into small pieces by hand 1 sweet pepper (bell pepper), sliced into thin strips 1 cucumber, sliced 2 tomatoes, sliced juice of a lemonT oss together with the soaked tofu and olive oil. Serve immediately.It all came back to my father, who died when I was nine years old, and who I adored. You must understand that these revelations take a lifetime. Mine took 51 years. Usually these deep understandings are accompanied with great inner pain. Then a major letting-go must take place. If that happens you are free - clean of old patterns that hold you back - and in a way you are reborn. The pattern is hard to find. Mine was: man-love- abandonment. This was engraved in my soul at the age of nine. In order to find the man who would love me and who I could love, I had to separate from my father and stop holding onto my 'safe' pattern. In love you can look for many things (warmth, comfort, friendship), but not for security! This statement, 'love what is good for you' , can be applied to food as well. But hard as it is to wean ourselves from unhealthy relationships, it is just as hard to let go of food that is bad for us. 108 109 Cinnamon and honey yogurt 240 ml (1 cup) yogurt 1 tbs honey 1 tbs cinnamon powder Fruit yogurt The perfect alternative to commercially produced yogurt drinks! 240 ml (1 cup) yogurt 150 g (5 oz) mango, or another fruit (peach, apricot, melon, strawberry), peeled and with pits, stones or seeds removed If the drink is not sweet enough, add honey. Forest fruit yogurt Serves 8 -10 forest fruit salad (see page xx) 500 ml (2 cups) yogurt a little granola for serving (see page xx)Chill the yogurt and fruit mix, then sprinkle fruit and granola on top.yogurt delights Most of these recipes contain honey. Do you know that honey is medicine? Bees are connected to the sun not only in colour, but on a deep level. The queen bee - not in commercial honey production but in organic bee-keeping - flies up towards the sun with some male bees and is fertilised in the air, under the sunlight. The bee is the only creature in the world that does this! Bees extract nectar (the most heavenly part of the flower) and turn it into honey. Thus spirit is materialised. What we eat, when we eat honey, is really the light of the golden sun! These yogurt shakes are tasty, sweet and refreshing! They can be turned into a dessert rather than a drink if you prefer.All these drinks are to be mixed with a blender or shaker. Drink with a straw. Date yogurt 240 ml (1 cup) yogurt (see page xx) 1 heaped tbs date paste, or 4 dates, seeded Carob and honey yogurt 240 ml (1 cup) yogurt1 tbs honey 1 tbs carob powder (often needs to be sifted since it can be chunky) 110 111 110 Friday menu (Sabbath meal) orange (pumpkin) soup oat groats (see page xx) fresh stir-fry with soy and honey sauce tofu in gado-gado (peanut) sauce simple leaf salad (see page xx) hot apple cider (non-alcoholic) nut torte with chestnut cream or omama's chocolate cream This is a festive evening meal since in Israel Friday's sunset is the beginning of the rest day, Shabbat. In Jewish and Israeli communities, families get together and friends invite one another. It is a minor celebration that is very much present in our life every week. It separates Friday from other days and, indeed, every Friday evening is special. OaTS Friday, Venus n Venus, dies Veneris Friday is connected to Venus (the Goddess and the planet), and the grain associated with the day is oats. Oats are most familiar to us in their flattened form as rolled oats: the main ingredient of muesli, granola, hot porridge and many cookies. The oat groats in these recipes are whole, unflattened grains, more like barley: check for them in your local whole-food store. Rolled oats are the only form of grain that it is possible to eat without cooking (in muesli). Oats completely absorb the forces of the sun and are therefore already 'cooked' . Oats are richer in fats than other grains and therefore supply more heat in our digestive system. For this reason they are good to eat when we feel depressed, because in a depressed state the digestive system cools down or even 'freezes' . Oats are high in protein, and are therefore also good food for animals. Oats originated in cold northern Europe; oats are the basic food of the Celts and Scandinavians. There is a school of thought that relates barley to Friday and oats to Tuesday. It's your choice! Be creative!!! 112 113 Orange (pumpkin) soup (without orange) Warm sweetness Cooking pumpkin soup reminds me of a cold winter day from my childhood in Transylvania: the first of November, the day of the dead. On this day everyone goes to the cemetery to decorate the graves of their beloved ones with chrysanthemum flowers and candles. As darkness descends we all light the candles and transform the cemetery into a spectacle of lights. The air is filled with the smell of burning candles mingled with the scent of the flowers. People work quietly, encouraging us kids to whisper and keep calm instead of running around. Sadness for the loss of loved ones unites with an attentive activity for them. I loved wandering on the paths of the cemetery and watching people's creativity, turning the graves into flowing forms of candles and flowers. As everyone was working, silently absorbed in memories, I could imagine the dead joining together in a circle dance, joyous at not being forgotten. The end of this intimate ritual was the eating of pumpkin baked on an open fire and sold at the gate of the cemetery. How delicious it was! Rich in taste, steaming from the glowing coals, so comforting. Sitting next to mother on the bus that took us home, I put my head on her shoulder, closed my eyes and felt the grey salty tears shed for my dead transforming into an orange sweetness in my stomach. This 'orange' soup's flavour is perfect. The mixture of the saltiness and the sweetness of the vegetables has to reach such a level of harmony that when you eat this soup you feel like melting. Amina, who was a cook in the restaurant, and I would make this soup together. Amina would make the 'physical body' of the soup: cleaning and cutting the vegetables, cooking and mashing them. Then she would call for me: 'Come, bring it to the heavens!' I would add the spices, salt and sugar, then taste it. If the taste wasn't perfect I would say: 'T oday it's a little cloudy, it's hard to reach the heavens.' And if the soup 'gave' itself to me easily, I would say: 'The sky is clear today!' Serves 10 -12 2 medium sweet potatoes, cubed 2 medium carrots, cubed 700 g (1 1/2 lb) pumpkin, peeled and cubed 3 medium onions, diced 5 garlic cloves, whole 1 1/2 litres (3 U.S. pints) vegetable stock or waterPut into a pot, bring to the boil, lower the heat and cook until the carrots are soft. Blend with a hand blender, then bring to the boil once more.115 Fresh stir-fry with soy and honey sauce First you need to make a cup of soy and honey sauce to add to the stir-fry at the end.

When serving, sprinkle dill and saffron on top. The deep red colour of the saffron merges well with the light orange colour of the soup, and the green dill balances it all. It is possible to add 300 g (10 oz) tofu, cut into cubes, to the second batch of vegetables. If using dried tofu, soak it in water and a bit of soy sauce for 2 hours before cooking. 116 117 Tofu in gado-gado (peanut) sauce For the gado-gado sauce, you need soy and honey sauce (see above). Start by soaking the tofu for 2 hours before cooking.

Spring onions (scallions), chopped Sprinkle on top to serve. This dish is even better on the second day.Soy and honey sauce Have a jar of this sauce in the fridge all the time. It can keep refrigerated for months. It can be used for stir-fry, grains, almond burgers (see page xx), stuffed butternut squash (see page xx) and more.

Take off the heat, add the apple juice concentrate and one of the tea plants. Cover the pot. 120 121 Chestnut cream Making chestnut cream is a task for extremely bored or extremely hard-working people, because it takes a lot of time and patience! It is possible to freeze the cream. You can buy chestnut cream in whole-food shops or you can replace it in this torte with Omama's chocolate cream (see page xx). Makes about 750 g (1 1/2 lb) 500 g (1 lb) chestnuts, in their shells 240 ml (1 cup) milk 100 g (1/2 cup) brown sugar 3 tbs rum 1. Cut a cross on each chestnut's shell. 2.

You can also use more chestnut cream or chocolate cream for the top and sides instead of the whipped cream. 122 123 123 CORN Saturday, Saturn r Saturnus, dies Saturni, Shabbat Saturday is the day of Saturn. In Hebrew tradition, this is the day on which God rested from the labour of creation. The grain connected to Saturday is corn. Of all the grains, corn has the strongest connection to the earth. It is rich in starch and is therefore easily digested and is a good source of instant energy. Many products are made from corn - in the food industry and in other industries - including ethanol, which is often added to motor fuel. Corn is related to the melancholic temperament, which carries the burden of earthly life. It is passive in its activities but active within, taken up with contemplation and reflection. The origin of corn is in the West - in the Americas. Omama's chocolate cream and chocolate sauce 150 g (3/4 cup) brown sugar 180 ml (3/4 cup) milk 3 tbs cocoa powder 200 g (7 oz) soft butter 1.

Add the soft butter and mix well. You can use a whisk. It is possible to add 60 g (1/2 cup) finely ground toasted walnuts (toasted in a toaster oven at 160\u00b0 C (320\u00b0 F) for 5-10 minutes). The result is delicious! Chocolate sauce In order to get a chocolate sauce for pouring on ice cream or pancakes, replace the milk with water and add the butter to the hot sauce immediately after it has thickened. 124 125 Baked coriander (cilantro) polenta Serves 8 -12 You will need a square baking pan, 32 x 24 cm (12.5 x 9.5 in).
