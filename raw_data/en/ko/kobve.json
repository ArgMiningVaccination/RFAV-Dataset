This is the same system you use to register for your own vaccinations. [Register now](https://getvaccinated.gov.bc.ca/) Only register your child once. You will get a notification from the Get Vaccinated system when it's time to [book your child's next appointment](#dose-2). Add your child to your Health Gateway account [Add your child as a dependent](https://www.healthgateway.gov.bc.ca/dependents) in your Health Gateway account to view and download their: - Immunization history (which vaccines they've already received) - Immunization forecast (when they're due for their next vaccination) It's part of your child's routine vaccine schedule COVID-19 vaccines are an important part of your child's routine vaccination schedule. Your child can get the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as other childhood vaccines, including the [influenza (flu) vaccine](#flu). What to expect at the appointment Most appointments are available at local clinics. Plan to be at the appointment with your child for 15 to 30 minutes. If you have multiple children, they each need an appointment. Information about vaccines for children is available to help you prepare for your child's appointment: [Children and COVID-19 vaccination \u2014 British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC)](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine/vaccines-children) [COVID-19 mRNA vaccines \u2014 HealthLink BC](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/covid-19-mrna-vaccines) Get your child's flu shot at the same appointment You can book your child's COVID-19 vaccine and a [free flu shot](/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/immunizations/flu) at the same appointment. If your child recently had a COVID-19 vaccine dose, don't worry. You'll get another invitation to book their flu shot. Public health recommends that everyone gets a flu shot this year, to protect yourself and your children from respiratory illness during the fall and winter months. If your child is 2 years or older, you can choose to get the flu vaccine by nasal spray instead of an injection. Arrive prepared Get your child ready for their appointment: - Talk to your child about getting the vaccine - Bring their booking confirmation and ID like their [BC Services Card](/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-services-card/types-of-cards/non-photo) - They need to wear a short-sleeved shirt - They don't need to fast. Drinking water is encouraged Getting the shot We want you and your child to feel comfortable: - When you check in, you can both ask questions - During the shot, use distractions like puzzles, videos or talking - The shot will pinch or poke a bit, but only takes a few seconds - After the shot, wait in an observation area for about 15 minutes After the vaccine appointment Just like adults and youth, your child may experience side effects after getting the vaccine. Your child's next doses When it's time for your child's next dose, we'll send another booking invitation by text or email. Like the first appointment, you'll select a location, date and time. You'll get an invitation approximately 56 days after your child's first dose, to get a second dose. Children 5 and older will be invited to get a [booster dose](/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/booster) six months after their second dose. My child already had COVID-19 Young children still need to be vaccinated even if they already had COVID-19. If your child was recently sick, they can get the vaccine 8 weeks after their symptoms started or they tested positive for COVID-19. Vaccine safety Health Canada has approved two mRNA vaccines for children: - The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine is approved for children 6 months and older - The Moderna Spikevax vaccine is approved for children 6 months and older All COVID-19 vaccines for adults and children follow the same review and approval process. Review [clinical information about COVID-19 vaccines for children from Health Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/vaccination-children/covid-19.html). Dosage of mRNA child vaccines Children need a smaller dose of the vaccine to get the same protection from COVID-19. Dosage for children ages 5 to 11 The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines for children ages 5 to 11 use a smaller dosage of the same vaccine used for youth and adults: - Pfizer is a 10 microgram dose, which is [a third of the dosage for adults](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/pfizer-biontech.html#a3) - Moderna is a 50 microgram dose, which is [half the dosage for adults](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/moderna.html#a3) If your child turns 12 soon, it's your choice to wait and have them vaccinated with the full dosage for youth and adults. Dosage for children under 5 The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines for young children use a smaller dosage of the same vaccine used for youth and adults: - Moderna is a 25 microgram dose, which is [a quarter of the dosage for adults](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/moderna.html#a3) - Pfizer is a 3 microgram dose, which is [a tenth of the dosage for adults](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/pfizer-biontech.html#a3) The Pfizer vaccine for young children requires 3 doses to complete the primary series. Consent is required for every child Give consent at the vaccine appointment Consent is required for children to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Consent for a child can be provided by a: - Parent, legal guardian or foster parent - Custodial caregiver like a grandparent or relative Only one parent, legal guardian or foster parent is required to give consent. You'll be asked to provide consent at the appointment. I have questions about parental consent Parents that are separated, divorced or not living together If parents are divorced, separated or have never lived together and they do not agree on vaccinating their child, the parent that wants their child to get vaccinated must: - Be the [child's guardian under the Family Law Act](/gov/content/life-events/divorce/family-justice/family-law/parenting-apart/am-i-a-guardian) and - Have the [parental responsibility](/gov/content/life-events/divorce/family-justice/family-law/parenting-apart/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-guardian)related to giving or refusing consent for medical and health-related treatments Parents who don't live together may have a written agreement or court order that says whether one or all parents have parental responsibilities. Parents who are unsure may wish to get [legal advice](/gov/content/life-events/divorce/family-justice/who-can-help/lawyers) about their situation. A court order may give guardianship to an adult who is not a parent. In these circumstances, if that individual also has parental responsibility related to giving or refusing consent to medical and health-related treatments they can provide consent for the vaccine. Children under temporary orders, interim in care, voluntary agreements or out-of-care orders The parent or legal guardian, in consultation with their child's social worker, decides if their child should be vaccinated. There are 2 options for registration: - The parent or legal guardian can register their child - The child's social worker can register the child, with consent from the parent or legal guardian Permanent transfer of custody (54.1/54.01) The care providers are the legal guardian and can provide consent. Children under a continuing custody order (CCO) The child's social worker can provide verbal consent to the foster parent or caregiver. The foster parent or caregiver can then register the child and take them to the vaccine appointment. You can contact your local [Child & Family Services Office](/gov/content/family-social-supports/data-monitoring-quality-assurance/find-services-for-children-teens-families) if you have questions. Taking time off work Your employer must allow you to take job protected leave to take your child to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

If you need to, you can [reschedule an appointment online](https://www.getvaccinated.gov.bc.ca/s/cancel-booking). Get a friend or family member to take your child If you can't take your child to their appointment, you can give authority to another adult to give consent. To do this, you must provide a written note containing: - Name of parent/legal guardian who is giving their authority to another adult - Name of child - Child's date of birth - Name of adult given authority to consent - Signature of parent/legal guardian who is giving their authority to another adult - Date note was signed - Parent/legal guardian's contact information Materials for children Talking to your child about COVID-19 and getting vaccinated is important.

Children with moderately to severely compromised immune systems will generally have lower antibody responses from two COVID-19 vaccine doses. A third dose helps create the antibodies they need to protect them from COVID-19. You will be contacted by the provincial Get Vaccinated system about how and when to book a third dose for your child, about 4 weeks after they receive their second dose. If you believe your child meets the criteria and you haven't been contacted, get in touch with your health care provider.
