New Year's day seems like a good time to assess how far we've got, five years on. At the beginning of 2007 [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/) (the universities central admission service) offered 45 different BSc degrees in quackery, at 16 universities. Now there are only 24 such degrees. If you exclude chiropractic and osteopathy, which all run at private colleges, with some sort of \"validation\" from a university, there are now only 18 BSc/MSc courses being offered in eight universities. Degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy and \"nutritional therapy\", reflexology and aromatherapy have vanished altogether from UCAS. In the race to provide BScs in anti-science, Middlesex University has now overhauled the long-standing leader, Westminster, by a short head. | | Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex | | Let's see what's gone. The University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) was the first to see sense. In August 2008 they [announced closure of their \"BSc\" degree in homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249). On September 2008 they announced [ an internal review ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=252)of their courses in homeopathy. herbalism and acupuncture. The report of this review [closed down all of them in July 2009.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) I first asked for their teaching materials in July 2006. I finally got them in December 2010, after winning an appeal to [the Information Commissioner](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364), and then winning an appeal against that decision at an [ Information tribunal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) . By the time I got them, the course had been closed for over two years. That is just as well, because it turned out that UCLAN's students were [being taught dangerous nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2628). No wonder they tried so hard to conceal it. Salford University was the next to go. They [shut down their courses](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) in complementary medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture. In January 2009 they announced \" they are no longer considered \"a sound academic fit\" \". Shortly afterwards. a [letter appeared in The Times](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984) from three heavyweights (plus me) congratulating the vice-chancellor on his decision. University of Westminster For many years, Westminster was the biggest supplier of BSc degrees in quackery. At the beginning of 2007 they offered 14 different BSc degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, \"complementary therapies\", (western) herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture. Some of their courses were so bizarre that some of the students and even staff sent me slides which taught things like \"amethysts emit high Yin energy\". Like UCLAN, Westminster also [held an internal review](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984). Unlike UCLAN it came to the absurd conclusion that all would be well if they injected more science into the courses. The incompetence of the review meant that those who wrote it hadn't noticed that if you try to put science into homeopathy or naturopathy, the whole subject vanishes in a puff of smoke. Nevertheless Westminster closed down entry to BSc homeopathy in March 2009 (though the subject remained as part of other courses). Three years after the [Nature article](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), all five BSc homeopathy degrees had shut their doors. During 2011, Westminster shut down Naturopathy, Nutritional therapy, Therapeutic bodywork and Complementary Medicine. See, for example, [More dangerous nonsense from the University of Westminster: when will Professor Geoffrey Petts do something about it?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) [Professor Geoffrey Petts of the University of Westminster says they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". The facts show this is not true](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683) [University of Westminster shuts down naturopathy, nutritional therapy, but keeps Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4704) Now Westminster has only four courses in two subjects. They still teach some dangerous and untrue things, but I suspect the writing is on the wall for these too. I have seen a document, dated 11 April 2011, which states \"The following courses have been identified as 'at risk' (School definition) and will be discussed at the APRG and University Review Group2, due to poor recruitment and high cost of delivery: Integrated Health Scheme: BSc BSc Herbal Medicine\" All but Chinese medicine and Herbal medicine have already gone. Almost there. University of Wales Since my first [post in 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) about the validation scam operated by the University of Wales, and some good investigations by BBC Wales TV, the outcome was the most spectacular so far. The entire [institution collapsed](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education-news/2011/12/29/can-education-heed-the-lessons-of-2011-91466-30025844/). They no longer \"validate\" external degrees at dodgy business colleges, loony religious colleges or magic medicine colleges. [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) (October 2008) This is a 'degree' in nutrtional therapy. It is even more hilarious than usual, but it passed the validation anyway. [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) (November 2010). This post followed the BBC Wales TV programme. At last the QAA began to notice, yet further confirmation of its utter ineptitude. [The University of Wales disgraced (but its vice chancellor is promoted)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766) (October, 2011) The eventual collapse of the university was well-deserved. But it is very weird that the people who were responsible for it have still got their jobs. In fact the vice-chancellor, Marc Clement, was promoted despite his mendacious claim to be unaware of what was going on. It remains to be seen how many of the many quack courses that were validated by the University of Wales will be taken on by other universities. The McTimoney College of Chiropractic is owned by BPP University (so much for their quality control, as [explained in Private Eye](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4422)). but still claims to be validated by Wales until 2017. Some of the more minor players Edinburgh Napier University. After an FOI request (rejected), Napier closed their herbal medicine degree in 2010. [Hot and cold herbal nonsense from Napier University Edinburgh: another course shuts.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3200) (June 2010) As expected, the Scottish Information Commissioner agreed with that for England and Wales and ordered material to be sent. [Edinburgh Napier University teaches reflexology, aromatherapy and therapeutic touch. Scottish Information Commissioner says you should know](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4049). Some of the horrors so discovered appeared in [Yet more dangerous nonsense inflicted on students by Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4188). The embarrassment seems to have worked. Their remaining degrees in aromatherapy and reflexology have now vanished from UCAS too. All that remains is a couple of part time \" [Certificates of Credit](http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/W76206.htm)\" for aromatherapy and reflexology Anglia Ruskin Univerity Not only have BSc degrees gone in aromatherapy and reflexology, but their [midwifery degree](http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/prospectus/ugft/midwifery.html) now states \"We are unable to accept qualifications in aromatherapy, massage and reflexology.\" University of Derby Reflexology and aromatherapy have gone, though doubtless Spa management therapies have much nonsense left University of Greenwich. BSc in Complementary Therapies (Nutritional Health) and BSc in Complementary Therapies (Nutritional Health) have been shut. [The BSc Acupuncture ](http://www2.gre.ac.uk/study/courses/ug/hea/acupuncture)is listed on their web site but it is under review, and is not listed in UCAS for 2012. ( [Acupuncture](http://www2.gre.ac.uk/study/courses/ug/hea/acupuncture) is run at [International College of Oriental medicine](http://www.orientalmed.ac.uk/), validated by Greenwich.). Only osteopathy (MOst) is still running, and that is a validation of an external course run at [The European School of Osteopathy](http://www.eso.ac.uk/home.html), in Maidstone Thames Valley University was renamed the [University of West London](http://www.uwl.ac.uk/index.jsp) in 2010. The nonsense that was run there (e.g. [Nutritional Fairy Tales from Thames Valley University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=260)) seems to have vanished. Their previous alt med guru, Nicola Robinson, appears now to be at London South Bank University ( [ranked 116](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?v=wide) out of the 116 UK universities) What's left? Chiropractic Surprisingly, given the total discreditation of chiropractic in the wake of the Simon Singh affair, and the internecine warfare that followed it, none of the chiropractic courses have shut yet. Some are clearly in trouble, so watch this space. Osteopathy has also had no course closures since 2007. Like chiropractic it also suffers from internecine warfare. The General Osteopathic Council refuses to disown the utter nonsense of \"craniosacral\" osteopathy. But the more sensible practitioners do so and are roughly as effective as physiotherapists (though [there are real doubts](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) about how effective that is). Excluding chiropractic and osteopathy, this is all that's left. It now consists almost entirely of Chinese medicine and a bit of herbal. Glyndwr university (Known as North East Wales Institute until 2008) [Ranked](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?v=wide) 104 out of 116 UK universities BSc Acupuncture (B341) BSc BSc Complementary Therapies for Healthcare (B343) Cardiff Metropolitan University (UWIC) (Known as University of Wales Institute Cardiff (UWIC) until Nov 2011.) The vice-chancellor of Cardiff Metropolitan, Antony Chapman, is in the [QAA's board of directors](http://www.qaa.ac.uk/AboutUs/corporate/board/Pages/default.aspx), so perhaps it isn't surprising that the QAA has done nothing.

Manchester Metropolitan gets the booby prize for actually starting a new course, just as all around are closing theirs. Dr Peter Banister, who was on the committee that approved the course (but now retired), has told me \" I am sceptical in the current economic climate whether it will prove to be successful\". Let's hope he's right. But well done Westminster. Your position as the leader in antiscientific degrees has now been claimed by Middlesex University. Their \"degrees\" [ in Ayurveda](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/search/index.aspx?q=ayurveda) mark out Middlesex University as the new King of Woo. Over to you, Professor Driscoll. As vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, the buck stops with you. Both still teach Chinese and herbal medicine, which are potentially dangerous. There is not a single product from either that has marketing authorisation from the MHRA, though the MHRA has betrayed its trust by allowing misleading labelling of herbal medicines without requiring any evidence whatsoever that they work, see, for example [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) [More quackedemia. Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) [Why does the MHRA refuse to label herbal products honestly? Kent Woods and Richard Woodfield tell me](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) Sub-degree courses In contrast to the large reduction in the number of BSc and MSc degrees, there has actually been an increase in two year foundation degrees and HND courses in complementary medicine, at places right near the [ bottom of the academic heap](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?v=wide). The subject is sinking to the bottom. With luck it will vanish entirely from universities before too long. Research-intensive Universities Although all of the degrees in magic medicine are from post-1992 universities, the subject has crept into more prestigious universities. Of these, the [University of Southampton](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) is perhaps the worst, because of the presence of [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956), and his defender, Stephen Holgate. Others have staunch defenders of quackery, including the University of Warwick, University of [Edinburgh](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) and [St Batholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555). Why have all these courses closed? One reason is certainly the embarrassment caused by exposure of what's taught on the courses. Professors Petts (Westminster) and Driscoll (Middlesex) must be aware that googling their names produces references to this and other skeptical blogs on the front page. Thanks to some plain brown emails, and, after a three year battle, the Freedom of Information Act, it has been possible to show here the nonsense that has been foisted on students by some universities. Not only is this a burden on the taxpayer, but, more importantly, some of it is a danger to patients. When a course closes, it is often said that it is because of falling student numbers (though UCLAN and Salford did not use that excuse). Insofar as that is true, the credit must go to the whole of the skeptical movement that has grown so remarkably in the last few years. Ben Goldacre's \"ragged band of bloggers\" have produced a real change in universities and in society as a whole. The people who should have done the job have either been passive or an active hindrance. The list is long. Vice-chancellors and Universities UK (UUK), the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the Hiigher Education Funding Council England (HEFCE), [Skills for Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh), the and [Prince Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=3179#050610) his reincarnated organisation, the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632)\", the [King's Fund](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2131), the Universities and Colleges Union (UCU), [OfQual, Edexcel](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454), National Occupational Standards and Qualifications and the Curriculum Authority (QCA). Whatever happened to that \"bonfire of the quangos\"? Follow-up 2 January 2012 The McTimoney College of Chiropractic (owned by BPP University) [claims that](http://www.mctimoney-college.ac.uk/category/latest-news/) its \"validation\" by the University of Wales will continue until 2017. This contradicts the statement from UoW. Watch this space. 3 January 2012. Thanks to [Neil O'Connell](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) for drawing my attention to a paper [in Pain](/white-2011-acupuncture-placebo-rct.pdf). The paper is particularly interesting because it comes from the [Southampton group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) which has previously been sympathetic to acupuncture. Its authors include [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). It shows, yet again that there is no detectable difference between real and sham acupuncture treatment. It also shows that the empathy of the practitioner has little effect: in fact the stern authoritarian practitioner may have been more effective. Patients receiving acupuncture demonstrated clinically important improvements from baseline (i.e., a 29.5% reduction in pain), but despite this, acupuncture has no specific efficacy over placebo for this group of patients. The clinical effect of acupuncture treatment and associated controls is not related to the use of an acupuncture needle, nor mediated by empathy, but is practitioner related and may be linked to the perceived authority of the practitioner.\" Sadly. the trial didn't include a no-treatment group, so it is impossible to say how much of the improvement is regression to the mean and how much is a placebo effect. The authors admit that it could be mostly the former. Surely now the misplaced confidence in acupuncture shown by some medical and university people must be in tatters. In yet another sign that even acupuncture advovates are beginning to notice that it doesn't work, a recent article [Paradoxes in Acupuncture Research: Strategies for Moving Forward](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/180805/), shows some fascinating squirming. 3 January 2012. The [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/degree-courses/8989183/Lie-back-and-relax-reflexology-and-aromatherapy-degrees-are-dropped.html) has carried a piece about closure of university courses, written by Michael Hanlon. On [31 January](#310112) they carried a much longer piece. 3 January 2012. It is a great pity that some physiotherapists seem to have fallen hook, line and sinker for the myths of acupuncture. Physiotherapists are, by and large, the respectable face of manipulative therapy. Their evidence base is certainly not all one would wish, but at least they are free of the outrageous mumbo humbo of chiropractors. Well, most of them are, but not the [Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists](http://www.aacp.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137&Itemid=149) (AACP), or, still worse, The [Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Energy Medicine](http://www.energymedphysio.org.uk/), a group that is truly away with the fairies. These organisations are bringing a very respectable job into disrepute. And the Health Professions Council, which is meant to be their regulator, has, like most regulators, done nothing whatsoever to stop it. 5 January 2012. Times Higher Education gives a history of the demise of the University of Wales, [Boom or Bust](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418612). It's a useful timeline, but like so many journalists, it's unwilling to admit that bloggers were on to the problem long before the BBC, never mind the QAA. There was also a leader on the same topic, [Perils of the export business](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=418588&c=2). It again fails to take the QAA to task for its failures. Interviews for [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw-world.de/) and [Middle East Broadcasting Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Broadcasting_Center) TV. 17 January 2012 Another question answered. I just learned that the [ludicrous course in Nutritional Therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), previously validated by the University of Wales (and a contributor to its downfall), is now being validated by, yes, you guessed, [Middlesex University](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm). Professor Driscoll seems determined to lead his univerity to the bottom of the academic heap. His new partnership with the Northern college of Acupuncture is just [one of a long list](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/business/partners/uk/index.aspx) of validations that almost rivals that of the [late University of Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766). The course has, of course, an [enthusiastic testimonial](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm), from a student. It starts I work full time as a team leader for a pension company but I am also a kinesiologist and work in my spare time doing kinesiology, reiki and Indian head massage. Evidently she's a believer in the barmiest and totally disproved forms of magic medicine. And Middlesex University will give her a Master of Science degree. I have to say I find it worrying that she's a team leader for a pension company. Does she also believe in the value of worthless derivatives. I wonder? 18 January 2012. the story has gone international, with an interview that I did for Deutsche Welle, [UK universities drop alternative medicine degree programs](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15673133,00.html). I'm quoted as saying \"They're dishonest, they teach things that aren't true, and things that are dangerous to patients in some cases\". That seems fair enough. There is also an [interesting item](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5789488,00.html) from July 2010 about pressure to drop payment for homeopathy by German health insurance 31 January 2012 The Daily Telegraph carried a prominent 1200 word account (the title wasn't mine). The [published version](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9051103/Complementary-medicine-courses-in-universities-how-I-beat-the-varsity-quacks.html) was edited slightly. As promised in my [last post](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4049) about Edinburgh Napier University, I wrote to the vice-chancellor of the university, Professor Dame Joan K. Stringer DBE, BA (Hons) CertEd PhD CCMI FRSA FRSE, to invite her to respond. | | 7 February, 2011 Dear Professor Stringer, I should be grateful if you could let me know about your opinion of the degrees that you offer in Aromatherapy and Reflexology I have posted on my blog a bit of the material that was sent to me as result of recent FoI requests. See http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4049 I submit that degrees like this detract from the intellectual respectability of what is, not doubt, in other respects a good university, but since you are mentioned in the post, it's only fair to give you the chance to defend yourself. In fact you'd be very welcome to do so publicly by commenting on the post. Best regards David Colquhoun Over a month later, I have received no response at all. This seems to me to be a bit discourteous. There is nothing new in failing to get any answer to letters to vice-chancellors. The only VC who has ever thanked me for opening his eyes is Terence Kealey, of the [University of Buckingham](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881). All the rest have stayed silent. I can interpret this silence only as guilt. They know it's nonsense, but dare not say so. Of course it isn't infrequent for the course to close down after public exposure of the nonsense they teach. So perhaps the letters get read, even if they don't elicit a reply. Meanwhile the university sent me more materials that are used to teach their students. So here is another sample, largely from what's taught to the unfortunate \"reflexology\" students. Remember, these pre-scientific myths are not being taught as history or anthropology. They are taught as though they were true, to students who are then let loose on patients, so they can make money from anyone who is gullible enough to believe what they say. There are no \"excess body energies\". It's made-up nonsense. The diagram is pure imagination. It dates form a time before we knew anything about physiology, yet it is still being taught as though it meant something. The admission that there is controversy is interesting. But it doesn't seem to deter Napier's teachers in the slightest. How can anyone in the 21st century believe that the heart is \"king of our emotional existence\"?. That's just preposterous pre-scientific myth, You must be joking. \"Vibrational medicine\" is a non-existent subject. Pure gobbledygook. This is partly old, partly quite new. It is all preposterous made-up nonsense. There isn't the slightest reason to think that \"zones\" or \"meridians\" exist. In fact there is good evidence from [acupuncture studies](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=945) to think that they don't exist. Now some slides from course CPT08102. The mention of the word 'energy' in the alternative world always rings alarm bells. Here's why. Well, it's a good question. Pity about the answer. Shouldn't that read \"as a practising reflexologist it is important than you have a MISunderstanding of the energy that surrounds us\"?. What logic? Have these people never heard of Hodgkin & Huxley (the answer, I imagine, is no)? The mention of Kim Jobst immediately raises suspicions. He is a homeopath and endorser of the obviously fraudulent [Q-link pendant](http://draust.wordpress.com/2007/11/17/at-the-risk-of-repeating-myself-more-on-altmed-journals/). \"when you as a reflexologist palpate the foot you not only produce the physical responses in the CNS but also enter the energetic body and move energy , , \". Well, no you don't. This is purely made-up nonsense. The words sound \"sciencey\" but the meaning of the words is utterly obscure. Yes we do live in an interconnected world. And sadly, that interconnectedness is used to spread myth and misinformation, usually with the aim of making money. I guess Edinburgh Napier University makes money by teaching ancient myths as though they were true. In so doing they destroy their academic reputation. Here you are tested to see how much nonsense you have memorised successfully. If only they had sent 'model answers'. Remember, these pre-scientific myths are not being taught as history or anthropology. They are taught as though they were true, to students who are then let loose on patients, so they can make money from anyone who is gullible enough to believe what they say. A 2009 [systematic review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740047) of randomised controlled trials concludes that \"The best evidence available to date does not demonstrate convincingly that reflexology is an effective treatment for any medical condition.\". So forget it. How about it Professor Stringer? Isn't it time to clean up your university? Follow-up Western herbal medicine need not be mystical nonsense, but it usually it is, Plants often contain chemicals that have pharmacological actions, with all the possibilities for good and for harm that implies (see [Plants as medicines](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205)). It would be quite possible to teach about the plant constituents and their actions in an entirely scientific way, but it seems that this is not what courses in herbal medicine choose to do. That is why they shouldn't be called Bachelor of Science degrees. We have recently revealed the ancient nonsense taught at Middlesex University in its \"BSc (Hons)\" degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine in [Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) as well as similar dangerous gobbledygook from the University of Westminster: see [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043). Western Herbal medicine does not talk about \"knotted spleen Qi\", but has an equally barmy mystical vocabulary of its own. They have in common a tendency to divide herbs into hot and cold, a crude and baseless classification that dates from a time when nothing was known about physiology or the causes of disease. A recent post described the problems of finding out what exactly is taught on these courses: [Not much Freedom of Information at University of Wales, University of Kingston, Robert Gordon University or Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2351) I lodged a Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act with Napier University Edinburgh on 10th August 2009. As almost always, [ it was refused](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2351), as was the internal review of my request. The response to the internal review came from Gerry Webber BA (Hons) 0 PHil MBA MCMI AUA (Fellow). Despite all those impressive sounding letters, he argued with a perfectly straight face that it was perfectly all right for the university to teach this sort of stuff. He ended \"On public interest grounds, I have therefore concluded that, in respect of the commercially sensitive information requested, the public interest is better served in withholding the information you have requested than in disclosing it.\" Despite all those impressive sounding letters after Dr Webber's name, here was a solemn letter, on the university letterhead, defending the teaching of pseudoscientific nonsense The experience is surreal, but far from unique. Although we [ won a judgement](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) that compelled disclosure from the Information Commissioner for England and Wales, the Scottish law is slightly different so I had to appeal to the Scottish Information commissioner. [ [Download appeal](/Napier-FOISA-appeal.pdf)] A similar appeal was lodged for Robert Gordon's University Aberdeen. They have already sent some homeopathy materials, and closed down the homeopathy course, as described at: [Robert Gordon University stops its homeopathy course. Quackademia is crumbling](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2914). Napier University followed the same pattern, but a bit more slowly. They sent some of what I asked for without waiting for a formal judgement, after they had been contacted by the Scottish Information Commissioner. Napier also shut down the degree from which the slides, below, were used. It is fascinating that so many places have done this shortly before what is taught is made public. Before that time the courses are defended and advertised. no doubt by people who have never given a moment's thought to what is taught. In 2007, after [my Nature article](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19) on the topic, [the Glasgow Herald](http://www.heraldscotland.com/less-than-complementary-1.854730) said A spokeswoman for Napier University said it stood by the integrity of its BSc degrees. \"The BSc Herbal Medicine course uses an approach to teaching and training that we believe best prepares students for practice within a modern integrated healthcare system,\" she said. The [university's brochure](/FHLS_CommHealth_HerbMed_15092004103945.pdf) for the course (still, carelessly, [on the web](http://www2.napier.ac.uk/newsnew/upload/foi/FHLS_CommHealth_HerbMed_15092004103945.pdf) at the time of writing), waxed lyrical about the herbal medicine course. Yet as soon as it becomes known what's actually taught, the courses close. What was taught on Napier's Herbal Medicine \"BSc\". Materia medica starts with hot and cold herbs Yes, but one of the problems is that very little is known about the therapeutic actions of herbs from \"controlled enquiry\". The material just isn't there to fulfil this aim. To paraphrase their quotation,,you can call anything medicine, but plenty of people will argue with you if you can't produce the evidence. This slide strikes me as pure pre-scientific gobbledygook. All herbs and all diseases seem to fall into the 'hot' or 'cold' class. The 'argument' is entirely circular. Pure pseudoscience (is that what the lecturer told them in response to the last question?). What do all these conditions have in common? They are all \"cold\". How can anyone take this sort of baloney seriously? This quotation appears to have no comprehensible meaning at all. It carries overtones of the [great \"detox\" fraud](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), and so perhaps is useful justification for slimming the wallets of the gullible. Now we come to a real herb. There is some real chenistry in this slide. Unfortunately it simply isn't known whether these chemicals have any useful function. Usually it isn't known either what dose of them you are giving in tincture of valerian. When I worked in a pharmacy in the 1950s, you could still find tincture of valerian on the shelves of a normal pharmacy, but iit soon vanished as paople realised it wasn't much use. Disappeared from normal medicine, that is. it is still alive and well among herbalists. Notice too, the mention of \"synergy\". The perpetual excuse of herbalists for giving impure mixtures of chemicals is that they might act synergistically. They are undeterred by the fact that no such synergy has ever been demonstrated properly. I asked that question ot Liz Williamson. editor of Potter's herbal Cyclopedia, but answer came there none. I'd be interested to know what answer was given to the last question, which isn't as simple as it sounds. I wouldn't mind betting it didn't include a critical description of isobol analysis. So what does Valerian do? It seems, even from the lecture, that there is no unanimity that it does anything useful at all. There is no worthwhile evidence to think it is useful for \"generalises anxiety disorder\" Let's take another opinion. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is the branch of the US National Institutes of Health which has spent around a billion dollars of US taxpayers' money on research into alternative medicine, For all that effort they have failed to come up with a single useful treatment. Clearly [they should be shut down](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=123). Nevertheless, as an organisation that is enthusiastic about alternative medicine, it's interesting to see what [they have to say about valerian](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/valerian/). What the Science Says - Research suggests that valerian may be helpful for insomnia, but there is not enough evidence from well-designed studies to confirm this. - There is not enough scientific evidence to determine whether valerian works for anxiety or for other conditions, such as depression and headaches. Even NCCAM don't pretend that there is any good reason to think it's good for anything. So, you might ask, why are students being taught to treat people with it? Simon Mills on \"hot and cold herbs\" Many of the slides refer to a book by herbalist Simon Mills. You can [see a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGhp0PNHVnc) of a talk he gave in which he 'explains' \"hot and cold herbs\". It strikes me as pure gobbledygook. Make up your own mind. Now take the test This is a question from a Napier University exam paper Which constituents are responsible for the actions of saw palmetto? Which actions would they be? This is what The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) says about saw palmetto. What the Science Says - Several small studies suggest that saw palmetto may be effective for treating BPH symptoms. - In 2006, a large study of 225 men with moderate-to-severe BPH found no improvement with 320 mg saw palmetto daily for 1 year versus placebo. NCCAM cofunded the study with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. - There is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of saw palmetto for reducing the size of an enlarged prostate or for any other conditions. - Saw palmetto does not appear to affect readings of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. PSA is protein produced by cells in the prostate. The PSA test is used to screen for prostate cancer and to monitor patients who have had prostate cancer. Magic Medicine In the materials that I was sent, I see nothing to make me believe that herbalism is being taught as science. On the contrary, it all seems to confirm the definition given in the [Patients' Guide to Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). Herbal medicine BSc degrees still exist. They are [still running at the following universities.](http://search.ucas.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/search/search/StateId/QZqoewhT8lCPiqyeulU0W5icV5Mny-UBLm/HAHTpage/search.HsKeywordSuggestion.whereNext?query=314&word=HERBAL&single=N) The vice-chancellors are named because they are the people who must take responsibility for this sort of nonsense being taught in their universities. University of East London (vice-chancellor from Feb 2010 is [Patrick McGhee](http://www.uel.ac.uk/vcg/vc.htm), who, in his previous job at University of Central Lancashire, did so much to prevent me from getting hold of their teaching materials, but then closed the courses anyway) University of Lincoln (Vice chancellor, [Professor Mary Stuart](http://thelinc.co.uk/2009/06/university-of-lincoln-appoints-professor-mary-stuart-as-new-vice-chancellor/)) London Metropolitan University (vice-chancellor, ( [interim Alfred Morris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metropolitan_University)) Middlesex University (vice-chancellor, Professor [Michael Driscoll](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx)) And, of course, the home of woo, the University of Westminster (vice-chancellor, [Professor Geoffrey Petts](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about/organisation-of-the-university/vice-chancellor/biography-of-professor-petts)). Their students are taught that Amethysts emit high Yin energy and that [dowsing and pendulums](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227) can be used for diagnosis and treatment. By the same token, we may congratulate [Professor Dame Joan Stringer](http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/principal/Pages/default.aspx), vice-chancellor of Napier University Edinburgh for closing down the course from which these slides came. Perhaps now she should consider closing their 'degrees' in aromatherapy and 'reflexology' Follow-up Every single request for information about course materials in quack medicine that I have ever sent [has been turned down](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2351) by universities, It is hardly as important as as refusal of [FoI requests to see climate change documents](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/09/freedom-of-information-hacked-emails), but it does indicate that some vice-chancellors are not very interested in openness. This secretiveness is exactly the sort of thing that leads to lack of trust in universities and in science as a whole. The one case that I have won took over three years and an [ Information Tribunal decision](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) against the University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) before I got anything. UCLAN spent \u00a380,307.95.(inc VAT at 17.5%) in legal expenses alone (plus heaven knows how much in staff time) to prevent us from seeing what was taught on their [now defunct \"BSc (Hons) homeopathy\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249). This does not seem to me to be good use of taxpayers' money. A [small sample of what was taught](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2628) has already been posted (more to come). It is very obvious why the university wanted to keep it secret, and equally obvious that it is in the public interest that it should be seen. UCLAN had dropped not only its homeopathy \"degree\" before the information was revealed, They also set up an internal inquiry into all the rest of their courses in magic medicine which ended [with the dumping of all of them](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899). Well, not quite all, There was one left. An [\"MSc\" in homeopathy by e-learning](http://www.uclan.ac.uk/information/courses/msc_homeopathy_by_elearning.php). Why this was allowed to continue after the findings of [UCLAN's internal review](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899), heaven only knows. It is run by the same [Kate Chatfield](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=196) who ran the [now defunct BSc](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249). Having started to defend the reputation against the harm done to it by offering this sort of rubbish, I thought I should finish. So I asked for the contents of this course too. It is, after all, much the same title as the course that UCLAN had just been ordered to release. But no, this request too was met with a refusal Worse still, the refusal was claimed under section 43(2) if the Freedom of Information Act 2000. That is the public interest defence, The very defence that was dismissed in scathing terms by the [Information Tribunal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) less than two months ago, To add insult to injury, UCLAN said that it would make available the contents of the 86 modules in the course under its publication scheme, at a cost of \u00a320 per module, That comes to \u00a31,720 for the course, Some freedom of information. Because this was a new request, it now has to go through the process of an internal reviw of the decision before it can ne referred to the Information Commissioner. That will be requested, and since internal reviews have, so far, never changed the initial judgment. the appeal to the Information Commissioner should be submitted within the month. I have been promised that the Information Commissioner will deal with it much faster this time than the two years it took last time. And a bit more unfreedom Middlesex University I first asked Middlesex for materials from their homeopathy course on 1 Oct 2008. These courses are validated by Middlesex university (MU) but actually run by the [Centre for Homeopathic Education](http://www.homeopathycollege.org/). Thw MU site barely mentions homeopathy and all I got was the usual excuse that the uninsersity did not possess the teaching materials. As usual, the validation had been done without without looking at what was actually being taught. The did send me the validation document though [ [download it](/homeopathy-bsc-validation-vr253.pdf)] As usual, the validation document shows no sign at all of the fact that the usbject of the \"BSc\" is utter nonsense. One wonderful passage says \". . . the Panel were assured that the Team are clearly producing practitioners but wanted to explore what makes these students graduates? The Team stated that the training reflects the professional standards that govern the programme and the graduateness is achieved through developing knowledge by being able to access sources and critically analyse these sources . . . \" Given that the most prominent characteristic of homeopaths (and other advocates of magic medicine) is total lack of critical ability, this is hilarious. If they had critical ability they wouldn't be homeopaths. Hilarious is not quite the right word, It is tragic that nonsense like this can be found in an official university document. Middlesex, though it doesn't advertise homeopathy, [does advertise degrees](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/search/index.aspx?q=%22complementary+medicine%22&site=live_WholeSite) in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Herbal Medicine and Ayurveda. On 2nd February 2010 I asked for teaching materials from these courses. Guess what? The request was refused. In this case the exemptions under FOIA were not even invoked but I was told that \"All these materials are presently available only in one format at the University - via a student-only accessed virtual learning environment. \". Seems that they can't print out the bits that I asked for, The internal review has been requested, then we shall see what the Information Commissioner has to say. Two other cases are at present being considered by the Information Commissioner (Scotland), after requests under the Scottish FoIA were refused. They are interesting cases because they bear on the decision, currently being considered by the government, about whether they should implement the recommendations of the [ execrable Pittilo report.](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Pittilo) Napier University Edinburgh. The first was for teaching material form the herbal medicine course at Napier University Edinburgh. I notice that this course no longer appears in UCAS or on Napier's own web site, so maybe the idea that its contents might be disclosed has been sufficient to make the university do the sensible thing. Robert Gordon University Aberdeen The second request was for teaching material from the [\"Introduction to Homeopathy\" course](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/prospectus/modules/disp_moduleView.cfm?Descriptor=NU3786) at the Robert Gordon University Aberdeen. The particular interest that attaches to this is that the vice-chancellor of Robert Gordon university is Michael Pittilo. The fact that he is willing to tolerate such a course in his own university seems to me to disqualify him from expressing any view on medical subjects. Michael Pittilo, Crohn's disease and Andrew Wakefield Michael Pittilo has not been active in science for some time now, but Medline does show scientiifc publications for Pittilo RM, between 1979 anf 1998. Between 1989 and 1995 there are five papers published jointly with one Andrew Wakefield. These papers alleged a relationship between measles virus and Crohn's disease. The papers were published before tha infamous 1998 paper by Wakefield in the Lancet (now retracted) that brought disgrace on Wakefield and probably caused unnecessary deaths.. The link between measles and Crohn's disease is now equally disproved. The subject has been reviewed by Korzenik (2005) in [Past and Current Theories of Etiology of IBD. Toothpaste, Worms, and Refrigerators](/korzenik-crohns-05.pdf) \"Wakefield et al proposed that Crohn's results from a chronic infection of submucosal endothelium of the intestines with the measles virus [Crohn's disease: pathogenesis and persistent measles virus AP, Pittilo RM, Pounder RE., Gastroenterology, 1995, 108(3):911-6]\" \"This led to considerable media interest and< public concern over use of live measles vaccine as well as other vaccines. A number of researchers countered these claims, with other studies finding that titers to measles were not increased in Crohn's patients, granulomas were not associated with endothelium 49 , measles were not in granulomas50 and the measles vaccine is not associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease51-55 \" This bit of history is not strictly relevant to the [Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Pittilo+report%22), but I do find quite puzzling how the government chooses people from whom it wishes to get advice about medical problems. Follow-up I notice that the Robert Gordon university bulletin has announced that \"Professor Mike Pittilo, Principal of the University, has been made an MBE in the New Year Honours list for services to healthcare\". That is a reward for writing a [very bad report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235) that has not yet been implemented, and one hopes, for the sake of patients, will never be implemented. I do sometimes wonder about the bizarre honours system in the UK. Postcript. On 16th February, the death of Michael Pittilo [was announced](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=410412&c=2). He had been suffeing from cancer and was only 55 years old. I wouldn't wish that fate on my worst enemy. It seems very reasonable to suggest that taxpayers have an interest in knowing what is taught in universities. The recent [Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2310) suggested that degrees should be mandatory in Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. So it seems natural to ask to see what is actually taught in these degrees, so one can judge whether it protects the public or endangers them. Since universities in the UK receive a great deal of public money, it's easy. Just request the material under the Freedom of Information Act. Well, uh, it isn't as simple as that. Every single application that I have made has been refused. After three years of trying, the Information Commissioner [eventually supported my appea](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364)l to see teaching materials from the Homeopathy \"BSc\" at the University of Central Lancashire. He ruled that every single objection (apart from one trivial one) offered by the universities was invalid. In particular, it was ruled that univerities were not \"commercial\" organisations for the purposes of the Act. So problem solved? Not a bit of it. I still haven't seen any of the materials from the original request because the University of Central Lancashire appealed against the decision and the case of [University of Central Lancashire v Information Commissioner](http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/Documents/PendingAppeals/CCU_15102009.pdf) is due to be heard on November 3rd, 4th and 5th in Manchester. I'm joined (as lawyers say) as a witness. Watch this space. UCLan is not the exception. It is the rule. I have sought under the Freedom of Information Act, teaching materials from UClan (homeopathy), University of Salford (homeopathy, reflexology and nutritional therapy), University of Westminster (homeopathy, reflexology and nutritional therapy), University of West of England, University of Plymouth and University of East London, University of Wales (chiropractic and [nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259)), Robert Gordon University Aberdeen (homeopathy), Napier University Edinburgh (herbalism). In every single case, the request for teaching materials has been refused. And that includes the last three, which were submitted after the decision of the Information Commissioner. They will send things like course validation documents, but these are utterly uninformative box-ticking documents. They say nothing whatsoever about what is actually taught. The fact that I have been able to discover quite a lot about what's being taught owes nothing whatsoever to the Freedom of Information Act. It is due entirely to the many honest individuals who have sent me teaching materials, often anonymously. We should be grateful to them. Their principles are rather more impressive than those of their principals. Since this started about three years ago, two of the universities, [UCLan](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) and [Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885), have shut down entry to all of their CAM courses. And [Westminster has shut two](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) of them, with more rumoured to be closing soon. They are to be congratulated for that, but is far from being the end of the matter. The Department of Health, and some of the Royal Colleges, have yet to catch up with the universities, The Pittolo report, which recommends making degrees compulsory, is being considered by the Department of Health. The consultation ends on November 2nd: if you haven't yet responded, please do so now ( [see how here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2329), and [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2310)). A common excuse: the university does not possess teaching materials (yes, really) Several of the universities claim that they cannot send teaching materials, because they have no access to them. This happens when the university has accredited a course that is run by another, privately run, institution. The place that does the actual teaching, being private, is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The ludicrous corollary of this excuse is that the university has accredited the course without checking on what is taught, and in some cases without even having seen a timetable. The University of Wales In fact the University of Wales doesn't run courses at all. Like the (near moribund) University of London, it acts as a [degree-awarding authority for a lot of Welsh Universities](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E5011). It also validates a lot of courses in non-university institutions, [34 or so of them in the UK](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7051&country=UNITED+KINGDOM), and others scattered round the world. Many of them are theological colleges. It does seem a bit odd that [St Petersburg Christian University, Russia, and ](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=RUSSIA&inst=PETERS) [International Baptist Theological Seminary, Prague](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=CZECH%20REPUBLIC&inst=IBTS), should be accredited by the University of Wales. They also validate the [International Academy of Osteopathy, Ghent](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=BELGIUM&inst=IAO) 34 UK institutions include the [Scottish School of Herbal Medicine, the ](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=SS) [Northern College of Acupuncture](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=NC) and the [Mctimoney College of Chiropractic](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=MT). The case of the Nutritional Therapy course has been described already in [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). It emerged that the course was run by a grade 1 new-age fantasist. It is worth recapitulating [the follow up](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259#follow). What does the University of Wales say? So far, nothing. Last week I sent brief and polite emails to Professor Palastanga and to Professor Clement to try to discover whether it is true that the validation process had indeed missed the fact that the course organiser's writings had been described as \"preposterous, made-up, pseudoscientific nonsense\" in the Guardian. So far I have had no reply from the vice-chancellor, but on 26 October I did get an answer from Prof Palastanga. As regards the two people you asked questions about - J.Young - I personally am not familiar with her book and nobody on the validation panel raised any concerns about it. As for P.Holford similarly there were no concerns expressed about him or his work. In both cases we would have considered their CV's as presented in the documentation as part of the teaching team. In my experience of conducting degree validations at over 16 UK Universities this is the normal practice of a validation panel. I have to say this reply confirms my worst fears. Validation committees such as this one simply don't do their duty. They don't show the curiosity that is needed to discover the facts about the things that they are meant to be judging. How could they not have looked at the book by the very person that they are validating? After all that has been written about Patrick Holford, it is simply mind-boggling that the committee seems to have been quite unaware of any of it. It is yet another example of the harm done to science by an unthinking, box-ticking approach. Incidentally, Professor Nigel Palastanga has now been [made Pro Vice-Chancellor (Quality)](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E735) at the University of Wales and [publishes bulletins](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E780) on quality control. Well well. The McTimoney College of Chiropractic was the subject of my next Freedom of Information request to the University of Wales. The reasons for that are, I guess, obvious. They sent me hundreds of pages of validation documents, Student Handbooks (approx 50 pages), BSc (Hons) Chiropractic Course Document. And so on. Reams of it. The documents mostly are in the range of 40 to 100 pages. Tons of paper, but none of it tells you anyhing whatsover of interest about what's being taught. They are a testament to the ability of universities to produce endless vacuous prose with very litlle content. They did give me enough information to ask for a sample of the teaching materials on particular topics. But I gor blank refusal, on the grounds that they didn't possess them. Only McTimoney had them. Their (unusually helpful) Freedom of Information officer replied thus. \"The University is entirely clear about the content of the course but the day to day timetabling of teaching sessions is a matter for the institution rather than the University and we do not require or possess timetable information. The Act does not oblige us to request the information but there is no reason you should not approach McTimoney directly on this.\" So the university doesn't know the timetable. It doesn't know what is taught in lectures, but it is \" entirely clear about the content of the course\". This response can be described only as truly pathetic. Either this is a laughably crude form of obstruction of my request, or perhaps, even more frighteningly, the university really believes that its endless box-ticking documents actually provide some useful control of quality. Perhaps the latter interpretation is more charitable. After all, the QAA, CHRE, UUK and every HR department share similar delusions about what constitutes quality. Perhaps it is just yet another consequence of having science run largely by people who have never done it and don't understand it. Validation is a business. The University of Wales validates no fewer than 11,675 courses altogether. Many of these are perfectly ordinary courses in universities in Wales, but they validate 594 courses at non-Welsh accredited institutions, an activity that earned them \u00a35,440,765 in the financial year 2007/8. There's nothing wrong with that if they did the job properly. In the two cases I've looked at, they haven't done the job properly. They have ticked boxes but they have not looked at what's being taught or who is teaching it. The University of Kingston The University of Kingston offers a [\"BSc (Hons)\" in acupuncture](http://www.kingston.ac.uk/acupuncturebsc/). In view of the fact that the [Pittilo group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235) has recommended degrees in acupuncture, there is enormous public interest in what is taught in such degrees, so I asked. They sent the usual boring validation documents and a couple of sample exam papers . The questions were very clinical, and quite beyond the training of acupuncturists. The validation was done by a panel of three, Dr Larry Roberts (Chair, Director of Academic Development, Kingston University), Mr Roger Hill (Accreditation Officer, British Acupuncture Accreditation Board) and Ms Celia Tudor-Evans (Acupuncturist, College of Traditional Acupuncture, Leamington Spa). So nobody with any scientific expertise, and not a word of criticism. | | Further to your recent request for information I am writing to advise that the University does not hold the following requested information: (1) Lecture handouts/notes and powerpoint presentations for the following sessions, mentioned in Template 3rd year weekend and weekday course v26Aug2009_LRE1.pdf (a) Skills 17: Representational systems + Colour & Sound ex. Tongue feedback 11 (b) Mental Disease + Epilepsy Pulse feedback 21 (c) 18 Auricular Acupuncture (d) Intro. to Guasha + practice Cupping, moxa practice Tongue feedback 14 (2) I cannot see where the students are taught about research methods and statistics. I would like to see Lecture handouts/notes and PowerPoint presentations for teaching in this area, but the 'timetables' that you sent don't make clear when or if it is taught. The BSc Acupuncture is delivered by a partner college, the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine (CICM), with Kingston University providing validation only. As such, the University does not hold copies of the teaching materials used on this course. In order to obtain copies of the teaching materials required you may wish to contact the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine directly. This completes the University's response to your information request. So again we see that Kingston has validated the course but has not seen a timetable, far less what is taught. My reply was thus | | Yes I am exceedingly unhappy about it. The university attaches its name to the course so it must obviously be able to get the material simply by asking for it (I'm surprised that the university should endorse a course without knowing what is taught on it, but that's another matter). I request formally that you obtain this material. If necessary please read this as a formal appeal. I await with interest. In every single case so far, the internal review has merely confirmed the initial refusal. It means a bit of a delay before the case goes to the Information Commisssioner's Office. Napier University Edinburgh Napier University runs a \" [BSc (Hons) Herbal medicine](http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U74301.htm?Nav=2)\". (brochure [here](http://www2.napier.ac.uk/newsnew/upload/foi/FHLS_CommHealth_HerbMed_15092004103945.pdf)). Since herbal medicine is a subject of the [Pittilo recommendations](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235), there is enormous public interest in what they teach. So I asked, under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act (2002). They sent quite quickly validation and accreditation documents, some examination papers, timetables and lecture lists. The validation was the usual vacuous box-ticking stuff though it did reveal that the course \"made extensive use of techniques such as tongue and pulse diagnosis\", which are well known phoney diagnosis methods, about as much use as a pendulum (as used at Westminster University). As at Kingston University, the exam papers they chose to send were mostly \"pretend doctor\" stuff. One of them was Discuss the herbal practitioner's role in the management of IHD [ischaemic heart disease) How one would like to see what the students said, and, even more one would like to see the model answer. Amateurs who try to treat potentially serious conditions are a danger to the public. So then we got to the interesting bit, the request for actual teaching materials. | | I have looked at the material that you sent and I'd now like to make the following supplementary request (A) Lecture notes/handouts and powerpoint slides for the following small smaple HRB09102 Materia Medica 4 Materia (HRB09104) HRB09100 Materia Medica Herbal Practice BSc Herbal Medicine : Materia Medica HRB07102 Lastly, I can see nowhere in the timetable, lectures that deal with Research methods, clinical trial design and statistics. No prizes for guessing the result Total refusal to send any of them. To make matters worse, the main grounds for refusal were the very \"commercial interests\" which, after careful legal examination, the Information Commissioner (for England and Wales) had decided were invalid. They say too that \"The public interest in withholding the information is greater than the public interest in its release\".. It is hard to see how the public interest is served by concealing from the people who pay for the degrees what is taught on degrees that [Pittilo wants](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2329) to make compulsory. [ [Download the whole response](/Prof_Colquhoun_FOISA_Response_071009.pdf)] The matter is now under internal appeal ( [read the appeal](/napier-herbal-appeal.pdf)) and eventually we shall find out whether the Scottish Information Commissioner backs the judgement. Robert Gordon University Aberdeen This case has particular interest because the Vice-Chancellor of Robert Gordon University is [ Professor Michael Pittilo](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece), chair of the highly contentious steering group that recommended degress in CAM. Robert Gordon University (RGU) does not teach herbal medicine or acupuncture. But they do run [An Introduction to Homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/prospectus/modules/disp_moduleView.cfm?Descriptor=NU3786). All the degrees in homeopathy have closed. It is perhaps the daftest and most discredited of all the popular forms of [Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). But Professor Pittilo thinks it is an appropriate subject to teach in his university. So again I asked for information under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. They sent me quite quckly a list of the powerpoint presentations used on the courses [ [download it](RGU_FOI_230709_1_Homeopathy_course_materials.pd)]. I asked for a small sample of the powerpoints. And again the university did not possess them! | | I should like to see only the following three powerpoint presentations in the first instance, please. Please can you let me know also who produced the powerpoints. (1) Evidence for homeopathy I note that you will have to request them but since they are being offered as part of a course offered by RGU, so RGU is responsible for their quality, I presume that this should cause no problem. The request was refused on much the same grounds as used by Napier University. As usual, the internal review just confirmed the initial proposal (but dropped the obviously ludicrous public interest defence). The internal review said \"it is mainly the quality of our courses (including course material) and teaching which has given us the position of \"the best modern university in Scotland\" I am bound to ask, if the university is so proud of its course material, why is it expending so much time and money to prevent anyone from seeing a small sample of it? My appeal has been sent to the Scottish Information Commissioner [ [download the appeal](/appeal-to-Scottish-info-commissioner-RGU.pdf)]. What are vice-chancellors thinking about? I find it very difficult to imagine what is going through the heads of vice-chancellors who run courses in mumbo-jumbo. Most of them don't believe a word of it (though Michael Pittilo might be an exception) yet they foist it on their students. How do they sleep at night? Recently the excellent Joe Collier wrote a nice BMJ blog which applauded the lack of respect for authority in today's students, [Joe Collier says good riddance to old-fashioned respect](http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2009/10/05/joe-collier-says-good-riddance-to-old-fashioned-respect/). I couldn't resist leaving a comment. | | I couldn't agree more. There is nothing quite so unnerving as being addressed as \"Sir\". It is an advantage of age that you realise what second-rate people come to occupy very grand positions. Still odder since, if occasionally they are removed for incompetence, they usually move to an even grander position. I guess that when I was an undergraduate, I found vice-chancellors somewhat imposing. That is, by and large, not a view that survives closer acquaintance. Should teaching materials be open to the public? There is only one university in the world that has, as a matter of policy, made all of its teaching material open to the public, that is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I can recommend strongly course 18.06, a wonderful set of [lectures on Linear Algebra](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/CourseHome/#features) by Gilbert Strang. (It is also a wonderful demonstration of why blackboards may be better than Powerpoint for subjects like this). Now they are on [YouTube too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c). A lot of other places have made small moves in the same direction, as discussed recently in Times Higher Education, [Get it Out in the Open](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=408300&c=2). Now the OU is working with other British universities to help them develop and share open course materials. In June, at the celebrations for the 40th anniversary of the OU, Gordon Brown announced funding to establish the Support Centre for Open Resources in Education at the OU, as part of a \u00a37.8 million grant designed to enhance the university's national role. The funding follows a separate grant of \u00a35.7 million from the Higher Education Funding Council for England for universities across the sector to make thousands of hours of free learning materials available. Much material is available on the web, when individual teachers choose to place it there, but at the same time there is a move in the other direction. In particular, the widespread adoption of Moodle has resulted in a big decrease in openness. Usually you have to be registered on a course to see the material. Even other people in the university can't see it. I think that is a deplorable development (so, presumably, does HEFCE). Conclusion I was told by the Univerity of Kingston that \"The course is one which the University has validated and continues to be subject to the University's quality assurance procedures, such as internal subject reviews, annual monitoring and external examining\" The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that \"quality arrurance procedures\" work about as well in universities as they did in the case of [baby Peter](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/baby-p/5313303/Baby-Peter-failed-by-NHS-staff-who-saw-him-35-times.html). No doubt they were introduced with worthy aims. But in practice they occupy vast amounts of time for armies of bureaucrats, and because the brain does not need to be engaged they end up endorsing utter nonsenes. The system is broken. Resistance is futile. You can see a lot of the stuff here It is hard to keep secrets in the internet age. Thanks to many wonderful people who have sent me material. you can see plenty of what is taught, despite the desperate attempts of vice-chancellors to conceal it. Try these links.

Chinese medicine and herbal medicine are i [n the news at the moment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007). There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting [ the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people. The proposed 'regulation' would do nothing to protect the public. Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety. The government's idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are 'properly trained'. But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place. The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous. Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this? That's easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation committees simply don't look. They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on. Here's some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these 'degrees'. These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places. Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook, SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology, It gets worse. Plain wrong. Curious indeed. The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse. Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill. Here's another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer. Herbal approaches for patients with cancer. I've removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having these dangerous fantasies revealed. The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons). First get them scared with some bad statistics. No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of [statistics at Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153) might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better ( [from CDC](#)). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2. Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3 The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939). It certainly poses a huge danger to patients. It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a 'tonic' was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The [Prince of Wales' company](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), Duchy Originals recently [fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html), and his herbal 'remedies' were [ zapped by the MHRA (](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm)Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course the [ antioxidant myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90) is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\"! That sounds terrific. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a [part of NHS Evidence. It ](http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/) was [launched in 2006](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm). The clinical lead was none other than [Peter Fisher](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22), clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen's homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22) (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that Centella asiatica, is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in [its herb list](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm). It does get a mention in [Cochrane reviews](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search) but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. What on earth is a \"lymph remedy\". Just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.\" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn't the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn't mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. Ah the mistletoe story, again. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists [ three completed assessments](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search). One concludes that more research is needed. Another concludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". NCCAM [says of mistletoe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe) - More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see [Question 6](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21)). - Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see [Question 7](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25)). - The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=Patient&language=English)(FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). - The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=Patient&language=English)research (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). Cochrane reviews lists conclusions. [For example](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html) \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find. A post on that topic is in the works. \"Indicated for cancers . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung\". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis) makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn't mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey's treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public. Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp) you get \"a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people []](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6) carrot juice was given instead. [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853) says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It's nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( [from a talk by Melinda Wharton](http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf)). Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies, Take a look at [Vaccine-preventable diseases](http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/). This is the sort of 'education' which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. [Smallpox in Baltimore,](http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html) USA, 1939. This man was not vaccinated. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. Pittilo's idea that imposing this sort of miseducation will help safety is obviously and dangerously wrong. The Department of Health must reject the Pittilo recommendations on those grounds. "}
