For questions related to this update, please contact the FAERS electronic submission coordinator at [faersesub@fda.hhs.gov](mailto:faersesub@fda.hhs.gov). This page provides drug and nonvaccine biological product manufacturers, distributors, packers, outsourcing facilities, and other interested parties with information about FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) electronic submissions and instructions on how to electronically submit postmarketing individual case safety reports (ICSRs) with and without attachments. Since 2000, FDA has accepted electronic submissions of both expedited and non-expedited Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) for human drug and nonvaccine biologic products. To date, FDA has only accepted electronic submissions of ISCRs in the XML format, prepared in accordance with [International Conference on Harmonisation-E2B (ICH E2B)](/media/76278/download) (PDF - 266KB) to transmit information directly from database-to-database using standardized (ICH E2B(M)) data elements. Starting June 10, 2015,* FDA is requiring that applicants electronically submit all ICSRs, ICSR attachments, and periodic safety reports. There are two options for submitting ICSRs electronically: - Database-to-database transmission ( \"E2B\") - The Safety Reporting Portal (SRP) by manually entering the data via our SRP portal. - Attachments: for both methods, we will only accept attachments in the PDF format. *FDA issued a final rule on June 10, 2014, that requires industry to submit post-marketing safety reports in an electronic format. See the rule at: [FDA issues final rule on postmarketing safety report in electronic format](http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170111002213/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm400526.htm) (FDA Archive).
