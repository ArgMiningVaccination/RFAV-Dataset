But how do severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections afflict children? The COVID-19 pandemic has yielded many surprises, not leas t that children generally develop less severe disease than older adults, which is unusual for a re-s piratory disease. However, some children can develop serious complications from COVID-19, such as multisystem inflamma tory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and Long Covid, even after mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. Why this occ urs in some and not others is an important question.Although children generally de velop mild COVID-19, s ome can develop severe d isease, and so it is impor tant they are protected.M oreover, when children do contract COVID-19, understanding t heir role in transmission, especially in schools and at home, i s crucial to ensuring effective mitigation measures. Therefore, i n addition to nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as im-p roved ventilation, there is a strong case to vaccinate children so as to reduce possible long-term effects from infection and to decrease transmission. But questions remain about whether v accination might skew immune responses to variants in the lo ng term. As the experts discuss below, more is being learned a bout these important issues, but much more research is n eeded to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 in c hildren. -Gemma K.

Herold2, C. Herold1,3W hy infants and young children have milder clinical courses with C OVID-19, accounting for ~0.1% of deaths, but are more vulnerable to es tablished pathogens has been a key question since the onset of the pandemic. T his may be attributed to differences in suscep-t ibility. All segments of the population were na\u00efve to SARS-CoV-2, whereas older children and adults ha ve protective immunity to es tablished viruses because of prior exposures and vaccines. Although the underrepresenta tion of children in severe COVID-19 cases was initially h ypothesized to reflect decreased susceptibility, no ag e-associated difference in household transmission, expression of angiotensin-con verting enzyme 2 (ACE2, the receptor for viral cell y), antibody titers against other coronaviruses, or SARS-C oV-2 viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs have been detected ( 1-4). These findings, coupled with immunological studies, suggest tha t the more favorable outcomes likely reflect rapid engagement of the pedia tric mucosal immune system.Studies of immune responses in hospitalized children and adults during the f irst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic found that pedia tric patients had less robust memory T cell responses and lower neutr alizing and Fc g-receptor activating antibody responses than adults ( 2, 5). Coupled with data showing an age-dependent decrease in serum le vels of the cytokines interferon- g and interleu-k in-17, these findings suggested that children may mount a more vig orous innate (pathogen nonspecific) response that promotes vi-r al clearance and precludes the robust adaptive immune response t o SARS-CoV-2 that contributes to severe disease in adults ( 2). This h ypothesis was strengthened by direct study of mucosal responses a t the time of COVID-19 diagnosis: RNA sequencing data and mea-surement of c ytokines demonstrated a brisk innate response in the nasal mucosa of children versus adults ( 3). These findings may be a consequence of tr ained immunity resulting from more frequent r espiratory infections in children, leading to higher baseline innate a ctivity in pediatric relative to adult nasal mucosae ( 6, 7).Another h ypothesis is that the na\u00efve character of the pediatric adaptive immune sys tem contributes to milder outcomes. Analysis of peripher al blood immune cells in pediatric and adult COVID-19 p atients showed an increased frequency of na\u00efve T cells, deple-tion of na tural killer (NK) cells, and a lower frequency of cytotoxic T cells in children compared with adults ( 6). Likewise, the T cell receptor reper toire from young children who seroconverted after C OVID-19 showed reduced clonal expansion compared with adults ( 8). The skewing away from cytotoxic activity may avert an over-e xuberant adaptive immune response that contributes to hyperin-flamma tion, which is characteristic of severe disease.C linical experiences with newer SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are potentially more tr ansmissible, suggest that the innate response continues to pla y an important role, although there is concern that future variants with greater capacity to evade innate immu-nit y may emerge. Thus, vaccinations, which are also approved for young children, are critical as S ARS-CoV-2 transitions from a pan-demic to an endemic virus. N otably, vaccines also protect against MIS- C, a rare but potentially severe post-COVID-19 pediatric sequela. T he findings underscore that differences in outcomes with n ew and old infections depend on the host, their prior infectious his tory and immune status, and the pathogen(s) involved. Studies across the ag e spectrum are needed to identify these contributing fac tors and guide public health policies. W hy do some children de velop MIS-C? By Janet Chou4,5 and Adrienne Randolph4,6,7A n obese but otherwise healthy 9-year-old develops fevers, r ashes, vomiting, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, elevated inflamma-t ory markers, and coagulopathy. He had asymptomatic COVID-19 4 w eeks before displaying these symptoms. Owing to myocarditis and h ypotension, he receives immunosuppressive dosing of intravenous im munoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids, enabling recovery in 1 w eek. This case is representative of MIS-C ( 9, 10), defined by fever, i nflammation, and involvement of at least two organ systems and r equiring hospitalization. Coronary artery aneurysms occur in over 8 % of patients (11). Unlike acute COVID-19, MIS-C is a postinfectious s yndrome occurring within 3 to 6 weeks of mild or asymptomatic S ARS-CoV-2 infection (9). Although severe COVID-19 occurs most f requently in the elderly, healthy children between 6 and 12 years of a ge most commonly develop MIS-C. In 2020, MIS-C occurred in ~3 in 10,000 US persons under 21 years, with a mortality rate of ~0.8%. Ob esity is present in ~30% of children with MIS-C ( 12), but its role a nd what triggers MIS-C remain unknown. The incidence and sever-it y of MIS-C are lower after infections with the Omicron variant, c ompared to the Alpha or Delta variants. This has been attributed to d ifferences in inflammatory responses associated with each variant a nd enhanced host immunity after COVID-19 vaccinations or SARS-C oV-2 reinfections (13, 14). P atients with have activated neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells ( 15, 16). Increased circulating c hemokines and cytokines facilitate homing of these activated im-m une cells to inflamed organs, most commonly the gastrointestinal a nd cardiovascular systems. Autoantibodies occur in some patients w ith MIS-C, but it is unknown if they drive autoimmunity or are by-p roducts of a hyperinflamed state. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein s tructural similarities to superantigens that can nonspecifically acti-v ate T cells (12). The expansion of T cells with specific T cell receptor V b repertoires, a characteristic of superantigen activation, has been o bserved in some patients with MIS-C ( 17). A lthough effective treatments for MIS-C are available, the causes o f this postinfectious syndrome remain unclear.

The hypothesis of pe rsistent, low-level SARS-CoV-2 replication driving MIS-C is based o n one study finding circulating SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a sub-s et of patients with MIS-C ( 12), although this was not replicated ( 18). Si milarly, extremely rare cases of MIS-C occurring after COVID-19 v accination prompted concerns that vaccine-derived spike protein c ould be a trigger (19). However, studies have shown that COVID-19 v accination reduces the risk of MIS-C ( 20), possibly by reducing the r isk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the overall incidence of MIS-C is d ecreasing. Drivers of hyperinflammation, including genetic vari-an ts impairing restraint of immune activation, have been identified a s additional risk factors ( 12). Future studies need to resolve this pa radox of a hyperinflammatory disease affecting previously healthy c hildren with antecedent asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infec-t ions. The identification of early biomarkers of hyperinflammation m ay address the unpredictable onset of MIS-C, a feature shared by t he development of Long Covid, another incompletely understood sy ndrome that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection.L ong and young peopleBy Binita Kane8 and Sammie McFarland9Although mos t children recover fully from COVID-19, some will h ave persistent symptoms. Global prevalence estimates of Long Covid in children v ary from 1:4 to 1:100 depending on cohort, m ethodology, and definition ( 21). The Office of National Statistics (ONS) es timates that ~120,000 children in the UK are suffering the effects of Long Covid, with 26,000 having symptoms for >1 year ( 22). A quarter of children experienced persistent symptoms months af ter hospitalization with acute COVID-19 infection, with almos t 1 in 10 experiencing multisystem involvement ( 23). In total, over 200 dif ferent symptoms have been reported, affecting every organ sys tem. Emerging evidence from case studies, patient-led charities, and pedia tric services set up to treat Long Covid highlight tha t children are also affected by Long Covid after initial mild or asymptoma tic illness ( 24). However, there are challenges in interpre ting the existing literature, particularly with regards to d efining \"control groups\" in a population that has had high levels of COVID -19 infection. Owing to the he terogeneity of symptoms, diagnosing Long Co-vid in children is challenging , especially in the absence of estab-lished biomark ers of disease. The first research definition of Long Covid in children and young people was published recently ( 25). T his acknowledges that the lack of complete recovery after acute infec tion with SARS-CoV-2 for >4 weeks is concerning, but symp-toms persis tent at 12 weeks are required to meet the definition of L ong Covid. An international consensus for a pediatric Long Covid d efinition is anticipated in 2023; this will be an important step in the illness being recognized and manag ed consistently. Children with Long Covid can be divided into those unable to r eturn to normal life because of symptoms such as (but not limited to) pain, fa tigue, post-exertional symptom exacerbation, head-aches, and cognitive dif ficulties, and those who have additional pos tinfectious complications, such as pediatric multisystem in-flamma tory syndrome (PIMS), acute neurological disease, myocar-ditis, and other potential ac ute or subacute illnesses ( 21). Although the e vidence for underlying biomedical causes of the long-term impac t of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults is growing quickly, there S ome children who were hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as some with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, develop Long Covid.1 146 9 SEPTEMBER 2022 VOL 377 ISSUE 66110909P erspectives_15714496.indd 11469/ 1/22 5:57 PM Downloaded from https://www.science.org at University of Pennsylvania on May 15, 2023 P HOTO: VNA XINHUA/EYEVINE/REDUXS CIENCE science.orgis a paucity of similar studies in children, limiting our understand-ing of the disease in young people. P otential mechanisms underly-ing L ong Covid include viral persistence in tissues, disorders of coagula tion, immune dysfunction, and autoantibody production ( 21). At the population health level, there is a suggestion that the incidence of t ype 1 diabetes is increased in children with Long Covid, although the cause of this is unclear and requires fur ther in vestigation (26). There are currently no longitudinal studies that repor t outcomes for recovery in children.A subs tantial global biomedical research effort, alongside c ooperation with patients and families, is required to understand the long-term impac t of Long Covid in children and to develop ef-fec tive services and therapies. Limiting severity of disease through v accination and taking preventive steps to mitigate against airborne virus tr ansmission, such as improving indoor ventilation in schools, remain impor tant tools to prevent the burden of Long Covid increasing in children. T his is especially important for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where additional fac tors such as poor sanita tion, overcrowding, and malnutrition pose fur ther risks to child health ( 27). What is the r ole of children in t ransmission of SARS-CoV-2? By Deepti Gurdasani10 and Christina Pagel11T here is now unequivocal evidence that children play an impor-tant role in the tr ansmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly within school and household se ttings. The role that a person or group pla ys in transmission is dictated by a combination of exposure (how lik ely they are to get exposed to infection), susceptibility (how lik ely they are to get infected if exposed), and transmissibil-i ty (how likely they are to transmit to others if infected). Although the dif ferent contributions of these are difficult to disentangle ( 28, 29 ), the important role of children in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is lik ely due to higher levels of exposure in schools. Early studies probably underes timated susceptibility in children ( 28-30) by not considering both lower rela tive exposure in children during periods of lock down and school closures, and that children are less lik ely to be symptomatic than adults ( 31, 32), and so are less likely to be identif ied as cases.School e xposure is high for two main reasons. Schools involve hundreds of children mixing daily in crowded indoor spaces tha t are of ten poorly ventilated, facilitating transmission. Addition-ally , infection in children is easily missed because they are more lik ely to have asymptomatic, relatively mild, or atypical symptoms compared to adults ( 31, 32); and they can be harder to test if C OVID-19 is suspected. Studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2 infec tion may go undetected among children, who can be \"silent\" asymptoma tic spreaders in school outbreaks, which then spread into the communit y (33). Contemporaneous surveillance data from the UK ONS (based on r andom COVID-19 testing of households in England) ( 32) showed that symptom-based testing vastly underes-tima ted actual case incidence and prevalence in children.T he clearest findings about the role of children in community tr ansmission come from studies that showed substantial reduc-tions and increases in pandemic growth when schools were closed and opened, respec tively ( 34). Random survey data from the ONS ( 32) indicate repeated increases in, and spread from, school-age children into parental ag e groups, with increases in infection r ates in children predating increases in other age groups after school opening . Very large studies of adults living with children in the US (35), UK (36), and Denmark (37) have shown a higher risk of infec tion among households with children. More recently, g enomic studies have also confirmed superspreading events within schools tha t then spread infections back into the community ( 33). F ortunately, studies also show that robust multilayered mitigation measures within schools can grea tly reduce school outbreaks and are associa ted with lower community prevalence ( 35). T o reduce the role that children play in transmission of SARS-C oV-2, and to limit the impact of COVID-19 on children's health and tha t of their families, it is important to reduce exposure and t ransmission through safer school environments (improving air qualit y through investing in better ventilation and air cleaning), using N95/FFP2 masks during high or increasing communit y t ransmission, vaccination, accessible case ascertainment (e.g., sa-liv a testing), and public information on how to make homes safer e nvironments. Key areas of future research include understanding reinfec tions in children (How often do they occur? What are the risks of L ong Covid or severe disease?); variant-specific effects on immune escape, reinfec tion, and transmission; and developing v accines or boosters that are safe for children but provide longer protec tion against infection, particularly for under-12s; quantifying t he long-term benefits of reduction in airborne disease; and better a ir quality, through investment in cleaner air in schools. Children play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and so mitigation m easures at schools are especially important.9 SEPTEMBER 5:57 PM Downloaded from https://www.science.org at University of Pennsylvania on May 15, 2023 INSIGHTS | PERSPECTIVESP HOTO: GERARDO VIEYRA/NURPHOTO/GETTY Hotez12,13,14,15,16,17T he rationale for vaccinating children is clear: The recent waves of C OVID-19 caused by the Delta and Omicron variants have taught us tha t infections with SARS-CoV-2 are not as benign for children as pre viously thought. In the US, more than 1200 children have los t their lives due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began ( 38), a number equiv alent to or higher than the 300 children who die annually from all v accine-preventable illnesses ( 39). Globally, the U nited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that ~17,000 children and adolescents ha ve lost their lives to COVID-19, with ~50% of those being under the ag e of 10 years ( 40). However, this number is based on 4. 4 million overall global COVID-19 deaths from 91 countries, which is g enerally considered an underestimate. T he new World Health Organization determination of 14.9 million e xcess global deaths (41), together with a UNICEF finding that 0 .4% of COVID-19 deaths occur among children and adolescents ( 40), could suggest that as many 60,000 children and adolescents ha ve died so far. This number would place pediatric COVID-19 dea ths on par with those caused by some other vaccine-prevent-able diseases such as pedia tric meningitis and other illnesses caused by the bac terium Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and high as measles-related deaths ( 42).C OVID-19 vaccines are now approved or increasingly available for immunizing children over the ag e of 6 months. Beyond their potential to reduce dea ths from COVID-19 are the actual measured b enefits of vaccinating children. In the US Delta variant wave in the summer-fall of 2021, mos t hospitalizations occurred among u nvaccinated adolescents\u2014only 8% of hospitalized adolescents were fully v accinated\u2014although this number rose to just over 20% when Omicron infec tions first accelerated in the final month of 2021 ( 43). Another study found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNT ech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were over 90% effective at protec ting against MIS-C ( 44). Vaccinated children are also less susceptible to COVID -19 infection overall ( 45), although the cur-rent v accines are less effective in children against symptomatic infec tion with the Omicron variant ( 46). Still missing are data on v accinating children to prevent Long Covid or its neurologi-cal complica tions. However, based on evidence from adults, some pedia tric societies currently advocate for pediatric COVID-19 v accinations on this basis ( 47). Also lacking are studies on vaccine access, equit y, and effectiveness for children with intellectual and d evelopmental disabilities. Additionally, extensive pharmacovigi-lance s tudies in the US and Europe have so far confirmed the s afety of pediatric COVID-19 immunizations, but such studies need to be e xtended to LMICs. Despite the bene fits of pediatric COVID-19 vaccinations and the enthusias tic support from most pediatric societies, parental ac-ceptance for v accinating their children remains low. For instance, in man y US Southern states, only 14 to 15% of children aged 5 to 11 h ave received a COVID-19 vaccination. Adding to these concerns is rising antiv accine activism that targets all pediatric vaccina-tions, including those for COVID -19. Therefore, there is urgency to a ccelerate educational efforts for parents about the seriousness of C OVID-19 infections in children and the positive health impact of immuniza tions. In parallel, expanded studies on vaccine effective-ness are needed for pedia tric COVID-19 vaccinations. This is true for both the recently authorized mRN A vaccines and newer and n ext-generation platform technologies (including universal coro-navirus vaccines). These vaccines might eventually be incorporated into routine childhood immuniza tion programs to avoid future corona virus infection vulnerabilities among new birth cohorts. P ediatric COVID-19 immunizations must be prioritized by policy-m akers and practitioners committed to global child health. O riginal antigenic sin and childhood immune r esponses ag ainst SARS-CoV-2By Sarah Cobey18 and Scott E. Hensley19C hildren's first exposures to SARS-CoV-2, whether through infec-tion or v accination, might shape the specificity of their immune re-sponses to S ARS-CoV-2 variants for the rest of their lives. Previous s tudies on influenza virus infections may inform how childhood S ARS-CoV-2 infections affect long-lived immunity. Thomas Francis J r. coined the phrase \"original antigenic sin\" in 1960 to describe t he observation that antibody responses elicited by childhood in-fluenza virus infec tions can be recalled later in life upon exposure to antig enically distinct influenza viruses ( 48). This recall can lead t o different patterns of antibody specificity among individuals ex-posed to the same influenza virus s train. But it remains uncertain whe ther de novo immune responses to new antigens are dimin-ished by these pre vious exposures and recalled immune memory. T he specificity of antibody responses to influenza virus arises from t argeting different epitopes. Often, these responses target epitopes tha t are conserved between contemporary and childhood viral s trains. This bias can be beneficial when antibodies are neutral-izing , but potentially detrimental when these epitopes change in the virus, leading to a loss of antibody recognition and grea ter risk of infec tion (49). Evidence suggests that variation in risk of medi- 1 148 9 SEPTEMBER 2022 VOL 377 ISSUE 66110909P erspectives_15714496.indd 11489/ 1/22 5:57 PM Downloaded from https://www.science.org at University of Pennsylvania on May 15, 2023 SCIENCE science.orgcally attended influenza virus infection and vaccine effectiveness b etween influenza seasons and age groups arises partly from these i diosyncratic interactions with immune memory ( 50-54).I s original antigenic sin relevant to COVID-19 vaccination a nd SARS-CoV-2 infections of children? Although the answer is c urrently unknown, it is likely that the specificity of antibody responses to a S ARS-CoV-2 variant is influenced by exposure his-t ory. For example, Omicron infection elicits a broader neutralizing antibody response in v accinated adults compared to those who a re unvaccinated, leading to higher neutralizing antibody titers to Omicron and Delta s trains in vaccinated individuals ( 55). The specif icity and magnitude of antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infec tion appear to be influenced by vaccination status ( 56), but i t is difficult to interpret differences in immune data between v accinated and unvaccinated individuals because unvaccinated individuals t ypically encounter more antigen during their infec-t ions. Furthermore, it is unknown how different exposures affect immune memor y over the long term in children and adults. T o understand the role of antigenic sin in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, i t is important to continue to investigate the magnitude, specificity, a nd functionality of B and T cell responses elicited by sequential S ARS-CoV-2 exposures in animal models and humans. It will also b e important to directly compare different types of SARS-CoV-2 vac-c ines in people with different exposure histories. For example, mRNA v accines might promote better de novo responses than some other v accine platforms in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 immunity b ecause these vaccines elicit very long-lived germinal centers (where B cells evolve to become high-affinity plasma cells that produce s pecific antibodies) (57) that prolong the availability of antigens to b oth na\u00efve and memory B cells. Longitudinal studies are important t o elucidate the short- and long-term effects of different SARS-CoV-2 e xposures on immune memory, infection risk, and vaccine effective-n ess in children.REFERENCES AND NOTES 1.
