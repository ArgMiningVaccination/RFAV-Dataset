Do vaccines cause autism? What is the VICP? How does the U.S. government really treat children injured by vaccines? Those questions are answered in a compelling video from the Canary Party, a political group that stands up for victims of medical injury, environmental toxins and industrial foods. Though [dozens of published studies](http://canaryparty.net/index.php/the-news/97-research-that-shows-that-vaccines-can-cause-autism) show that vaccines are linked to autism, and tens of thousands of reports per year of post-vaccinal regression continue to [roll in to the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Activities/vaers.html), according to The Canary Party, the U.S. government and pharmaceutical companies routinely deny it - and prevent vaccine injury victims from receiving treatment and justice. The new video is narrated by actor/comedian/activist Rob Schneider, a parent concerned about government intrusion into families' healthcare choices for their children, and the increasing reports of vaccine-injured children. When the SNL alum was approached about the project, he was eager to sign on, saying, \"This fight is like the Civil Rights fight. I only hope this is 1963... not 1953!\" Schneider does not have a vaccine injured child, but was disturbed by what he learned about the vaccine program while looking in to vaccinating his own baby, \"What upset me the most is the inequity in this system. Parents vaccinate their children after being told that it will keep their child healthy. Then when some suffer devastating disability instead, the system abandons them and sweeps the damage under the carpet. No one is accountable, these families are left devastated and it's wrong.\" The video illustrates The Canary Party's understanding of how the current autism epidemic is rooted in the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which Congress passed to [shield vaccine manufacturers](http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/10/argument-preview-does-the-national-childhood-vaccine-injury-act-shield-manufacturers-from-design-defect-claims/) from liability for injuries and deaths caused by vaccines. \"Reports of adverse reactions to the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP) vaccine had caused consumers to question its safety, and manufacturers lobbied for relief from potential lawsuits,\" said Ginger Taylor, Vice President of The Canary Party. \"With that financial obstacle removed, pharmaceutical companies then pushed government agencies to add more and more vaccines to the recommended childhood schedule.\" In the 27 years since VICP was created, Congress has never investigated the program to explore the possible negative health effects of giving 70+ vaccinations to a child,\" said Wayne Rohde, who has submitted dozens of FOIA requests to CDC on vaccine safety issues only to have them ignored. \"Currently [1 in 6 ](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/health/story/2011/05/One-in-six-children-have-a-developmental-disability/47467520/1)children receive special education (3) and HHS reports that [50% of children](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285910002500) have a chronic medical condition such as asthma, allergies, diabetes or immune disorders (4).\" ...\"We are thrilled that Rep. Darrell Issa will be holding a second round of vaccine hearings this fall in the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, to examine just what is happening in the VICP,\" said Canary Party President Jennifer Larson. \"We are eager for Congress and the American people to see just how far the program has strayed from what it was intended to be when Congress put it in place in the 1980s. It has failed families and become nothing more than a tool to protect vaccine makers and cover government malfeasance in the vaccine program, to the detriment of countless children.\" The Canary Party hopes that the video will help people understand the true reasons why the vaccine debate on autism continues, and focus public and media attention on the upcoming Congressional Oversight Committee hearings in November 2013.

Dr. Foley Comments: Our children are telling us something. Autism has increased dramatically by 1500% over the last two decades. Roughly 80% of these individuals are still under the age of 22! Science shows that only 1 percent of autism cases are likely due to genetics. Is the current vaccine schedule to blame? Let's compare today's schedule to that of 1980 when autism was a relatively rare condition: Families are blocked from getting into a REAL court to prove that vaccines have caused their child's autism. Please take 5 minutes to watch this highly informative video and share it with everyone you know. Understanding the ingredients in vaccines can also help you make an informed decision. The CDC has provided [a detailed list of ingredients](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf) (adjuvants and preservatives) along with additional substances used during the manufacturing process. Children are routinely injected with multiple toxic ingredients, including formaldehyde, gluteraldehyde, aluminum hydroxide, amorphous aluminum, hydroxyphosphate sulfate, aluminum phosphate, polysorbate 80, neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B, potassium aluminum sulfate, sodium borate, and cells from monkey kidneys yeast protein, calf serum, Fenton medium (containing bovine extract), modified Latham medium (derived from bovine casein) and modified Stainer-Scholte liquid medium. In many cases, vaccines are often just the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back in a growing number of children. Babies today are born pre-polluted; exposure to toxins actually begins in the womb. Scientists have detected 287 contaminants in the umbilical cord blood of newborns, including mercury, [BPA](http://www.bodycures.com/plastics-chemical-bpa-found-in-all-children/), fire retardants, pesticides, and Teflon chemicals. Experts believe rising rates of birth defects, asthma, allergies, diabetes, neuro-developmental disorders and other serious diseases in U.S. children are a result of these early chemical exposures. Today, over half of all US kids suffer from chronic disease and disability. Fortunately, advances in bioenergetic and functional medicine now make it possible to precisely identify, measure, and gently eliminate thousands of toxic chemicals at the cellular level inside brain tissue and other affected organs. [Children can recover from chronic illness if all hidden root causes are targeted and treated](http://www.bodycures.com/holistic-medicine-for-the-21st-century/). Since blood only makes up 7% of the total body, blood tests are woefully inadequate for determining your child's toxic burden and nutritional needs. Learn more about the "}
