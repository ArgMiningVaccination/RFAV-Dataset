Consequently, millions of research dollars pour each year into medical science and technology in the hope of eradicating various sicknesses and diseases. Patients and doctors alike suffer the terrible consequences of this impossible quest for material perfection. Yet, there is an alternate view\u2014that human beings and human evolution are great enough to include \"illness\" as an essential part of existence. In the first part of the book, the author traces the history of our changing concept of healing, from the so-called temple sleep of ancient Egypt\u2014when spiritual science tells us that human beings still had a living connection with the spiritual hierarchies\u2014through the herbal lore of ancient Greece and the healings of Christ, to the rise of modern medicine, based primarily on treating symptoms. The practice of modern medicine focuses merely on removing discernable symptoms and ailments. The author, however, asserts that this does not really heal at all. Rather, true healing considers the whole human being. And, to do this, doctors must learn the language of our natural, healing life forces, which affect not only the body, but also nature and the greater cosmos. From this perspective, illness is actually a gift, a blessing that urges both patient and doctor to work together with our illnesses for the sake of something infinitely greater\u2014true healing. Blessed by Illness offers a powerful introduction to \"alternative\" methods of healing. "}
