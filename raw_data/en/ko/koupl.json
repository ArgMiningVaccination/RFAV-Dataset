[ Fees & Health Insurance ](#) Important Update: Insurance Billing at Lipscomb University Health Center In an effort to enhance our healthcare services, the Lipscomb University Health Center will introduce insurance billing for the services provided to our students beginning August 2023. We want to encourage every student to have health insurance while enrolled at Lipscomb University. The Health Center will also have cash pay options available for those that may be underinsured. To efficiently process insurance claims and manage accounts receivables, the Lipscomb University Health Center will be collaborating with Compu-Med Billing Services, Inc. This company will work closely with the Health Center staff to ensure accurate and timely processing of insurance claims while upholding HIPAA compliance. We understand that adapting to these changes may raise questions or concerns. The Health Center staff and Compu-Med Billing Services, Inc. representatives will be available to assist students and provide support throughout this transition. Our commitment to the well-being of our students remains unwavering as we strive to support their health needs while pursuing their academic goals. Please contact the Health Center at [healthservices@lipscomb.edu](mailto:healthservices@lipscomb.edu) with questions or for assistance. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we work towards delivering an improved healthcare experience for our student community.

Lipscomb University is required by law to comply with the guidelines set forth by the state of Tennessee which requires students to provide the university with proof of immunity against certain communicable diseases. [ Required Vaccinations & Screenings ](#) Vaccinations & Screenings College students have increased risk of some contagious diseases due to the close living quarters and interactions they have with one another. Because of the risk of transmission to a large number of people, some vaccines are required at Lipscomb. All students must receive the meningococcal vaccine that protects against bacterial meningitis. The Centers for Disease Control has lots of information on their [meningitis](http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/index.html) website including who is at risk, what causes it, signs and symptoms of the disease, and prevention. Required screening for all students Tuberculosis (TB) screening Students must show proof of a tuberculosis (TB) screening test, chest x-ray, or note from a provider stating he/she is at low-risk for TB, dated within the last year, on the Health Form at enrollment. We have a TB risk assessment to help you. If you give any \"yes\" answers via the TB risk assessment tool, one of our nurses must determine if you require a TB test. All pharmacy, nursing and dietetic students must have a TB test every year in the program. A TB test can be any of the following: a purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, a QuantiFERON-Tb Gold blood test, (QFT) or chest x-ray administered within the past 12 months. It's your preference on which one you receive. The QFT is a newer test that is more accurate than the traditional skin test and does not require a follow-up appointment to read the results. Those receiving PPD skin tests must follow-up 48-72 hours afterward to the clinic to have the result read by a nurse; we do not give TB skin tests on Thursdays due to not being able to read the test in the proper timeframe. If you do not return in this timeframe, the test must be repeated. If you are a returning student and have not been enrolled in school for one calendar year or more, you are required to repeat this test upon your admission. If you're traveling in a country at high risk for TB, you should get a test six to eight weeks after your return to the U.S. We can advise you on if your travel plans put you at risk for TB. Required vaccinations for all students Submit copies of documentation for MMR, Varicella and tuberculosis via [Med+Proctor](http://secure.medproctor.com). Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR)* Two doses are required to those born after 1956. If you think you have had the MMR immunizations but do not have proof, then you need to have a blood test (a titer) to see if you are immune for all three diseases. A copy of your titers is acceptable, but if you do not have acceptable levels of antibodies then you must get a booster. Varicella* Two doses are required for those born after 1979. (Or documentation of varicella infection from a health care provider. A blood test can also be taken to prove immunity.) Meningococcal A, C, Y, W (MCV4, MPSV4, Menactra, or Menveo)** Valid immunization records come from your doctor's office, health department form, high school or college records; proof of immunity by titer is also accepted with attached lab results. Required vaccinations for all students living on campus and all student nurses Meningitis** The meningitis vaccination is required for all student nurses, living off or on campus and for all students living on campus.
