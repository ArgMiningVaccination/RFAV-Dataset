These boosts can come in endless forms\u2014a wheatgrass shot in a smoothie, an afternoon siesta, a long weekend. For our skin, a boost can come in the form of a face mask\u2014a tightening, hydrating, calming, make-your-complexion-glow face mask. Our skin is constantly under attack from toxins, UV rays, and environmental impurities, which all take a toll on the complexion. While our daily skin care works to combat these damages, using an occasional face mask can be the ultimate savior because it gives the skin an additional dose of vitamins, minerals, and hydration. And that is a boost of defense against, well, the world. A face mask can draw out toxins, rid the skin of impurities, deeply hydrate, remove excess oil, and overall give skin a luminous, radiant glow. A once-a-week application can significantly benefit the complexion\u2014after just a few weeks. Now the question is: Which mask should you buy? Of course, we're partial to our [Absolute Anti-Aging Face Mask](https://www.umaoils.com/products/absolute-anti-aging-face-mask), [Ultimate Brightening Face Mask](https://www.umaoils.com/products/ultimate-brightening-face-mask), and [Deeply Clarifying Face Mask](https://www.umaoils.com/products/deeply-clarifying-face-mask). But we're also partial to whipping up our own, especially since Ayurveda makes it oh-so-easy with several star ingredients - often available in the comfort of your home! These simple but highly effective DIY face masks need just a few pantry ingredients (or maybe a quick grocery run) to make! Here's to glowing skin. (Editor's note: Our experts love hearing from you, so if you have a question about an ingredient, are looking for a substitution, or are curious for customized natural skincare solutions, please shoot us a note!) Carrot, Honey, and Lemon Mask This nutrient-rich mask works as a lightweight and brightening moisturizer. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene and vitamins C and K, three ingredients that slow down the appearance of aging, nourish, and moisturize the skin. Lemon lightens dark spots and aids in cellular turnover. Honey is an excellent natural anti-bacterial agent. Mash a medium-sized carrot in a food processor. (Alternatively you can grate it.) Add two tablespoons of organic honey and a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice to the carrot pulp. (If your skin is sensitive you can skip the lemon juice.) Apply the mixture to freshly cleansed skin. Leave on for twenty to thirty minutes then rinse off with lukewarm water. Almond, Honey, and Rosewater Mask An excellent mask for dry and/or blemished complexion. Almond flour, milk, and honey deeply nourish the skin while rosewater serves as a brightening toner. Mix two tablespoons each of milk powder and almond flour with one tablespoon each of honey and rosewater. Apply this paste evenly to the face, neck, and d\u00e9collet\u00e9. Leave on for twenty minutes (it will get a bit dry). Rinse with cold water. This mask is gentle enough to use daily. To brighten hyperpigmentation problems, apply the mask to specific spots and leave on overnight. Fenugreek with Milk Powder and Sandalwood Mask Fenugreek, an incredible antioxidant-rich medicinal herb commonly used in Ayurveda, naturally lightens dark spots, protects skin from sun damage, treats blemishes, and evens the skin's appearance. Simply put: It's amazing. Milk powder naturally contains lactic acid, calcium, potassium, magnesium, and vitamins A, B6, and C. It makes an excellent skin cleanser, leaving skin supple and soft. Mix one tablespoon each of fenugreek powder and sandalwood powder (you can also use kaolin clay) and mix in half tablespoon of milk powder. Add water to attain desired consistency then apply to the face. Leaving on for twenty to thirty minutes. Wash off with cold water. Use this mask once a week for best results. Yogurt and Egg White Mask Yogurt contains zinc and lactic acid, which respectively eases inflammation and exfoliates. Massaging plain yogurt onto the face removes dead cells, tightens the pores, eases fine lines, and hydrates. When using yogurt in your skin care make sure to stay away from the flavored and sweetened varieties. Mix the whites of two eggs and with two tablespoons of plain yogurt. Apply this mix to freshly cleansed skin and leave on for about seven minutes. Wash off with warm water then follow with a final cool water rinse. Banana and Sandalwood Mask Bananas are superstars for the skin. They're loaded with vitamin B6, iron, manganese, vitamin C, potassium, biotin, and copper. These nutrients help to rejuvenate the complexion and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. [Sandalwood](https://www.umaoils.com/ingredients/sandalwood/) helps to balance the skin's oil production\u2014for both dry and oily skin\u2014as it harmonizes the skin's natural oil production instead. Sandalwood also calms inflammations and gives the skin a radiant glow. Mash ripe banana until it reaches an even, creamy consistency. Mix in sandalwood powder. Apply the mask all over the face, neck, and d\u00e9collet\u00e9. Let it dry and leave on for twenty minutes. Rinse off with warm water. This mask is excellent for weekly use. Yogurt, Oatmeal, and Honey Mask Oatmeal gently exfoliates dead cells. Honey provides antibacterial and antimicrobial action while also being an exceptional skin moisturizer. These two ingredients combined leave skin bright, dewy, and hydrated. Mix two tablespoons of oatmeal with three tablespoons of plain yogurt. Add a dash of honey and stir together until the mixture is even. (Allow honey to come to room temperature first to allow for easier mixing.) Apply the mask to the face neck, and d\u00e9collet\u00e9. Allow to dry for ten minutes then wash off with warm water. (Add half tablespoon of powdered rice to the mix to help clear pores and rid blemishes.) - [A-Beauty,](/blogs/uma-oils/tagged/a-beauty) [Face Mask Roundup: Try Out These Natural Face Masks for Detoxification, Hydration, & Glow](/blogs/uma-oils/face-mask-roundup-try-out-these-natural-face-masks-for-detoxification-hydration-glow) The feeling of putting on a face mask after a...
