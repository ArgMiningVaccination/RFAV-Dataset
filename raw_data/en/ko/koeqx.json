What this paper adds .Eight key cultural barrier themes are identied that hinder members of ethnic minority groups from accessing eective diabetes care services. .It is proposed that these eight themes could inform professional education as to how to develop anddeliver culturally competent diabetes services for members of ethnic minority groups. .Gaps in current diabetes service delivery are identied. .Based on the ndings, suggestions are oered to improve the commissioning and diabetes service deliverytailored to the needs of ethnic minority groups with diabetes. ABSTRACT A number of reports indicate that cultural barriers may prevent members of ethnic minority groups from accessing diabetes services, but little is knownabout the specic nature of these barriers. Thissystematic review of observational studies aimedto identify and explore cultural barriers as a basis forimprovements in care. Articles published frominception to September 2011 were retrieved fromfour databases (Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane and DARE), two National Health Service specialist li- braries (Diabetes, and Ethnicity and Health),Warwick Medical School publications and referencelists. Inclusion criteria were qualitative or quanti-tative studies involving ethnic minority groups withdiabetes. Two reviewers independently conductedpaper selection and appraisal.

Although diabetes aects every society, some popu-lations are particularly susceptible but also lack under-standing of the condition (Baradaran and Knill Jones,2004; International Diabetes Federation, 2009; Alamet al, 2012). Evidence suggests that, where members of susceptible populations are in the minority, they maynot receive equitable diabetes care. This is attributed to a mixture of cultural factors and some service providers' lack of cultural competence (Hawthorneet al, 1993; Narayan and Rea, 1997; Cone et al, 2003; Brown et al, 2002; Zeh, 2010; Zeh et al, 2012; Mainous et al, 2007). The National Service Framework for Diabetes stipulates the minimum standards of dia-betes care to be oered to all patients, irrespective ofethnicity, language, culture, religion, gender, dis- ability, age and location (Department of Health, 2001). Healthcare practices should be designed toensure that health workers take into account theindividual patient's background and deliver tailoredservices (Cone et al, 2003; NHS Health Scotland, 2004). However, few studies have explored the eectsof cultural and linguistic barriers which may compro-mise the quality of care delivered to members of ethnic minority groups with diabetes (Davies, 2006; Hill, 2006; Fleming and Gillibrand, 2009). Very little isknown about how these barriers may operate in par-ticular societies, and some service providers do notappear to appreciate the nature of these barriers orhow they may prevent members of ethnic minoritygroups from receiving patient-centred diabetes care(Department of Health, 2001; Roberts, 2007; Wilson et al, 2012). A better understanding of these cultural issues may guide healthcare commissioners and clini-cal commissioning groups (CCGs) to recongurediabetes services in primary care, which may improveboth care service engagement and outcomes in min-ority populations (NHS Health Scotland, 2004).Culture is a shared and dynamic phenomenon displayed by the behaviours and attitudes of a socialgroup, which remains dicult to interpret, but requiresa good understanding by health workers (Naeem,2003). In this review, culture is dened broadly as ashared system of values, beliefs, identities, traditions,behaviours, and verbal and non-verbal patterns ofcommunication that bind a group of people together and dierentiate them from other groups (Salimbene, 1999). It encompasses beliefs, language, social normsand values, including practices which can create asense of social support and belonging for individualswho share the same core beliefs. These can bothfacilitate and impede health coping styles, access toand utilisation of healthcare services, and implemen-tation of professional advice. This study focused on the cultural barriers to accessing and use of diabetes services. In this review, the term ethnic minority group refers to a population group with an ethnic origindierent from that of the majority population of thehost country (Bulmer, 1996; Modood and Berthoud,1997). Scoping searches identied 10 reviews that reported cultural barriers among members of ethnic minority groups with diabetes. Two were systematically con- ducted reviews (Brown et al , 2002; Fleming and Gillibrand, 2009) and eight were literature reviewswith some methodological flaws, for example, reviewswith no inclusion criteria (Hawthorne et al, 1993; Davies, 2006; 2006; Gohdes, 1988; Brown, 1997; Greenhalgh, 1997, 2008; Hill, 2006). Although these reviews provided some insight intocultural barriers, the following two questions seemedto have received less attention. The present systematicreview aimed to address these. 1 What specic cultural barriers impede members of ethnic minority groups from receiving eectivediabetes care services, and how do they do so?were retrieved, 22 of which were included in thereview. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, anarrative analysis was undertaken. Eight key cul-tural issues emerged, namely participants' strongadherence to cultural norms, religious beliefs, lin- guistic diversity, low health literacy levels, dierent beliefs about health and illness, belief in expert andprofessional support, low accessibility of culturallyappropriate services/information, and low con-cordance with western professional advice. Theseissues compromised the level of diabetes care servicesreceived by members of ethnic minority groups. It is recommended that further attention is given to thedevelopment of culturally competent interventionsfor improving access to healthcare and diabetesoutcomes for members of specic ethnic minority groups.

Methods Design, search strategy, data sources and eligibility This is a systematic review, which included qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods study designs. CINAHLand MEDLINE databases were searched from incep-tion to September 2011 using the search terms listed in Table 1. In addition, searches were conducted using Cochrane and DARE databases, two NHS Evidencespecialist libraries from2004 to 2011 ( http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/ stantranet/staresources/ researchpublications/n = and behavioural change research ( n=1 ) were contacted for advice and to identify additionalstudies. The journal Diabetes Primary Care was hand searched as these articles were relevant to our topic butnot accessible via PubMed or other major databases.The inclusion criteria were as follows: .Participants: children or adults with any type of diabetes, provided that they were an ethnic min-ority population in the country of study. .Design: observational studies using qualitative orquantitative methods. Randomised controlled trialsand quasi-experimental studies are deliberatelyexcluded from consideration in this paper, as theyare included in another published review using the same search strategy (Zeh et al, 2012). .Setting: participants were recruited from any set- ting. .Reporting: studies were included if they reportedon cultural dierences and data extracted fromthemes that explored any cultural barriers. .Only primary published studies with no languagerestriction were included. The screening and mapping exercise for the papers identied as a result of the search strategy (see Table 1)identied two issues, namely cultural barriers preventing members of ethnic minority gro ups from accessing eective diabetes care services , which is the focus of this review, andculturally competent healthcare interventions in ethnic minority groups with diabetes, which has been published elsewhere (Zeh et al, 2012). We found that 'any struc- tured intervention, tailored to ethnic minority groups by Table 1 Search strategy Search terms Unless otherwise specied, search terms are free text terms: MeSH for Medical Subject Headings (CINAHL and MEDLINE systems).ti,ab; (NHS AND health AND care AND systems).ti,ab; (delivery HEALTH NURSING human*.ti,abP Zeh, HK Sandhu, AM Cannaby et al 12 integrating elements of culture, language, religion, and health literacy skills, produced a positive impact on arange of patient important outcomes' (Zeh et al, 2012, p. 1237) .This strengthens the case for further exploring and understanding specic cu ltural barriers to diabetes healthcare provision. Selection criteria All citations were downloaded into Endnote Web andduplicates removed. All types of cultural and linguisticthemes from any study involving any ethnic minoritygroup with any type of diabetes in any setting globallywere included. The titles/abstracts were independentlyscrutinised for eligibility by two reviewers (PZ for 100% of all papers, and JS or HS for 50% of the papers) using the inclusion criteria, and disagreements wereresolved through discussion and a third opinion (JSor HS or AMC). Cohen's kappa was used to test thescreening process inter-coder reliability and to calcu-late agreement levels. Cohen (1960) sets a threshold of0.85 as representing a very high level of agreement,whereas Landis and Koch (1977) stipulate limits of greater than 0.61 as a substantial agreement and greater than 0.81 as a perfect agreement. The PreferredReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram details the results ofthe screening and selection processes (see Figure 1)(Moher et al, 2009).Data extraction and quality assessment of studies One reviewer (PZ) read and re-read each of the full included publications to understand how culturalbarriers hindered the studied populations fromaccessing eective diabetes care services within the research settings. He extracted data using a revised data extraction form (Zeh et al, 2012; see Box 1). This form was piloted by three reviewers on three randomincluded papers by cross-checking independent notesfor consistency. The methodological quality of thequalitative studies was assessed using Popay et al (1998) and Jadad et al (1996) for quantitative and Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) for the mixed method research studies (see online Tables S1S3). Individual quality assessment checklists, in contrast to a universaltool (Pluye et al, 2009), were deemed more appropri- ate to facilitate specic study design assessments dueto the heterogeneity of the included studies. Data analysis A narrative synthesis of the evidence was used because of the heterogeneity of the included studies. Following coding, thematic analysis was performed for each studyand then tabulated across studies. Themes were dis-cussed among all the researchers until agreement wasreached. The results were triangulated without sep- Figure 1 Flow chart (adapted from Moher et al, 2009) for screening and including studies.Cultural barriers to accessing eective diabetes care services 13 arating the study designs (qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods) to reduce duplication of themes andto improve validity and generalisability. Results Available evidence The searches identied 316 studies (310 studies fromdatabases and 6 studies from other sources) (seeFigure 1) and of 55 potentially relevant studies (all in English), a total of 22 were included (see Table 2). The inter-coder reliability of the screening process washigh (kappa score = 0.92). Characteristics of the included studies Of the 22 included studies (see Table 2), 18 usedqualitative methods (one used mixed-qualitativemethods (Greenhalgh et al, 1998), 13 used in-depth interviews (Kelleher and Islam, 1994; Duthie-Nurse, 1998; Rhodes and et al, 2005; et al, 2005; Lawton et al, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2007, 2008), two used focusgroups (Greenhalgh et al, 2011; Brown et al, 2006), and two used case study methods (Narayan and Rea,1997; Fleming et al, 2008). Two studies used mixed methods (Greenhalgh et al, 2006; Lloyd et al, 2008) and three used quantitative methods (Naeem, 2003; Sedgwick et al, 2003; Povlsen et al, 2005). Studies were conducted in six dierent countries, namely the UK ( n = 16), the USA ( n= 2), Denmark n= 1), Sweden ( ( n= 1) and the Netherlands ( n= 1). A total of 1897 participants with varied ethnicities, of which15 were stated and two were unspecied (see Table 3),were recruited from three settings (community, pri- mary care and acute sectors). Nine studies included adults with type 2 diabetes (Greenhalgh et al, 2006,2011; Fleming et al, 2008; Lawton et al, 2005, 2007; Lloyd et al, 2008; Kohinor et al, 2011; Duthie-Nurse, 1998; Kelleher and Islam, studies involvedwomen with gestational diabetes (Narayan and Rea,1997; Hjelm et al, 2005), one study included children with type 1 diabetes (Povlsen et al, 2005), four studies included participants with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (Fagerli et al, 2005; Stone et al, 2005; Rhodes and Nocon, 2003; Rhodes et al, 2003), and ve studies did not specify the diabetes type (Brown et al, 2006; Greenhalgh et al, 1998; Naeem, 2003; Sedgwick et al, 2003; Gonzalez, 2008). The characteristics and cul-tural and linguistic needs of these populations werevaried. Participants' ages in all 22 studies ranged from 0 to 80 years. Although 21 of the studies included between 5 and 1100 ethnic minority participants each,one study (Narayan and Rea, 1997) included only oneparticipant with gestational diabetes. Quality assessment of the included studies and risk of bias Of the 22 included studies (see online Tables S1S3), 14 studies were of good quality and met 80100% of the quality criteria (scored A) (Lloyd et al, 2008; Greenhalgh et al, 1998, 2006, 2011; Kohinor et al, 2011; Gonzalez, 2008; Lawton et al, 2005, 2007; Stone et al, 2005; Hjelm et al, 2005; Fagerli et al, Nocon, 2003; Rhodes et al, 2003; Chowdhury et al, 2000). A further 8 studies were of moderate qualityand met 5079% of the quality criteria (scored B)(Fleming et al, 2008; Brown et al, 2006; 2005; Naeem, 2003; Sedgwick et al, 2003). No study scored below 50%. Ten studies in-cluded a range of dierent ethnic minority groups; thelargest was black Caribbean ( n= 522) in a UK study (Sedgwick et al, 2003), and the smallest number of minority participants involved in the studies wereLebanese ( n= 1) in a Swedish study which included 27 participants from four ethnicities (Hjelm et al, 2005). Of all the included studies, 73% ( n= 16) were published in the UK, and smaller numbers werepublished in the USA ( n= 2), Denmark ( n= 1), Sweden (n= ( n= 1) and the Netherlands ( n= 1).

Cultural adherence with regard to diet, exercise and social interactions A total of 13 studies reported strict adherence to cultural norms (Kelleher and Islam, 1994; Narayan and Rea, 1997; Greenhalgh Naeem, 2003; et al, 2005, 2006b, 2008; Stone et al, 2005; Fleming et al, 2008; Gonzalez, 2008; Kohinor et al, 2011). Participants in ten of these studies were of South Asian origin (Narayan and Rea, 1997; Kelleherand Islam, 1994; Lawton et al, 2005, 2006b, et al, 2005; Chowdhury et al, 2000; Greenhalgh et al, 1998, 2006, 2011; Fleming et al, 2008; Naeem,2003). They had strong traditions with regard to food, and their traditional dishes generally had a very highcontent of fat or deep-fried food despite awareness ofthe detrimental eects of these on health and well-being. Food classications were based on their percep-tions of the strength of the food's nourishing powers, rather than on western notions of nutritional content. Participants reported managing their diet by 'cuttingdown on' rather than replacing perceived unhealthyfoodstus (Lawton et al, 2008). Food choices were determined by two interrelated and intersecting bi-nary classications, 'strong'/'weak' and 'digestible'/'indigestible', which have social and mean-ings (Chowdhury et al, 2000). Some participants per- ceived western medicines as having detrimental eects if taken in excess or without eating traditional food-stus; this could lead to inappropriate self-adjustmentof medication without medical consultation (Lawtonet al, 2005). Surinamese participants also reported strong traditions related to food despite an awarenessof the need to change their behaviour and adapt tohealthy dietary guidelines (Kohinor et al, 2011). Some participants of South Asian origin displayed more negative attitudes towards exercising, which theyperceived as worsening their condition (Greenhalghet al, 1998; Lawton et al, 2006b). Women reported more barriers to physical exercise, including fear ofphysical harassment, gender norms, social rules andcultural expectations that women should be indoors.It was stated that diabetes 'weakened and aged' the body, and this was reported as an additional barrier to undertaking physical exercise. Social interactions, andconsumption of traditional dishes at social and cul-tural events such as weddings and religious festivalswere regarded as very important (Chowdhury et al, 2000; Duthie-Nurse, 1998; Hjelm et al, 2005; Lawton et al, 2008). There was a strong attachment to social meanings and moral worth in real-life accounts of diabetes self-management (Greenhalgh et al, 2011). Commitment to religious beliefs Religious beliefs (Muslim, Christian, Hindu and Sikh) and practices were reported in 12 studies (Greenhalghet al, 1998, 2011; Kelleher and Islam, 1994; Duthie- Nurse, Hjelm 2008; Naeem, 2003; al, 2005; Gonzalez, 2008; Chowdhury et al, 2000). Eleven of these studies reported that partici-pants, especially Muslims, demonstrated a strict com-mitment to religious beliefs about food and fastingduring Ramadan, and diabetes self-management was asecondary consideration. All but one study (Lawtonet al, 2007) identied religion and spirituality as major influences on coping with, managing and/or under- standing diabetes. Religion was seen to be a source ofTable 3 Ethnicity of ethnic minority groups Bangladeshi 222 Black African 163Black Caribbean 522 Eastern European 2 Gujarati Muslim 5Hindu 20 Indian 38 Iranian 3Iraqi 10 Lebanese 1 Multicultural ethnic minority group543 Muslim Kashmiri 106 Pakistani 121 Puerto Rican 12 South Asian 15Surinamese 32 Mixed ethnicity participant 82 Total 1897Cultural barriers to accessing eective diabetes care services 27 support in coping with anxiety in one study (Stone et al, 2005). Many studies found that most Muslim and some Hindus and Sikh participants reported an externalhealth locus of control. For example, Muslim partici-pants reported that having diabetes was the will of Allah, and thus beyond their control, and therefore they accepted their fate. They generally attributed theirbeliefs and other behaviours to Allah's will, and heldthe view that adhering to dietary choices was the dutyof an ill person. Although most of the participantswere generally concerned about the impact of poordiabetes control, some Muslim participants held anattitude of 'enjoying life and leaving the rest to Allah', which resulted in poor diabetes control, especially during fasting periods (Naeem, 2003). In studiesinvolving both ethnic minority and white Europeanadults (Lawton et al, 2007; Hjelm et al, 2005; Stone et al, 2005), the ethnic minority participants, most of whom were Muslims, showed resignation at the diag-nosis of diabetes, citing family history or a view that itwas Allah's will, whereas their white counterparts reacted with shock, denial, and concern about the perceived consequences of diabetes complications. Linguistic dierences between patients and health workers In total, 14 studies attributed ineective diabetes man- agement to communication diculties and lack of linguistically appropriate hea lthcare services (Greenhalgh et al, 1998, 2006, 2011; Duthie-Nurse, and et al, 2005; Hjelm et al, 2005; Stone et al, 2005; Lawton et al, 2005, 2006a, 2006b; Brown et al, 2006; Povlsen et al, 2005; Gonzalez, 2008). Five of these studies identied lack of knowledge about dia-betes in ethnic minority groups arising from their inability to communicate in English (Greenhalgh et al, 1998, 2011; Hjelm et al, 2005; Lawton et al, 2005; Gonzalez, 2008). In three studies, participants pre-ferred linguistically competent healthcare providers tointerpreters because they wanted communication tobe direct, and interpreters were perceived as a sourceof anxiety and frustration (Gonzalez, 2008; Brownet al, 2006; Lawton et al, 2006a). Two UK studies (Duthie-Nurse, 1998; Lawton et al, 2006b) reported that linguistic barriers between participants and thepublic limited participants' knowledge of their neigh-bourhood and reinforced their vulnerability and socialisolation, which led to some participants, especiallywomen, staying indoors. Seven studies identied a need for interpreter support (Greenhalgh et al, 1998, 2011; Rhodes and Nocon, 2003; Rhodes et al, al, 2003; et al, 2005; Povlsen et al, 2005), with fourreporting a preference for professional interpreters rather than friends, relatives or receptionists (Rhodesand Nocon, 2003; Rhodes et al, 2003; Sedgwick et al, 2003; Fagerli et al, 2005). Reliance on family members or friends to interpret was inconvenient, as it disruptedpeople's routines and responsibilities. These partici- pants also reported being uncomfortable discussing some aspects of their illness in front of their relativesor friends, and preferred to 'die in silence' (Rhodesand Nocon, 2003; Fagerli et al, 2005). Some partici- pants were unaware of the availability of local inter-pretation or advocacy services (Greenhalgh et al , 2011). Participants cited the use of medical jargon ortechnical terminology by health workers as a com- munication barrier (Fagerli et al, 2005; Stone et al, 2005; Lloyd et al, 2008). Low health literacy levels Eight studies reported low health literacy levels (low reading and numerical ability, resulting in reducedaccess to health information), which were perceivedby the specic populations as hindering them from receiving eective diabetes care services (Narayan and Rea, 1997; Greenhalgh et al, 1998, 2011; Rhodes et al, 2003; Hjelm et al, 2005; Lawton et al, 2005, 2008; Povlsen et al, 2005; Gonzalez, 2008; Lloyd et al, 2008). Some participants' lack of knowledge about diabeteswas seen as a barrier to eective glycaemic controland/or diabetes self-management. For example, someparticipants only took their prescribed oral hypo- glycaemic agents (OHAs) when their blood glucose levels were very high, over 18 mmol/l, or skippedmeals in order to avoid taking them (Lawton et al, 2005). In studies involving majority and minority popu- lations, lower levels of educational attainment werereported within the minority groups, resulting in alower level of understanding of diabetes care (Rhodes et al, 2003; Hjelm et al, 2005; Povlsen et al, 2005). The severity of the lack of literacy skills was noted in threestudies (Greenhalgh et al, 1998; Rhodes et al, 2003; Lloyd et al, 2008). Audio-visual aids were used to improve comprehension, information retention, patientcompliance and understanding if ethnic minorityparticipants could not read or write in their rstlanguage. For some participants, lay and oral sources of health information were valued highly because of their low literacy skills (Greenhalgh et al, 1998, 2006; Lloyd et al, 2008). Lay diabetes information sources, such as family or personal experiences, appeared tohave had a more profound influence on participants'behaviours than scientic evidence.P Zeh, HK Sandhu, AM Cannaby et al 28 Beliefs about health and illness In total, 11 studies reported various beliefs about health and illness based on religious, individual andsocietal factors, as well as compromising healthcareservice provision and/or concordance with profes- sional advice or treatment and Islam, 1994; Duthie-Nurse, et al, 2005; 2007; Brown et al, 2006; Naeem, 2003; Stone et al, 2005; Gonzalez, 2008). Muslim, Hindu and Sikh partici-pants reported that these factors contributed to theway they perceived health and illness. Two sub-themesemerged in relation to perceived beliefs about health and illness, namely causation and the integration of curative and diabetes self-management measures intoeveryday life. Causation Nine studies discussed perceived beliefs relating to thecause of diabetes (Lawton et al, 2006b, 2007; Greenhalgh et 2005; Naeem, 2003; Stone et al, 2005). These included heredity, cold weather, unfamiliar western lifestyles, stress, Allah's will andsupernatural factors. It was believed that hereditymeant that diabetes was unavoidable (Naeem, 2003;Stone et al, 2005). Attributing diab etes onset to 'Allah's will and beyond their control' was common amongMuslim participants in six studies (Lawton et al , 2006b, Naeem, 2003; Stone et al, 2005). Health, destiny, illness and death were perceived to be pre-ordained byAllah. Five studies discussed the power of Allahbeyond the individual patient's control, often leadingto an attitude of resignation at diagnosis (Lawton et al, 2007; Hjelm et 2003; Stone et al, 2005). In one study (Hjelm et al, 2005), involving ethnic minority and non-ethnic minority Swedish-born female participants, the non-ethnic minority Swedish-born participants attributedthe cause of gestational diabetes to scientic explana-tory concepts, feared developing type 2 diabetes, andsought medical help and advice from healthcare pro-fessionals. Their beliefs about health and illness wereexplained in medical terms. Ethnic minority partici- pants attributed the onset of diabetes to social and supernatural factors which made them reluctant toseek medical advice. In another study, South Asianparticipants attributed the onset of diabetes to UKlifestyles and/or values, or as a form of punishment fortheir past religious sins. Other life circumstances, suchas poverty, limited access to healthcare services, andfamily-related stress, were also regarded as causes of diabetes. In contrast, white British participants con- sidered their own lifestyle choices and personal fail-ings, thus adopting an internal locus of control to a greater extent (Lawton et al, 2007). Five studies reported diet and/or lifestyle as factors that contributed to developing diabetes (Greenhalghet al, 1998; Naeem, 2003; Hjelm et al, 2005; Brown et al, 2006; Lawton et al, 2006b), with one aligning 'over- weight gures' with the cultural norms of projecting prosperity and well-being in the community ratherthan a health risk (Naeem, 2003). In two of thesestudies, participants partially associated physical ex-ercise with diabetes, linking such exercise to worsen-ing of their condition (Greenhalgh et al, 1998; Lawton et al, 2006b). South Asian participants linked cold weather rather than diet and/or inactivity to the onset of their diabetes, and believed that returning to South Asia would 'cure' them (Duthie-Nurse, 1998; Greenhalghet al, 1998). Integrating curative and diabetes self- management measures into everyday life This sub-theme examines the perceived healing para- digms and beliefs about diabetes self-management. In total, 11 studies reported at least one aspect of diabetes self-management, which demonstrated participants'perceptions of diabetes and their daily coping mech-anisms. In 10 studies, participants acknowledged thatdiabetes was a permanent condition and could be con-trolled, to an extent, through natural or supernaturaland/or medicinal means. For example, in the studyby Lawton et al (2005), participants reported that if western medicines were taken in excess, they could cause side eects, worsening their condition. In add-ition, they believed that traditional diets, such aschapatti and curry, had strengthening properties thatcounterbalanced these side eects of medication. Inanother study (Lawton et al , 2008), participants acknowledged the detrimental eects on their bloodglucose control of some South Asian foodstus, such as 'roti', used by most participants to describe com- plete meals consisting of curries, chapatti and/or ricewith side dishes, although its literal meaning is 'chapatti.'However, most of them, especially among the rstgeneration, did not eect dietary changes. Participants also expressed initial qualms about taking oral hypoglycaemic agents, due to fear ofacquiring the 'sick person's identity' (Lawton et al, 2005). In one study, Gujarati Muslim men believed in the healing powers of 'allopathic medicine', westernmedicine and other complementary therapies, especiallyherbal therapies (Fleming et al, 2008). In another, the Puerto Rican participants preferred and perceivedbetter eects of western medicines as opposed to comp-lementary or alternative medicines (Gonzalez, 2008).Cultural barriers to accessing eective diabetes care services 29 Belief in expert and professional support In seven studies, some participants expressed reduced condence in health workers, and questioned theircompetence and the support that they oered (Narayanand Rea, 1997; Greenhalgh et al, 1998; Lawton et al, 2005, 2006a; Rhodes and Nocon, 2003; Rhodes et al, 2003; Brown et al, 2006; Gonzalez, 2008). Participants in three of these studies had condence in UK doctorsand perceived them to be competent and trustworthy.In contrast, doctors from the Indian subcontinentwere perceived as untrustworthy, lacking training,and as sometimes giving preferential treatment tothe wealthy and to relatives and friends (Lawton et al, 2005, 2006a; Rhodes and Nocon, 2003; Rhodes et al, 2003). One of these studies reported that medicinesavailable in the UK were superior but inherentlydangerous compared with those available from theIndian subcontinent (Lawton et al, 2005). Another perceived the purpose of healthcare services to be theprompt detection and treatment of complications,rather than the provision of advice about managing their condition (Lawton et al, 2006a). In one study (Narayan and Rea, 1997), family members of a Hindu patient with gestational diabetesfelt humiliated and embarrassed following their ex-clusion from her care planning. They saw this ascontrary to their customs of involving family membersand valuing their contribution to care. In two studiesinvolving African-Caribbeans, South Asians (Brown et al, 2006) and Puerto Ricans (Gonzalez, 2008), partici- pants valued one-to-one linguistically and culturallyconcordant support from their health workers. Low accessibility of culturally appropriate services and information Nine studies reported variations in participants' ex- periences, with negative issues relating to accessing culturally appropriate services or information (Narayanand Rea, 1997; Greenhalgh et al, 1998, 2011; Rhodes and Nocon, 2003; Rhodes et al, 2003; Stone et al, 2005; Brown et al, 2006; Lawton et al, 2006a, 2006b, 2008; Kohinor et al, 2011). These included gender issues, lack of culturally sensitive fac ilities during clinical con- sultations, and preferences for same-sex health workers irrespective of language barriers (Rhodes and Nocon, 2003). Some women avoided mixed-sex leisure facili-ties, such as swimming pools, and male gym instruc-tors (Rhodes and Nocon, 2003; Lawton et al, 2006b), due to social and cultural beliefs about modesty(Greenhalgh et al, 2011). Six studies reported inap- propriate and/or lack of culturally appropriate infor-mation about diet and foods (Greenhalgh et al, 1998; Narayan and Rea, 1997; Stone et al, 2005; Brown et al, 2006; Lawton et al, 2008; Kohinor et al, 2011). Par-ticipants in one study expressed a particular prefer- ence for gender-specic diabetes education sessions(Stone et al, 2005). Participants in two studies reported having received inappropriate information from health-care workers that led to non-concordance with dietaryand other healthcare advice (Greenhalgh et al, 1998; Rhodes et al, 2003). For instance, some Bangladeshi participants reported receiving leaflets in Bengalidespite having very limited literacy skills (Rhodeset al , 2003). A further two studies reported the receiving of culturally insensitive advice (Narayanand Rea, 1997; Lawton et al, 2006a). For example, a Hindu patient was prescribed beef, perceived byHindus as taboo, which contributed to the patient's non-concordance with the care package recommended by the nurse (Narayan and Rea, 1997). Low concordance with western professional advice In total, 11 studies reported that participants did not follow professional advice due to lack of cultural knowledge, religious and language dierences, or con- textual factors, which were sometimes misinterpretedby health Lawton et al, 2005, 2008; Stone et al, 2005; Fleming et al, 2008; Greenhalgh et al, 2011; Kohinor et al, 2011). Partici- pants expressed a desire for dietary balance, but reported the importance of the traditional norms and beliefs about their foods, which some claimedmade them 'weak and not al, 2000; Lawton et al, 2008; Fleming et al, 2008). All of these factors contributed to their non-adherenceto professional recommendations. Two studies reportedconflicting professional dietary advice and prescrip- tions that were contrary to participants' traditions (Narayan and Rea, 1997; Kohinor et al, 2011). Two studies reported healthcare professionals' lack of cul-tural awareness resulting in a mismatch betweenprescribed interventions and the patient's beliefs andvalues (Narayan and Rea, 1997). In one study, participants reported deliberately reducing their tablet intake without medical advice and concordance when they were lethargic or unwell, and despite awareness of the importance of prescribedoral hypoglycaemic agents (Lawton et al, 2005). In another study (Fleming et al, 2008), Gujarati Muslim men noted that contextual factors such as the choice ofallopathic or cheaper homeopathic medicines influ-enced their choices. Stigma associated with havingdiabetes was reported as a factor contributing to low concordance with professional advice (Lawton et al, 2006b, 2007; Greenhalgh et al, 2011).P Zeh, HK Sandhu, AM Cannaby et al 30 Discussion The themes identied from this review of dierent ethnic, cultural and religious groups are participants'strong adherence to culture, religious beliefs, linguis-tic dierences between them and their health workers,low health literacy levels, dierent beliefs about healthand illness, belief in expert and professional support, low accessibility of culturally appropriate services and information, and low concordance with western pro-fessional advice. Although we do not claim that ourndings are universal, our review has collated anddemonstrated signicant cultural and linguistic bar-riers that are perceived by members of ethnic minoritygroups as compromising diabetes care. There ap-peared to be gaps in identifying and making reason- able adjustments to meet specic needs which could enhance the engagement of members of ethnic min-ority groups, increase their personal satisfaction withdiabetes service provision, and ultimately improve theirhealth-related outcomes. Only three studies (Lawtonet al, 2006a; Sedgwick et al, 2003; Brown et al, 2006)reported specic attempts to seek their opinions ofservices or their cultural needs (Goody and Drago, 2009; Brown et al, 2002; Hill, 2006). More work is needed to improve cultural competence among healthworkers to enable them to more eectively empowerpatients to self-manage their diabetes. Health policiesshould therefore be directed towards improving cul-tural competence training to facilitate partnershipworking between patients and their healthcare pro-viders. This has been shown to improve professional skills, cultural knowledge and attitudes among health- care professionals, enabling them to work eectivelyin cross-cultural situations, thereby yielding positivehealth-related outcomes for their ethnic minoritypatients (Majumdar et al, 2004; Khanna et al, 2009). For people with diabetes, knowledge of diabetes can signicantly predict their perceptions of the qualityof services they receive, as well as their own illness perceptions (Baradaran and Knill Jones, 2004). The inability of members of ethnic minority groups tospeak English fluently and low levels of health literacyin their own mother tongue are seen, in the UKcontext, as factors contributing to increasing socialdistance and reducing communication, which oftenthreaten trust between patients and their health workers(Audit Commission, 2000; Greenhalgh et al, 2011). Appropriate linguistically competent tools have been proposed to provide high-quality diabetes care ser-vices to ethnic minority groups (Roy and Lloyd, 2008). As culture consists of shared but dynamic patterns of behaviours and interactions that remain ongoingamong dierent ethnic groups (Naeem, 2003), cau-tion should be exercised when interpreting theseresults, due to the heterogeneity of the studies withregard to factors such as place of publication, recruit- ment setting, study design, studied population, andthe cultural barriers explored. In total, 73% ( n= 16) of the included studies were published in the UK, whichhas a signicant number of ethnic minority peoplewith diabetes (Zeh et al, 2012), and merits substantial investment in researching the cultural dierences faced by these populations (Brown et al, 2002, 2006). There- fore this review may be more applicable to the UKprimary care situation. Health workers need to acknowledge cultural similarities and dierences and build trust that mightencourage concordance (Goody and Drago, 2009).Dietary advice and information should not be pre- scriptive, but rather it should be negotiated, aord- able, culturally sensitive, and take account of theimportance of food in the individual patient's ethnicand social context, as well as the importance of theirreligious, cultural, and health and illness beliefs (Brown,1997; Hill, 2006). Diabetes health workers need topossess culturally competent knowledge of dierentcultures and ethnic foods, in order to empower patients with diabetes to adopt healthy lifestyles rather than to abandon familiar foods, as the evidence fromthe studies included in this review demonstrateslimited cultural competence in these areas. Strengths and limitations of the review The search criteria included all ethnic minority groups with all types of diabetes and all primary qualitativeand quantitative studies, excluding randomised con-trolled trials and quasi-experimental studies (whichhave been reported elsewhere), that have exploredcultural dierences globally. We assessed the qualityof studies and included any research design to uncoverany relevant studies that have explored cultural dif- ferences in diabetes. Triangulation of the results from the three included designs (quantitative, qualitativeand mixed-methods) was a strength of the review, asthey complemented each other, thereby improving thevalidity and generalisability of the ndings. Our de-sign was rigorous compared with previous systematicreviews that limited their search to specic ethnicminority groups, certain study types or specic types of diabetes, and which did not formally assess the methodological quality of the included studies (Brownet al, 2002; Fleming and Gillibrand, 2009). The limitations of this review include the hetero- geneity of the included studies, which causes dicultiesin analysing the results or drawing rm conclusions.Some current research involving Eastern Europeanpopulations within the UK may have been excluded, as only published studies were included. ExcludingCultural barriers to accessing eective diabetes care services 31 randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies from this review may have resulted in theomission of some important information about eth-nic minority groups, such as exploration of dierentaspects of cultural barriers and their eectiveness.However, our aim was to collate and highlight these barriers in order to target appropriate interventions for ethnic minority groups with diabetes. Zeh et al (2012) identied the key elements for such inter-ventions. Further reviews, including both randomisedcontrolled trials and observational studies, may pro-vide more insight into this area. Some cultural barriersmay be specic to certain ethnic minority groups.Grouping all ethnic minority groups together may be contentious, as they may dier in terms of health patterns and the eects of interventions, making itdicult to provide generic recommendations (Davidsonet al, 2013). In fact the denitions of ethnic minority groups, culture and cultural barriers have been re-stricted in this review, as they have diverse interpret-ations. The fact that not all of the studies includedparticipants' health literacy levels may pose training and comprehension problems, and it is dicult to ascertain whether specic cultural barriers pertainedto specic ethnic groups and/or age groups, whichmay have dierent educational needs. In addition,some vital information about ethnic minority groupsmay have been missed by excluding other chronicconditions, such as cancer.Conclusions, implications for practice and recommendationsfor further research This review has examined cultural barriers that can aect the quality of life of ethnic minority groups with diabetes and their glycaemic control, including com-munication problems, religion, health literacy levelsand beliefs about health and illness. Understandingthese issues may enable health workers to deliverculturally appropriate and individualised care, andthus reduce health inequalities in diabetes serviceprovision. The review has examined some of these cultural issues and oers suggestions to guide the planning and commissioning of culturally appropri-ate diabetes services for ethnic minority populations.Sustained and targeted actions by health commis-sioners and partnership with a ll stakeholders in diabetes management (local authorities, community organis-ations, diabetes leads in primary and secondary care,academic institutions and service users) are essential for improving diabetes-related outcomes (see Box 2).
