The most c ommon type of demen tia is Alzheimer's disease, but there are other types and causes of dementia. In fact, new research is suggesting that \"pure\" pathologies may be rare and most people likely have a mix of more than one type of dem entia. Worldwide more than 50 million peop le live with dement ia and because people are living longer this numb er is expected to triple by 2050 ( ADI, 201 9). In Florida, t here are 510,000 residents currently living with Alzheimer's disease ( Alzheimer's Asso ciation, 2019) and b y 2025, thi s number is e xpected to increase by more than 200,000. In Florida, about 43% of residents in certified nursing homes have dementia and a n additional 30% have some other psychological diagnosis (Harrington and Carrillo, 2018 ). This means understanding the issues and co mplexities associated with Alzh eimer 's disease and other types of dementia is critical for family, friends, and anyone working in a nursi ng home , adult day care facility , or hospice, no matter what their education or back ground . Defining Dement ia The ugly rea lity is that dementia often manif ests as a relentless and cruel assault on personhood, comfort, and dignity. It siphons away control over th oughts and actions, control that we take for granted every wak ing second of ev ery day. Micheal J. Passmore , Geriatr ic Psychiatrist, Univers ity of Br itish Columbia Dementia is a collective name for the progressive, global deterioration of the brain' s exec utive functions. D ementia occurs primarily in later adulthood and is a major cause of disability in o lder adults. A lthough a lmost everyone w ith deme ntia is elderly dementia is not considered a normal part of aging. The exact cause of dementia is still unk nown. I n Alzheimer's disease, and likely in other forms of dementia, damage wi thin the brain is thoug ht to be due to the formation of beta-amyloid plaques, the formation of neurofibril lary tangles, and degeneration neurons in the cerebrum . These proc esses are clearly explain ed in the following video. Video (4:21) Inside the Brain: U nraveling the Mystery o D isease https://w ww.youtube.com/wa tch?v=NjgBnx1jVI U In Alzheimer's disease, damage begins in the temporal lobe, in and around the hi ppocampus. T he hippoc ampus is part of the brain's limbic system and is responsible for the formation of new memories, spatial memories and navigation, and i s also involved with emotions. Mild Alzheimer's Disease In the earliest sta ges of Alzheimer's dis ease, before symptoms can be dete cted, plaques and tangles form in and around the hippocampus , part of the brain's limbic system (shaded in blue).

Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 4 of 60 As the disease progresses, plaques and tangles spread to the front part of the brain (the temporal and frontal lobes ). These areas of the brai n are involved with language, judgment, and learn ing. Speaking and understanding speech, the sense of where your body is in space, and executive func tions such as plannin g and ethical thinking are affected.

It is now thought that the brain changes associated with Alzh eimer's disease begin years, or even decades, before symptoms emerge. The chan ges eventually reach a threshold at which t he onset of a gradual and progressive decline in cognition beco mes obvious (DeFina et al., 2013). Types of Dementia Althoug h Alzheimer' s disease is the most common cause of dementia, it isn't the only cause . Front al- tempor al dementia \u2014which begins in the fr ontal lobes \u2014is a relatively common type of dementia in those un der the age of 60. Vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia are other co mmon types of dementia (see table). In all, more than twenty different types of d ementia have been i dentified.

T o guide cl inicians, in 2011 t he National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's As sociation (NIA -AA) published updated d iagnostic guidelines , which are intended to provide a deeper understanding Alzheimer's disease than e arlier gu ideline s. The 2011 guidel ines: Recognize that Alzheimer's disease progresses on a spectrum with three stages : (1) an early, preclinical stage with no sympt oms; (2) a middle stage of mild cognitive impairment; and (3) a final stage marked by sympto ms of dem entia. Cognitive de cline is gradua l and progre ssive. Expand the criteria for Alzheimer's de mentia beyond memory loss as the first or only major symptom and recognize that other aspects of cognition, such as word -finding abil ity or judgment, may be come impaired fi rst. Other cognitive change s can include changes in: Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 6 behavio r Reflect a better understanding of the distinctions and associations bet ween Alzheimer' s and non-Alzheimer's dementias, a s well as between Alzheimer's and disorders that may influence its development, such as vascular disease , delirium , or stroke. Recognize the potential use of biomarkers \u2014indicators of underly ing brain disease\u2014to diagnose Alzheimer 's disease. However, the gu idelines state that biomarkers are almost exclusively to be used in research rather than in a clinical setting. National Institute on Ag ing, 2020 Since the publication of the 2011 guidelines , resea rchers have increasingly come to understand that cognitive decline in AD occurs continuously over a long period , and that progression of biomarker measures* is also a continuous process that begins before symptoms are evident . The disease is now regarded as a continuum rather than three dist inct clinically defined stages (Jack et al., 2018). * amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration/neuronal injury . A 2018 update of the 2011 NIA -AA diagno stic guid elines added a \" numerical clinical staging scheme .\" This staging scheme reflects the sequential evolution of AD from an initial stage characterized by the appearance of abnor mal biomarkers in asymptomatic individuals. As biomarker abnormalities progress, the earliest subtle symptoms become detectable. Further progression of bio marker abnormalities is accompanied by progressive wor sening of cognitive symptoms, culminating in dementia (Jack et al., 2018). The numerical clinical staging scheme is as follows: 1.Performance within expected range on objective cognitive tests. 2.Normal performance within expected range on objective cognitive tes ts. (Transitional cognitive decline: Decline in previous level of cognitive func tion, which may involve any cognitive domain s. 3.Performance in the impaired/abnormal range on objective cognitive tests. 4.Mild dementia . 5.Moderate dementia. 6.Severe dementia . Jack et al., 2018 In 2018, an Alzheimer 's Association workgroup lead by Alireza Atri published a report describing the need for clinical practice guidelines for use in primary an d special ty care settings. The guidelines build on the NIA_AA guidelines but add a clinical component for the evaluation of cognitive impairment thought to be related to Alzheimer 's disease or a related type of dementia. Key componen ts inc lude: All middle -aged or older individuals who self -report or whose care partner or clinician repor t cognitive, behavioral or functional changes should undergo a timely evaluation. Concerns should not be dismissed as \"normal aging\" without a proper assessment.Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 7 of 60 Evaluation should involve not only the patient and clinician but, almost always, also involve a care partner (e.g., family member or confidant). Atri, 2018 Neuroima ging and CSF Biomarkers Neuroimag ing is increasingly being used to a ssist with early diagno sis of Alz heimer's disease and related dementias by detecting visible, abno rmal structural a nd functional changes in the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about the shape, positio n, and volume of the brain tissue and is being u sed to detect brai n shrinkage, whi ch is related to excessive nerve death. Positron emission tomography (PET ) uses a radioactive dye called PiB to detect the presence of be ta amyloid plaques in the brain. PET Scans Show ing PiB Uptake Adele \u2014this s a new image. Lauren T his image shows a PiB -PET scan of a patient with Alzheim er's disease on the lef t and an elderly person with normal memory on the right.

CSF biomarkers are measures of the concentrations of proteins in cerebral spinal fluid from the lumbar sac tha t reflect the rates of both production (pr otein expression or release/secret ion from neurons or other brain cells) and clearance (degradation or removal) at a given point in time . Sensory Impairment and the Changing Brain Sensory impairment is s omething often overlooked by caregivers and healthcare professionals when interacting with an older adult with dementia. Both hearing impairment and visual impairments must be taken into account when assessing difficult behaviors as well as a person's ability to complete common activi ties of daily living. For a person with dementia, h earing and visual impairmen ts are associated with adverse outcomes. For example, hearing impairment is associated with poor self -rated health, difficulties with basic and instrumental activities of daily living , difficulty with memory, frailty , and falls ( Guthr ie et al., 201 8). Similarly, visual impairment has been linked to an increased risk of mortality, difficulties with independence in activities of daily living , difficulty with mobility , and reduced so cial participation. Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 8 of 60 Individuals with vi sual impairment al so are more l ikely than those without visual impairment to require community -based supports (Guthrie et al., 2018). Loss of cell s in the part of the brain that processes vision (occipital lobe) cause s a narrowing of the visual field and a loss of peripher al vision. Vision becomes narrows and becomes binocular , which means items placed on a table in front of a person (such as food) may be outside of a person 's remaining visual f ield. Vision is also a c ritical for good balance and visual imp airment mean s a person begins t o rely on touch to help with balance . Macular degeneration, a common visual impai rment in older adults cause s loss of vision in the center of the eye, making it difficult to see some thing directly in fro nt of you. Be cause of damage to the visual path ways in the brain, the visual field narrows, making it difficult to see above, beside, and below.

Conditions That Can Mimic Dementia There are medical conditions other than d ementia c an cause cognitive changes in older adults . Gerontology specialists speak of the \"3D s\"\u2014dementia, deli rium, and depr ession\u2014because these three conditions are the most common reasons for cognitive changes i n older adults. Delir ium and depression are often mistaken for dementia. As a care provider with direct, dai ly contact w ith clients, your observations an d feedback help healthcare providers identify c hanges that may be treatable . Delirium Delirium is a sudden, severe confusion with rapid changes in brain f unction . Delirium deve lops over hours or days and is typically temporary and reversibl e. Deli rium affect s perception, mood, c ognition, and attention. The most common causes of delirium in people with dementia are medication side effects, hypo or hyperglycemia (low or high blood sugar) , and metabolic changes. A n unfamilia r environment, injury, or severe pain can also cau se delirium . Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 9 of 60 Delirium is under -diagnosed in almost two-thirds of cases and can be misdia gnosed as d epression or dementia. Since the most common c auses of deli rium are re versible, recognition enhances early intervention. Early diagnosis can lea d to rapid i mprovement (Hope et al., 2014). Service , England, U.K. Depression Depression is a common but se rious moo d disorder. Major depressive disorder is charact erized by a combination of symptom s that interfere with a pers on's abi lity to w ork, sleep, stu dy, eat, and enjoy activities. Some people may experience only a si ngle episode within their lifetime, but more of ten a person may have multiple episodes (NIMH, 2018). Persist ent depressi ve disorder is characterized by long -term (2 years or long er) symptom s that may not be severe enough to disable a person but can prevent norm al function ing or fe eling well. Psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus so me fo rm of psyc hosis, such a s delusions or halluc inations . Psychot ic symptoms typically ha ve a depressive \"theme,\" such as delusions of g uilt, poverty, or illness (NIMH, 2018). Depression is very common in people with dementia. Almost one -third of long-term care reside nts have d epress ive symptoms and abo ut 10% meet criter ia for a curren t diagnos is of major depressive disorder. Despite this awarenes s, depres sion is unde rtreated in people with dementia. Depressive illness is associated with increased mortali ty, risk of ch ronic dise ase, a nd higher levels of supporte d care (Jo rdan et al., 20 14). Symptoms of depression can include: Persistent sad, anxious, or \"empty\" mood Feelings of hopelessness, guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness Irritability, restlessness, or having trouble sitting still Loss of interest in once pleasurable act ivities, including sex Decreased energy or fatigue Moving or talking more slowly Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions Difficulty sleeping, early -morning awakening, o r oversleeping Eating m ore or less than usual, usually wi th unplanned we ight gain or loss Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems with out a clear physical cause and/or that do not ease with treatment Frequent cry ing NIH, 2017 Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 10 of 60 Behavior Managem ent Behavioral changes in people with dementia ar e generally called behavioral and psy chological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Anyone who has worked with someone with demen tia is familiar with at lea st some of the dif ficult behavior s associated with dementi a. Som e behavio rs are associated with brain change s while others are cause d by frustration, loss of control, discomfort, pain, and the inability to communicate needs. Some are cause d by poorly trained caregivers and hea lthcare prov iders. There is no doubt that the car ing for a person exhibiting a challenging beh avior puts a great deal of stress on caregivers. Whether cari ng for someone at ho me, in adult day care, in a nursing home, or in hospice, difficult beha viors are emotionally and financially costly. In nur sing home s, where up to 97% of resident s with dementia e xperience at least one behavioral symptom of dementia ( Scales et al., 2018), the cost of care is three times higher than that of other n ursing home resi dents (Ahn & Hor gas, 2013). Understandin g The Root Caus e of Difficult Behavio rs Often behavioral sy mptoms of dementia can be addressed with proper staff training, environmental modification s, pet therap y, social engagement, a nd good commu nication. Unfortun ately, there is strong that much of the frus tration that peo ple with dementia experience is due to negative environmental influences , including staf f attitudes , behaviors, and care practices . One mmon -sense approach \u2014the problem -solving approach \u2014add resses challenging behaviors by looking for the ro ot cause of a be havior. This approach encourages caregivers to get in the habit of observing the antecedent , behavior, and consequence (A, B, C) of a chal lenging behavior. Antece dent\u2014what caused \u2014what are the b ehavior? The problem -solving approa ch is very effective when insights are shared by staff, caregivers , and family members . This helps caregivers understan d when (and how of ten) a behavior occurs and offers caregi vers the opportunity for disc ussion and plan ning. To be successful, interventions and training must occur at the ind ividual and group level, as well as at the levels of man agement and organization. Common Challenging B ehavio rs When con sidering the most c ommon challengin g behavior s seen in a person with dement ia, severa l stand out: agitation and aggressi on, rumma ging and hoarding, delusions and hallucina tions, and sleep disturbances. Behaviors will ty pically change as dementia progresses although a person -centered, individual approach to management is al ways recommended, no matter what a person' s level of cognitive change. Agitation and Ag gression Agitation occurs in over 40% of care home residents , 75% of older hospital patients with dementia , and as many as half of peopl e with s evere dem entia. It is broadly defined as restlessness, pacing, shouting, and verbal or physical aggression . Agitation is complex , with a range of biological, psychologica l, and social causes. It may be a direct result of loss of cells in the area o f the brain that controls behavior or an expression of pain or thirst, difficulties with communication , discomfort, and emotional distress (Sam pson et al ., 2019) . Sometimes agitation can result in aggression , which can be difficult, harmful , and exhausting for patients and care givers. The impact on nursing and other healthcare providers can include burnout, sick leave, turn over, and in crease d eco nomic cost s. Because m any people with dem entia live in skilled nursing faci lities, assisted living , or are seen i n acute care hospitals , it is crucial to explore ho w staff in these settings understand and respond to agitation, particularly near the en d of life (Samp son et al., 2019) . Depending on the type and severity of a person 's cogni tive changes, a gitated and agg ressive behaviors may become more pronounced as the dementia progresses. Agitat ed and aggress ive behaviors often occur during personal care tasks involving close contact and may be related to a Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 11 of 60 perceived threa t or violation of personal space . In the e arly stages of dementia, when activities of daily living are independent ( or nearly so) , there is less need for direct help, less need for caregivers to be in one 's personal space, and more personal control. As dementia progresses, a person 's view of the worl d changes: conversations are more diff icult, daily tasks take longer to complete, fatigue increases, tasks that used to be done without thin king require a major effort. To make mat ters worse, everyone around yo u move s too fa st. Agitation and a nxiety make sense if you consider the changes that are occurring in a person 's visu al field, hearing, depth perception , ability to communicate, ability to walk , and indepen dence. Caregiver t raining is essential. P sychosocial and environmental inte rventions, recognition of personal habits and patterns can reduce or el iminate agitated or aggressive behaviors. A ntipsychotics, although contrain dicated in frail older adults , are so metimes used for a limit ed amount of time to redu ce aggression (espec ially if related to psychos is), part icularly among t hose most severely agit ated. In frail, older adults, antip sychotics are usually contraindicated because they can increase mortality and worsen cognitive impair ment. Wandering Wandering is a normal human a ctivity that most people en joy. In the early stage of dementia , when a person is safe and balance is good, wandering is usually not seen as a problem. As dem entia progresses and damage begins t o spread to the part of the brain associ ated with motor control, the risk for falls increases. Judgment may also decline, and a person may begin to wander into restricted are as or get lost in the community . At this stage, heal thcare providers and caregivers often see wandering as a problem and d isrupt ive to their care duties\u2014especially if a facility or home has not been modified to allow and encoura ge safe wandering. F or a variety of reasons, caregivers and healthcare providers may want to control or prevent wandering. However, preventing res idents from safely wandering can create a whole o ther set of problems such as boredom, loss of social interaction, stigma, loss of conditionin g, and even ski n breakdown . A lthough w andering can appear aimless, hyperact ive, and excessive\u2014especially in the later stages of dementia, from the standpoint of the person with dementia it is a com pletely normal activity . People wander out of habit, out of curiosity , or because they are convinced something needs to be done such as cle aning or cookin g. Wand ering warms a person and relieves depress ion, boredom, pain, and discomfort. Wande ri ng can involve moving to a specific locati on, lappin g or c ircling along a path, pacin g back and forth, or wandering at random. More than half of people with demen tia will wander at some point during the course of their disease . Wandering is not limited to walking: people who have transitioned from walking to the use of a wheelchair als o wande r. There i s no reason not to encourage this sort of activity so long as it can be done safely . Wheelchairs can usually be low ered to allow a person to self -proper with their feet and seating systems with drop seats can be installed in wheelchairs if the chair cannot be lowered. Peopl e with Alzheimer's are more likely to wa nder than those with othe r types of d ementia . People with frontal-tempo ral dementia tend to pace and lap whereas people with Alzheimer's d isease tend to wander randomly . Psychot ropic medications, particularly ant ipsychoti cs are associated with restlessness and a compelling need fo r movement or pacing (Burns et al., 2012). A person -centered, team approach involving healthcare pr oviders, fam ilies, and even other reside nts can be successful in managing wandering. Facilities that provid e safe, looping wand ering paths wit h numerous rest areas, provid e regular exerc ise and activit ies, and have measures in place to prevent a person with dementia from wandering into client rooms have a great deal of success managing this behavior . Easy-to-grasp rails, grab bars, transfer poles, and balle t-type bars liberally installed throughout a fa cility encourage safe mobility and prevent falls. Clean, clear hallways provide easy access to rails and bars. Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 12 of 60 In a Canadian st udy seekin g inpu t about wa ndering from older adul ts with dementia living in a long term care facility, researche rs discovered t hat, from the p erspective of the older adults t hemselv es, wandering is a pleasurable activity that they conside red healthful, pur poseful, a nd social. Wandering is also an expres sion of unmet needs, such as a desire to be with family, to relieve boredom, or to continue a lifelong habit. Residents shared six reasons walking : 1. It is enjoyable 2. It has h ealth benefits 3. It provides purpose 4. It has be en a l ifelong habit 5. It is a form of socializat ion 6. It provi des a chance to be with animals (Adekoya a nd Guse, 2019). A person's pr e-dementia lifest yle is clearly a factor in the desire to walk or wander and certain personalit y traits a re evident is peop le who wan der: They have an active interes t in music . They tend to have an extro verted personality showing warmth, pos itive emotion, altruism . They were very involve d with social activities and w ere active in social- seeking behavior s. They were phy sically a ctive. They may have experienc ed str ir readju stments . They responded to str ess by engaging i n motor activities . (Futrell et al., 2 010). Imagine if a pers on whose p re-demen tia lifestyle involved a lot of walking is now living in a n unfamiliar environment and is being prevent ed from mo ving a bout. Stopping the natur al tendency to explore, to become familiar with a new living space, and to socialize with new people can be extremely frustrating. It is n o wonder that this can lead to dep ression, anger , and behavioral problems .

The Wander er Elena is a resident in a 5 -story n ursing hom e in Miami. She has moderate dementia and although she is non -ambulatory , she is very good at propellin g her wheelchair . After breakfast in her room , an aide whee ls her to the a ctivities room and leave s her alone at a table with a jigs aw puzzle. After abou t 15 minutes Elena gets bored with the puz zle, exits the activitie s room , and heads down the hall. She is stopped twice by staff member s, who turn her aro und toward the activities room with a reprimand . When the staff membe r is out of s ight, Elena turns back around and continues in the direction she was headed. She st ops near an elevator, wh ere she sits for a while watching people come and go. Several more staff members pass by and gently remind her not to get o n the e levator. Each time she is l eft in the same place next to the elevator. Finally, when no one is looking Elena wheels into the elevator . Antecedent (what causes a certain behavior ): Elena is curious and used to like walking around Miami , exploring t he diff erent neighborhoods. Sh e was never one t o sit around doing not hing. She was bored with the jigsaw puzzle and wanted to do something more inter esting. She rolls out into the hallway and stops near an intere sting door t hat opens and closes with a sati sfying swoosh s ound. The Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 13 of 60 peopl e going in and ou t of the door smile at her. Behav ior: The door to the elevator is an interesting visua l cue and Elena enjoys seeing people comin g and going. People talk to her \u2014and she likes the interaction \u2014but she doesn't und erstand what th ey are saying. She sits for a wh ile watching pe ople come and go and when the opportunity arises, she enters the elevator. When the d oor opens on the ground floor, she wheels out of th e elevator, heads to the front do or, an d out onto the stre et. Her b ehavio r is consistent with her persona lity and her pr evious habits. Consequence : Once she gets into the elevator, Elena 's inabi lity to think logically puts he r at risk. She exits the elevat or next to a door that lea ds out of the building and wande rs into the str eet. Fortunatel y, someone sees h er wandering do wn the middle of the street and convince s her to return to the n ursing home. Discussion : Large nurs ing homes are busy places, often unde rstaffed, and often poorl y designed for people with dementia. Nevertheless, caregivers and healthcare pro viders should try to underst and the reason for Elena 's wandering a nd come up with activities that are appropriate for a person like Elena. Regular medi cations reviews will help staff understand if Elena 's beh avior is relate d to medication side effects, overme dicating, o r drug inter actions. To keep El ena out of the elevator : Redirect her to a pu rposeful activity Provide places where she can wander s afely Schedu le regular exercise Offer simple, meaningful chores Attach an electronic device that alerts caregi vers when she has wandered out of a design ated area Place a plastic PVC pole on the back o f her wheelchair and a horiz ontal pole across the entran ce to the el evator so that she is physically st opped from entering the elevato r Take her for reg ular outings outside the buil ding Allow her to keep a bird or pet in her room Provide safe, meaningful outdoor activities Rummaging and H oardin g Rummaging and ho arding occur when a perso n obsessivel y gathers, h ides, or puts away items in a secre tive and guarded man ner. T hese beha viors are not necessarily dangerous or un safe, but they can be frustrat ing for c aregivers , healthcare personnel, and other resident s. In a way, t hese rummaging is similar to wandering\u2014a desire to explore, to do something meaningful, or to co mplete a task. In the early stage , rummaging is likely more goal directed than in the later stages of dementia. Activities of daily living are nearly ind ependent , and rummaging and hoarding might be invisible to caregivers. As cognition changes and short -term memory declines, hoarding and rummaging may become more pronounced. In the late stages, rummaging may appear completely obsessive and illogical to a caregiver or healthcare provider. A person without deme ntia may h oard due to fear of losing money or possessions, a lack of control, or a need to \"save for a rainy day .\" A person wit h mild dementia may rummage simply out of confusion or forgetfulness . Hoarding is associated with insecurity an d anger a nd an att empt to hold onto possessions and memories from th e past. These actions are considered a type of obsessive - compuls ive behavior . As dementia progres ses, m emory loss, poor judgment, and confu sion contribute to the impulse to rumma ge and hoard. People may rummage out o f boredom or to find something th ey think has bee n misplace d. They may fear being robbed (or may actually have been robbed) and feel a need to protect their p ossessions. Rummaging through familiar items can create a sense of safe ty and security. Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 14 of 60 In the later stage, rummaging and hoarding can become a real problem for an elder -care facility. A person with significant cognitive changes might enter another person' s room and rumma ge through their belongings . At this s tage, a person with moderate to severe dementia does not understand that certain rooms are off limits \u2014after all, in our ho mes, we can go wh erever we want without someone stopp ing us. Rummaging in another person 's room can be prevented by installing locks on drawers and cl osets. The rummagin g impulse can be satisfied by creating a rumma ging room or a bag or drawer of items that the person can pick thro ugh. Restri cting all rumm aging and hoarding can be frustr ating for a person who en joys these activi ties. In the home as well as in adult day care and nursing homes , important items such as credit cards or keys should be placed out of r each or in a l ocked cabinet. Other conside rations for caregivers: Look for patterns (rummaging behavior s may not be as illogical as they seem to observers) Get rid of poisonous item s such as caustic liquids Replace poisonou s plants with edible plant s (or at least non -poisonous plants) Label cabinets, doors, and clo sets (with words or pictures ) to help the p erson find what they are looking for Get rid of clutter Obser ve care fully to learn the pers on's favorite hiding places Check garbage for missing item s Provide a place on wheelc hairs for storage of needed items Psychosis (D elusions and Halluc inations) Psyc hosis is a n europsych iatric symptom that can occur in people with demen tia. Delusions, hallucinatio ns, paranoia, euphoria, anxiety, disinhibition, or ag itation are examples of psychosis. Sensory deficits such as impai red hearing or vision can contribute to psychosis because of distortions of sound or sight. For most people with de mentia who experience psychosis, symptoms tend to worsen a s cogniti on declines and dependence increases. Although psychotic symptoms occur in AD, they are observed more frequently in other forms of dementi a, such as Parkinson's disease -related dementia, Le wy body dementia , and vascular dementia . The prevalence of psychosis in other forms of dementia, such as fro ntotemporal dementia , tends to be quite low ( Fischer et al., 2 017). Psychotic symptoms can be caused at any stage of dementia by health fact ors such as urinary tract infections and dehydration or environmental factors commonly f ound i n nursing homes and day care facilities such as poor lighting , too much nois e, or senso ry over load. Changes in the brai n contribute t o these behavi ors, esp ecially changes related to sensory awareness, memory, and decreas ed ability t o communicate or be understood. Visual ha llucinations c an occur in the moderate to severe stages of dementia and are particularly common in a person with Lew y body dementia . While atypic al antipsychotics are sometimes used off - label to manage hall ucinations, for a person with Lewy body dement ia, an tipsychotic medications can make hallucinations wors e. The first step in the management of psychosis is to rule out d elirium as a cause. Caregivers must also determine if the cla ims by the perso n did occur . For someone with new o nset of visual hallucina tions, the number one cause is medication side effects. For this reason, all medications should be carefully reviewed. This includes prescription and ov er-the-counter medicat ions, as well as herb al supplemen ts. When communicating wi th someone who is expressing psychotic symptoms such as paranoia or delusions, realize that the comp laint is real for that pe rson. Do not argue; simply exp laining the tr uth of the situation does not work. Do not agree with the person or validate t he paranoia or delusion \u2014try to respon d to the person's emotion. Delusions and hallucinations are often successfully addressed using behav ioral interv ention s. Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 15 of 60 To ma nage hallucinations, decrease auditory and vis ual stimuli and evaluate for visual or heari ng impairment. O ther su ggestio ns: Minimize violent or noisy TV Remove wall hangings Reduce noise, play relaxing music Cover mirro rs Reduce glare f rom w indows Ensure adequat e lighting Sleep Disturbances Many older adults with dementia have sleep and c ircadi an rhythm disturbances due t o advanced age, the effe cts of certain chronic illnesses and medications, declining brain health, diminish ed mobility, and other cause s. The Ame rican Geriatric s Society and the Nat ional Ins titute on Aging recognize a geriatric syndrome in which physical an d mental risk factors ov erlap to increase risk for sleep and circadian disturbances. Numerous negative c onsequences are associa ted with sleep di sturbanc es, including increases in cognitive decline, metabolic disease, high blood pressure, cardiovascular dis ease mortality, frailty, impaired quality of life, and hypersensitivity to pain ( Capezuti et al., 2018). Imp ortantly, s leep di sturban ces can contribute to the onset and severity of some behavior al pro blems, particularly anxiety, increased confusion, wandering, and sundowning *. *Sundowning: increased confusion and restlessness in the late afternoon and early evening, possib ly due to d amage to the part of the br ain that regulates sleep patterns. Sleep disruption can have the following features: Increased sleep latency Fragment ed sleep and increased early -morning awak enings Decrease d total sleep time, decreased sleep ciency Decreased slow-wave and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep Increased daytime nappi ng and daytime sleepiness Agitation, verbally disruptive behaviors, hallucinations, and nig httime wandering ( Burns et al., 2012) In AD, and likely in other neurodegenerative diseases, sleep disorders appear early . Sleep disorders worsen as the disease progresses, and their progression in the late stage of the disease is a strong predictive factor for mortality (Brzecka et al., 2018). S leep disturbances and accompan ying symptoms o ften lead providers to prescribe psychoactive medica tions, including hypnotics. About half of nursing home residents with dementia are prescribed sedative -hypnotics, especially when displaying anxiety and agi tation. However, many of these medications have been associated w ith an increased risk of falls and fractures in older adults (Capezu ti et al., 2018). Me dications use d to treat behavioral symptoms of dementia , as well a s those used to slow th e progression of d ementia, can cause da ytime s leepiness and lead to sleep disturbances. Before treating sleep disturban ces, look for potentially tre atable causes such as pain, hunger and thirst, the need to ur inate, infections, adverse drug reacti ons, and e ven noise. Nonp harmacological treatments include : Light the rapy Good sleep hygiene practicesFlorida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 16 of 60 Exercise and individ ualized social activities Restriction of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol Maintaining a calm, warm atmosphe re Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 17 of 60 Physical and Ch emica l Restraints The use of ph ysical and chemical re straints is widesprea d in all settings despite evidence their use leads to functional and cognitive decline . Restraint use also contribute s to loss of control, stigma, loneliness, loss of dignity, and boredo m. The amount of restraint use in nursing ho mes varies, with some stu dies noting rates as high as 60% for certain types of restraint . It is not uncommon for a resident to be given both a chemical re straint (often atypical antipsychotics) and a physical rest raint although chemical re straints are used most often. Not surprisi ngly, residents gi ven both types of re straints have the worst outcomes (Foebel et al., 2016). The Omnibus Budg et Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87) establ ished a resident 's right to be f ree of physical or chemica l restraints in n ursing homes wh en used for the purpose of discipline or convenience and when not required to treat the resi dent's medical symptoms. Unc ooper ativeness, restlessness, wandering, or un sociability are not sufficient r easons to justify the use of a restraint (GovTrack, 2020). Use of re straints should be : Reserved for documented i ndications Time limited Frequently re-evaluated for their indi cations, effectiveness, and side effects in ea ch patient (GovTrack , 2020) Florid a Nursing Home Bill of Ri ghts In most state s the use of physical and chemical r estraints on nursi ng home patients is illegal. In Florida, the Nu rsing Home Bill of Rights states that a nursing home resident has [extract] . . . the right to b e free from ment al and physical abuse, co rporal punishment, extended involuntary seclusion, and from physical and chemical res traints, except those restraints authorized in wr iting by a physic ian for a specified and limited period of time o r as are necessi tated by an emer gency. In case of an emer gency, restraint may b e applied only by a qualified licensed nurse who s hall set forth in writing the circumstances req uiring the use of restraint, and , in the case of use of a chemical restraint, a physician shall be consulted immediately thereafter. Rest raints may not be used in lieu of staff supervision or merely for staff convenience, for punishment, or for reasons oth er than residen t protection or s afety (Florida Statutes, 2019). Physical Restr aints A physical restraint is any device, material, or eq uipment attached t o or near a person's body that can neither be controll ed nor e asily removed by the person, and t hat deliberately prevents or is deliberately intended to prevent a person's free body movement to a position of choic e or a person's normal acc ess to his body (Lai et al., 2011 ). Physical restrai nts include vests, straps, wrist ties, splints, mit ts, belts, recli ners, geri -chairs, and bedside rails, among others. Restraint can als o include using (or threatening) force to make a person do somethin g that they are re sisting, and re stricting their movemen ts, whether or not they resist (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2009, late st available ). The use of physical restraints (includi ng be lts), can incr ease the risk of death or se rious injury as well as increase the length of a hospital stay. Both prolonged an d short periods of physical restraint use are associated with pressure sores, loss of muscle strength and endurance, joint contr actures, incontinen ce, demoralization, humiliat ion, feelings depression , aggressi on, and Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 18 of 60 impaire d social functioning ( Gulpers et al., 2010). The use of physical restraints can also create an ethical dilemma by restricting a person's auto nomy and independen ce (Lai et al., 2 011). Unfor tunately, the us e of phys ical restraints is a com mon practice , not o nly in nursing facilities but in the home care setting as well . A study in F landers, Belgium found nurses reported that some of their clients\u2014cognitively impa ired older persons , some of who m sometime s lived alone \u2014were restrained or locked up w ithout contin uous follow -up. Intervi ews indicated that the patient's family p layed a dominant role in the decision to use restraints. Rea sons for using restraints included \"providing relief to the family\" and \"ke eping the patie nt at home as long as p ossible to avoid ad mission to a nursing home.\" The nurses s tated that general practitio ners often had no clear role in deciding whether to u se restrai nts (Scheepmans et al. , 2014). Chemic al Restraints Tens o f thousan ds of n ursing ho me residents with deme ntia receive powerfu l antipsychotic drugs that ar e not intended or approved for their medical conditions. Rather, the drugs are often used to sedate a nd control them, a terrible substi tute for the individualiz ed care t hey nee d and des erve. The U.S. Fo od an d Dru g Adm inistration (FDA) h as issued its most d ire warning \u2014known as a black box warning \u2014that antipsychotic drugs cause elders with dementia to die. California Adv ocates for Nu rsing H ome Reform, 2012 We do no t usually think of a medi cation as having the p otential to r estrain a person 's free movement. However, in older a dults with dementia ther e is a long history of antipsychotic and sedative u se\u2014 chemical restraints \u2014to subdue or otherwi se alter a person's behav ior. A chemical restraint is the intentio nal use of any medication s to subdue, sedate, or restr ain an individual. C hemical restraints are commonly used to restrict a person 's freedom of movement in acute, emergen cy, or p sychiatric settings. Chemical restr aints are often prescribe d for what healthcare workers describe as dang erous , uncontrolled, aggressive, or violent behavior. Anti-anxiety, antidepressant, and antipsychotic medications are commonly used to treat the behavio ral an d psychological symptoms ass ociated with dementia. T hese medications affec t mood, percep tion, conscious ness, cognition, and behavior. They c an become a chemical restraint if used improperly and may be overused a mean s of behaviora l control in older a dults with dementia (Peisah & Skladzien, 2014). Antipsycho t ics carry a U .S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) black -box warning in dementia; they must be used with extreme caution, ongoing monitoring, and only when strict conditions are met. Short -term and long- term antipsychotic use is associated with substanti al risk of cognitive d ecline, morbidity , and mortal ity. The use of antipsyc hotics is reserved as a last resort for severe refractory behavioral disturbances without an identif iable and treatable cause or when a serious risk of imme diate harm or safety exists that cannot be otherwise ameliora ted (Atri, 2019 ). The 2015 American Geri atric Society (AGS) Updated Beers cri teria for safe medication use in older adults recommend av oiding antipsychotics for treatment of behavioral symp toms o r delirium in people with demen tia due to the increased risk of cerebrovascula r events and greater risk of cognitive decline and mortality . Further, antipsychotics sho uld be avoided unless non -pharmacol ogic options have faile d or are not possible and the older adult is threatening substantial harm to self or others (AGS, 2019). Nevertheless, a prescriber may cho ose to prescribe antipsychotic medications for behavioral symptoms asso ciated with demen tia an d they ma y be effec tive in some cases. The prescriber must, however, disclos e to the patient or family that the medication is be ing used off -label* and ob tain permission to use it for behavior al sympto ms. *Off-label use is the prac tice of prescr ibing pha rmaceuticals for an unapproved indication, age g roup, dose, or fo rm of administration. Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 19 of 60 Alternatives to Restraints Many attempts have been made to reduce restrain t use in clinical practice , with some notable successes. Mo st interventions use educatio n and trai ning aimed at a ddressing and resolving beha vioral triggers . In a small Dutch study involving 30 residents, education, institutional changes, and alternative interventions resulted in a si gnificant redu ction in the use of belt restraints. Belts w ere re placed with resident-centered interventio ns such as movement and balance traini ng, lower beds, hip protectors, extra supervision, and monitoring devices (video camera, sensor mat, and infrared alarm systems) (Gulpers et al., 2010). Other strategies have been u sed as an alter native to physical rest raints . Reducing clutte r, keeping hallways fre e of equipment and obstacles, and liberal use of rails, grab bars, and transfer poles in rooms, bathroom s, hallways, a nd co mmon areas is recommen ded. Changes inte nded a more dementia-friendly environme nt include: Redesi gning nursing stations so they are part of a home -like design. Provid ing comfortable, ea sy-to-access alternative seating. Lower ing wheelchairs t o allow self-prope lling with feet. Provid ing press cushions to ort comfor t and r educe skin breakdown . Installing carpeting or rubber mats in key areas to reduce injury from fal ls. Psychosocial policies and activities can also assist in reducing or eliminating the use of restraints. Establ ishing a routin e, including a toileting schedu le, improve s comfort and reduce s anxiety. Regular exercise an d comfortable places to rest and nap are important. Other dementia -friendly psyc hosocial change s include : Assessing and trea ting hunger, thirst, cold, and discomfort. Chang ing medicati ons or taper ing medic ations with adverse effects.

Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 20 of 60 Activities of Da ily Liv ing (ADL s) The humanity with whic h assistance f or everyday livin g is offered, especi ally help with eating and intimate care, is crucial in helping peo ple retain their self -esteem and dignity . Nuffie ld Council on Bioeth ics Activiti es of daily liv ing (AD Ls) are th e tasks we do during our daily lives. Bec ause ADL skills t end to worsen a s dementia progresses, caregiver involvement naturally changes and inc reases over time. Basics ADLs are the skills needed to take care of personal needs such as: Eating and dr inking Toileting and bathing Walkin g Groomin g, dressing , and und ressin g Transfers Instrumen tal ADLs (IADLs) are the skills n eeded to fun ction within society and w ithin th e community. As with basic ADLs, these skills decrease as dementia progresses. IADLs include : Housework Financial managem ent Shopp ing Preparing m eals Commun icatin g with the outs ide world Medical management As a direct caregiver, medica l professional or family member, t he following best principles should be understood and applied to all activities of daily living at all stage s of dementi a: 1.

Understand a nd know y our pat ient b. Train staff c. Collaborate with other healthcare pro fessionals and family mem bers (Wheatley et al., 2019) S ymptoms, Stag es, and Behavi oral Symptoms Caregiver re sponsibiliti es increase as demen tia progresses . The ability to organ ize, sequence, and complete comple x tasks such as shopping, cooking, and medi cation management begin s to decline in the early stage of dementia. W hen a person be gins to neglect these tasks, someone, often a fami ly member or friend must step in to help . When short -term mem ory and logical decision -making begin to Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 21 of 60 decline, caregiver s must be gin to oversee medical decision s, medication management , shoppi ng, cooking, a nd in caregiver res ponsib ilities can be gradual or abrupt and may be confusing for everyone involved. How Mild Dementia Affects ADLs In the early stage of dementia , most people remain independent with basic ADLs. Many will begin to need h elp with instrumenta l ADLs \u2014especially compl ex tasks requiring mult iple steps o r extensive plannin g. There likely will have been a gradual decli ne over several years, often unn oticed by family and friends. Basic activ ities of daily living such as eat ing, dr essing, and bathing are likely still indepe ndent. At this stage, a per son may try to c over up any confusion by turning to others for help with simple tasks. This is a natural response to loss of cognitive abilities and may be accompan ied by denial, anger, and exc uses. Th ere may b e some loss of interest in hobbies and activities. Mood changes, such as depressio n and a nxiety can occur. Learning new tasks may be difficul t and complex tasks may be left uncompleted. Faulty judgment and mild changes in personality becom e obviou s to friends and family. How Modera Dementia fects ADLs As dementia progr esses , instrumental ADLs such as work, medication management, an d personal finances become more diffi cult. A person may begin to need help wi th some basic daily activitie s. Mobility is often still go od and , if so, safety can become a concern . Caregiver res ponsibilities begin to increase, causing stress, anxiety, and worry for family members . In the moderate ph ase: Cooking, housework, and shoppi ng may requir e direct assistance Basic ADLs may require as sistan ce for se t-up and safet y ADLs may b e disrupted by beha vioral and psychological symptoms such as anger, fr ustration, and difficulty communicating needs How Severe Dementia Affects ADLs As demen tia becomes more severe , inde pende nce is gradually lost and care givers mu st provide close, direct care with most, i f not all ADLs. At this stag e, a person ma y require direct assistance with basic ADLs such as eating, bathing, transfers, and walking. Contro l of bodily fu nctions may be incons istent, requiring help with b athing an d toileting. Family m embers may find it im possible to continue to provide needed care and m ay be gin to consid er an in-home caregiver, assisted living , or skilled nursing. A person with severe demen tia who still h as good mobi lity may wande r and require cons tant monitorin g. If the person is lives at home, ti red and over worked caregivers and family members must provide even more support with ADLs and to maintain a safe en vironmen t. If in a skilled nurs ing, adult day care, or assisted living situ ation, the faci lity must pr ovide enough staffing and equipment to ensure a perso n's safety. Often, assisted living and skilled nursing facilities are understaffed and workers are untra ined in dement ia-friendly pr actices. As sev ere dementia progress es, balance an d safety awareness g o from bad to wors e, requiring significant d irect h elp with transfers and mobility. People with demen tia are much more likely to be at high risk for falls than people w ithout dementi a. To prevent injur ies from fal ls, it may be ne cessary to use b ed and chair alarms or provide a one -on- one c aregiver. Caregivers and h ealthca re providers mus t mak e difficult d ecisions to preven t injury and to provide a safe en vironment. End of Life/Hospice As people near the end of lif e, most people will experience decreased appet ite as well a s difficulties swallowing food and water , which can increase the risk of aspiration pneumo nia. They may be candi dates f or some type of artificial hydration , which can include enteral1 or intravenou s nutrition2. TPN is often used in the terminal state of malignancy (Takenosh ita et al., 2017). Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 22 of 60 1Enter al nutrition mainly consists of nasogastric (NG ) aneous periphera l venous nutrition (PVN) and total parentera l nutrition (T PN). The American Geriatrics S ociety has issued a position statement on tube feed ing, which states that careful han d feeding is almost as good as tube feeding for the o utcom es of com fort, aspir ation pneumonia, functional statu s, and death. Ha nd feeding has the added benefits of being a n intimate social interac tion wh ile avoiding the bu rdens and complications associated with tube feed ing. Involving a dietician , who c an offer dietary supplements i n addition to the regular diets h as pro ven effective in mainta ining nutritional status in eld erly In Florida, near ly 6% of residents in nursing ho mes receiv e nutrition via some sort of feeding tube (Harr ington and Carrillo, 2 018). The overr eaching questi on is whether tube feeding is g ood for the patient or even necessary , especially those with end -stage dementia. In the latest stage of Alzheimer 's, most people stop eating entire ly, which is considered part of the natura l cours e of t he disease. Strategies for Assisting with ADLs When a ssisting someone with b asic or instrumenta l activities of da ily living, encourage them to express their wishes . \"No, I don't want to!\" mea ns just that, even when spoke n by someone with dementia. When a ssisting with basic ADL s such as dressing, grooming, eating, bathi ng, and toileting, c ertain strategies will help you to comp lete these tasks succe ssfully. Use co mmon s ense, be aware of your body language, and use a quiet, confident tone of voice. Wh atever the acti vity, move slowly, give clear, simple command s, limit cho ices, and allow plen ty of time to complete the task. There are times when t he caregiver an d the person with dementia have diff erent goals. F or example, a caregiver i n a nursing home may want to bathe a resident an d get her dressed quickly because the careg iver has two more peop le to get dressed before breakf ast. A caregiver in an adult day care facility may have multiple clients she needs to get to the l unchroom by n oon but one of her clients may want to continue watching TV and want his lunch in his chair in the a ctivities room . The reside nt's wishes should be respected. ADL Stra t egies: Mild De mentia A person with mild dementia may need very l ittle h elp with basic activ ities of daily livi ng. Neverthel ess, it is to ke ep certain core princi ples in mind: Dressing o Encourage ch oice o Allow resident or client t o direct the activity Groom ing o Allow residents or clients to groom themse lves, provide tools as needed o Provide assistanc e only as needed Eating o Ask for food pr eferences , encourage choice o Encourage help with meal preparation and meal set -up o Provide adaptive uten sils as needed o Provide assistance only as needed Bathing o Encourage choice Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 23 of 60 o Assist with bathing or showe r as needed o Monitor for safety and com fort Toileting * o Monitor and a sk o Assist as nee ded o Encourage f luids** even tho ugh mor e bathroom visits may be nec essary *Be aware that s ome medic ations cause co nstipatio n while others increase or de crease the urge to urinat e. **Dehydration ca n caus e increas ed confusion. ADL Str ategies: Moderate Dementia A person in the moder ate stage of dementia will need more help with ADLs , espec ially instrumental ADLs. The re is variability at this stage depending on a p erson's physical capabilities and the type of dementia, but f or some, walki ng, tran sferring, bed mobility , and basic ADLs rem ain relatively independent. For ot hers, especial ly thos e with physical limitations or und erlying medical condi tions, more he lp will be requ ired. In t he moderate sta ge of dem entia: Dressing o Limit ch oices but encourage choice o Provide comfor table clothes with elastic waistbands and Ve lcro closures o Encourag e indepe ndence o Provide assistance as nee ded Grooming o Limit choices (\"Would y ou like lipstic k today?\" \"W ould you like to brush your hair ?\") o Encourage as much independ ence as pos sible Eating o Ask for food pre ferences o Set up the meal before serv ing\u2014open pack ages, un cover trays o Provide adaptive equipment as needed o Monitor closely, enco urage independe nce Bathing o Ask about bathing preferences o Initiate and monitor the activity o Provide direct assi stance as needed, pa rticularly in showers T oileting o Ask regularly if the res ident needs to use the bathroom o Provide close assis t, particularly wit h transfers o Label bathro om door for eas y identification o Provide toileting on a regular sche dule ADL Strategies : Severe Dementia Once a person reaches the severe stage of dementia , the mo re complex instrumental ADLs have likely been compl etely taken over by a family memb er or care giver. Basic AD Ls will require a great deal of assistance to comple te, depending on the person's physical capabilities. A person with severe dementia may still be able to walk independently and may be independent or ne arly so with b ed mobility an d transfer s. Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 24 of 60 With severe deme ntia, anything that requires planning, seque ncing, or judgme nt will b e severely impai red, so close assistance is needed for dressing, bathing, meal preparation, grooming, and toileting. If mobil ity is com promised , close assista nce will b e needed for al l ADLs. Remember to reintroduce yourself each time you meet the person you are assisting.

ADL Strategie s at the End of Life End-of-life care for people with dement ia can be com plex for re asons other than cognitive im pairment . Most people are frail and have multiple comorbidities . Near the end o f life there are often complications that create dilemmas for healthcare providers and family members . A person may be agitate d or experiencing difficulties with swallowing , eating, drinking , and taking ora l medication and diminished immune response can cause increase d susceptibility to infections (Davies et al., 2018). Loss of ab ility to v erbally commun icate, impai red hearing and vision , and the need for ever greater help with ADLs can be dif ficult for ever yone involve d. Encouraging p articip ation and indep endence in as many ADLs as possible is an important goal for caregivers. However, as the end of life appr oaches, comfort, c ompanionship , skin care, and pain management become the primary focu s. Active and active-assist ed movement, such as re aching, rolling , standi ng, se lf-propellin g a wheelchai r, and participation in appropriate a ctivities should be gently encouraged.

Tuesday is her shower d ay\u2014an aide helps h er undress in her room, covers her with a blanket, and whee ls her to the shower room using a rolling commode c hair. When they leave the r oom and enter the hallway, Mrs. Caval ia start s to fidg et. As t hey approach the sh ower room she begins to yell and prote st. When she is placed in the shower she screams and pushes her caregiver away. Antecedent (what cause s a certain behavior) : In her room, the a ide undresses Mrs. Cav alia and wraps her in a ba th blanket. Una ble to find a shower chair, she hel ps Mrs. Cav alia into a toilet chair. Mrs. Cava lia's bottom is hanging out the h ole in the chair, which emba rrasses h er. Sh e tries to stop the caregiver from wheeling her out into the ha llway b y grabbing at the doorway as t hey e xit. She says \"No! No!\" but the caregiver te lls her she is dirty and needs a s hower. Behav ior: By the t ime M rs. Cava lia reaches the show er room she is very agitated. She slaps the aide and repeatedly grabs the show er door. The aide manages to get Mrs . Cavalia into the s hower room, but when she turns on the water, Mrs. C avalia scream s, grabs the shower hose, and pushes the aide away. She sp rays water all over the aide and into the hallway. Consequence : The resident, staff, and the patien t's daughter are all upset. The sit uation created an unpleasant e nvironment for everyo ne involved and sh owering has beco me a dreaded experience for Mrs. Cava lia. Discussio n: Find ou t how Mrs. Cav alia bathed earlier in life. Allow her to parti cipate in her bathing even if it takes lo nger. Allow her t o undr ess in the show er room rather than in her roo m. Talk with her during the proced ure and get continual feedback from her. Ask h er questions such as \"Is this too hot?\" \"Do you want to wash your face?\" \"Ar e you cold?\" Mrs. C avalia's d aughter has told th e nurs ing staff that her mother prefers to un dress in the shower room and ha tes being wheeled half -naked down the hall. Th e nursing assistant bathing her today is new, hasn 't received dementia -friendly training, and ha sn't been told about Mrs. C avalia's preferen ces.

Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 26 of 60 Activities fo r Resid ents wi th Alzheimer's We all yearn for meaning in our lives. We like interacting with one another, teac hing so meone a new skill, and co ntributing to the s uccess of an act ivity. In many institutional settings , we have s tripped people of meaningful w ays to contr ibute, t o help, to learn, and to grow as a pers on. Often, a p erson with dementi a residing in a nursing h ome, another type of long-term care facility , or even in a n adult day care facility is not engaged in an y activities . This leads to a perception of \"warehousing \", the belief that moving to a facility or even participa ting in adult day care is nothing more than a place to be while wa iting to die . Low levels of eng agemen t and lac k of stimulatio n are problema tic because they cause boredom and loneliness that can lead to be havior chall enges (Cohen - Mansfie ld, 2018) . The goo d news is that there have been s ome not able successes in the design of act ivity programs for people with dem entia. A good activities program matches a person 's abilities with th e activity. It encourage s people with mor e mild cognitive changes to he lp and t each those wit h more severe dementia. For example, M ontessor i-type acti vities programs include detailed intervi ews with family caregivers about the residen t's forme r interests and skills coupled with assess ments of co gnitive, language, and motor skil ls. A range of acti vities are presented, tes ted, an d refined. When dementia is ad vanced , the activities are simpl ified. Facilitators present tasks del iberately, demo nstrating them fi rst, and using language as appropriate . People with mild dementia or no dementi a are encourag ed to help teach and demonstrate activities for people with impaired cognition (van der Ploeg et al., 2012). This allows people who can still contribute to do some thing meaningf ul. Well-design ed activitie s should include physic al activity , which has the added health benefit s of improving balance, decreasi ng falls, increasing strength , and imp roving mood . And because cogn ition and physical activity are lin ked, there is evidence th at regular phys ical activity can favorably affect physical and co gnitive function , quality of life , and a ctivities of daily livin g. Lack of physical activity and a sed entary lifestyle are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, metabo lic disease , and other adverse health conditions known to act as mediators in the early onset a nd progre ssion of dementia ( van Al phen et al., 2016) . Individual Act iv ities Individ ual activities that are carefully matched to a pe rson's abilities and interest s are recommended at all stages of dem entia. Keepi ng in mind that adults of ten have a fear of failur e (especially those aware of t heir cognitive decline ), activities must be appr opriate to a person 's cognitive level, consisten t, creativ e, and enjoyable .

Care can b e physic al, financial , or emotional . Caregivers he lp with basic activities of d aily living such as bathi ng, dressing, walki ng, and cooking , or w ith more complex tasks s uch as m edication and ho me management. A caregiver may provide direct care or manage care fr om a distan ce and can be a family member, a n eighbor, a frien d, or a profes sional. The onset of caring te nds to emerge natura lly from customary family transactions that exis ted before the onset of dementia. The need for care escalate s over time, fr om support for household, finan cial, and social activi ties, to person al care , to al most constant supervision and surveillance. Import ant transitions include the inv olvement of professional caregiv ers, institutionalization, and bereavement (ADI, 2013). Caus es of Stress f or th e Caregiver Caregivers of people w ith dementia in vest significant time, energy, and money over a long p eriod of time. Poor self -rated health and lower l evels of life satisfacti on are reported by many caregivers. Caregiver s' cumulative stres s is associ ated with increased nursing ho me placement of the pat ient with dementia (Lykens et al., 2 014). It is generally accept ed that the accumulated financial, physical, and psychological stress of caring for a person with dementia may increase a careg iver's risk of morbidity and mo rtality. Recent large , population -based studies however have suggested th at morbidity and mortality rates for caregivers may be lower than for non- caregivers . This may be due to the to the physiological benefits of prosocial helping behaviors (Roth, Brown, Rhodes, and Haley, 2018). Nevertheless, h igh levels of emotional s tress can lead to deni al, anger, and contribu te to social withdrawal. Care givers, overwhelmed by the dema nds of caring for someone with dementia can experienc e irrit ability, anxiety, and s leep disturbances. Many studies have documented a higher prevalence o f depressi ve symptoms among caregivers, with the highest prevalence among tho se caring for someone with dementia ( ADI, 2013). The eco nomic impact of caregiv ing is an addit ional stressor for caregivers. For caregivers of ol der people (n ot dementia caregivers sp ecifically) a 1% increase in hours of ca re is associate d with a reduc tion in the employment rate of caregivers by around 10% ( ADI, 2013). In a su r vey of Americ an care givers, 13% had to go from working full- to part- time, 11% had t o take a less demandi ng job, and 11% had to give u p work entirely . Cutting b ack or giving up on wo rk increases caregiver str ain, while hir ing a paid caregi ver or having additional infor mal sup port can reduce caregiver strain ( ADI, 2013). The a mount of str ess experienced by ca regivers is associate d with c aregiver demogr aphics, persona lity, and their pe rception of their role as a caregiver, t heir coping strategies, and relationships they have ou tside of their caregiving role.

Managing Caregiver Stress It is possible to r educe caregive r stress with educati on, training , support , and resp ite care. These four comp onents have been shown to decreas e care giver stress an d reduce or delay the transit ion from home to a care home (ADI, 2013). In a program called R esources fo r Enhancing Alzheimer' s Caregiver Health (REACH II), r esearchers targeted 5 caregiver d omains (depression, burden, self-care/health y beha viors, social support , and problem behaviors ) and provided i nterventions to address each domain . Caregivers were provid ed with educ ation, ski lls to mana ge troublesome behavi ors, social sup port, strategies t o reframe n egative emotional responses, and strate gies t o improve health beh avior and stress ma nagement . Active treatments were more effective than receiving only educat ional materials in red ucing careg iver burden and depressio n (Lykens e t al., 2014). These findings reinforced those of an earlier study, which indicated that active training such as engagement of c aregivers in skills training, role playing, and interactive practice we re more su ccessful in reducing caregiver b urden, compared with more passive metho ds, such as prov iding information only (Lykens et al., 2014 ). Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 31 of 60 Family Issues All over th e world, the fam ily is the cornerstone of care for older people who have lo st the capacity for independent l iving. In Florida in 2018, more than 1 million unpaid caregivers provided c are valued at more t han $1 4 billion (Alzheimer' s Association, 20 19). Caring for a person with dementia is a huge commitment and places bo th financ ial and physical strain on family caregivers. On averag e, caregivers spend 14 hours per week assist ing with basic ADLs an d up to 43 hours per week when more complex assistance and super vision are needed ( ADI, 2013). The majority of people w ith de mentia live in the community, and for more than 83% of these individuals, care is pro vided by fami ly, friends , or other unpaid ca regivers. Nationwide, a pproximate ly 16 million A mericans are caring for a pers on with Alz heimer' s disease or another de mentia. The largest propor tion of those careg ivers is sp ouses, followed by children and children- in-law, mostly female (67%). The typical profile of a dementia care giver is a m iddle- aged or older female child or female spouse of the person with dementia (Alzheim er's Association, 20 19). In many d evelo ped countr ies, the vital cari ng role of fa milies and their need for support is often overlooked . In devel oping countrie s, the reliability and universality of the family c are system is oft en overestimated . Family careg ivers are often cast into the role of caregiver u nexpectedly and are largely unpaid or \"nearly\" unpaid (ADI, 2013). Caregivers wh o are women may experience sl ightly highe r leve ls of burden, depression , and impa ired health than m en. Evidence suggests that the se differences arise because fema le caregivers t end to spend more t ime caregivin g, take on more caregivi ng tasks, an d are more l ikely to care f or someone with a greater number of behavioral problems ( Alzheime r's Association, 2 019). Changing attitudes and e xpectations among t he young, incr eased workforce mobility, and decl ining fertility ra tes mean that famil y mem bers are less avail able for inform al care for th eir older ad ult relatives. The education of women has led to more wor kforce participation. A ll thes e factors have put the system of infor mal, unpai d care under pressu re as fewer young people are unwilling or unabl e to care for o lder adult s (ADI, 2013). For a person w ith dementia , caregivers provide ca re for a longer t ime, on average, th an caregiv ers of older adults with other c onditions. They are more like ly than caregiv ers of people witho ut dementia to provide hel p with se lf-care and mobility and healt h or medical care. Yet half of caregivers of people with Alzheimer' s disease or anothe r dementia indicate they have no experienc e performing med ical or nursing tasks (A lzheimer's Association, 2019). Caring for a perso n with de mentia also means managing symptoms that caregiv ers of people with other di sease s may not face, such as neuropsychiatric sympt oms and severe behavioral problems. Family careg ivers often lack the inf ormation or resour ces necessary to manage the inc reasing ly complex medication regimens f or people with dem entia (Alzheimer's Associat ion, 2019). Fami ly Issues in the Ear ly Stage In the ea rly stage o f dementia, family memb ers are conf ronted with many issue s, worries, and concerns and must adj ust their own behavi or and manage their own frustrations as they try to learn about dementia. They are often unaware of avail able dementia -care service s and may f ind primary care phy sician s are of little he lp. In this early stage, family caregivers will n otice some loss of free time and some financial strain. The person experienc ing cognitive changes is often aware of what they are losing , causing frustration, denial, and difficulty adapting to lifestyle changes . At this stage, periodic confusion and perce ptual changes may mean th e loss of a driver 's license , which represents a loss of independence. Family members and spouses are more alert t o safety issues, leading to a loss of privacy. Having to rely on another per son for shop ping, cooking, and finances means a loss of normal act ivities and a \" normal \" life. If a spouse -caregiver is not be in g ood he alth, he or she may wo rry about not being able to pr ovide good care as the disease progresses. An adult child caregiver may worry about having to ta ke over the care of the parent and as sume a ne w role in t he family. Neverth eless, caregiver bu rden is usuall y Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 32 of 60 manageable in the e arly stages of dementia. Direc t care is often not needed, and caregivers can often leave their fa mily member alone f or periods of time. To counter act these early difficulties , specia lized tr aining is strongly recomme caregiv ers. This is an esse ntial but often neglected component of dement ia care. T raining can prepare family caregivers for what lie s ahead and allow them to mor e easil y partner with hea lthcare provid ers to provide competent a nd compa ssionate care. Family Issues in the Middl e Stages In the midd le sta ges, beha vioral and psychological p roblems may arise, requiring decisions about behav ioral interventions and, perh aps, medications. Family caregive rs often cut back on employmen t as the dem ands of care giving in crease. As the deme ntia p rogresses from the mild to moderate stage, caregivers beg in to inves t more time, energy, and money, pla cing strain on their own lives and finance s. Managing an additio nal househol d and the increase d physical demands of assisting with transfers and other activities of daily living can increase str ess. Medical car e becomes more complicated , healthcare providers may provide little guidance, and care feel there is often no one t o turn to for help. Personal losses continue to accumulate for the person with dementia and for caregivers. Loss of independence becomes more severe for everyone. For the person with demen tia, decisions are much more difficult a nd personal care ofte n requires direct help, affecting a person 's dignity . Loss of privacy , loss of independence, difficulties with mobility means the person with dementia loses the ability to live with any sort of i ndependence. Depressi on, alon g with symptoms of burno ut, poor self -rated health, highly perceived stress, and lower levels of life satisfactio n are factors that begin to affect the caregiver's health . Family caregivers are also less lik ely to engag e in pre ventive h ealth behaviors. Consequently , they can be at risk for serious illness, incre ased emergency department use, and hospi talization (Lykens et al., 2014). Family caregivers' cumulative stress is also associated with increased nursing ho me placement, institutionalization, and hospitalization of the person with dementia. C aring for someone with dement ia can undermine the heal th and well-being of both the patient and the caregiver ( Lykens et al., 2014). Famil y Issues in the L ate Stages In the late stages, communicating with, and unde rstanding what others are saying is severely affected. P eople with dementia lose the ability to make their needs clearly known . Specialized training makes helps caregivers immensely at this stage. Caregivers mu st lea rn to interpret facial expression s for sadnes s, anger, or frust ration, as well a s physical gestures such as graspi ng at undergarments, which may com municate the need to use the bat hroom. In the later stage, independence, privacy , and self-determination are almost completely lost. Daily care, meals, entertainment, exerci se, and schedul es are under the complete control of care providers. Caregiver s, whether family or professional, must schedule their activities around the needs of the person they are caring for. One of the most dif ficult issues \u2014usually in the mid dle to late stages of d ementia \u2014is the decisio n to place a famil y member in residential care or ski lled nursing. There are a numb er of reasons ci ted by caregivers fo r placement: Need for skil led care Patient's dem entia-related beh aviors assistance For family caregivers, r elinquishing ful l-time care can cause feelings of loss , sadness, resi gnation, and depression . Although a family m ember might believ e the care in a facility is better and mo re skilled Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 33 of 60 than the care the person receives at home, this is of ten not the case. Paradoxically, placement of a loved one in a c are facility may do little to allev iate the stress that caregivers ex perience. Once a family member has moved to a car e facility , family careg ivers must begin lear ning to navigate a complicated healthcare syst em. Healthcare workers can s upport family membe rs by determining the preferences, abilities, and resourc es of each family member. Regular face -to-face meetin gs with family memb ers and facil ity staff will help f amilies work through difficult conflicts. Fami ly Issues a t the End of Life The demands of caregiving intensify as people with d ementia approach the end of life. In the year before the person's dea th, more than ha lf of caregivers fe el they are \"on duty\" 24 hour s a day . Many report that caregiv ing durin g this time i s extremely stressful. One study of end- of-life care f ound that 72% of family c aregiver s experienced relief when the person with A lzheimer's dis ease or another dementia died ( Alzheimer's Associ ation, 2019). Caring towards the end of life can be particularly challenging as medical symptoms and complications increase and the person becomes less responsive an d able to comm unicate . Caregivers have rep orted a gap in support services for the challenges they f ace towards the end of life, such as car ing at home and navigating comple x care systems. The strain on health and social care services wo rldwide has resulted in a shift fr om formal care services prov iding care, to careg ivers provid ing more care for longer at home (Davies et al., 2019). Jasmine 's Story My dad died in 2007. My mom had been experiencing very mild dementia for sev eral years and my dad took care of most everything. When he died, me, my 3 sisters, a niece, and a nephew jumped in to help. We made a schedule, cooked, cleaned, and took care of medical care and finances. This worke d pretty well for several years until my mom lost the ability to stay home alone for any length of time. She was diagnosed with macular degenerati on and started needing help with meal preparation , TV, and e ven the telephone. Three of us, plu s my nephew started staying overnight. One sister refused but h elped during the day . As my mom 's dementia progressed, she started getting argumentati ve and nasty at times. She lock ed my nephew out of the house , saying he was bo ssing her around . He stopped helping soon after. She couldn 't make decisions anymore and her answer to anything involving money was \" no!\" She absolutely refused to have any sort of hired help \u2014not even a housecleane r. Another year passe d and my mom 's dementia worse ned. My niece hung in but eventually got a full- time job and had to quit helping us. We were down to the 4 sisters\u2014one of who m refused to stay overnight and som etime s didn't show up for her shift . By this time , my mom was almost completely blind. She was able to walk around the house , dress herself, and do most activities of daily living by herself. She still enjoyed c ar rides, books on tape, and TV. Over time, a s her dementia progressed , she started losing some of her independence in daily t asks such as dressing and sh owering. To relieve some of our caregiving duties, we finally were able to hire a caregiver. This helped a little but unfortunately, the sister in charge of my mom 's money refused to pay for overnight help. We li mped along like this for a couple of years until one sister quit and the other moved to Arizona. That left the 2 of us and a coupl e of caregivers to cover our mom 's needs 24/7. My sister cut back to 3 days at w ork and I neglected my bus iness. We split the time between the 2 of us with caregivers filling in when we were n't there. The thing that reall y increase d caregiv ing duties was when my mom could no longe r safely walk by herse lf. That meant we had to help he r every time she got up. We had to stay close by , listening carefully, and get up multiple times at nigh t to help her to the bathroom. Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 34 of 60 During the last couple of years , we we re busy from dawn to dusk \u2014shopping, cooking, cleaning, helping her exercise, managi ng caregivers, taking her to medical appointment s, and entertaining her. The last year was the hardest. Unfortunately, her doctor pretty much checked out well before my mom died. If it weren' t for my sister's and my knowledge of the heal thcare system, we w ould ha ve been sunk. My sister and I were good caregivers , but the carin g last for almost 20 years. My mom died peacefully in her sleep and I' m still recovering 3 years later . T he Grief Process The diagnosis of dementi a affect s the person with dementia a s well as fami ly and frie nds. Grief is related t o uncertainty about the course of the d isease a nd an ticipated loss of independence. Grief can manifest itself in physi cal symptoms such as sh ortnes s of breath, h eadach es, fatigue, a feeli ng of heaviness, and a lack of energy. Psycho logical sy mptoms will almost certainly develop including d epres sion, anxiety, insomnia, and loss of interest in normal hobbies and activities. These issues can lead to sel f-destructive behavi ors, such as alcohol or drug abuse. S uppor tive interve ntions to a ddress grief should include assessmen t of co-morbid c onditions, education a nd training , and develo pment of a care plan. Losses f or the person experienc ing dementia include: Loss of physical strength and abi lities Increased confusion and change s in men tal abilities Loss of income and saving s Changes in ho using and pers onal possessio ns, in cluding loss of pets Loss of self -sufficiency and privacy Changes in social roles, loss of friends and social networks Losses fo r family memb ers and caregivers include: Loss of compan ionship Loss o f income Loss of privacy and free time Changes in rou tines and social ro les Little time for hobbies and social activities There may be a great deal of grief when a person wi th dementia moves to a care home. Nursing home s and as sisted living f acilities lack privacy, usually don't allow pets, and truly represent the last stage of a person 's life. This can cause grief and depressio n for th e person with dement ia as well as family members and friends . When a love d one d ies, family memb ers experience a period of acute grief that can inclu de intrusive thoughts *, intense emotional distress, and withdrawal from norm al daily activities. T his period, along with the chronic grief that follows , may vary in leng th and inte nsity from individu al to individua l and often re sembles clinical depression (Monk et al., 2013). *Intrusive thoughts: unwanted, involuntary thoughts, im ages or ideas that can be ob sessive, distressing , or up setting.

Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 35 of 60 Dementia Care Programs Entering a long -term care f acility is often a diffi cult and fe ared transitio n for an older adul t. Loss of social status, stigma, isolation, and reduced contact with friends and family members can have a profound effect \u2014especia lly for a pers on with cog nitive challeng es. Having to adapt to th e facilit y's routine, loss of privacy , and unfamilia r surrou ndings can leav e a person fee ling isolated and depressed. To address this, friend s and family members are encoura ged to pa rticipat e in a dementi a care program\u2014mult idiscip linary programs designed to meet the individual n eeds of residents . The quali ty and suc cess of a dementia care program is influenced by the envi ronment of a care facil ity and by the facility's philos ophy of c are, services availabl e, and s taff experience an d training. They usually include support groups f or family members , friends, and care givers.

Even trained healthcare providers can f ind it difficu lt day-in and da y-out to deal with patien ts (or family members) e xperiencing dement ia. In d ition to demen tia-specific e ducation, care givers m ust learn to differentiate dementia from other illnesses. This is a critical sk ill that allows a direct -care staff and family members to advocate for their loved on e in a complicated healthcare syste m. Careg ivers also must learn to manag e difficult behaviors when they ar ise. This involves slowing down, listen ing, and find ing effective ways to communicate. With effective, deme ntia-based training, it is pos sible to get better at caring for someone with dementi a. Training provides access to resources, support, and equ ipment that im prove health and safety. A dement ia care program at the Universi ty of Califo rnia at Los Angeles (https://www.uclahealth.org/de mentia/) is one example of a progr am that pr ovides care giver trainin g and social and medical services to families caring for a person with dem entia. The program has five key components: (1) p atient rec ruitment and a dementia regis try, (2) struct ured needs as sessment s of patie nts and caregi vers, (3) i ndividualized dement ia care plans based on a needs asses sments an d input from the primary care physician, (4) monitoring and revising care pla ns, and (5 ) access 24/7, 365 days a yea r for assistance and advice ( Reuben e t al., 2013). The overall g oal of the progr am is to add ress the lack of sup port and training for caregivers, improve care transitions, and provide access to commun ity-based services. P hysicians report t hat the program has p rovided valuable behavioral and socia l recomme ndations and n early all said they would recomm end the program for other pa tients (Tan, Jennings, and Reuben, 2014).

A therapeu tic envi ronment provides support for some one with dement ia and their famil y. It recognizes that people with dementia are influenced by their surroundings and do better with environme nts that are individualized , flexib le, and designed to support differing f unctio nal levels and approaches to care (Campernel & Br ummett, 2010). At a m inimum , an organization carin g for people with dementia should understand that people with dement ia deserve and need kind and suppo rtive care focused on dignity, respect, and a utonomy. Person-Centered Philosophy of Care Person-centered care depends on a caregiver 's and organization 's skills, training, and knowledge. It means th at care is built a round both resident and caregiver needs and preferences , creating a high - quality share d environment . Person -centered care i s flexib le, creative, and supportive . Person- centered ca re is also refe rred to as dementia -friendly care , which promotes inclusion of the per son living with de mentia and their caregiv ers in care and treatment decisions , with the aim of increasin g positive outcomes f or both (Handl ey et al., 2015). The Physical E nvironment There is a connection betwee n the environment and how peopl e feel and beha ve. Homes o r buildings thoug htfully design ed for the care of p eople with deme ntia encourage community, maximize saf ety, suppo rt caregivers, cue specific behavio rs and abil redi Campernel & Brummett, 2010). Safety, securit y, simplicity, and familiarity are central principals for the design of dementia -friendly e nvironments . For someone with dementia , a familia r environment is predictable , lessens confusion, and creates a sense of being at home. This support s social relation ships, identity, autonomy , and priva cy (F\u00f8rsund et al., 2018). A deme ntia -friendly facility should be of a smaller size , with an op en design. This is less con fusing for someone with dement ia and allows staff and caregivers to easily monitor clients at a d istance . Although it is importa nt not to overwhelm residents and adult day care par ticipants with too mu ch informatio n or noise , the design should provide useful stimuli such as familiar cues to bathrooms and exits to safe outside areas . Private spaces are important, allowing people to be alone or in close company of a frie nd (de Boer et al., 2018) . Dement ia-friendly indoor design can include: Private space in a client's room with a private bath room and a separate bedroom or reces s for sleeping. Public sp aces w ith easy accessibility and places for semi -private interactions . Rooms personalized with furniture , memorabilia , pictur es, televisions, comp uters, and person al possessions. Control/ab sence of smelly odors . Sunlight, ventilation, and elimination of dark nooks a nd crannies . Small, residential -looking nursing stations .

In a comparison of \"regula r\" specializ ed ca re unit s and small, homelik e specialized c are units in the Netherland s, resi dents in the homelike care units needed less su pport with ac tivities of da ily life, were more s ocially engag ed, showed less agitation ove r time, and n eeded less p sychot ropic m edication an d fewer physica l restraint s. Residents of the small, homelike units awarded higher scores to aspects of quality of life, s howed less negati ve affect, bet ter social relations hips, and were more e ngaged in a ctivities (Kok et al., 2016). Althoug h there is a trend toward the development of smaller, home -like nursing hom es, la rge nursing homes are st ill the norm. In the U.S., there are approximately 16,000 nurs ing ho mes with an average of 100 beds per facility.

Having regular contact with specially tr ained caregiver s can provide comfort , predictability , and a sense of ease (Rijnaard et al., 2016). Schedul es and R outine s In tradit ional nurs ing homes, da ily life is pri marily organiz ed around the routines of the nursing home and the convenience of the st aff\u2014schedule s can chan ge dramat ically from day to day . This is di fficult for people wit h dementia bec ause t hey re ly on a predictable routine f or orientation. Although c aregivers and s taff are responsible fo r mainta ining a schedule , dementia -friendly facilities encourage caregivers to be flexibl e and adjust their schedule to benefit the person they are caring f or. For exampl e, if someo ne do es no t want to tak e a shower o n a usual bathing day, a careg iver might help the person wash up and schedu le the show er for another da y.

Attempting to rush can cause aggressive behav iors and frus trate both par ties. Staff a s Part of the Envi ronment There are a pproximately 687 certified nursing homes in Florida . Since 1 987, t he Nursing Home Reform Act has required nu rsing fa cilities to have enough nursing st aff to provi de nursing and re lated serv ices to attain or ma intain the highest physical, mental, a nd psychosocial well-being of resid ents. Facilities must have a registered nurse as a D irector of Nurs ing for at lea st eight consecutiv e hours a day, seven da ys a week and licensed nur ses on -site twent y-four hours a day (Harring ton and Carrillo, 2018). Staff turnove r is one o f the most vex ing problems for nursing home s and other organization s that provide care for peopl e with deme ntia. For people with dementia, this lack of consist ency and staff turnover make it particularly difficult to keep staf f \"dementia -trained \" and thus integrated into the living environment.

This model deempha sizes the medical model and emphasiz es practices that seek to reduc e loneliness, helplessness , and bor edom. One exa mple of an organization that promotes deme ntia- friendly care is t he Eden Alt ernative , which foc uses on what they call \" elder-centered\" principles of care. The Eden Alternative stresses the need to address the scourge of lo neliness, boredom, helplessness, a nd loss of mean ing. Key principles are: Make life worth living by c reating a human habitat where life revolves around close and continuing co ntact with people of all ages and abilities, as well as plants and animals. Decrease loneliness by p roviding easy access to h uman and animal co mpanionship. Address helplessness by c reating opportunit ies to give as well as receive care. Address boredom by c reating an environment in wh ich unexpected and unpredictable interactions an d happenings can take pla ce. Develop meaningful activities. Meanin gless a ctivity corrodes the human spirit. Make m edical treatment the servant of genuine human caring , never its master. Florida Al zheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 41 of 60 De-emphasize top-down, bureaucratic authority, seek ing ins tead to place the maximum possible decision- making author ity into the hands o f the Elders or into the hands of those closest to them.

Develop wise leaders hip, which is the lifeblood of an y strug gle agai nst loneliness , helplessnes (Kubsch, Tyczkowski , and P assel, 2018) In an analysis of staffing at seve ral Eden facilities covering a 6 -year period from 1999- 2005, staff turnover was reduced to approximately 10% per year (even as low a s 5% in some f acilities) , agency staffing was el iminated , and there was a 60% decrease in absenteeism. Other positive outcom es included significant decreases in behavioral incide nts, pressure ulcers, and restraint use ( Buswell, 2019). Prop er Staffi ng Proper staff ing in nursing ho mes and other facilities providing services for older adults with dementia is consistently a ssociated with higher quality of care. In Florida, as in many states, nursing assistants spend more than 3 times as much time with resident s in nur sing homes as do registe red nurses (Harrington an d Carr illo, 2018) . Nursing ho mes with more RN hours per pati ent ha ve been associated wit h positive outc omes and fewer deficiencies .

Staff A djustin g to R esident Rout ines When a facility is reorgani zed in to a dementia -friendly care home , staff adjust their routines to the routine s of the residents , rather than t he other wa y around. This requires a fundamenta l shift in how medical pr ofessionals have been edu cated and trained. In a home -lik e setting , the medical aspects of the facili ty are deemph asized. R esidents, staff , and family caregivers work as a unit. To the extent possible , care team should be consisten t. Daily tasks, such as cooking and cleani ng, are shared and organized by residents , staff, and caregivers. Not surprisingly, this reduce s staff turnover and provides more satisfaction for both staff and residents. To en courage in tegration of the staff into a home-like environ ment: Hire s taff with the em otiona l skill, training , and desir e to interact w ith people with memory problems. Increase pay , training, and opportunities to advance. Eliminate ins titutional, centralized nu rsing stations. Locate nursing and work areas throughout the buildi ng for staff c onvenien ce. Allow sta ff to contr ol lighting a nd environment al levels. Emphas ize signage for residents, lim it signage for staff and visitors. De-empha size or c amouflage doors t o staff and utility areas. Keep staff consiste nt. Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 42 of 60 Ethical Is sues with D ementia Pa tients Healthcare pr oviders must learn to incorporate e thical principles in to daily care. This is particularly true in the complex an d ethically difficult area of d ementia care. A ke y principle is to u nderstand an d remem ber that people with demen tia remai n the same equally v alued people t hroughout the c ourse o f their illness, reg ardless of the extent of the change s in thei r mental abili ties. Nuffield Council on Bioethics Those who work in d ement ia care setting s face diffi cult ethical decision s each day. St aff must balance the needs of mult iple clients while considerin g patient con fidentiality, th e potent ial for a buse, and the benefits an d risks of medicatio ns and procedures. If patients are no longer able to exp ress their own will, designated decision -maker s must st ep in and ma ke difficult decisions. Decision-makers mu st put aside their own needs and desi res and carry out what they believ e the person with de mentia would do if able. Ethical Ap proaches to Ca re In biomedical ethics , several basic ethical princi ples are commonly accepted. Th ese are (1) autonom y and wel l-being, (2) benefi cence, and (3) justice . Veracity or truthfulness is also an important e thical princi ple that must be considered. Autonomy and Well-Being Autonomy is the righ t of ind ividuals to mak e decision s about th eir own healt hcare and their own life . Patients must be told the truth about their condition and informe d about the risks and benef its of treatment. Patients are permitted to refus e treatment even if the best and m ost reliabl e informati on indicat es that tr eatment w ould be beneficial, unless this d ecision has a negative impact on the well- being of another ind ividua l. This sort of c onflict can create an ethical dilemma. For so meone with deme ntia, autonomy means fostering imp ortant relation ships, mai ntaining a sense of sel f, and having a way to expre ss values. Autonomy is not simply the ability to make rational decisions. A person's w ell-being i ncludes bo th their mome nt-to-momen t experiences o f contentment or pleasure, and mor e objective fa ctors such as their level of cognitiv e functi oning (Nuffield Co uncil st available ). Beneficence: Kin dn ess Beneficence is the act of be ing kind. T his m eans providing care that is in th e best interest of the patient or client . A decision is ben eficent or kind when the same decision would be made regardless of who was making it. Beneficence is closely relat ed to the concept of \"d o no harm \". Actions or practice s of a healthcare prov ider ar e \"right\" so long as they are in t he interes t of the pat ient and avoi d negative co nsequences. Justice: Equity and Fa irness Justice is often defined as a fair distribution of benefits and burdens, particularl y in conne ction with misfortunes f or which we can not be held personally responsible (Nuffield Council on Bio ethics, 20 09, latest av ailable ). This includes the degree to which healthcare services are distributed throughout society and the way healthcare is d elivered at the individual level. Given the vul nerability of people with d ementia , it is partic ularly importan t that resources su pport dementia care. This is in part an is sue of appropriat e resource s and prac tical sup port, but als o requires both caregiver s and care workers to be recognized and valu ed as people who hav e expertise and an important role in society. A fair distribution of benefits and burdens s hould promote and sustain the pers on with de mentia thr oughout the course of their dementia and help t hem maint ain their autonomy as much as possi ble (Nuffiel d Counci l on Bioethics, 20 09, latest available). Flori da Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, 3 units Page 43 of 60 Veraci ty (Truthfulness ) Veracity is telling the tr uth. When interac ting with a person with dem entia, the ethical re asoning behind most interactions is based on concer n for the well -being of the perso n with dementia, with conflicts ex perienced between the desires to maintain trust while at the same time avoiding di stress. Consideration for the perso n with dem entia must co exist with beliefs about the moral importan ce of telling the truth and practical concerns about ho w to get through t he day (Nu ffield Council on Bioethics, 2009, lat est avai lable). Some people argue that fa iling to tell the truth is a breach of trust and undermin es a pers on's remaining gri p on reality . Others point out that telling the truth in circumstances where the pers on with dem entia will not believe it may equally undermine t rust because t he person will think that they are being lied to. For healthcare providers, there is the added is sue of whe ther telling a lie undermines the inte grity of profession al care, and for those in volved in providing care th ere is the concern that failing to tell the truth is detrimental to the ir own moral well-being ( Nuffie ld Council late st available ). Ethical Confl icts and Dilemmas Ethical dilemmas ari se when there a re equally co mpelling reasons both fo r and against a specific course of acti on and a decision must be made. It is a dil emma because t here is a conflict between available choices. Usually one action, t hough m orally right, violates another eth ical standard. A classic ex ample is stealing to f eed your fami ly. Stealing is legally and e thically wrong, but if your family is starvi ng, stealing food might be mora lly justified (Noel -Weiss et al., 201 2). This is a \"rig ht vs. right\" d ilemma. When evalua ting the altern atives, both co urses of action have positive and negative eleme nts. Right vs . righ t is an ethical dilemma , whereas right vs. wrong is a moral temptation (Kidder, 1996). Worki ng through an ethical dilemma un til a satisfactory conclusion is r eached, making decisions tha t lead t o goo d actions, and avoidin g regrets and n egative conse quence s are th e foundational p rinciples of ethical practi ce (Noel-Weiss et al., 2012). Examples of Ethical Dec ision-Making Case 1 Mr. Corona is 8 8 years old and liv es in a cottage on his daugh ter's property.

There are many types of dement ia, although Alzheimer's disease is the most common type. Delirium and depression can b e confused w ith dementia and a thorou gh eva luation should rule out othe r causes of cognitiv e loss prior t o making a diagnosis of dementia. Although people with dementia often exhibit behaviors that a re challenging for family and profes sional caregiver s alike, the b ehaviors are caused by damage to t he brain and are not int entional. Ch allenging behaviors can be caused b y unmet needs and are ofte n a means of commun ication.

There are many proven alterna tives to phy sical and ch emical are the mainst ays of individ ualized care. Activities of daily living are disrupted in people with dementia. As the dementia progresses, caregivers must step i n and assist with personal care and hou sehold manag ement. They must also de sign individual and gr oup activities that provide a sense of accom plishment and well -being. Caregiver training is an e ssential component for anyone c aring for a p erson with d ementia . Fam ily caregi vers play a critical and often-overlooked role i n the care of loved ones with dement ia\u2014especially in the early -to-moderate sta ges. Caregivers ofte n experien ce stress, which does not abate simply by placing th eir family mem ber in a care facil ity. In a facility, professional caregi vers must be trained to view the per son with deme ntia in the context of a family. Facilities built a rou nd a philosophy of pers on-centered care can have a pr ofound and positive effect on challengin g behaviors associated with dement ia. Providing a safe, clean, home -like environme nt in which residents and staff wo rk together has been shown to improve outcom es in those with dem entia. Caregivers \u2014both family an d professional\u2014experience many ethical confl icts when caring fo r a person with dementia.
