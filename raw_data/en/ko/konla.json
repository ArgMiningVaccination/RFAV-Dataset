Elsewhere, western Uttar Pradesh in India - historically the world's most entrenched reservoir of polio but free of indigenous poliovirus type 1 for more than a year - was re-infected by a virus from a neighbouring state. By the end of the year, the number of children paralysed by polio in 2008 had returned to 1999 levels. And yet 2008 has proved to be a turning point in the ght against polio. To say 2008 was an arduous year in polio eradication is an understatement. To say it was a watershed for polio eradication is not. Against a sobering epidemiological backdrop, the progress made - in key political, technical, nancial and operational areas - led the ACPE and SAGE 1 to conclude in November 2008 that the intensi ed eradication effort had shown that the remaining challenges in the four polio-endemic countries could be overcome. First and foremost, all tiers of government in key polio- infected countries - from central to local levels - have realized the level of support and effort required to nish polio eradication and are engaging in the global effort as never before. In addition to nancial and operational commitments, the remaining countries with indigenous polio - Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan - now have special mechanisms to monitor the performance of eradication activities and hold local authorities accountable for their quality. Secondly, these efforts are being closely watched and frankly assessed. Following the re-infection of West Africa, for example, the international community has refocused its attention on key polio-affected countries, especially Nigeria, with a World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA) in May 2008 tasking each endemic country - by name - to act. Thirdly, the donor community has remained determined in the face of continued transmission of polio. Mindful that meeting established global health goals demands extraordinary perseverance, donors have redoubled efforts to nish the nal lap. In January 2009, the Bill & Melinda 1 The Advisory Committee for Poliomyelitis Eradication and the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.Gates Foundation announced a further US$ 255 million grant for polio eradication to Rotary International, which the latter pledged to match with another US$ 100 million, bringing to US$ 200 million Rotary's matching funds in the past year alone. That same month, the United Kingdom announced a multi-year contribution ofUS$ 150 million, and Germany signalled its intention to provide US$ 130 million. By the end of the year, these global developments and country-speci c strategies were showing an impact on wild poliovirus transmission. In India, monthly vaccination campaigns in the highest-risk areas, using monovalent vaccine, have reduced wild poliovirus type 1 - the more dangerous of the two remaining strains - to record lows. In Nigeria, stronger leadership at state level brought about new commitments to accountability for the quality of vaccination campaigns. By early 2009, the proportion of children with no polio vaccination in the highest-risk states of northern Nigeria fell to under 10% for the rst time ever. In Afghanistan, teams exploited lulls in the confl ict in the southern region to enter normally inaccessible areas and give children an additional dose of monovalent vaccine between large-scale campaigns. Pakistan started using nger-marking of vaccinated children to objectively measure coverage, thereby introducing real accountability of local authorities. With new multi-sectoral activities, the country laid the ground for the Prime Minister's Action Plan for Polio Eradication, launched in early 2009. Meanwhile, ongoing research in social attitudes, the development of new vaccines and behaviour of the poliovirus is expanding the current state of knowledge. In March 2008, Somalia became polio-free once again, demonstrating that full application of international outbreak response guidelines can stop the virus even in the most dif cult conditions. This Annual Report of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) features progress made in 2008 towards the objectives de ned in the GPEI Strategic Plan for 2004-08 and reports on intensi ed eradication activities. executive Summary3Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008 Wild poliovirus cases in 2008While not all milestones have been met, the 2008 ACPE recommendations recognized the range of progress made and concluded that \"the strategies of the GPEI are valid and can succeed\". Consequently, the ACPE endorsed the framework for a new strategic plan for the GPEI, combining proven eradication strategies, recently-developed tools and tactics and new initiatives to stop polio transmission. This strategic plan will be informed by the outcomes of an independent evaluation in 2009 - to propose area-speci c strategies to address the remaining barriers to stopping polio transmission - and by the results of clinical trials to assess the impact of new tools, such as a bivalent OPV formulation.Polio eradication, when complete, will be an enduring gift to future generations. In the 21 years since the launch of the GPEI, the number of children paralysed by polio has fallen by more than 99% - from more than 350 000 children paralysed each year to 1652 in 2008. The world has gone from more than 125 countries infected to 18, of which only four have never stopped polio. Some ve million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralysed. The powerful combination of government commitment, tireless immunization efforts by health workers and communities, along with a keen understanding of the remaining country-speci c challenges has paved the way for the GPEI to approach the nal inch to polio eradication with con dence.\"eradicating a disease is hard, slow, painstaking work.

Strategic objective I Interruption of wild poliovirus transmission Wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission was detected in 18 countries3 in 2008. Endemic transmission of types 1 and 3 continued in Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. New importations occurred in Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Sudan and Togo. Local transmission of viruses imported in previous years continued in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan (see section 1.2). Type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) was detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria. 2 Details in Appendix A 3 Afghanistan, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan and T ogo.0100200300400500600700800 Nigeria1168375 1981 6259773723 India Pakistan Afghanistan 76791 484 133611 6 1073* Includes one case of type 1/type 3 polio in India in 2007 and one in Nigeria in 2008Milestone 20082Status Milestone 1: No countries will be polio-endemic at the end of 2008.

Countries with indigenous wild poliovirus nigeria Epidemiological summary The outbreak of type 1 cases in 2008, while concentrated in known highest-risk northern states, spread throughout the country. The incidence of type 3 poliovirus was reduced, from 169 in 2007 to 76 in 2008, but was also evident countrywide. Transmission of type 2 cVDPV declined slightly in 2008 (62 cases compared to 68 in 2007). Overall, the total number of infected districts increased from 155 in 2007 to 241 in 2008. Failure to vaccinate in highest-risk areas The primary challenge to Nigeria's polio eradication effort has been a failure to vaccinate: the number of children missed during vaccination campaigns was suf cient to allow poliovirus to circulate. In the main, this was due to weaknesses in the planning and implementation of immunization activities. These operational handicaps were coupled with inadequate efforts to engage communities in polio eradication activities. As a result, data showed that 29% of children with non-polio acute fl accid paralysis (AFP) were under-immunized, meaning they received fewer than three doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). In the 10 highest-risk states 4 in the rst quarter of 2008, 50% of children aged under ve years had received fewer than three doses of OPV. The situation allowed both wild and vaccine-derived 1122 wild poliovirus cases in 2006, then 285 cases in 2007, Nigeria appeared to be heading in the right direction. Instead, the number of cases nearly tripled in 2008 - due to a rise in type 1 polio - and viruses of Nigerian origin re-infected seven countries in West Africa. This setback alarmed the international community, galvanized national leadership and deepened the engagement of state governors.

Wild poliovirus Type 3Wild poliovirus Type 1 Wild poliovirus Type 1 & 3 8Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Of Nigeria's 36 six Bauchi, Kano, Katsina and Zamfara - contributed almost two-thirds of all polio cases in the country in 2008. Kano alone - where 30% of children had never been vaccinated - was responsible for almost one third of the national total. These gures indicated the acute need to increase national, state and local government area (LGA) political leadership. Polio immunization activities in 2008 were also hampered by the erratic availability of other antigens and the \"Pluses\" during most Polio Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) (activities which supplement OPV with additional health interventions, such as insecticide-treated bednets and de-worming tablets). Although the state and LGA governments did increase their overall contribution to the IPDs, the necessary mechanisms for tracking their contribution and measuring its impact on the quality of the activities were not institutionalized. Year of crisis renews national and state leadership The type 1 outbreak began in the rst quarter of 2008. By May, delegates at the 62 nd World Health Assembly (WHA) issued a resolution urging Nigeria to reduce the risk of international spread of polio by ensuring high vaccination coverage in key polio transmission areas. A Presidential Taskforce was assembled, headed by the Federal Minister of Health, which briefed President Umaru Yar'Adua in June. Subsequently, State-level Task Forces were established in the key northern states. Meanwhile, the governors of some states began a process of deeper engagement with polio eradication - attending launches, making public statements of commitment and following up with local of cials. These states - including Kebbi and Jigawa - were rewarded with signi cantly lower levels of polio circulation. In the latter state, the governor's engagement was echoed at the LGA level. As a result, SIA quality improved, as refl ected in the immunization status of the population: the number of under-immunized children in Jigawa fell from 65% in January to 20% by year's end. Such developments show how rapidly progress can be achieved in the Nigerian setting, with systematic political engagement and oversight across all high-risk areas. In February 2009, the state governors of Nigeria convened an urgent session on health and collectively signed the Abuja Commitments to Polio Eradication in Nigeria, pledging to provide active leadership to mobilize both the state and LGA civil administrations to eradicate polio in the country. Bill Gates, Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was among the attendees. Mr Gates, whose itinerary took in a visit to the north and IPD eld activities, noted: \"If the country capitalizes on the commitments I've heard in the past two days, Nigeria can lead the way to a polio-free Africa.\" These Abuja Commitments appear to be bearing fruit: in Kano, the proportion of never-vaccinated children has been greatly reduced in the rst quarter of 2009.

In June 2008, as the West Africa outbreak grew, the WHO warned its Member States under the International Health Regulations (IHR) of the threat Nigeria represents. Key to success in the Nigerian programme is replicating and sustaining the operational improvements achieved in some areas of northern Nigeria in 2008 throughout all remaining high-risk states - given the clear correlation between the involvement of the state governor and local government chairpersons and improvements in operations - thus building on the Abuja Commitments . New mechanisms will therefore be put in place to monitor state and local government engagement and activities implemented to promote improved ownership and accountability. Based on the recommendation of the Expert Review Committee for Polio Eradication in Nigeria, operational initiatives - such as the placement in 2008 of 12 international consultants in high-risk northern states for three-month periods - will be repeated in 2009, and funding has been made available to support additional teams in high-risk states. Given the critical role that communities play in polio eradication, and the importance of high quality social mobilization in making sure that children receive vaccine, polio partners in the country will focus on strengthening communication capacity. Recruitment of polio-focused communication staff at LGA, state and zone levels (combining several states) has been prioritized, with appointments expected by mid-2009. When available, a new bivalent OPV (bOPV), containing types 1 and 3, will be added to the mix of monovalent OPVs (mOPVs) and trivalent OPV (tOPV) by the emerging epidemiology. Bivalent OPV has the potential to boost immunity to the WPVs currently in circulation in Nigeria. Children dance at the Presidential Flag-Off to a National Immunization Day in Kaduna State, northern Nigeria. \u00a9 WHO / Thomas Moran10Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008 Given the continued circulation of both type 1 and 3 wild polioviruses, a bivalent OPV (bOPV) - which targets both types at once - could substantially simplify the logistics of polio eradication in at least three endemic areas (Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan), bordering countries at high-risk of re-infection, and some re-infected areas (e.g. Angola, Chad and Sudan). More ef cacy data were needed before regulatory agencies could support licensure of bOPV - similar to the situation with mOPV just four years ago. Of particular importance was the degree to which bOPV would compromise seroconversion to each type. A clinical trial to shed further light on this question was launched in 2008, using bOPV as part of a seroconversion study in India. If bOPV performs better than tOPV against types 1 and 3, it could supplement existing vaccination strategy by late 2009. The effectiveness of bOPV in eld conditions would of course be dependent on SIA quality, as with other vaccines.

Meanwhile, western Uttar Pradesh - free of indigenous type 1 polio for all of 2008 - was re-infected from neighbouring Bihar state. Virtually all type 1 polio reported from India since then has been related to this outbreak. In late 2008, polio continued to fall sharply, and by end-March 2009, India had recorded 21 cases overall, compared to 165 at the same time last year. Highly-vaccinated children still get polio The primary challenge to India's energetic and comprehensive polio eradication efforts is the failure of the vaccine to optimally protect children in the remaining infected areas of the country. Due to a unique combination of challenges (high population density, large birth cohorts, poor sanitation infrastructure and high enteric disease burden), OPV ef cacy is sub-optimal, further complicated by the movement of people between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and other states, including Punjab. This mobility re-introduced type 1 poliovirus into western Uttar Pradesh in May 2008, at the beginning of the high-transmission season. On news of the initial importation case, an intense outbreak response was mounted, with monthly SIAs from June to December covering nearly all of western Uttar Pradesh. As a result, the outbreak peaked in August then declined. However, transmission of both type 1 and type 3 virus continues. The response to this outbreak may have been compromised by potency problems - discovered late in 2008 - with the main mOPV1 used in India. The large number of type 3 cases in India in early 2008 was the tail end of an earlier outbreak that spiked in November-December 2007. From January 2008, state- wide campaigns using mOPV3 in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh India In 2008, western Uttar Pradesh - historically the world's most entrenched global reservoir of wild poliovirus, in India's most populous state - stopped transmission of indigenous type 1 poliovirus. Transmission was stopped for a full 12 months, re-af rming the technical feasibility of global polio eradication. The subsequent re-infection from neighbouring Bihar was followed by a swift response, resulting in a further reduction in the overall number of poliovirus cases and bringing type 1 to the verge of eradication in both Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states.Wild poliovirus Type 1 Wild poliovirus Type 3 Wild poliovirus Type 1 & 3 12Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008reduced the numbers of affected children signi cantly, particularly in the second half of 2008, when the average number of type 3 cases per month was nearly halved (from 51 cases per month in January-June to 29 cases per month in July-December). A well-oiled machine In addition to Uttar Pradesh, type 1 polio from Bihar was exported into six polio-free states in 2008 5. High quality, rapid large-scale mop-ups successfully restricted these outbreaks, limiting circulation to a single reported case in the rst four of those states, ve cases in Delhi and two in Punjab. These experiences highlighted two things: the signi cant risk posed by migrant communities in transporting the virus to polio-free states; and the success of swift application of outbreak response standards. National and state ownership of India's polio eradication programme is strong, with nancial and political commitment plainly evident. Chief Ministers of both endemic states made statements of support in 2008, and activities in India are largely self- nanced. Communities remain determined to eradicate polio, as evidenced by the national immunization coverage rate of 95% of children aged under ve, high public visibility and community knowledge about polio. India's strong community and government ownership will continue to be supported through surveys of social attitudes and monitoring of district-level of cial engagement. 5 Assam, Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.The way ahead As recommended by the India Expert Advisory Group, which lays out the national strategy, the polio programme in India continues to prioritize the elimination of type 1 circulation while maintaining control of type 3 circulation at a low level. The immediate priority is to optimize the potency of mOPV1 by increasing the titre 6 and enhancing scrutiny at India's largest producer, while supplementing the vaccine available with higher-titre offshore product to increase the impact of each vaccination contact. 6 Expressed in infectious units per human dose, vaccine titre is basically the concentration of active ingredients in the vaccine.

Understanding that India is unique among endemic countries in its quality of SIAs, the polio programme is conducting further research into enhancing immunity status and exploring innovative vaccine techniques. A serosurvey for polio immunity in western Uttar Pradesh was launched in 2008, using the AFP Surveillance System as a platform. Results will assist the programme in more accurately estimating immunity levels in western Uttar Pradesh and determining areas that require improvement. If data show that the use of higher-titre mOPV1 or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) could help close residual immunity gaps in the highest-risk areas of western Uttar Pradesh, these could be introduced to supplement current vaccination tactics. Depending on the results of the ongoing bOPV trial, this product could be added to the armamentarium, to allow continued pressure on type 1 virus while intermittently boosting immunity to type 3. A sub-continental scale of activity \u00a9 Jersey Rotary / Richard WainwrightThe sheer scale of the operation required to tackle polio in India is staggering, and yet India appears the most likely of the four remaining endemic countries to next eradicate polio. Consider the operational challenge: in 2008, India administered more than one billion doses of OPV during polio vaccination campaigns. In all, 692 million doses of mOPV1 were administered, 227 million doses of mOPV3 and 236 million doses of tOPV. On any given National Immunization Day (NID), more than 72 million children were immunized across a single weekend, making these regular occurrences repeatedly the largest immunizations in history. And somewhere in India, polio campaigns were conducted in 24 out of the 52 weeks in the year.

In Pakistan in 2008, indigenous transmis- sion of both types of WPV continued in Sindh and North West Frontier Province. Punjab - Pakistan's most populous province, which had been polio-free for almost two years - witnessed an outbreak of imported poliovirus due to the large movements of people triggered by insecurity in the North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Despite intense eradication activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan - considered a single epidemiological block - wild poliovirus transmission expanded in Pakistan and persisted in the southern region of Afghanistan. Pakistan's polio programme suffers from managerial shortcomings - notably in Sindh province - while in the North West Frontier Province and tribal areas as well as in southern Afghanistan, immunization teams are unable to reach all children due to the unsettled security situation. In Pakistan, federal leadership has developed mechanisms for improved accountability from lower levels of government, including the use of nger-marking of vaccinated children as an objective measure of vaccination status after campaigns. In insecure areas of both countries, tactics for increasing safe access for vaccinators - including, but not limited to, negotiations with local authorities - have been key to improving coverage. \u00a9 Sahil/UNICEF AFG/2007Wild poliovirus Type 1 A boy is vaccinated at a polio immunization booth at a remote border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan.Wild poliovirus Type 3 15Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Failure to vaccinate in safe areas - inability to vaccinate in insecure zones In Pakistan, a confl uence of factors - including management and operational issues - set back polio eradication efforts in 2008. In southern Sindh province of Pakistan (especially in the megacity of Karachi) and in parts of Balochistan, the need for improvements in SIA performance was evident in the number and vaccination status of children paralysed. As a rst step, the Government of Pakistan began the systematic use of nger-marking of vaccinated children as an objective measure of coverage to complement parental recall and other methods. Use of nger-marking to gauge SIA quality enabled the programme to identify gaps in district-level accountability and develop mechanisms to address those gaps. Solutions proposed by the provincial and federal authorities ranged from improved supervision of campaigns to the development of province-speci c strategies to increase district accountability. Throughout 2008, the mobility of health workers became increasingly restricted in a growing proportion of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and of central and southern North West Frontier Province districts, due to insecurity. While a supporting network of surveillance informants continued to identify AFP cases in these areas, the inability of staff to move around seriously compromised independent monitoring of campaigns. Of the total target population (of children above ve years of age) in North West Frontier Province/ Federally Administered Tribal Areas, the percentage that could not be reached varied from 3% to 11% during the campaigns in 2008 (representing between 146 000 and 640 000 children). The most serious of these situations was in Swat district (with four cases in 2008 and a target population of over 350 000 children), where the last vaccination campaign of the year was in July. In Afghanistan, the main reason for continued transmission of polio in 2008 was the inconsistent quality of campaigns in the southern region, with staf ng and management challenges aggravated by the precarious security situation. An in-depth analysis of SIA data showed that the quality of campaigns, particularly in Kandahar, Helmand and Uruzgan provinces, was inconsistent. In an immunization campaign held on 1-3 June, nearly a quarter of districts in the southern region failed to reach the coverage target of 95% of all children aged less than ve years. In subsequent campaigns, the proportion of such districts rose to as much as 40%. In confl ict areas or where local anti-government groups blocked entry, the average number of children not accessed in each round of 2008 due to insecurity in the confl ict zone ranged from 100 000 to 200 000 (of the total target population of 1.2 million in the southern region). While a comparatively small number, this is enough to sustain transmission, especially in view of the corridor of transmission of polio from Karachi into this region.

In Pakistan, provincial-level action plans were developed, with a view to increasing district-level leadership accountability. The Federal Ministry of Health launched an inter-provincial committee for polio eradication with the aim of bringing together the health leadership at province level to provide basic guidance and monitor and review implementation of national polio campaigns. Regular meetings of this committee are essential to its ultimate effectiveness. The federal leadership engaged other government sectors, such as the National Highway Authority, as well as the public and private television networks in support of polio eradication. By February 2009, the Prime Minister had endorsed a \"Polio Action Plan\" with concrete steps for collaboration with ministries beyond health. In Afghanistan, a written letter of support from the appropriate Taliban shura or governing board was obtained prior to each SIA. To exploit the opportunity this created, several high-level missions from the capital Kabul to Kandahar province resulted in a plan for non- governmental organizations (NGOs) in the health sector to assume a much greater role in immunization campaigns in the southern region and for local religious and political leaders to negotiate access into areas not controlled by the government. In districts with fl uctuating security conditions, polio teams entered districts whenever they could, in order to boost immunity by vaccinating children with an addi-tional dose of mOPV (which can be given with a shorter interval between doses than tOPV). These so-called Short Interval Additional Doses (SIADs) gave extra protection to an estimated 50 000 to 100 000 children repeatedly. Special communication strategies were designed for areas where conservatism restricted activities (in parts of the eastern, southern and south-eastern regions) through involvement of infl uential members of the community including religious leaders, teachers and elders, and by holding \"courtyard\" discussions with groups of women.\u00a9 UNICEF Pakistan Pakistan's innovative national polio cell has united the country's media in the fight against polio, dramatically lifting the profile of National Immunization Days, while making immunizers more accountable and ultimately increasing the number of children being immunized. A typical Fatwa issued prior to each immunization in Afghanistan \"All the residents of Kurram Agency are hereby required to extend their full cooperation with the teams working for Polio Vaccination and must not give them any harm. All Mujahdins and Talibans are also directed to cooperate with them.\" Ordered by: Fazal Saeed Haqani - Ameer Taliban Movement - Kurram Agency.Dated: 08 / 07 / 200817Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Across the border, encountering similar access problems in the North West Frontier Province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas, polio teams obtained the support of local Taliban whenever possible. Campaigns were conducted by religious organizations when feasible, using local vaccinators from the same religious sect. Teams merged with the community in dress and behaviour, giving vaccine after prayer and lunchtime to create the least disruption. As part of cross-border coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, teams at border vaccination posts immunized 1.5 million children. The SIA schedule was synchronized, with the border areas generally covered on the same day. The way ahead In accessible areas of Pakistan, improving SIA quality will require converting the national inter-sectoral commitment to district level, with independent monitoring systems ensuring districts are actively working to cover at least 90% of their target populations, especially in Sindh. Provincial-level operational plans are being updated to improve district-level micro-plans and increase vaccinator and supervisor training and performance. Seroprevalence surveys are being initiated to verify programme performance and vaccine ef cacy to guide strategy in areas where there is divergence between reported coverage and case numbers. Environmental surveillance is being introduced to re ne understanding of the transmission zones. In insecure areas, the priority will continue to be on area-speci c tactics, adapting to fl uctuating conditions and applying lessons learned from other confl ict-affected, polio-free countries: negotiations for access using the most appropriate interlocutors, irrespective of af liation, and with the goal of obtaining Days of Tranquillity for polio vaccination. Quarterly reviews of the security situation will guide these tactics, including the appropriate use of SIADs. Use of bOPV, possibly by late 2009, would help simplify the logistics of vaccination operations generally, boosting the effectiveness of the SIADs and other tactics in insecure areas. A risk model designed in 2008 will inform contingency plans, in order to ensure continuity of operations irrespective of security conditions. Traditionally marked as International Peace Day, 21 September is an occasion in Afghanistan to mark the desire for peace through activities nationwide. A suicide car bombing on 14 September - killing two doctors and their driver on their way to supervise preparations for a polio vaccination campaign - threatened to derail the Peace Day immunization campaigns, but the national polio eradication team felt that the best way to remember their fallen colleagues was to continue their work. President Hamid Karzai issued a statement that government forces should refrain from attack on Peace Day, and anti-government elements were quoted in the media as being in support of the day. Following these statements, 14 000 vaccinators fanned out across the polio-affected provinces of Kunar, Lagman, Nangarhar and Uruzgan to vaccinate 1.8 million children. Polio tragedy ends in Day of Peace Dr Shams ul Haq Kakar Dr Mamoon Tahiri18Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 20081.2. Countries with imported poliovirus As long as indigenous wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission continues anywhere in the world, the risk of international spread remains. In 2008, 14 countries had circulation of imported poliovirus, all but one in Africa. Of these, 10 countries were infected by WPV of Nigerian origin and four by WPV of Indian origin. By year-end, Ethiopia appeared to have stopped WPV circulation. And at the time of going to print, Nepal and Ghana had not announced a WPV case for more than six months. The experience of the past ve years shows that for programmatic purposes, importations can be categorized as persistent, recurrent or sporadic and that prevention and response strategies can be adapted accordingly. Full implementation of international outbreak response guidelines 7 can help rapidly stop outbreaks due to importations. However, if these guidelines are not fully followed, there is a serious risk that transmission of imported poliovirus will persist. Such persistent importations pose a primary risk in the affected country as well as a signi cant secondary risk of onward spread to other destinations. 7 Adopted by the 59th World Health Assembly in May 2006.Areas at highest risk of recurrent importation are now well de ned by proximity to or with trade and cultural ties to an endemic country: for example, countries close to Nigeria either physically or in terms of frequent contact. Sporadic importations are those which periodically occur into countries that are not considered high-risk, because they are distant from endemic areas and do not have close links to such areas. Though most sporadic importations lead to few cases - as in Botswana in 2004 - larger outbreaks can occur, as evidenced by Indonesia in 2005 with 303 cases. On rare occasions, outbreaks occur due to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). 8 Circulating VDPVs are more likely to arise in a community where children have received limited vaccination against polio. Such cVDPVs can be swiftly stopped if outbreak response guidelines are fully followed. In 2008, cVDPVs were circulating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria, all due to type 2 cVDPVs (type 2 poliovirus has been eliminated in the wild). 8 See section 2.2 Endemic Areas and areas at highest risk of recurrent wild poliovirus importations Areas at highest risk of recurrent importations Areas of indigenous poliovirus transmission19Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008 Countries with ongoing transmission in 2008, following an importation of wild poliovirus, by event* Countries with recurrent importations Country Type First case Most recent case # casesDuration (in months)Status *** WPV1 20-May-08 20-May-08 1 0 StoppedCountries with persistent ** transmission following importation Country Type First case Most recent case # casesDuration (in months)Status *** Angola WPV1 25-Apr-07 18-Feb-09 16 Stopped WPV1 18-Nov-08 18-Nov-08 Ongoing Democratic Republic of 17-Dec-06 5-Aug-08 40 20 Stopped Stopped WPV3 16-Dec-08 16-Dec-08 1 0 Ongoing * An importation event is the detection of one or more cases of poliovirus that genetic analysis shows to be of external origin (i.e. originating from another country). ** Countries with transmission >12 months following an importation of the virus. *** An outbreak is considered ongoing when poliovirus is detected whithin the last six months, otherwise considered stopped.Countries with sporadic importations Country Type First case Most recent case # casesDuration (in months)Status *** Central African RepublicWPV1 6-Apr-08 30-Dec-08 3 9 Ongoing Ongoing Togo 11 3 Ongoing Data in WHO/HQ as of 12 May, 200920Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008 Areas of persistent outbreaks: Insufficient improvement in immunity profile Global immunization status in 2004 Global immunization status in 2008 % non-polio AFP , 6 - 59 months, with 3+ doses of OPV 0 - 39 % 40 % - 59 % 60 % - 79% 80 % - 100 % N/A Endemic countries Data as of 12 of May, 200921Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Horn of Africa Persistent importation spreads In the Horn of Africa, a persistent importation on the southern Sudan-western Ethiopia border was detected in 2008 and spread in early 2009 to northern Sudan, Kenya and Uganda. Of Sudan's 26 recorded poliovirus cases in 2008, 24 were from southern Sudan, genetically linked to a virus that had circulated in Sudan in 2004 9. This \"missing link\" highlights the importance of countries establishing not only suf cient routine immunization levels to reduce the consequence of an importation but also high-quality surveillance to rapidly detect poliovirus. Polio vaccination activities were hampered by management issues and civil unrest in parts of the country. In response, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partnership sent in four STOP (Stop Transmission of Polio) team members to boost AFP surveillance (a further nine STOP team members were sent to Sudan in early 2009). Indeed, the increasing number of cases in Sudan in late 2008/early 2009 refl ects improvements in AFP surveillance. By early 9 T wo were type 3 cases imported from Chad to Darfur2009, the Government of Southern Sudan declared the polio outbreak a national health emergency and backed up these words by increasing the number of immunization activities. Maintaining this level of political commitment to polio eradication is essential in order to vaccinate enough children to nally stop this persistent outbreak. In early 2008, Ethiopia reported three cases of polio on its border with southern Sudan. Following a series of outbreak response activities, no cases of WPV were reported in Ethiopia after April 2008. By early 2009, however, both Kenya and Uganda were infected by imported WPV linked to Sudan. Kenya had previously suffered just two cases of polio in 25 years, both direct importations close to the Somalia border, while Uganda had been polio-free since 1996. As this report went to press, both countries were conducting international standard polio outbreak responses. \u00a9 U N M I S / J o h a n n H a t t i n g h Children line up to receive oral polio vaccine at a school in Sudan.22Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Persistent importations threaten progress In central Africa, two persistent importations of WPV continued in 2008, the rst encompassing Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo - with virus of Indian origin - and the second in Chad, with virus of Nigerian origin. Both countries have had an outbreak for more than 12 months, have reported both type 1 and type 3 viruses, and have contributed to cases in the Central African Republic. Immunization response to the persistent outbreak has not been to the standard of the internationally endorsed outbreak response guidelines, and surveillance indicators mask gaps at sub-national levels. Central Africa Angola was infected in 2008 by both type 3 and type 1 imported poliovirus, both of Indian origin. While the type 1 virus was the continuation of a 2007 importation, the type 3 cases were the result of a 2008 importation which subsequently moved into the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With a view to interrupting the persistence of the importation, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for polio eradication in Angola met twice in 2008 and again in early 2009 to review strategies and implementation, recommending an intensi ed campaign schedule and speci c activities to achieve high quality. To this end, 10 technical public health of cers, seconded by the Government of Cuba, were deployed to \"high-risk provinces\" to work on improving SIA coverage and monitoring. The Democratic Republic of the Congo saw a reduction in cases in 2008, but suffered a new importation of a type 3 poliovirus from India via Angola. Although no type 1 case has been reported since August 2008, the most recent type 1 cases were reported in the security-compromised provinces of South and North Kivu, where access is limited and low-level transmission may continue. As the Democratic Republic of the Congo also reported a cVDPV type 2 outbreak in Katanga Province, the 2009 campaign schedule comprises a mix of monovalent and trivalent OPV. Following importations from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic recorded three cases in 2008. Despite four NIDs, population immunity remains low due to the sub-optimal quality of the immunization activities, hampered by insecurity. The country has put in place a series of measures to improve the quality of immunization activities, including speci c strategies to reach security-compromised areas. These include a directive from the Ministry of Health to provincial governors and health authorities to enhance their monitoring of eradication activities as well as systematic engagement with NGOs. Implementation of these activities - which were successful in stopping the Central African Republic's 2004 outbreak - is being monitored, and surveillance reviews will take place in the Central African Republic as well as the Democratic Republic of the Congo at end-2009. In 2008, aside from Nigeria, Chad reported the highest number of cases of any African country (37). A major country-wide type 3 outbreak - comprised of two chains of transmission of viruses of Nigerian origin that have now been circulating in the country for 12 months - further exported virus into eastern Sudan and the Central African Republic. Chad also reported a small number of type 1 cases. The polio eradication effort in Chad has been hamstrung by poor quality immunization campaigns and sub-optimal surveillance standards, compounded by insecurity. In response, technical assistance was increased, with satellite of ces set up in the provinces and AFP cases being regularly validated. Vaccination campaigns were staggered to adapt to security restrictions, and OPV was added to measles campaigns to improve coverage. By early 2009, the detection of AFP cases had nearly doubled in Chad (with 102 paralysed children found in the rst four months of 2009, compared to 54 in the same period of 2008).

Recurrent importations provoke united response Whereas in 2007 only Niger was repeatedly the destination of imported poliovirus from Nigeria, in 2008 WPV spread to six other West African countries. Benin was rst re-infected in April, with cases detected throughout the year in the north and south, each episode presenting as independent importations of virus from Niger ia. Burk ina Faso was repeated ly in fected w ith v ir us that had originated in Nigeria (one virus was directly linked to Nigeria, another arrived via Benin and a third via Togo). Poliovirus linked to Burkina Faso, in its turn, caused the reinfection of Mali in August. Ghana was infected by a virus of Nigerian origin via Burkina Faso and Nigeria directly, while Togo was infected via Ghana and Burkina Faso. The nal country to be re-infected in West Africa in 2008 was C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in December. Throughout much of 2008, Niger continued to report cases of W PV impor ted f rom Niger ia. The cases detected during the rst quarter of 2008 were either genetically linked to 2007 circulation or a new importation. High quality campaigns interrupted this ongoing circulation, but could not prevent new importations in the last quarter of the year. In response to the West African outbreak, four synchronized immunization activities were conducted in 2008, in seven countries 10, plus Nigeria. Previous experience - and notable gains in population immunity and speed of detection and response since the 2003- 10 Followed by three synchronized vaccination campaigns spanning the seven re-infected countries and Nigeria between February and 12 of May, 2009.West Africa24Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008 \u00a9 UNICEF/Togo/2009/Bonnaud2006 outbreaks - argues that such a rapid, large-scale response will once again render this region polio-free. However, the ease of movement of WPV in West Africa underlines the extreme vulnerability of that region as long as there is polio in Nigeria. Three-year-old Thomas of Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9, Togo, receives oral polio vaccine as part of West Africa's seven-country synchronized outbreak response. High-quality response reduces sporadic re-infection, stops outbreak Nepal remains at constant risk of WPV re-importation due to its close proximity to the polio-endemic states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in northern India. This was borne out in 2008 when Nepal reported six type 3 cases - all single importations from either Bihar or Uttar Pradesh. Large-scale rapid-response mop-up immunization activities, along with one NID and four SNIDs, prevented any further spread in the country. nepal 25Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Maintaining surveillance sensitive enough to detect poliovirus is critical in guiding the eradication of remaining indigenous poliovirus, in enabling rapid response to importations and in certifying the interruption of transmission. In 2008, all WHO regions maintained AFP surveillance at or above certi cation level 12. While all polio-endemic regions and the majority of re-infected countries showed improvement in AFP surveillance levels compared with 2007 statistics, there was a slight decline in 11 Details in Appendix A. 12 A non-polio AFP rate of at least 1 per 100 000 of the under-15-year-old population, with adequate stool specimens taken from at least 80% of AFP cases and all processed in a WHO-accredited laboratory.polio-free regions. In polio-endemic regions, 15 countries did not reach certi cation-quality AFP surveillance 13. In polio-endemic WHO regions - the African (AFR), Eastern Mediterranean (EMR) and South-East Asian Regions (SEAR) - most countries recorded AFP - reporting levels of 2 per 100 000: double that of certi cation levels 14. In AFR, 91% of countries achieved this level, compared with 93% in EMR and 97% in SEAR. 13 AFRO: Algeria, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Namibia, R\u00e9union, Saint Helena, Sao T ome and Principe and Seychelles.

The following three areas - all with persistent circulation of imported WPVs - showed evidence of such gaps in 2008, requiring corrective action. Chad: The 2008 AFP indicators in Chad exceeded certi cation quality at the national level but were sub-optimal in six of the 18 provinces. Genetic analysis reveals that some chains of poliovirus transmission were missed for periods of up to 15 months, con rming signi cant sub-national surveillance gaps. While the security situation in mid-2008 initially restricted the efforts of the programme to improve surveillance quality, data analysis and review of priorities are now carried out on a quarterly basis to assess the risks of missed transmission. Improvements by end-2008 include the establishment of three sub-national of ces, allowing close supervision of surveillance focal points in the provinces. Southern Sudan/Western Ethiopia: At the national and provincial level, 2008 surveillance indicators exceeded certi cation quality in both Sudan and Ethiopia. However, detection in 2008 of a virus in the border area of southern Sudan and Ethiopia, which had circulated undetected for 36 months, con rmed that sub-national surveillance gaps persist. Following a surveillance review in southern Sudan in early 2009, improvements being undertaken include more systematic active surveillance visits to address the under-reporting of AFP cases, which is partly due to weak infrastructure. Technical support to southern Sudan has been stepped up with the deployment of over 20 WHO staff and consultants. Ethiopia conducted a review in late 2008 to identify high-risk zones in need of special attention, and these zones are now being targeted to improve the quality of surveillance and immunization activities. Angola: Angola's surveillance indicators at national and sub-national level were of certi cation standard in 2008, but were below the higher operational target set for countries with importations. To help strengthen the reliability of surveillance indicators, 24 international consultants were deployed in early 2008. This bore immediate results: by end-2008, Angola nationally met the higher operational target set for countries with importations, although gaps at sub-national level still remain. 2.2. Global polio laboratory network A global network of 145 laboratories continues to support the GPEI. The primary responsibilities of the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) are the analysis and characterization of polioviruses from AFP cases, although samples from non-AFP sources are also analysed on request. WHO continues to coordinate and administer a laboratory quality assurance programme that involves accreditation based on annual performance reviews, pro ciency testing, and standardization of laboratory testing procedures. In 2008, the network tested approximately 157 200 faecal samples from 79 740 AFP cases 15 and 13 000 samples from non-AFP sources such as sewage water. The AFP workload increased by 10% overall compared to 2007, due to improvement in surveillance in the three remaining polio-endemic regions where workload increases were 18%, 14% and 10% in AFR, EMR and SEAR, respectively. 15 Data reported by WHO region up to 21 January 2009.In January 2008, WHO introduced a revised accreditation checklist for use in the GPLN. The main changes allow for review of laboratories using new test algorithms with target reporting times of seven and 14 days for virus isolation and Intra-typic Differentiation (ITD) respectively, and more detailed evaluation of management and biosafety. A new virus isolation pro ciency test panel was also introduced in 2008 for evaluating performance with the new algorithm and used in four WHO regions. The accreditation status of laboratories 16 was: 140 (96.6%) fully accredited, four provisionally accredited, and one laboratory with accreditation pending the repeat of the virus isolation pro ciency test. Laboratories in polio-endemic regions generally had little dif culty in meeting the 14-day timeline for reporting virus isolation results, but some with high workload or limited ITD experience did not meet the required standard for timely reporting of ITD results. 16 As of 21 January, 2009.27Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008 Detection and transmission links among wild polioviruses Analysis of the genetic relationships among WPV was carried out in 2008. Endemic transmission of two genotypes continued in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. New importations of WPV of Indian origin occurred in Angola and Nepal. Local transmission continued - of WPV that had been imported from India in previous years - in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the latter infecting the Central African Republic in 2008 as well. Endemic transmission continued in Nigeria in 2008. Additionally, 10 other countries 17 had new importations of WPV of Nigerian origin in 2008 and two (Chad and Sudan) had continued transmission of previously-imported WPV. Type 3 WPV in Sudan was most closely related to that found in Chad. Benin and Niger also had sporadic importations from neighbouring Nigeria. The GPLN also identi ed WPV in non-AFP samples in 2008. In India, both types 1 and 3 WPV were isolated intermittently from sewage collected in Mumbai (Maharashtra Province), predominantly related to viruses circulating in Bihar. In Egypt, two different type 1 WPVs were also isolated from single sewage samples collected in Giza in September 2008 and in Cairo in December 2008. 17 Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Sudan and T ogo.These two isolates represented separate introductions of viruses of Nigerian (transmitted via Sudan) and Indian origins, respectively. Thorough follow-up investigations found no polio cases in Egypt. The new look of outbreak response: Faster and better lab work In Africa, between the rst quarters of 2008 and 2009, 15 countries suffered importations of poliovirus. The median interval between when a child rst developed AFP to con rmation of polio in the laboratory was 31 days, as opposed to the 51 days it took in outbreaks in 2002-2005. The contribution of this rapidity of detection to rapidity of response is clear: from laboratory con rmation to the rst large-scale vaccination response took 27 days in 2008, down from 37 days in the previous African outbreaks. Detection of vaccine-derived polioviruses The GPLN screens Sabin-related isolates to identify VDPVs (de ned as > 1% VP1 nucleotide sequence divergence from the parental Sabin virus). VDPVs were also found in sewage samples collected in Estonia, Israel, Finland and Switzerland in 2008, although no polio cases were found in any of these locations during follow-up investigations. Progress in developing better laboratory diagnostics in 2008 appears to have led to better detection of VDPVs. Detection sensitivity was increased by as much as 30% over traditional tests in the Nigeria outbreak, using a new VDPV screening test developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Programme experience of the real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test will be re-assessed in June 2009 and prior to introduction into all endemic regions by end-2009. Circulating Vaccine-derived Poliovirus type 2 cases, 2008 Nigeria: 62; Democratic Republic of the Congo: 14; Ethiopia: 3 Data as of 12 May, 200928Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Containing polio: Western Paci c Region completes Phase 1 Once WPV is eradicated, viruses will remain only in facilities for research, diagnostics and vaccine production. Work has already begun on managing the post-eradication risk of WPV being re-introduced from such facilities, with identi cation of these facilities through nationwide surveys - known as Phase I of poliovirus laboratory containment activities. In 2008, the WHO Western Paci c Region (WPR), encompassing 27 countries from South-east Asia to the South Paci c, became the second WHO Region to of cially complete Phase I containment in all Member States. Announcing this development, the WPR Regional Certi cation Commission (RCC) made special mention of both China and Japan for completing the Phase I activities. Both countries faced signi cant challenges due to their large number of biomedical laboratories, but nonetheless conducted surveys of more than 50 000 facilities across government and private sectors to identify those laboratories holding infectious or potentially infectious materials containing WPV. Surveying sectors of government not normally involved with polio eradication activities is a complex operation, testifying to the government commitment in China and Japan.The China and Japan surveys, along with those of the other Member States of the WPR, resulted in of cial identi cation of 45 facilities containing WPV materials in 4 out of 27 countries in the region. WPR follows EUR in completing Phase I of containment. The WHO Region of the Americas (AMR) has also made signi cant strides in 2008 towards completing Phase I. The AMR RCC has accepted as complete the reports on Phase I containment activities from 24 of the 35 Member States in the region. The remaining 11 countries will be reviewed at their meeting in 2009, clearing the way for AMR to complete this phase. Global completion of Phase I will occur only once WPV circulation has been interrupted and the Phase I activities are completed in the remaining four countries with indigenous poliovirus circulation. The Phase I survey and inventory activities together establish the baseline for WPV risk. The strategy to manage this risk is provided in the Global Action Plan to minimize poliovirus facility-associated risk in the post-eradication/post-OPV era (GAPIII). Based on risk assessments and wide consultation with experts in the elds of biosafety and risk management, GAPIII outlines a post-eradication strategy for both the minimization and the management of WPV risk at such facilities. 18 18 See Section 3.3 for 2008 activities on GAPIII. Catching cVDPVs Detection sensitivity in the Nigeria cVDPV outbreak increased by as much as 30% over traditional tests by using the new rRT-PCR VDPV screening test developed by CDC. The new method was evaluated through testing more than 4000 poliovirus isolates at the CDC and more than 1000 isolates under eld conditions in reference laboratories in India, Pakistan and South Africa. These evaluations involved testing of wild type, vaccine-derived and Sabin-like poliovirus isolates of all three serotypes.Preliminary results from prospective testing con rmed higher sensitivity for type 2 VDPV screening compared to traditional methods, nding close to 60 VDPV cases in Nigeria and 17 VDPV cases in other African countries. Additionally, some AFP cases were identi ed retrospectively as VDPVs previously missed by the traditional VDPV screening approach, including type 2 VDPV cases from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (two from 2005 and one from 2007) and Somalia (one from 2005). Implementation of the new screening method in all ITD laboratories of the network is planned for 2009 and 2010. 2.3. Containment of poliovirus29Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008To prepare for the eventual certi cation of the eradication of WPV in the three remaining WHO Regions with circulating WPV, Regional Certi cation Commissions (RCCs) and National Certi cation Committees (NCCs) continue to meet regularly to review submissions by eligible countries where no WPV has been found for at least three years in the presence of certi cation-quality surveillance. In 2008, the number of eligible countries from which the RCCs accepted nal certi cation documentation increased: in AFR, from 21 to 24 (of 46 Member States); in EMR, from 15 to 19 (of 23 Member States); while in SEAR, the number remained stable at nine (of 11 Member States), with India and Timor-Leste pending.Furthermore, two fully certi ed regions - WPR and EUR - maintained their RCCs and NCCs to support activities to maintain polio-free status and to achieve /maintain laboratory containment in all countries 19. RCCs in both these regions met in 2008 and reviewed annual update reports from all countries. As in the previous years since regional certi cation, the RCCs' close scrutiny of AFP and immunization data from all Member States was one of the main reasons why both polio-free regions were able to maintain certi cation-quality surveillance and adequate levels of immunity against polio, particularly in known high-risk groups and areas. 19 The Americas did not maintain their certi cation bodies following regional certi cation, but established a Regional Commission for Laboratory Containment and Veri cation of Polio-free Status in 2004, mainly to oversee laboratory containment activities.2.4. Certification of global polio eradication Progress towards Phase 1 of Global Containment, at end-2008 Polio endemic Conducting survey Reporting completion of survey and inventoryNot started containmentPolio re-infected in 200830Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Once global WPV transmission has been interrupted, WPV stocks contained and eradication certi ed worldwide, the greatest risk of polio being re-introduced will derive from the attenuated polioviruses contained in OPV, resulting in vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and outbreaks due to VDPVs. With these risks in mind, the WHA, in its May 2008 resolution, requested the WHO Director-General \"to set, if and when appropriate, a date for the eventual cessation of use of OPV\" in routine immunization programmes. In response to the WHA's directive, the GPEI intensi ed its programme of work to develop the most appropriate strategies for managing the post-eradication, long-term risks of polio. The Polio Research Committee (PRC) was reconstituted in 2008, with experts in the elds of virology, epidemiology, sociology and public health from around 20 Details in Appendix A.the world. The PRC operates under the auspices of the ACPE and the SAGE. The group held its inaugural meeting in May 2008, and is now providing further guidance to the GPEI on long-term risk management by reviewing polio eradication-related research, identifying knowledge gaps, proposing appropriate studies, determining research priorities and funding levels, reviewing external research proposals and engaging potential new collaborators. This aspect of the GPEI research agenda is focused on three areas: Fully characterizing the long-term polio risks, especially VDPVs Developing tools to manage the long-term risks Contributing to policy frameworks to internationally coordinate the management of the long-term risks of polio. 3. Strategic objective III Management of long-term risks after wild poliovirus eradication Milestone 200820Status Milestone 1: Long-term immunization policies will be introduced. Achieved Milestone 2: Additional tools for the detection and immediate noti cation of circulating WPV will be nalized (where appropriate).Achieved Milestone 3: Assembly of mOPV stockpile will begin. Not achieved Milestone 4: Implementation and veri cation of GAPIII will begin. Not achieved 3.1. Characterization of long-term polio risks In 2008, signi cant new knowledge was gained on the post-eradication risks posed by OPV. The risks of VAPP being already well-known 20, research activities in 2008 focused on the risks relating to VDPVs. Experience with circulating VDPV events in the past 10 years suggests that limited population immunity is the main risk for the spread of a cVDPV. In 2008, cVDPVs were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria. 31Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 20083.2. Developing tools to manage long-term risks To reduce the potential risks associated with OPV cessation and to manage the long-term risks of stored polioviruses, new tools are being developed as called for by the PRC, ACPE and SAGE guidance bodies and mandated by the WHA. Detection of VDPVs: faster and more sensitive In addition to more sensitive detection, the advantages of the new rRT-PCR screening method for VDPVs include data output in computerized format and minimal risk of sample contamination. It is planned to fully implement rRT-PCR assays in 13 of the 17 ITD laboratories in EMR and SEAR and to hold a training workshop in AFR by end-2009. Ensuring outbreak response capacity: monovalent OPV stockpiles In 2008, more than 1.2 billion doses of type 1 mOPV were administered in 23 countries, and more than 370 million doses of type 3 mOPV administered in eight countries. This experience helps formulate policy on post-eradication immunization strategies. To ensure outbreak response capacity for cVDPVs detected immediately following OPV cessation, an international stockpile of monovalent OPVs must be established, maintained and managed. By end-2008, six type 1 mOPVs and three type 3 mOPVs had been licensed, as a result of an expedited approach to licensure agreed by WHO and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in monovalent OPV-producing countries. Additionally, one manufacturer licensed a type 2 mOPV and another application for licensure is pending. Before the end of 2009, an initial stockpile tender will be issued by UNICEF for the development and licensing of 21 See section 2.2all three mOPVs and for the production of initial bulks for the stockpile. Affordable IPV options Following OPV cessation, IPV will be the only option with which to maintain population immunity against polio for those countries that need or choose to do so. While the full role of IPV following OPV cessation is still being evaluated, at a minimum IPV will be needed in all countries that continue to store and handle polioviruses. Other countries may perceive that the long-term poliovirus risks warrant continued routine immunization with IPV. Recognizing that the current costs of IPV are substantially higher than OPV, the development of affordable strategies for IPV use (i.e. ideally to achieve immunity at a cost similar to that achieved through OPV) in low-income settings was accelerated in 2008. A vial of temperature-sensitive monovalent oral polio vaccine in India. \u00a9 Sephi BergersonTo better detect VDPVs (and further de ne the extent of this risk), the new state-of-the-art screening method known as rRT-PCR was piloted by the Global Polio Laboratory Network.21 Initial data from the Nigeria outbreak shows the test increased cVDPV sensitivity by up to 30%. A study series continues to measure the prevalence of VDPV excretion among people diagnosed with primary immune (B-cell) de ciency disorders (PIDs), with speci c outcomes expected to be: an estimation of the prevalence of immunode ciency-associated VDPV (iVDPV) excretion among PIDs in a broad geographical variety of middle- and low-income settings; genetic characterization of iVDPVs; and further insight into the duration of iVDPV excretion. This work is being carried out in Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Senegal and Tunisia. After study protocols were adapted to national contexts, ethical clearances were obtained through national and WHO processes for China, the Russian Federation and Tunisia in 2008, and implementation began in the latter two. The remaining countries are expected to implement their studies in 2009.32Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008To this effect, the GPEI entered into a multi-year collaboration on Sabin-based IPV with the Netherlands Vaccine Institute in 2008. This collaboration encompasses a number of clinical development projects for IPV using Sabin-strain polioviruses to facilitate IPV production in developing country settings, including an assessment of alternative inactivation processes to improve the immunogenicity of these strains. By end-2008, projects already under way included an evaluation of Sabin-virus seed strains, one alternative inactivation process and production of master virus seed-lots. Other collaborative research on affordable IPV strategies which took place or secured funding through the PRC in 2008 included four studies on alternate seed-strains of Sabin viruses, four on fractional dosing of IPV and three on the use of adjuvants. To evaluate the role of IPV before and after OPV cessation and help develop long-term immunization policies, a SAGE working group on IPV was constituted in 2008. In November, the working group presented the SAGE with a framework to assess potential options for immunization in the post-eradication era in low- and middle-income countries. This framework will be completed through a combination of new clinical and operational research. 3.3. Coordinating the management of long-term poliovirus risks Of the six major elements of the risk-management strategy for the post-eradication era, 22 three require international coordination: synchronization of eventual OPV cessation, use of vaccines from a mOPV stockpile in outbreak response after OPV cessation, and long-term containment of polioviruses. 22 Framework for National Policy Makers in OPV-using Countries: Cessation of routine OPV use after global polio eradication, WHO, 2005.Synchronization of eventual OPV cessation Based on a series of expert technical consultations 23, in 2004 the ACPE recommended that use of OPV should cease as soon as possible after the interruption of WPV worldwide in order to minimize the long-term risks. In May 2008, the WHA resolution on polio eradication requested that 23 WHO Informal Consultation on Identi cation and Management of Vaccine-derived Polioviruses, September 2003. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative understands the need for agreed processes and policy for the handling of the mOPV stockpile after the final drop is administered. \u00a9 WHO / JG Brouwer33Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008work begin to set a date for the eventual cessation of OPV use in routine immunization programmes, if and when appropriate. In November, the SAGE re-af rmed the ACPE recommendation, and the GPEI will now work on developing, as requested by the WHA, a comprehensive mechanism for managing the risks. Use of a mOPV stockpile for outbreak response after routine OPV cessation Given the small but real risk associated with even attenuated polioviruses (i.e. cVDPVs), it is essential that there be internationally-agreed processes governing the use of mOPV for outbreak response after the cessation of trivalent OPV use in routine immunization programmes. Documents such as the Standard Operating Procedures for a mOPV stockpile translate such policy advice into actionable guidelines. In 2008, the PRC made a grant to Kids Risk Inc., formerly part of a Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology collaboration, to continue mathematical modelling of outbreak response scenarios for polioviruses following OPV cessation to further inform policy in this area. Long-term containment of polioviruses Based on wide consultation with experts in biosafety and risk management, the Global Action Plan to minimize poliovirus facility-associated risk in the post-eradication/post-OPV era (GAPIII) outlines a post-eradication strategy of risk minimization through the destruction of unneeded poliovirus materials in all but a few essential facilities, as well as risk management in such facilities by strict adherence to required safeguards. A full list of facilities which will continue to store or handle poliovirus after eradication 24 is being compiled to clearly establish the baseline risks they present, which are to be managed by the strategies laid out in GAPIII. 24 See section 2.3Throughout 2008, ongoing consultation and further analysis of the difference in reproductive rates between wild and attenuated polioviruses resulted in re nement of GAPIII. After interruption of WPV transmission, facilities retaining WPV will need to meet three safeguards: Primary safeguards: facilities must retain all virus stocks under international standard containment speci cations to minimize the risk of a containment failure Secondary safeguards: facilities must be located in areas of high IPV immunization coverage to minimize the consequences of any containment failure Tertiary safeguards: facilities must be located in areas of high standards of personal, domestic and environmental sanitation to minimize the risk of transmission following any containment failure. Facilities retaining only OPV/Sabin materials will be required to meet only the primary and secondary safeguards, due to the lower potential for transmission of the attenuated strains as compared to WPV. This strategy may permit IPV production in tropical settings using Sabin or more attenuated strains, while at the same time maintaining the high levels of biosafety required. Following veri cation of VAPP/VDPV elimination, however, safeguards for Sabin IPV may also be enhanced, especially if safer, alternate seed strains for IPV have been developed, characterized and validated by that time. GAPIII will be released for an extended period of public comment in 2009 before nalization.

Comprising human resources, communication networks, operational guidelines and standards, independent strategic guidance bodies and streamlined partner coordination mechanisms, together with the 'nuts and bolts' of the operation - the of ces, vehicles and medical and non-medical equipment - this infrastructure is not only a living asset to the countries in which it operates, but is superbly placed to assist in disease surveillance, large-scale immunization operations, and public health or national emergencies as they occur. In 2008 alone, GPEI staff and infrastructure responded to catastrophic fl oods in Bihar, India, were deployed to tackle the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as outbreaks of cholera and avian infl uenza in Africa and Asia, and provided support for measles immunization in several countries, as well as immunization with DTP, yellow fever and tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccines in Nigeria. In many areas of the world, polio staff constitute the single largest resource of technical assistance for immunization and surveillance in low-income countries. Of 999 WHO immunization staff in the AFR, for example, 914 (91%) are funded by the polio programme, with the vast majority spending a considerable proportion of their time on work related to immunization, surveillance and outbreak 25 Details in Appendix A.response for diseases other than polio. Polio employs more than 3000 technical and support staff globally. Their day-to-day work includes health staff training, district-level microplanning, refurbishment of vaccine cold chain systems, and scaling up the technical capacity of networks for surveillance and monitoring of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). As human resources in the polio effort are scaled down with progress towards eradication, it will be essential that this does not create a vacuum for other health programmes. Key decisions on post-eradication planning in 2008 - notably the WHA resolution in May - paved the way for more concrete planning for the mainstreaming of the GPEI in the long term. A key element of a new strategic plan for GPEI is a timeline to help countries in their long-term planning and preparation for integration and downscaling processes, once polio is eradicated. The timeline is of course dependent on interrupting WPV transmission in the remaining infected areas. The downscaling processes will eventually encompass all functions currently performed by polio-funded staff - such as immunization planning and monitoring, policy development, training and surveillance for other VPDs - with a view to transitioning these functions to other internationally- or nationally-funded immunization staff. To minimize the risks associated with OPV cessation, international agencies and national governments will need to, inter alia: ensure sustained AFP surveillance for at least ve years following OPV cessation; maintain long-term polio surveillance and outbreak response capacity; 4. Strategic objective IV Mainstreaming of the Global polio eradication Initiative Milestone 200825Status Milestone 1: All joint GAVI/Polio priority countries will implement integrated plans. Not achieved Milestone 2: All countries will have integrated or expanded AFP reporting, as appropriate (especially for measles and neonatal tetanus).Not achieved Milestone 3: All countries will have a GAVI-supported Interagency Coordination Committee (ICC) and if appropriate, a Technical Advisory Group (TAG).Achieved Milestone 4: All polio-funded \"human resources\" will formally contribute to multi- disease programmes.Achieved Milestone 5: All countries will have polio operations which are fully integrated with those for measles.Not achieved35Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008implement full containment of Sabin polioviruses; and verify VAPP/VDPV elimination. To this effect, work continued in 2008 to ensure that the long-term functions, including containment, surveillance and outbreak response capacity, would be managed in the long-term in other, non-GPEI institutions and oversight bodies (e. g. WHO's Global Alert and Response Network and the SAGE). In the near-term, a risk analysis will be conducted to ascertain how downscaling will affect other public health programmes, and a risk management plan developed in coordination and consultation with country-level programmes and appropriate stakeholders in other public health programmes, especially immunization. Year sMajor Activitie sKey MilestonePeriod 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 Last WPV WPV Co world the post-2013 period36Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008 Counting every child - Because every child counts In the teeming streets of India's Uttar Pradesh state, ensuring each of the estimated 38 million children in India's most populous state receives the optimum doses of polio vaccine remains one of the GPEI's greatest challenges. For here, some 500 000 children are born every month and until recently, the names of up to half of those children were not making it onto the of cial medical registry. Each month, mobile polio vaccination teams, which walk from house to house to ensure blanket immunization coverage, continued to nd unregistered, unimmunized newborns. Not only are these infants susceptible to contracting and carrying polio, but their unregistered status skews immunization coverage gures, making planning for the immunization effort an unwanted guessing game. Seeking a solution, the National Polio Surveillance Project established the Tracking Every Newborn initiative, where individual immunization teams recorded the details of each newborn infant on their house-to-house visits, moments before giving them their rst dose of OPV.In a 12-month pilot project undertaken across one block in each of eight districts of western Uttar Pradesh, the names of all newborns were added to the immunization registers held by the local Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs). After six months, the number of registered children had nearly doubled. While the ANM registers showed 16 569 newborn children, polio workers con rmed an additional 15 742 newborn children. It was then possible to determine more accurate immunization coverage, which showed, for example, that of the 32 311 infants who now appeared on the of cial register, only 60% were fully immunized against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3). 26 The Tracking Every Newborn project has also motivated the community - from ANMs and vaccinators to the parents themselves - to ensure that all newborn children are placed on the of cial register for routine immunization purposes. The Uttar Pradesh Government subsequently requested that the successful initiative be expanded to other blocks, to ensure every child in Uttar Pradesh gets counted - because every child counts. 26 DTP3 coverage is used as a measure of immunization coverage. Polio's determination to reach every newborn child in India has proved a boon for Uttar Pradesh's official immunization register. \u00a9 WHO / JG Brouwer37Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008 Financial Contributions for 2008Renewed nancial commitments by polio-endemic countries and donors, especially Rotary International, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm) and several G8 countries, assured the full nancing of the 2008 planned budget. The Government of India in early 2008 committed domestic resources of up to US$ 225 million for its polio eradication efforts. The Government of Nigeria in 2008 contributed US$ 21.3 million from its national coffers. The Government of Pakistan committed US$ 20 million in domestic nancing for OPV for SIAs in 2008, while working out the modalities to provide additional OPV funding for 2009-2010. The Government of Bangladesh also provided US$ 10.8 million from the Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Programme (HNPSP) Pooled Funding mechanism for activities in 2008. At its annual convention in June, Rotary International launched a US$ 100 million fund-raising campaign to match the US$ 100 million contributed to Rotary by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In July, on the eve of the G8 Summit in Toyako, Hokkaido, Japan, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a US$ 150 million contribution to the GPEI and encouraged G8 countries to step up their support. At the Summit, G8 leaders highlighted polio eradication in their Summit communiqu\u00e9 for the seventh successive year: \"To maintain momentum towards the historical achievement of eradicating polio, we will meet our previous commitments to maintain or increase nancial contributions to support the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and encourage other public and private donors to do the same.\" This commitment follows previous statements of support, at every Summit since Kananaskis, Canada, in 2002. 5.

These activities were in response to an importation from Bihar, India, with which Nepal shares an extended border. This contribution brings Australia's total support to the GPEI to US$ 16.01 million. Azerbaijan made its second contribution to polio eradication in 2008 in support of polio eradication efforts in the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Member States, bringing its total contributions toUS $ 40 000. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced US $150 million in new funding to be utilized in 2008 and 2009, and encouraged G8 leaders to translate polio their commitments into \"real nancial resources\". This contribution brings the Foundation's total contribution to the GPEI, including matching grants provided to Rotary International, to US $ 655 million. Brunei Darussalam made its rst ever contribution of US$ 150 000 in 2008, in response to the OIC's call for increased political and nancial support for polio eradication. Canada continued its strong support for the GPEI, disbursing US$ 32.5 million for Afghanistan, Nigeria, and sub-Saharan Africa as part of multi-year contributions totaling US$ 68.95 million. Canada is the fourth-largest public sector donor to the GPEI, providing more than US$ 260 million.In addition to its role as a spearheading partner, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2008 provided funding for OPV, operational costs and programme support to UNICEF and WHO and continued to dispatch its epidemiologists, virologists and technical of cers to assist polio-affected countries in implementing polio eradication activities. US Congress appropriations to the CDC for polio eradication in its scal year 2008 totaled US $101.5 million, bringing the CDC's total contributions to more than US$ 1.2 billion. The European Commission (EC) disbursed US$ 8.2 million in 2008 as part of its 2007 US$ 28.8 million ( \u20ac20 million) three-year agreement for polio eradication activities in Nigeria, and signed a new 2009-2010 contribution for Bangladesh for US$ 2 million (\u20ac1.4 million). These new contributions bring total EC polio eradication funding to more than US$ 193 million. In 2008, Germany provided US$ 80.96 million for OPV in India and Nigeria as well as global unspeci ed funding. These new contributions bring Germany's total support to the GPEI to US$ 224.7 million. Iceland has been providing unspeci ed support to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative since 2005. Its 2008 contribution of US$ 100 000 brings Iceland's support to the Initiative to US$ 300 000. Ireland in 2008 complemented an existing pledge with an additional US$ 3.73 million ( \u20ac3 million), bringing Ireland's total contributions to the polio eradication effort to more than US$ 20.5 million. Japan continued to provide critical support for the procurement of OPV. In 2008, it provided US$ 19.45 million in OPV funding for Angola, Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sudan. This new support brings Japan's total contribution to the GPEI to over US$ 353 million, making Japan the third-largest public sector donor to the Initiative.

As part of a 2006-2008 pledge, Luxembourg contributed US$ 2.41 million in 2008, bringing its total contributions to more than US$ 10.5 million. Malaysia almost doubled its previous contributions when, at the WHA in May, Malaysian Health Minister Datuk Liow Tiong Lai pledged US$ 1 million on behalf of his government, bringing Malaysia's total funding toUS$ 2.13 million. Monaco provided its fourth contribution to the Initiative, increasing its previous year's support to US$ 90 000 to support activities in Niger. This brings Monaco's total funding for polio eradication activities in Niger to US$ 300 000. The Netherlands Ministry of Health in 2008 provided US$ 240 000 to support polio work at the Dutch Institute of Public Health and the Environment, bringing the Netherlands total contribution to polio eradication to US$ 113.1 million. Norway has consistently provided important unspeci ed contributions to the GPEI. In 2008, it provided US$ 7.65 million, bringing its total contributions to the GPEI to US$ 57 million. The OPEC Fund for International Development provided two grants of US$ 500 000 each for polio eradication activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, raising its total contributions to the GPEI to US$ 1.75 million. Spain contributed US$ 3.35 million, for surveillance activities in Angola, Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau and Namibia. Spain's total contribution to the GPEI totals US$ 9.6 million. Rotary International , in addition to being a spearheading partner in the GPEI, also remains the largest private sector donor. At its annual convention in June, Rotary International launched a US$ 100 million fundraising campaign, to match the US$ 100 million contribution to Rotary International by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in November 2007. In 2008, Rotary contributed US$ 130.5 million. By 2013, Rotary International will have contributed more than US$ 1 billion to the GPEI. The Russian Federation , in response to the commitments made in the 2008 G8 communiqu\u00e9, signed a three-year commitment to provide US$ 10 million for 2008-2010. In 2008, it disbursed US$ 8.94 million, including funding from a previous multi-year commitment. Turkey made its second contribution to the GPEI in 2008. It provided US$ 100 000 for polio eradication activities in Afghanistan, bringing its total support to US$ 150 000. The United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) continued to play a critical nancing role in the Initiative, providing global unspeci ed support as well as targeted needs in Pakistan. In 2008, DFID signed a ve-year US$ 153 million (\u00a3100 million) agreement, as well as providing US$ 14 million (\u00a37.5 million) for meeting operations and surveillance support to the programme in Pakistan. In 2008, DFID disbursed US$ 41.3 million (\u00a327.5 million). The United Nations Foundation (UNF) in 2008 provided US$ 210 000 for the GPEI's resource mobilization efforts. This funding brings the UNF's total support for the GPEI to over US$ 43 million. US Congress in its scal year 2008 allocated US$ 32 million to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for polio eradication activities. Funds were used to support social mobilization, surveillance and laboratory support, outbreak response and monitoring in priority countries, bringing USAID's total support to US$ 358 million. World Bank Investment Partnership for Polio In 2001, an innovative nancing mechanism, commonly referred to as 'IDA buy-downs', was developed to allow the use of credit issued by the International Development Association (IDA), the concessionary lending arm of the World Bank, for OPV procurement for polio eradication activities. Third-party donor funding (provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the CDC, Rotary International and the UNF) is used to \"buy-down\" IDA credits and turn them into grants. In 2008, US$ 10.72 million in World Bank IDA credit was provided to Nigeria and Pakistan for their current buy-downs and a new US$ 50 million buy-down for Nigeria was signed with funding to be disbursed in 2009 and 2010. The total amount of the World Bank Investment Partnership for Polio funding is US$ 210 million. 40Global polio eradication Initiative GpeI Annual Report 2008Objectives Milestones for 2008 Status Comment Interrupt poliovirus transmissionNo countries will be polio- endemic at the end of 2008.Not achievedFour countries remain polio-endemic - India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan - with poliovirus circulating in speci c, geographically-limited areas in each country.At end-2008, the ACPE and SAGE concluded that the intensi ed polio eradication effort launched by the GPEI stakeholders in February 2007 had demonstrated that the remaining technical, nancial and operational challenges can be overcome.
