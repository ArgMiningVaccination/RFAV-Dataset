Varying the dose of ASA was without ef-fect on appetite and food energy intake; however,as appetite was ratedlower by the medicated os-teoarthritic than by the healthy group, although theenergy intakes were notsignificantly different, theformer should be considered as potentially at nutri-tional risk.4NAL Call No: TX361.A3J63Actual the elderly v. 8 (4): p. 25-39. charts; 1988. nutritionalknowledge of 150 noninstitutionalized elderly indi-viduals was measured using mean scores on a 20item test.

Age-related taste alterations arecontroversial, but there is consensus on anolfactory decline with age. Much of the age-relatedchemoreceptive research has used inappropriatemethodology, thus leaving many findings incon-clusive. Changes in the taste system with age maybe related to nutrient intake, which in turn can beinfluenced by taste. Literature on such inter-relationships is limited. Vitamins A, thiamin, B-6,B-12, folacin, zinc, and copper are thought to in-fluence taste function. Moreover, those nutrientsare of concern in the aged. The use of appropriatemethodology is critical not only for the s( ory but 2also for the nutritional aspects, particularly forqualitative and quantitative assessments of nutrientintakes.

Calcium and vitamin D statuswere studied in 193 healthy elderly French people.Calcium intake was less than 500 mg/d in 62% ofthe patients and the vitamin D intake was less than5 micrograms/d in all patients. They also exhibitedreduced levels of serum calcium (SCa) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) and high levels ofparathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkalinephosphatase (SAP). The response to calcium (1000mg/d) and ergocalciferol (20 micrograms/d) sup- plementation given for 6 mo was evaluated in 65patients with 69 subjects taken as controls. Thetreatment induced a significant increase in SCa andin 25-OHD levels, and a subsequent decrease inPTH levels without modification of the mean cal- citriol levels. The biochemical changes were moremarked in long-stay hospital patients than in out-patients. All these changes were significantly dif-ferent from those observed in the control group.

Inadequate dietary in-takes and low nutritional status have beenidentified within elderly populations. Researchsuggests the elderly are at risk for inadequate con-sumption of dietary vitamin B-6, folacin and zinc; 20vitamin B-12. and iron are rarely a problem. Bioc- hemical data indicate vitamin B-6 status is fre-quently low in the elderly, while folacin and vitaminB-12 status is generally adequate. Iron status in- dices in the elderly are more difficult to interpret,but suggest a marginal adequacy.

The results of a Dutch nationalnutrition survey of food consumption and nutri-tional status among 539 independently living, ap-parently healthy elderly persons, aged 65 to 79years, show that in general the intake of macro-nutrients deviates from the Dutch recommen-dations. In particular, saturated fat intake and P:Sratio were unfavorable, especially for the solitaryelderly persons (saturated fat intake 19.0 + /- 3.2%and 17.7 +/- 3.3% total energy for men and wo-men, respectively). Except for vitamin B-6 (about92% of the recommendation on a group level formen and 78% for women), the intake ofmicronutrients studied is considered to be ade-quate. Elderly women living alone had a higher cal-cium:phosphorus ratio (0.76 + /- 0.12), lower meatconsumption (90 + j- 31 gm), and a lower meanHDL-cholesterol concentration (1.22 + 1- 0.28mmol/L) in serum than non-solitary elderly wo-men (Ca:P ratio 0.73 + /- 0.12, meat consumption100 + /- 36 gm, HDL-cholesterol concentration1.45 + /- 0.38 mmol/L).

Dietary supplements of choline and lecit-hin have been used to treat Alzheimer's diseasebut are ineffective.

Also, the trend in the1980s toward self improvement has stimulated in-terest iu health, fitness, and nutrition. These fac-tors, in turn, have influenced the way pew,- '-purchase, prepare, and consume food. The greaterpercentage of women in the work force and today'sfast-paced lifestyle have led to a growing demandfor convenience, especially as related to food.Modern lifestyles also are characterized by morefragmented meals--\"eating on the run,\" eating awayfrom home, buying take-out foods, or orderingfoods for home delivery. The nutritional implica-tions of these new eating patterns are being ques-tioned. However, it is the actual foods consumedthroughout the entire day, not necessarily whereor when people eat, that determine nutritional ade-quacy. The increased health consciousness ofAmericans is responsible for their heightenedconcern about the nutritional content of foot:, inparticular fat, cholesterol, sodium/salt, sugar,vitamins, and minerals. Improving nutritional in-take/status is being viewed by some consumers notjust as a means to avoid specific chronic diseasesbut to improve the quality of life.

Recent work has dem-onstrated that undernourished individuals have im-paired immune responses. The most consistentabnormalities are seen in cell-mediated immunity,complemt -,t system, phagocytes, mucosal Thesechanges, together with other handicapping factorsobserved in underprivileged societies, lead to moreinfections, which in turn produce physiologicalchanges that worsen nutritional status. It is nowestablished that deficiencies of single nutrients alsoimpair immune responses. The best studied arezinc, iron, vitamin 86, vitamin A, copper, andselenium. If malnutrition occurs during fetal life,as epitomized by small-for-gestational age infants,the effects on cell-mediated immunity are very sig-nificant and long lasting. There is much recentevidence to suggest that at the other end of theage spectrum, namely in old age, nutrition plays animportant role in maintenance of optimum immu-nity. Response to influenza virus and other vac-cines is improved when the nutritional deficienciesin the elderly are corrected. These interactions ofnutrition and immunity havehave several practkalapplications. (author) 180NAL Call N.Y. : Haworth nutrition for the elderly v. 6 (4): p. 3-16.charts; 1987.

Extract: Purposes were to assess the ef-fectiveness of an instrument designed to measurenutrition knowledge of older adults, and to use thisinstrument to compare nutrition knowledge ofolder adults according to age, sex, education, oc-cupation and sources of nutrition information. A24-item nutrition knowledge test was adapted foruse with older adults, and was administered to 104subjects (60 years of age and older) from twosenior citizen centers in a medium-sized Midwes-tern community. Data were analyzed using an itemanalysis to determine the best and poorest items, 51and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) to testfor significant differences in nutrition knowledgeby selected socio-demographic variables. Theresults revealed that the raw scores of the nutritionknowledge test ranged from 4 to 20 with a meanof 13.17 and standard deviation of 3.74. 1:-ghteenitems met the item analysis criteria, while theremaining six items were judged as poor. Theresults of the ANOVA showed significant differ-ences in nutrition knowledge by educational leveland occupation, with those with college educationbackgrounds and professional occupations havinghigher scores than other groups. Findings suggestthat objective tests can be developed and used witholder adult audiences, and that nutrition educationefforts need to be focused on older adults fromlower socioeconomic backgrounds.

The amount of DHA necessary tomaintain normal amounts of the liver and brainphospholipids postnatally is 11 mg/kg daily. El-derly patients on long-term gastric tube feedingsand others on long-term intravenous fluids and ontotal parenteral nutrition are particularly prone todeficiencies of alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapen-taenoic acid (EPA) and DHA. The amounts esti-mated to prevent deficiencies in the elderly are800-1100 mg/d of alpha-linolenic acid and 300-400mg/d of EPA and DHA combined.

A.London The Foundation; Jan.BNF British Nutrition Zinc is an essential trace element and isrequired for such processes as growth, immunityand reproduction. Many people, nen in di'scountry, have a marginal intake of zinc and seve alcommon dietary constituents can impair its absorp-tion. Despite homeostatic regulation of zinc ab-sorption, subclinical zinc deficiency may becommon, although it is difficult to detect. Attentionto the zinc nutrition of at-risk groups such as themalnourished, children, pregnant women and theelderly is therefore required. Zinc is relatively non- tcodc and should be used in the prevention andtreatment of zinc deficiency and possibly otheidisorders.
