Journal of Infection March 22, 2020 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jinf.2020.03.035 Purpose To determine if serum amyloid A (SAA) is a marker for prognosis and severity of COVID19. Study design Case series (n = 132 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods From January 18 - February 26 2020, 132 inpatients from Tianyou Hospital in Wu - han, China with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated for lab data and clini - cal assessment. Time points included admission, 2-5 days of hospitalization, and at the composite endpoint (Feb 26 2020). The data evaluated included blood SAA, C Reactive Protein (CRP) , procalcitonin (PCT), (L), platelet count (PLT), CT imaging, and disease progression. At the study endpoint, patients status was assessed as discharged, still inpatient, or expired. Findings Patients showed high levels of SAA and CRP . Out of 132 patients, 123 had SAA above 10mg/L (<10mg/L set as normal clinical reference). The L count decreased in these patients. As patients with COVID-19 became worse in clinical severity, the levels of SAA and CRP increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased. Using a ROC curve, the ratio of SAA/L was more sensitive in predicting the severity of COVID-19 clinical course than measuring SAA and L individually. When comparing the CT scans to the SAA level, patients with a higher SAA were more likely to have worse CT findings. Clinical ImplicationsLevels of SAA and CRP increase significantly in patients with COVID-19 infec - tions, and increased proportionally with respect to clinical severity. Lympho - cyte count (L) decreased in these patients as well. The ratio of SAA/L appears to be a more sensitive measure predicting severity of clinical manifestation as opposed to measuring SAA or L alone. Using both SAA and CT scans can aid clinicians in predicting patient severity. Limitations This study did not utilize a control group. Additionally, patients came from a single hospital, limiting generalizability of findings.DIAGNOSISReview by Kelsey Danley, MS4 (COVID-19): rRT-PCR or CT? Chunqin Long et al. European Journal of Radiology March 25, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108961 Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and real-time re - verse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Retrospective chart review (n = 87 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Nasopharyngeal isolates and CT imaging were obtained on 87 patients among 204 patients suspected of having COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and sent for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and CT scans were examined retrospectively by two radiologists with 10 and 15 years of expe - rience in chest imaging, respectively. In cases of disagreement, a consensus was reached. CT evaluations included the lobar location and pattern of the lesion. Findings On CT imaging, peripheral distributions were observed more in the diseased group (72.2%) vs more focal consolidation (52.0%) in the control group (p<0.05). Moreover, ground-glass opacities were observed more frequently in the dis - ease group. Only one patient with COVID-19 had a normal chest CT. This yielded a sensitivity of 97.2% (35/36). In terms of the rRT-PCR testing, the test was initial - ly positive in 30 patients, for a sensitivity of 83.3% (30/36). However, of the six false-negative patients, three were positive with a second round of testing, and the final three were positive with a third round of testing. Clinical ImplicationsCT imaging proved to be more sensitive than rRT-PCR in the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in China. This study recommends that pa - tients with positive CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results still be placed in isolation and have rRT-PCR testing repeated in the subsequent days of admission. Limitations The study has a small sample size, likely because it was conducted during the height of the pandemic in China. The number of rRT-PCR tests conducted were limited by supply, and only those with fever and a positive CT test were tested with rRT-PCR.DIAGNOSISReview by Paul Parker, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCOVID-19 infection among asymptomatic and symptomatic preg - nant women: Two weeks of confirmed presentations to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals. Noelle Breslin et al. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology MFM April 9, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100118 Purpose To present the clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases presenting to an affiliated pair of NYC hospitals over 2 weeks between March 13 and March 27, 2020. Study design Case series (n = 43) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Retrospective review of medical records over a 15-day period beginning with the first PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection involving a pregnant patient on March 13, 2020. Clinical documentation for all pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 via PCR nasopharyngeal swab was reviewed. Records related to neonates born to COVID-19 positive women were also reviewed. Findings 43 pregnant women tested positive for COVID-19 infection during the study period. The mean maternal age was 26.9 \u00b15.9 years and median gestational age was 37 and 0/7 weeks. 86% of COVID-19 positive women showed mild disease, 9.3% exhib - ited severe disease and 2 developed critical disease presentations. 41.8% of women had an additional comorbid condition, with mild intermittent asthma as the most common. 14 (32.5%) of 43 patients initially presented without COVID-19 associated symptoms. No infants were found to be COVID-19 positive after birth. Clinical ImplicationsUniversal testing among pregnant women upon admission for delivery can help with infection control , and allows hospitals to preserve limited PPE supplies among women who are test-negative. There may also be implications in the man - agement of neonates delivered to COVID positive women and it supports more re - strictive visitor policies, strict hand and respiratory hygiene precautions, and mask - ing of all patients and birth partners, as well as staff on the labor unit. COVID-19 should also be considered on the differential diagnosis in women present with common perinatal and postoperative infectious or respiratory complications. Limitations This study was the largest case series to date of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, although the sample size still remains small. This cohort includes patients presenting for care at either a tertiary care center or a smaller community hospital in NYC, but these findings may be generalizable to other centers or regions with lower disease prevalence.DIAGNOSISReview by Wendy Tian, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubProfiling early humoral response to diagnose novel coronavirus dis - ease (COVID-19) Li Guo et al. Clinical Infectious Diseases March 21, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa310 Purpose To describe the timeline of antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the efficacy of diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Study design Cross-sectional study Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Paired plasma samples and throat swabs were collected from 82 confirmed (via qPCR or deep sequencing) and 58 probable (qPCR and deep sequencing negative, but typi - cal symptoms) COVID-19 cases from Beijing and Wuhan hospitals. 135 plasma samples collected from adults in 2018 with acute lower respiratory tract infections and 150 plas - ma samples collected from healthy adults in 2018 and 2019 were used as controls. Host response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined using ELISA on recombinant viral nucleocap - sid protein. Cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV were tested by Western Blotting. CLustalW program was utilized to align nucleocapsid gene sequences. Findings IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were positively detected, respectively, in 90.4%, 93.3%, and 77.9% of the plasma samples collected from confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19. The median time to IgM and IgA detection was 5 days after symptom onset, peaking between 8-14 days. The median time to IgG detection was 14 days after symptom onset, peaking between 15-21 days. The detection rate for a single PCR test is 51.9% with >90% positive detection 1-3 days after symptom onset. By day 5, PCR detec - tion decreases to <80%, then <50% at 14 days. When comparing PCR to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detection, the detection rate was higher by qPCR within the first 5.5 days after symptom onset, and higher by IgM ELISA after 5.5 days of symptom onset. Perform - ing IgM ELISA on qPCR negative samples, however, increased the detection rate to 98.6%. Clinical ImplicationsTesting for the presence of IgM on PCR negative samples in cases of suspected COVID-19 could improve sensitivity of testing and aid in early detection of subclini - cal patients , helping to prevent spread of the virus with early and accurate diagnosis. Limitations This study used a cross-sectional sample. Due to individual variation in production of antibody development, longitudinal studies likely would have yielded more reliable data. A strong cross reactivity was found between SARS-CoV-2 recombinant N proteins with human plasma positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-1, but not NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1. It is unlikely, however, that these patients were pre-infected with SARS-CoV-1 during the last epidemic in 2002. DIAGNOSISReview by Hannah Raff, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubClinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China W Guan et al. New England Journal of Medicine February 28, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2002032 Purpose To identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in China. Study design Case series (n = 1,099) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The study included 1,099 COVID-19 patients from 552 hospitals across 30 provinces in mainland China from December 11, 2019 to January 29, 2020. Data included exposure history, clinical symptoms, and laboratory and radiologic findings. Cases were defined as severe vs. non-severe using the American Thoracic Society guidelines for communi - ty-acquired pneumonia. Incubation period was defined as time between earliest date of exposure and symptom onset. The primary composite end point was admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, or death. Findings Most patients (43.9%) were Wuhan residents, and 72.3% of nonresidents reported contact with Wuhan residents. However, 25.9% of nonresidents denied recent travel or contact with Wuhan residents. Patient ages ranged from 0-14 (0.9%), 15-49 (55.1%), 50-64 (28.9%), and >65 (15.1%), with median age of 47 years. Most patients had nev - er smoked (85.4%), and 12.6% were current smokers. The most common presenting symptom was cough (67.8%), followed by fever (43.8%). Admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, or death occurred in 24.9% of patients with severe disease and 6.1% of all patients. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 91.1% of patients and acute respiratory dis - tress syndrome (ARDS) in 3.4%. Most common CT findings were opacity patchy shadowing No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 2.9% of severe patients. Notable laboratory findings of patients included lymphocytopenia (83.2%), thrombocytopenia (36.2%), and leukopenia (33.7%). Clinical ImplicationsThe clinical characteristics and conventional routes of transmission of COVID-19 mim - ic those of SARS-CoV. Absence of fever occurs more frequently in COVID-19 (56% on presentaton, 11% after hospitalization) than in SARS-CoV-1 (1%) and MERS-CoV (2%). Using fever as a symptom for detection may not be reliable. Limitations Some cases demonstrated incomplete documentation of exposure history and lab - oratory testing. The incubation period could only be estimated for 26.5% of patients, allowing recall bias to play a significant role. The studied population inevitably rep - resents a more severe presentation of COVID-19, as asymptomatic individuals or those with mild symptoms would likely remain home, not requiring additional medical care. DIAGNOSISReview by Andy Wu, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubRelation between chest CT findings and clinical conditions of coro - navirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia: A multicenter study. Wei Zhao et al. American Journal of Roentgenology date published DOI: 10.2214/AJR.20.22976 Purpose To explore the relationship between chest CT findings and COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Retrospective study (n = 101) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Medical records were retrospectively collected for 101 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in four cities of Hunan province in China. Patients were divided in two groups: non-emergent vs emergent type infections. All patients underwent CT upon admission and the extent of respiratory involvement was evaluated using a CT scoring system. Chest CT scans were blindly and independently reviewed by two radiologists with 5 and 15 years of experience, respectively. Findings Out of 101 patients in the study, 87 (86.1%) were in the non-emergent group, 14 (13.9%) were in the emergency group. Eighty-seven patients had ground glass opacities (GGO) on CT, 65 had mixed GGO and consolidations, 72 had vascular enlargement in the lesion and 53 had traction bronchiectasis. Lesions on CT were more likely to have peripheral distribution (n=88), bilateral involvement (n=83), have lower lung predominance (n=55), and be multifocal (n=55). Patients in emer - gency group were older than those in non-emergent group but the difference in the rate of underlying disease was not significant. Clinical ImplicationsCT is considered routine imaging for care of COVID-19 patients. Combination of chest CT and PCR screening is necessary for early diagnosis. COVID-19 pres - ents with typical CT features can be helpful in screening suspected cases and evalu - ating extent of disease. Limitations The study was limited by the number of patients included (n=101). Other viral in - fections and negative results were not included in the analysis limiting comprehen - sive exploration compared to other lung infections. Follow up CT findings were not evaluated limiting insight on progression.DIAGNOSISReview by Ahmet Sakiri, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubComparison of throat swabs and sputum specimens for viral nucleic acid detection in 52 cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2)-infect - ed pneumonia (COVID-19). Chenyao Lin et al. Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine April 16, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0187 Purpose To compare the accuracy and efficiency of throat vs sputum samples in diagnosing COVID-19. Study design Case series (n = 54) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods This was a retrospective study on 52 patients at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China from February 7-16, 2020. Patients were diagnosed using WHO interim guidance. Simultaneously, both a throat swab and sputum specimen were taken and tested for COVID-19 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reactio (RT-PCR). Findings The majority of patients tested were middle aged and elderly males (average age 57.3 years and 27/52 were men). The percent of patients that tested positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR from a sputum sample was 76.9% (40 cases) vs. 44.2% (23 cas - es) from a throat swab. Authors reported that 51.9% of the patients had the same result on RT-PCR for throat and sputum samples, 40.4% showed positive sputum samples and negative throat swabs, and 7.7% showed negative sputum samples and positive throat swabs. Clinical ImplicationsProper collection of specimens is an important step in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Screening patients via sputum culture compared to throat swab via RT-PCR may increase the accuracy of diagnosing of COVID-19. Considering that sputum is more sensitive than throat swabs for 2019-nCoV detection, patients should not be excluded from having COVID-19 if they have a negative RT-PCR result via throat swab. Limitations This study was a sample size of only 52 patients from a single hospital, thus evalu - ation of larger group of patients needed. Additionally, sputum has a high viscosity, which can make it difficult to test and there is no standardized pre-treatment pro - cedure in order to test serum. Pre-treatment of sputum in this study used acetylcys - teine, which can cause loss of some of the RNA. Also, the study did not include data on nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which would be a useful comparison for diagnostic methods. Lastly, not all patients produce sputum with COVID-19, thus this could limit sputum RT-PCR testing.DIAGNOSISReview by Kelsey Danley, - tecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Wanbing Liu et al. Journal of Clinical Microbiology March 30, 2020 DOI: 10.1128/JCM.00461-20 Purpose To look for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies on two immunogenic portions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients, the nucleocapsid protein (rN) and the spike protein (rS). Study design Observational laboratory analysis Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Blood samples of 214 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (and 100 healthy con - trol samples) were run using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect both IgM and IgG antibodies against the rN and rS proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure. Patients were 0-55 days post onset (DPO) of disease, with median DPO of 15 days. Findings Of the 214 patients samples tested for presence of anti-rN IgM and IgG antibodies, 68.2% and 70.1% of patients displayed positive IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. For anti-rS antibody presence, 77.1% and 74.3% of patients displayed positive IgM and IgG anti - bodies, respectively. The presence of IgM and/or IgG was looked at for both rN and rS, and patients displayed one or both of the antibodies in 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. Regarding time course of serologic response, positive rates of both IgM and IgG for rN and rS assays were low at <10 DPO, although IgM increased at 6-10 DPO. IgM and/or IgG for patients at 16 DPO was 88.9% and 90.7% for rN and rS, respectively. None of the 100 healthy controls displayed positive IgM or IgG to either rN or rS. The detection of IgM was significantly higher using both kits (81.3%) vs. the rN kit alone (68.2%), but not using the rS kit alone (77.1%). For IgG, 80.4% were positive using both kits, significantly higher than the rN kit alone (70.1%) but not so for the rS kit alone (74.3%). When testing for presence of IgM and/or IgG, no significant difference was seen between both kits (86.9%) and either rN (80.4%) or rS (82.2%). Clinical ImplicationsThe rS-based IgM antibody test is more sensitive for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 due to the earlier immune response against the S protein. Antibodies increased in a time-dependent manner, with IgM decreasing at >35 DPO. Antibody tests should be considered as adjuvant testing to nasopharyngeal PCR swabs, especially in patients who are >10 DPO. Limitations The study could not follow up with discharged patients to see the extent of the antibody decrease >35 DPO. Moreover, additional immunogenic proteins could have been tested using ELISA to observe antibody production to various parts of the protein.

Journal of Medical Virology March 30, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25822 Purpose To outline clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Study design Meta-analysis Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Authors executed a detailed search on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], and China Biology Medicine disc [CBMdisc] using the keywords 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan Coronavirus, clinical features, 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, and imaging features. Inclusion criteria included cross-sectional studies, case studies, patients with confirmed NCP , and data on clinical characteristics, biochemical indicators, and imag - ing signs. Case reports were excluded. The quality of all included literature was as - sessed using the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) scale. After final review, 31 articles and 46,959 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Findings Mean age of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 46.4 years old and 55.6% were male. About 35.6% of patients had comorbidities, including 18.3% with hypertension, 11.2% with cardiovascular disease, 10.3% with diabetes, 3.9% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 3.0% with chronic hepatonephropathy. The main symptoms were fever (87.3%) and cough (58.1%). Other presentations included dyspnea (38.3%), myalgia or weakness (35.5%) and chest tightness (31.2%). Most patients with NCP re - quired hospitalizations, and 29.3% of those patients required intensive care. The main complications were respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure. In imaging results, 75.7% of patients had lesions involving both lungs, and 69.9% showed ground-glass shadows. A computerized tomography (CT) chest is highly sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 (97% in epidemic areas). Clinical ImplicationsThis study illustrates that COVID-19 causes bilateral pneumonia and lung function rapidly deteriorates. Chest CT imaging has proved to be very sensitive to COVID-19 and serves as an important supplement to nucleic acid detection . Limitations The study was limited to studies in England and China, but not from South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan where the pandemic is rapidly increasing and causing a catastrophic impact on the health of communities.DIAGNOSISReview by Emily He, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubUltrastructural evidence for direct renal infection with SARS-CoV-2. Evan Farkash et al. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology April 20, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2020040432 Purpose To evaluate direct renal infection by SARS-CoV-2 as a proposed mechanism of renal failure in COVID-19 patients. Study design Case report Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods An autopsy was performed on a single patient who died of COVID-19 following an open repair of an aortic dissection, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric renal failure. Renal tissues were examined with light and electron microsco - py to detect for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in renal cells. Findings Light microscopy analysis of tissue collected at autopsy from a patient with COVID-19 and acute renal failure showed focal tubular isometric vacuolization and mild to moderate necrosis and karyolysis. Ultrastructural analysis showed abun - dant viral forms, consistent in size and morphology with SARS-CoV-2, within tubu - lar epithelial cells that correlated directly to areas of isometric vacuolization. Viral structures were organized into small arrays and predominantly found in the cyto - plasm, indicative of intracellular manufacturing and assembly. Vacuoles contained double membrane vesicles suggestive of partially assembled virus. Viral detection, arrays, and assembly support direct infection of the kidney with SARS-CoV-2 as a proposed mechanism of renal failure. Clinical ImplicationsThis study supports direct infection of kidney as the mechanism of renal injury in COVID-19 patients . However, the cause of kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Limitations This case report only evaluates renal tissue from a single patient. Additional studies are needed to further support direct infection as a proposed mechanism of renal failure in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, evidence of direct renal infection does not preclude alternate mechanisms of kidney injury.DIAGNOSISReview by Hannah Raff, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubA preliminary study on the ultrasonic manifestations of peripul - monary lesions of non-critical novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Yi Huang et al. SSRN February 28, 2020 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3544750 Purpose To explore the ultrasonic manifestations of peripulmonary lesions of non-critical COVID-19 and provide reference for clinical diagnosis and efficacy evaluation. Study design Retrospective analysis Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The authors reviewed pulmonary ultrasonography studies performed on 20 non-crit - ical patients with COVID-19. Each patient had direct ties to Wuhan in January and February, 2020. Studies included conventional two-dimensional ultrasound and color Doppler flow imaging ultrasonography (CDFI). Each study was reviewed independent - ly by two physicians using the six-zone method of each lung, where the sum of all zone's scores represented the global lung ultrasound score. Findings COVID-19 foci are mainly observed in the posterior fields in both lungs, especially in the posterior lower fields. Fused B-lines and waterfall signs are visible under the pleura. The B lines, which are good indicators of alveolar interstitial syndrome, are fused and in fixed position. The pleural line is unsmooth, discontinuous, and interrupted. The subpleural lesions show patchy, strip, and nodule consolidation. Air bronchogram sign or air bronchiologram sign can be seen in the consolidation. The involved interstitial tissues have localized thickening and edema, and there is localized pleural effusion around the lesions. CDFI ultrasound shows insufficient blood supply in the lesions. High frequency linear array probe is suggested to be used for minor subpleural lesions, as it can provide rich information and improve diagnostic accuracy. Clinical ImplicationsChest CT is recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19 since lung abnormalities may develop before clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study offers a brief overview of expected ultrasonic pulmonary findings in COVID-19 patients to under - stand the pathophysiology of the disease. Ultrasound cannot replace CT scans, but is superior to CT in detecting small, peripulmonary lesions and effusions. It can also produce real-time images and show dynamic changes such as blood flow. Ad - ditionally, ultrasound is available point-of care, radiation-free, and is repeatable, and machines are easily disinfected. Ultrasound may be a preferable imaging modality for some patients. Limitations The study sample size is small. There are no control studies or interventions. The study did not follow patients over time nor re-scan with symptom resolution.DIAGNOSISReview by Nick Sytsma, MD Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubDiagnostic value and dynamic variance of serum antibody in coro - navirus disease 2019. Yujiao Jin et al. International Journal of Infectious Diseases April 3, 2020 DOI: 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.065 Purpose To evaluate diagnostic value of dynamic variance of serological testing in COVID-19. Study design Case control Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods A retrospective study comparing the IgM and IgG titers of COVID-19 nucleocapsid and spike protein from 43 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients to titers from 33 patients with suspected COVID-19 who tested negative from January 2020 to March 4 2020 at Xi Hospital of Hangzhou, China. A positive COVID-19 diagnosis was deter - mined using RT-PCR on patient sputum or oral swab samples. IgM and IgG titers were measured on patient serum samples using chemi\u00acluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) analysis and presented in arbitrary units/mL (AU/mL). Findings Sensitivity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies was 48.1% and 88.9%, respectively. Specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies was 100% and 90.9%, respective - ly. No control patients were positive for IgM antibodies and only 3/33 (9.1%) control patients were positive for IgG antibodies, however, their titers were low (less than 15 AU/mL). Of the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 group, 27 were tested for viral antibodies before becoming virus negative. In this group, 13/27 (48.1%) had IgM antibodies and 24/27 (88.9%) had IgG antibodies. The IgM positive predictive value was 100% (13/13) while the IgM negative predictive value was 70.2% (33/47). The IgG positive predictive value was 88.9% (24/27) while the IgG negative predictive value was 90.9% (30/33). Over the span of 32 days after RT-PCR confirmation, patients with COVID-19 had IgM titers that initially increased then declined, while IgG titers increased and then became stable. Only IgG had a significantly different median titer after patients converted to vi - rus-negative with double the titer compared to when the patients were virus-positive. Clinical ImplicationsThis study suggests that serological testing may be helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Limitations Due to the small sample size used in this study, the reliability of the results should be questioned. Additionally, since serological testing kits were not readily available at the start of the study, the time between the onset of symp\u00actoms to serological testing was varied. Furthermore, this study does not attempt to correlate the serology results with severity of disease.

Journal of Medical Virology April 24, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25932 Purpose To assess the diagnostic performance of a novel fully automated chemiluminescence immu - noassay (CLIA) for quantitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. Study design Case-control selection cross-sectional study (n=105) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods 61 COVID-19 positive patients (59 \u00b1 23 years; 35 women, 26 men) hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) and 44 patients with rheumatic diseases (n=31) and infectious diseases (n=13) serving as a pre-COVID-19 (2018-2019) control group were tested for IgM and IgG anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies via the iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer. All COVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by performing RT-PCR using oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs (confirmed by two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests). Based on manufac - turer recommendations, samples found to have IgM and IgG concentrations 10 AU/mL were considered positive (reactive). Findings At the manufacturer's recommended threshold of 10 AU/mL, sensitivity for IgM antibodies was 73.3% and specificity was 92.2%, IgG antibody sensitivity was 76.7% and specificity was 100%. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) performance curves showed Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.918 and 0.980 for antiSARSCoV2 antibodies IgM and IgG, respective - ly. Among the COVID19 patients 64.1% (41/64) demonstrated both IgM and IgG positive test results, while 4.7% (3/64) had only IgM positive results and 7.8% (5/64) had only IgG positive results. The average concentration of IgM antibodies in COVID-19 positive sera was 69.8 AU/ mL versus 48.9 AU/mL for IgG antibodies. Clinical ImplicationsEarly and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 plays a critical role in slowing it's spread. When serol - ogy testing is used for diagnostic purposes, detection of the patient's immune response (e.g., IgG, IgM, IgA, and total antibody counts) is the point if interest. This study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients produce both IgM and IgG antibodies, with few patients producing only IgG or IgM antibodies. This is one of the first studies on anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibod - ies by CLIA method on an Italian population. Limitations The results of this single-center cohort study are limited by the varying lengths of time be - tween the onset of symptoms in COVID-19 positive patients and the development of positive serum samples. In addition, patients in the early stages of the disease were not enrolled in this study and as such, the efficacy of this method as an early diagnostic tool is unclear. Due to the nature of the assay using antigens from different components of SARS-CoV-2, different levels of cross-reactivity with other coronavirus antibodies are possible; however, authors did not examine such cross-reactivity.DIAGNOSISReview by Emily He, MS3 Table of ill with COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective randomized controlled trial Cai-Neng Wu et al. British Journal of Anaesthesia March 19, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.02.020 Purpose Examine efficacy and safety of fiberoptic bronchoscopic intubation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial (n= 60) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods 60 patients participated the study and randomly split into HFNO and SMO groups, each including 30 patients. Two patients from the HFNO ultimately dropped out of the study. Six anesthesiologists performed 10 consecutive intu - bations, five from each group. Patients were positioned supine with their heads up and were pre-oxygenated for a total of four minutes via HFNO or SMO prior to rapid sequence fiberoptic intubation. During intubation attempts, HFNO was maintained whereas no oxygen was administered to the SMO group. Findings Intubation time was significantly shorter in the HFNO versus SMO group . HFNO group had both greater minimum SpO2% and lower occurrence of rescue face-mask ventilation during intubation as compared to the SMO group. There were no significant differences in 7-day mortality, incidence of SpO2<80%, or percentage of minimum SpO2 >95% during intubation . Clinical ImplicationsThere was shorter intubation time and lower incidence of desaturation during intubations leading to rescue face-mask ventilation in patients who received preoxygenation with HFNO. The results of this study suggest a possible avenue for anesthesiologists to consider during intubation of COVID-19 patients to limit potential exposure to the virus. Limitations Six anesthesiologists participated in the study; however, it was not reported in the manuscript whether outcomes were similar between the six anesthesiolo - gists or not. Smaller final sample size in HFNO vs SMO groups is also a concern. Authors did not mention breathing treatments or medications, such as steroids, prior to intubation, which could potentially impact ease of intubation and/or PaO2 percentage.CRITICAL CAREReview ClubCOVID-19 Infection: Implications for Perioperative and Critical Care Physicians John R. Greenland et al. Anesthesiology March 27, 2020 DOI: 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003303 Purpose To summarize the currently available evidence to guide management of critically ill pa - tients with COVID-19. Study design Systematic review Level of evidence4 Methods Literature review of 108 journals. Findings Critically ill patients tend to have high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, increasing transmission risk to healthcare providers. Studies conducted in Hubei Province, China showed 5-25% of COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the ICU, and of those in the ICU, 60- 70% progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although high-flow nasal cannula does not significantly decrease intubation rates, it has been shown to lower 90-day mortality in ARDS. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in H1N1 and MERS had failure rates 50-90%. After intubation, management of COVID-19 is similar to management of ARDS. Guidelines recommend low tidal volume ventilation (4-8 ml/ kg body weight) to maintain plateau pressures <30 cm H2O, with permissive hypercap - nia. Guidelines also recommend prone positioning >12 hr/day in severe ARDS if there are sufficient personnel to ensure lines and endotracheal tube are not displaced. High positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is cautiously recommended to increase lung recruitment, but some studies have shown increased mortality with high vs low PEEP . Clinical ImplicationsWhile use of angiotensin-converting of ACE-2 receptors, major cardiology societies do not currently recommend altering therapy for patients on these medications. Impaired secretion clearance is thought to predispose respiratory failure, highlighting the impor - tance of consistent bronchial hygiene in COVID-19 patients. Use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with close monitoring should only be used as an initial management strategy for mild COVID-19-associated ARDS, or if chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or heart failure is contributing to respiratory distress, as it had high failure rates in the prior H1N1 and MERS epidemics. Limitations The conclusions by the authors are drawn from review of clinical studies but need sub - stantiation from further research. Due to limited data, many of the management guide - lines illustrated in this paper are based off studies on MERS, SARS, and H1N1. Future research is also needed to address route of infection, and whether there are observed differences in clinical presentation based on transmission.CRITICAL CAREReview by Beth Hall, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubIntubation and Ventilation Amid the COVID-19 Outbreak: Wuhan's Experience Meng Lingzhong et al. Anesthesiology March 26, 2020 DOI: 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003296 Purpose To detail best practices regarding intubation and ventilation of critically ill COVID-19 pa - tients. Study design Review article Level of evidence4 Methods This is a summary of four webinars discussing preparedness, airway management, lung-pro - tective ventilation, goal of oxygenation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Information was based on firsthand experience from physicians treating critically ill patients in Wuhan. Findings This articles estimates percentage of patients requiring intubation at 3.2%. -Intubation Recs : Any patients with cardiopulmonary arrest or jeopardized airway should be intubated. Any patient in respiratory distress (respiratory rate (RR) >30/min) or with hy - poxemia (SpO2 < 93% on air (RA); PaO2:FiO2 < 300 mmHg) is only intubated IF 1) the condition has progressively gotten worse or is expected to get worse AND 2) 2hr high-flow oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation is not expected to be effective. -Intubation Procedure Recs : Infection Control: Two single-use filters placed in the inha - lation and exhalation breathing circuits. Preoxygenation: If patient on high-flow oxygen, consider bag valve mask or tightly fitting facemask. If patient on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), continue for preoxygenation. Modified Rapid Sequence Induction: Goal is intubation within 60 secs of muscle relaxants to shorten the period of potentially ineffective ventilation, from losing consciousness to endotracheal tube (ETT) placement. Muscle relax - ants are administered directly after loss of consciousness to facilitate speed. - Ventilation Recs : In the absence of formal vent settings recs, the authors recommend acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilation guidelines emphasizing 1) Tidal vol - ume (TV) less than 6 ml/kg predicted body weight; 2) RR less than 35 breaths/min; 3) pla - teau airway pressure less than 30 cm H2O; 4) positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) greater than 5 cm H2O. Clinical ImplicationsAnesthesia providers play a key role in the treatment of infected patients; critically ill pa - tients with COVID-19 should be intubated and ventilated per the above recommendations. Limitations The authors are simply reporting what has (and has not) worked during their clinical expe - rience treating COVID patients. There are no interventions, controls, or outcomes reported. The authors admit clinicians may reasonably dissent with their guidelines.CRITICAL CAREReview by Nick Sytsma, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPractical considerations for performing regional anesthesia: lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic Sui An Lie et al.

Transition from paper-based consent documentation to mo - bile electronic devices protected with single-use covers . In preparation of the OR, minimize personnel present, and utilize single-use materials when possible. Fit OR equipment with single-use plastic covers. Reduce drugs and materials kept in drug trolleys wherever possible. -Intra-operatively, sedation should be used with caution. Use nasal canula under the patient's surgical mask if needed . -In the presence of respiratory disease, use alternatives to brachial plexus block such as interscalene, suprascapular, or infraclavicular blocks to minimize the risk of diaphragmatic paralysis. -In the event of complications, anesthesiologists should be prepared to convert to GA or summon help for resuscitation. -Post-operatively, the patient should recover in the same OR to prevent con - tamination of other clinical areas . OR equipment should be left for decontamina - tion prior to use with another patient. Clinical ImplicationsHaving a well thought out plan for RA to manage infected patients may help to ensure the safety of both the patient and peri-operative team. Limitations This review lacks data to support its conclusions. Nuances of planning for surgeries using RA during infectious disease pandemics are largely left to individual institu - tion.CRITICAL CAREReview by John Sweeney, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubFindings of lung ultrasonography of novel corona virus pneumonia during the 2019-2020 epidemic Qian-Yi Peng et al.

Study design Case Series Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The authors performed lung ultrasonography on 20 patients with COVID-10 using a 12-zone method and aggregated typical pathological findings. Findings -Some providers have recommended early CT for screening suspected patients, but lung ultrasound may not be practical for critically ill patients; additionally, lung ultra - sound has significant advantages in that there is ease of use at point of care, repeat - ability, absence of radiation exposure, and low cost. -Characteristic findings in 20 confirmed COVID-19 pts include 1) thickening of the pleural line with pleural line irregularity; 2) B-lines in a variety of patterns including focal, multi-focal, and confluent; 3) consolidations in a variety of patterns including multifocal small, non-translobar, and translobar with occasional mobile air broncho - grams; 4) appearance of A-lines during recovery phase; and 5) pleural effusions are uncommon. - Focal B-lines are the main feature in the early stage and in mild infection; alveolar interstitial syndrome is the main feature in the progressive stage and in critically ill patients; A-lines can be found in the convalescence. - Predominant pattern is of varying degrees of interstitial syndrome and alveolar con - solidation, correlated with the severity of the lung injury. Clinical ImplicationsThis study offers a brief overview of expected lung ultrasound findings in COVID-19 patients. Lung ultrasound is helpful for diagnosing pneumonia/ARDS at presen - tation, tracking the evolution of disease, monitor lung recruitment maneuvers, managing ECMO and/or prone positioning, and making decisions related to weaning ventilator support. Limitations The study only includes scans from twenty patients. No demographic information included; authors assume the ultrasound findings are universal. These ultrasound findings are consistent with many different lung processes/types of pneumonia; therefore can likely help diagnose pneumonia but not specifically COVID pneumonia.CRITICAL CAREReview by Nick Sytsma, MDCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubDevelopment and Validation of a Clinical Risk Score to Predict the Occurrence of Critical Illness in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 Wenhua Liang et al. Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine May 12, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2033 Purpose To develop and validate a clinical score assigned at hospital admission to assist in prediction of which patients with COVID-19 will develop critical illness. Study design Retrospective cohort (developmental cohort n=1590; validation cohort n=710) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Researchers established a cohort of COVID-19 positive patients from 575 hospitals across 31 Chinese provinces. Patients were considered critical upon ICU admission, intubation, or death. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables ascertained at hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to identify predictive factors of critical illness. Independent predictive factors were then combined to form a risk score calculator (COVID-GRAM). The scoring system's accuracy was measured by the area under curve (AUC) method. The scoring system was subsequently validated using four additional Chinese cohorts. Findings The development cohort included 1590 patients. Mean age was 48.9 years and 57.3% of pa - tients were male. The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean age of 48.2 years. 53.8% of patients were male. From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (odds Mean in the development cohort was 0.88 and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88. The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public at http://118.126.104.170/ . Clinical ImplicationsThe authors have created an easily accessible, highly accurate scoring system (COVID-GRAM) for predicting a COVID-19 patient's risk of developing critical illness, therefore allowing staff to better prioritize patient care and optimize the use of resources. Early returns indicate this scoring system (using ten significant variables and factors including chest X-ray abnormality, age, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and the number of comorbidities) is more accurate than the CURB- 6 system commonly used by emergency physicians. Limitations The populations used in both the developmental and validation cohorts were not enormous. All data originates from China, which may impact its generalizability to patients in other coun - tries as it has been well documented that countries have varying incidences of comorbidities.CRITICAL CAREReview by Nick Sytsma, MD Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubInitial Clinical Impressions of the Critical Care of COVID-19 Patients in Seattle, New York City, and Chicago Phillip Sommer et al.

Study design Observational/Expert Opinion Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods This study was observational, with no reported interventions or population data. The study mentions aggregating more than 300 clinical cases, 100 of which required intubation, from America's hardest hit cities: Seattle, New York City, and Chicago. Findings Patients present diverse and nonspecific initial symptoms of fever, malaise, fatigue, and cough in addition to chest pain, headache, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal changes. Younger patients were not exempt from severe presentation. Lab findings were notable for rarely elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts with lymphopenia being a common prognostic sign. Procalcitonin levels were typically somewhat low. C-reactive protein (CRP) was frequently elevated with a positive correlation to severity of illness. Troponin and liver biomarkers were also sometimes elevated. Coagulation abnormalities, including D-dimer elevations, were frequently observed. Bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities on chest x-ray were almost always present and severity was usually congruent with disease severity. Hypotension was com - mon and treated with low-dose vasopressors. Concurrent myocardial infarction (MI) was also described. Severe cardiomyopathy presenting as respiratory symptoms was observed and appeared to dramatically increase mortality. Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and refractory metabolic acidosis cases were not uncommon along with electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia. Hypoxemia presented out of proportion to clinical presentation, frequently re - quiring noninvasive oxygenation which was associated with a high rate of intubation and low rate of successful extubation. Severe respiratory failure was reported to occur ~ 1 week after initial symptoms. Treatment of COVID-19 in the critical care setting was largely supportive. An - tiviral therapies, hydroxychloroquine, and aminoquinolines have generated research interest, but there is no consensus on their use or the utility of administering steroids. Clinical ImplicationsAs rapidly-expanding COVID-19 infections continue to consume the US health care system's finite resources, this study, which summarizes the COVID-19 landscape in three US metropol - itan areas, is useful for urban providers to preserve and augment their dwindling clinical and operational resources. It is also potentially useful for providers who have not encountered a COVID-19 surge to date, as it helps to establish clinical expectations. Limitations This article is limited by a lack of objective data, lack of interventions, and urban patient pop - ulations and therefore, the findings may not be generalized to a wide array of clinical settings.CRITICAL CAREReview by Nick Sytsma, MD Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the Treatment of Severe Pulmonary and Cardiac Compromise in Coronavirus Disease 2019: Experience with 32 Patients Jeffrey P .

Study design Cohort Study (n=32) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Authors used a multi-institutional database to collect and analyze data at 9 different hospitals from 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were supported by ECMO therapy between March 17 and April 9, 2020. Collected metrics included pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge. Findings Of the 32 patients placed on ECMO, 5 (15.625%) survived and have been taken off ECMO, 10 (31.25%) died while on ECMO, and 17 (53.125%) were alive and still on ECMO upon comple - tion of the study. Only 1 of the 5 patients taken off ECMO had been discharged at the con - clusion of the study. All 5 patients who survived were on venous-venous ECMO, and patients requiring veno-arterial support appear to have a poorer prognosis. Of the 32 total patients on ECMO, 6 were given antiviral drugs (Remdesivir), 5 were given intravenous steroids, 6 were giv - en anti-interleuken-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 was given Hydroxychloroquine. 3/6 of the patients given antivirals survived and were successfully weaned off ECMO. 4/5 of those patients given intravenous steroids survived and were successfully weaned of ECMO. The patient given Hydroxychloroquine survived and was suc - cessfully weaned off ECMO. 2/6 of those patients given anti-interleuken-6 receptor monoclo - nal antibodies survived and were successfully weaned of ECMO. None of the 5 patients who survived and were taken off ECMO had a previous history of heart disease, and surviving patients were younger on average than the patients who died on ECMO. Clinical ImplicationsThere seems to be some effectiveness in using ECMO therapy along with other supportive care measures for some severely ill COVID-19 patients who may experience acute pulmonary and cardiac compromise. Intravenous steroid therapy showed positive results for survival and successful removal of ECMO. Limitations This study is limited by a short time span and a small sample size. In addition, over half of the sample was still on ECMO at the time of study conclusion, so many final outcomes are unac - counted for. More collaborative research on ECMO outcomes is needed, including follow ups on patient outcomes from this study.CRITICAL CAREReview by Reilly Frauchiger-Ankers, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubNeurological manifestations of COVID-19: a systematic review Gaurav Nepal et al. Critical Care July 13, 2020 DOI: 10.1186/s13054-020-03121-z Purpose To evaluate various neurological manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients and hypothe - size their underlying pathophysiology. Study design Systematic review (n = 37 studies included) Level of evidenceLevel 1 Methods The authors performed a systemic review of all studies, published in any language, which reported neurological manifestations in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. They reviewed pre-prints and published studies from PubMed, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Research square, medRxiv, SSRN, and ChinaXiv. After yielding 106 articles from their literature search, 37 articles met inclusion criteria. This included 12 retrospective studies, 2 prospective studies, and 23 case reports/series. Findings The most common neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection were peri- and post-infectious hyposmia and hypogeusia , which were found in 59.45% and 56.48% of patients, respectively. This was hypothesized to result from direct viral-mediated damage to the olfactory nerve and/or apparatus. Also, inflammatory-mediated cerebral edema was a well-documented complication, which commonly presented as headache, confusion, deliri - um, loss of consciousness, seizure, and coma. In other cases, SARS-CoV-2 induced a cytokine storm syndrome, which created a hypercoagulable state leading to the presentation of an ischemic stroke. Additionally, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was hypothesized to reduce the expression and function of ACE2 proteins, leading to decreased ability to lower blood pressure and subsequent cerebral hemorrhage in some cases. Lastly, acute transverse myelitis, Guil - lain-barr\u00e9 syndrome, and Bell's palsy were also seen in some cases and was thought to be due to molecular mimicry between microbial and nerve antigens. Clinical ImplicationsThis systemic review sheds light on the spectrum of neurological conditions that can arise in patients with COVID-19. In many of the included studies, the patient's neurological symptoms preceded their respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Having an awareness of the possible neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection may allow health care workers to detect impending infections earlier, resulting in earlier interventions and improved outcomes. Limitations Most of the studies included were case reports/series and retrospective observational studies. Also, this systematic review only included studies released prior to May 20, 2020, which could contribute to premature analysis of data trends that may not be up to date with the current literature.EPIDEMIOLOGYReview by Alejandro Javier Paulino, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush DEVELOPMENTTable of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-RBD Structure and Receptor Bind - ing Comparison and Potential Implications on Neutralizing Anti - body Vaccine Development Chunyun Sun et al. bioRxiv February 20, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.951723 Purpose To investigate whether SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) possess cross-re - activity to SARS-CoV-2. Study design Observational study Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Sequence, macro, and microstructures were evaluated with computer analysis soft - wares. Binding kinetics, antibody cross-reactivity, and neutralization efficiency were measured by ELISA. SARS-CoV nAbs were generated by immunizing rodents with protein; two - ies and four monoclonal antibodies were analyzed for cross reactivity using ELISA. Non-Ace2-blocking antibodies were also screened for cross-reactivity using ELISA. Findings Within the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, significant differences were found in the receptor binding motifs (RBMs). SARS-CoV nAbs demonstrated little cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein, indicating a low probability of identifying efficacious cross-reactive nABs to SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV antibodies or antibody libraries. However, three ACE2-non-blocking monoclonal antibodies were found to cross-bind the SARS- CoV-2 S1 protein and cross neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at high concen - trations. Based on the two viruses' RBD structural similarities, targets for cross-reac - tive and neutralizing antibodies may be found. Clinical ImplicationsThere is a potential trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum of therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses. This paper underscores the challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants or SARs-CoV, should it re-emerge. Limitations Types of antibodies obtained in this study were limited. Future research needs to explore mechanism of neutralization for non-blocking RBD antibodies.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by John Sweeney, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPotential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review Junxiong Pang et al. Journal of Clinical Medicine February 26, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9030623 Purpose To provide guidance to policymakers on the most effective distribution of resourc - es for research and development surrounding (2019-nCoV). Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 1 Methods Authors compiled the findings of 27 human studies examining the diagnostics, vac - cines, and therapeutic drugs for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Findings Nucleic acid based tests are useful for diagnosing active 2019-nCoV (a.k.a. SARS- CoV-2) infection and serological testing may be effective for determining the ex - tent of infection, including asymptomatic infection and attack rate in populations. Potential vaccines and antiviral treatment modalities for SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented based on data from trials for other corona viruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Clinical ImplicationsNucleic acid testing is useful for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection At the time of publishing of this study, there was only one vaccine that has received emergen - cy approval, and is currently being used in clinical and surveillance centers in China. Other vaccine candidates will take roughly one year to start phase 1 clinical trials. Given the absence of a vaccine and a long interval before one is available, clinicians should consult literature for optimizing treatment protocols with pre-existing or available medications. Limitations Inferences of vaccine effect on 2019-nCoV are largely based on the behavior of SARS and MERS. Most of the studies on vaccines for SARS and MERS were exclud - ed by reviewers for being performed in cell or animal models, so only four studies were ultimately included. No vaccine studies in any population type were available for 2019-nCoV specifically. In addition, no completed trials on 2019-nCoV therapeu - tics had been completed at the time of the review.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Leah Greenfield, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubThe COVID-19 vaccine development landscape Tung Thanh Le et al. Nature Reviews, Drug Discovery April 8, 2020 DOI: 10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5 Purpose To contribute to the global efforts for the development of vaccines against COVID-19 by providing an overview of current vaccine development activity. Study design Narrative Review Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Since February of 2020, reviewers have continually monitored and reported on the COVID-19 vaccine development landscape using sources such as the World Health Organization, clinical trial databases, publicly available literature, press releases, and information from product developers. Findings There are currently 115 vaccine candidates for COVID-19 globally, 78 of which were confirmed to be in active development. Of these, 73 vaccines are in ex - ploratory stages and the remaining five are in clinical development . In clini - cal development, there are two vaccines using a non-replicating viral vector, one using recombinant protein, one using RNA, and one using DNA. In addition, at least 10 projects are investigating the use of adjuvants, which would make lower doses possible and allow more people to get vaccinated without compromising efficacy. Clinical ImplicationsThe high number of vaccine technology platforms being tested to fight COVID-19 offer hope for a safe, effective, and quickly available vaccine. In addi - tion, it is possible that multiple platforms will be successful, which would allow different patient populations to receive different vaccines depending on their age and medical conditions. Limitations Many of the technology platforms being used for development are not currently used in any licensed vaccines, raising questions about safety and efficacy in an already accelerated development landscape. In addition, these platforms may not be able to use existing production equipment to manufacture vaccines on the massive scale that may be necessary.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Leah Greenfield, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubAn effective CTL peptide vaccine for Ebola Zaire based on survivors' CD8+ targeting of a particular nucleocapsid protein epitope with potential implications for COVID-19 vaccine design CV Herst et al. BioRxIV/Vaccine March 9, 2020 Develop a CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) producing a T-cell response against EBOV (Zaire ebolavirus); determine if CTL expansion can be driven by NP43-53, an EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) peptide shown to provide pro - tective CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in previous mouse studies; and see if this peptide is protective in an in-vivo EBOV murine challenge model. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for SARS-CoV-2. Study design Basic science/translational mouse study Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods An established microsphere-based, synthetic vaccine platform was used to im - munize C57BL/6 mice with NP43-53 or 9mer sub-sequences of NP43-53. Spleno - cytes were harvested 14 days after immunization and analyzed for IFN- release after simulation with peptide used in vaccination. Mice were then vaccinated with NP44-52 (a subsequence of NP43-53) or a control and challenged 14 days later with mouse-adapted EBOV. Findings For the splenocyte restimulation experiments, there was no significant difference in IFN- production between NP43-53 vaccinated mice and con - trol-treated mice . NP44-52-vaccination induced greater IFN- release than NP43-54 and was used for subsequent experiments . In the in vivo EBOV chal - lenge model, control-treated mice showed increasing mortality compared to vaccinated mice, which survived and showed no morbidity. Low levels of IL-6, MCP-1, IL-9, and GM-CSF and increased IFN- were found in surviving mice. Clinical ImplicationsAs a single dose of the peptide vaccine protected mice from EBOV morbidity and mortality, a CTL-mediated peptide vaccine may be feasible and efficacious for SARS-CoV-2. Limitations This is a murine study, so there is a limitation to how these findings can be ap - plied to humans. For example, the NP43-53 peptide is a mouse peptide, and a human HLA-restricted peptide would need to be determined for an effective vaccine.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Emily Beltran, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal an emerging coronavirus infection: advances and pros - pects in designing and developing vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and therapeutics. Kuldeep Dhama et al. Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics March 18, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1735227 Purpose Highlight the ongoing advances in designing vaccines to counter COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), and focus on earlier efforts to develop a vaccine to fight hu - man coronavirus (CoV) infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Study design Review article Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods This paper served as a brief review to highlight ongoing advances in COVID-19 vaccine development and compare them with prior efforts made in history. Findings Most COVID-19 vaccine strategies target the surface-exposed spike (S) glyco - protein as the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. The possibility of de - veloping a universal COVID-19 vaccine was assessed based on the similarity in T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 shares genetic similarity with SARS-CoV, making it possible that vaccines developed for SARS-CoV can exhibit cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 . Direct administra - tion of monoclonal antibodies can help play a role in COVID-19 control. Stud - ies have shown that patients recovering from SARS display potent neutraliz - ing antibody responses. Studies have also shown that passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies induces substantial protection in mice subjected to lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Clinical ImplicationsThis study describes various designs of COVID-19 vaccine development: the S glycoprotein (recognizing the human ACE2 cellular receptor), the similarity in T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the direct administration of monoclonal antibodies. Limitations This study was limited by its lack of including suitable animal models for ana - lyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Ahmad Gill, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubImmune responses in COVID-19 and potential vaccines: Lessons learned from SARS and MERS epidemic Eakachai Prompetchara et al. Asian Pacific Journal of Allergy and Immunology March 2020 DOI: 10.12932/AP-200220-0772 Purpose Utilize historical data from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to compare past with the present SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Aim to understand viral pathogenesis, host im - mune responses, and evasion strategies in order to inform therapeutic vaccine strategies moving forward. Study design Review article Level of evidenceN/A Methods SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 were compared using viral comparisons using demographic data, characteristics, and immunopathogenesis as a foun - dation to inform discussion of various vaccine platforms. Delivery mechinisms range from DNA, viral vector, subunit, virus-like particles, inactivated and live-at - tenuated SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% genomic similarity with SARS-CoV and 50% with MER - SCoV. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV also share the same entry receptor of ACE2, expressed on type 2 alveolar cells. Nucleic acid-based vaccines showed prom - ise in Phase I and II of trials for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (SARS-CoV-2 was not presented in this review); similar vaccines were trialed in less than one year after the Zika outbreak, depicting a hopeful timeline to therapeu - tic intervention. This platform yields advantages of rapid production, simple design, and induction of both B and T cell responses. Yet this delivery modality has disadvantages of efficient delivery system requirement and lower immune response induction compared to live vaccines. Clinical ImplicationsThis paper highlights the robust and rapid response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine de - velopment globally and suggests the pivotal role of international collaboration, preclinical studies performed in parallel with clinical trials to expediate therapu - tic timeline.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Morgan Sturgis, MS2 of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubMultiple-epitope vaccine design using an immunoinformatics ap - proach for 2019 novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) Y e Feng et al. bioRxiv March 3, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332 Purpose Identify surface-exposed peptides of SARS-CoV-2 to design multiple-epitope vaccines. Study design Basic Science Study Level of evidenceN/A Methods Based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 retrieved from the NCBI database, candidate B-cell epitopes were analyzed from an online tool in the Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource. Prediction of linear B-cell epitopes and surface accessible epitopes were performed through Bepipred soft - ware and Emini tool. Prediction of T-cell epitope binding affinity to specific HLA alleles were performed through netMHCpan and prediction software iNeo-Pred. Based on B-cell and T-cell epitopes, vaccine peptides were optimized for high epi - tope count and HLA score, then designed by an in-house tool iNeo-Design. In addi - tion, an online server swiss-model was used to the predict the 3D protein structures and HLA molecules. Findings Based on 19 B-cell epitopes and 121 adjacent T-cell epitopes, 17 candidate vaccine peptides that contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes were generat - ed. 499 core T-cell epitopes were analyzed to generate 13 T-cell epitopes-only vaccine peptides. All in all, a total of 30 peptide vaccine candidates were designed to potentially cause an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. 26 of them were from the spike protein, 2 were from the membrane pro - tein, and 2 were from the envelope protein. 5 peptides were located in the receptor binding domain region, suggesting that they were likely to induce production of neutralizing antibody. Clinical ImplicationsThis study recommends multiple vaccine peptides involving B-cell and T-cell epitopes to use as potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Limitations The study was limited in that these multiple-epitope vaccine designs require in vitro and in vivo trials to determine effectiveness of these vaccine pep - tides. In addition, this study is a preliminary report that has not been peer-re - viewed.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Audrey Sung, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSelf-amplifying RNA SARS-CoV-2 lipid nanoparticle vaccine induces equivalent preclinical antibody titers and viral neutralization to re - covered COVID-19 patients Paul McKay et al. bioRxiv preprint April 25, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.055608 Purpose To observe the IgG response to a self-amplifying RNA SARS-CoV-2 lipid nanoparticle vac - cine generated in a murine model compared to antibody titers from recovered COVID-19 patients. Study design Randomized controlled animal trial Level of evidenceN/A Methods Mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The treatment group was immu - nized with self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) protein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) in doses ranging from 0.01 g to 10 g. The positive control group received electroporated plasmid DNA, and the negative control group received saRNA encoding the rabies glycoprotein. Each group received two vaccines, one month apart. Serum samples from each group and from recovered SARS-CoV-2 human patients were collected. These samples were analyzed to measure SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG anti - body levels and ability to neutralize a pseudotyped virus. Findings High quantities of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 were found in the mouse treatment group in a dose-responsive manner. Viral neutralization was significantly more effective in the treatment group than in the positive control group. At all vaccine doses, the treatment group demonstrated significantly higher quantities of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and sig - nificantly more viral neutralization than serum derived from natural infection in humans. A positive correlation between antibody levels and levels of viral neutralization was observed in both humans and mice. Clinical ImplicationsA vaccine using saRNA encapsulated in LNP has the potential to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This vaccine formulation was effective at stimulating a robust cytokine response in mice, suggesting that the LNP enhances the immu - nogenicity of the saRNA. In addition, the cellular immune response favored Th1 cells, which increases the likelihood that the results are translatable to humans. RNA ther - apeutics formulated with LNP are already in clinical use and require lower doses than messenger RNA drugs, easing some concerns about clinical safety. Limitations This was a mouse model and the results may not be generalizable to humans. The sam - ple size was small, with n=7 or 8 for each group, and mice within the treatment group did not all receive the same vaccine dose. This study still has to undergo peer review.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Leah Greenfield, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubIn silico Design of novel Multi-epitope recombinant Coronavirus surface bioRxiv preprint April https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.985499 Purpose To perform an in silico design a vaccine for Coronavirus based on surface glycoproteins. Study design In Silico Level of evidenceN/A Methods A multi-epitope vaccine based on surface glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. NCBI resources were used to gather relevant protein sequences and to determine sequence alignment. Antigenicity of the coronavirus surface glycoprotein was evaluated using Vax - iJen 2.0 server. B-cell epitopes were predicted using ElliPro and IEDB analysis resource. T-cell epitope prediction was performed using ProPred-1 server. 17 potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico. Then, the epitopes were joined via different linkers. The ability of selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was then evalu - ated using IFNepitope web server. Findings A final vaccine was constructed, which composed of 398 amino acids and at - tached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12. Physicochemical properties and anti - genicity in the proposed vaccine demonstrated that the vaccine was stable. Molecular docking studies confirmed that the vaccine interacted with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules as expected. Interferon-gamma analysis showed that 16/17 epitopes had the potential to produce interferon-gamma. Clinical ImplicationsThis study introduced a novel multi epitope vaccine design against Coronavi - rus. The multi-epitope vaccine with 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant was a stable construct with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity. Limitations This was an in silico study; the proposed virus must still be followed by in vi - tro and in vivo studies before proceeding. Also, this study still has to undergo peer review.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Ahmad Gill, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPotent neutralizing antibodies in the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients are directed against conserved linear epitopes on the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein Chek al. bioRxiv March 31, 2020 DOI: B-cell epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 virus spike glycoprotein for vaccine development. Study design Basic Science Investigational Study Level of evidenceN/A Methods Convalescent serum samples were collected from 25 patients in Singapore during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein tagged with luciferase reporter was used to assess neutralizing ac - tivity of sera. Antigenic targets of sera were determined using liner B-cell peptide library for entire S protein of either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and peptide-based ELISA and antibody depletion assays. Sera from recovered SARS patients and healthy patients were used as comparisons and control groups, respectively. Findings - Six of the 25 sera samples demonstrated good neutralizing capability with IC50 scores ranging between 694-836 (one outlier; IC50 = 1603). patient sera strongly detected peptide pools S14 and S21. The individual peptides detect - ed within these pools were S14P5 and S21P2. Importantly, both peptides are localized in proximity to functionally important regions of the S protein: peptide S14P5 is localized in proximity to the RBD and S21P2 contains part of the fusion peptide sequence. Antibody-depletion assays demonstrated reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection when antibodies against the aforementioned peptides were depleted in the sera. Sera from COVID-19 patients demonstrated detection against SARS-CoV pool S51 which overlaps with SARS- CoV-2 pool S21, raising the potential of a pan-coronavirus epitope. Clinical ImplicationsThis study identifies two immunodominant B cell linear epitopes (S14P5 and S21P2) that are recognized by neutralizing antibodies and may serve as immuno - genic targets for vaccine. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size, with only six patient samples demonstrating good neutralization capacity. Further development is necessary to create a vaccine based on this work. Also, this study still has to undergo peer re - view.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Yereida Gallardo, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal arrives, can the world make enough? Roxanne Khamsi Nature April 9, 2020 DOI: 10.1038/d41586-020-01063-8 Purpose Biomedical companies around the world are working on formulating a SARS-CoV-2 vac - cine. Most research to date has compared the numerous platforms available and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Optimistic timelines project a vaccine will be available within the next 12 to 18 months. This article seeks to address the question that follows: once a vaccine is formulated, how is the world to go about its production and equitable distribution? Study design News, review article Level of evidence5 Methods Quantitative and narrative data collection from reputable sources including: World Health Organization (WHO), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), US Pharma - copeia (USP), and several others. Findings How vaccine distribution looks will depend heavily on the delivery mechanism, which range from inactivated form to subunit to RNA/DNA based, with each formu - lation bearing its own challenges and rewards. Regardless of the platform chosen, CEPI describes a gap that needs to be unpacked: a fair allocation system. In response to pan - demics of the past, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework to coordinate the supply-demand of vaccines, diagnostics, and drugs but due to its specificity for influenza, PIP does not apply to SARS-CoV-2. The article advocates for a rapid response mimicking this framework yet addresses time to devise as a limiting factor in addition to the retroactive obtainment of samples posing a logistical threat to its success. Clinical ImplicationsThis article allows for greater understanding of the vast limitations of vaccine develop - ment beyond delivery type; touching on production costs, resource scarcity, politics, and upholding the justice pillar of medical ethics. It calls on global governments and private funders to be proactive in their response to this knowledge; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) estimates minimum $3 billion USD are needed to devel - op, trial, and manufacture, and distribute a vaccine for the world (not including estimated billions needed to fuel manufacturing plants). Limitations The inevitable limitation in our current stage of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development lies in the careful balance of efficiency and efficacy. This article seeks to predict future chal - lenges in this realm based on past patterns and present predicaments.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Morgan Sturgis, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubComputers and viral diseases. Preliminary bioinformatics studies on the design of a synthetic vaccine and a preventative peptidomimetic antag - onist against the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV, COVID-19) coronavirus Barry Robson Computers in Biology and Medicine February 26, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103670 Purpose To find a short section or sections of SARS-CoV-2 viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. Study design Bioinformatics Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods The use of Q-UEL (an involved automatic surfing of the world wide web to speed access to information) systems to access relevant emerging literature, and to interact with standard publicly available bioinformatics tools on the internet. Additionally, the use of MARPLE/HDNstudent with XTRACTOR allows for specific search queries that bypass \"autosurfing\" of the internet. Findings The sequence of amino acids KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well con - served across many coronaviruses (including 2019-nCoV) and corresponds to the re - gion around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. Many conventions in diagnostic and vaccine design are not significant in coronavirus matches, however an exposed loop in the SARS coro - navirus is an important target for creating antibodies and a carrier protein is necessary to promote immunogenicity. The addition of C-terminal and N-terminal linkage se - quences resulted in the proposed L-amino sequence of GPSKRSFIEDLLFNKVTLAC as a B-epitope to be synthesized and attached to a carrier. Clinical ImplicationsKRSFIEDLLFNKV protein subsequence is seen as a potential Achilles' heel because it is exposed or potentially exposable, being required for proteolytic activation cleavage, and is also a well conserved feature on the virus. This motif seems a likely primary tar - get for synthetic vaccines and a basis for drug discovery. Limitations One must be aware of coincidental matches that are not truly significant unless one can see that the proteins being compared are essentially of the same function or fam - ily, with the order of similar sections preserved, and that the correspondences make sense. This was an in silico study; the proposed sequence must still be followed by in vitro and in vivo studies before proceeding.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Johanna Balas, MS1 & Vazquez Parker Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubInsights into Cross-species Evolution of Novel Human Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Immune Determinants for preprint 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.925867 Purpose To analyze the genomic evolution of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) and identify T-cell epitopes (TCEs) for subunit vaccine development. Study design Basic Science Investigational Study Level of evidenceN/A Methods Genome sequences of 2019-nCoV (n=48) were obtained on January 29th, 2020 from GSAID and GenBank, along with genomic sequences MERS-CoV strains (n=8,2,10, respectively). One alphacoronavirus sequence was used as an outgroup con - trol. To identify potential target peptides for vaccine design, TCEs were predicted using struc - tural protein sequences of conserved and strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947.3).. Findings Phylogenic analysis showed 2019-nCoV to be genetically and evolutionary related to bat CoVs. A large clade was formed by these viruses with both 2019-nCoV and bat-CoV virus clusters sharing a common ancestor (92% bootstrap support). Additionally, there was a 96% sequence similarity between the 2019-nCoV Wuhan-Hu-1 and bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 strains. 2019- nCoV and bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 sequences differed in the structural proteins spike (S) and membrane (M), but envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) were highly conserved. The binding af - finity for all possible 15-mer peptides from the 2019-nCoV structural proteins against the pre - dominant HLA-DR alleles in the ethnic populations of China, Thailand, Japan, and Asia-Pacific Region were assessed. There were eight common epitopes recognized by all HLA-DR alleles across the ethnic populations distributed among S, E, and M proteins (n=2, 3,3, respectively). Clinical ImplicationsThis study suggests the current 2019-nCoV likely evolved from bat CoVs through a series of recombinant events that enabled it to adapt to humans. Additionally, 8 epitopes recog - nized by HLA alleles common to different ethnic populations were identified; creating a sub - unit vaccine containing these eight epitopes may induce effective antiviral T-cell and antibody responses in different ethnic populations. Limitations This study only identified high-binding affinity TCEs against HLA-DR alleles predominant in Asia and Asia Pacific Region. As the 2019-nCoV is now classified as a pandemic and has spread to various countries globally, this decision may limit the generality of the predicted epitopes. Additionally, further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate the predicted epitopes and whether they can produce a robust immune response. Lastly, this study has not been peer-reviewed.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Yereida Gallardo, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal Identification of Potential Vaccine Targets for COVID-19 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Based on SARS-CoV Immunological Stud - ies Ahmed et al. Viruses March 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/v12030254 Purpose To identify identical epitopes between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV (responsible for the 2003 endem - ic), and MERS-CoV (responsible for the 2012 outbreaks) to find potential targets for an effective vaccine. Study design Laboratory Study Level of evidenceN/A Methods The investigators obtained reference protein sequences for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS- CoV, along with SARS-CoV B- and T-cell epitopes. They estimated a population coverage for the T cell epitopes to represent the population likely to elicit an immune response for at least 1 T-cell epitope. Lastly, the investigators constructed a phylogenetic tree of the structural protein of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, as well as the Zaria Bat coronavirus strain. Findings The M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid), and E (envelope) proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS- CoV-2 have over 90% genetic similarity while the S (spike) protein has 76% similarity. The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV is substantially lower. From previous studies, S and N proteins are known to induce immune responses. 27/115 T-cell epitopes are identical between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (all in N or S proteins). MHC binding assays suggested 5 dis - tinct MHC alleles for 19 of these epitopes. The population coverage for these epitopes is 59.76% globally and 32.36% in the Chinese population. To identify potential T cell targets that would cover a larger percentage of the population, additional T cell epitopes were considered that have not yet been experimentally tested for SARS-CoV. Of these, 229 epitope sequences had an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 with MHC allele information available and 102 of these were S or N proteins. Population coverage estimates for these sequences showed 96.29% with 20 distinct MHC alleles. 49 B-cell epitopes from SARS-CoV had an identical match in SARSCoV-2 (45 from N or S protein). Clinical ImplicationsThe study demonstrates similarities and differences between the novel coronavirus of 2020 and past coronavirus outbreaks. The study also determines important structural aspects of the SARS- CoV-2 epitope that may be used to develop an immune response. We may be able to extrapo - late the data from previous immune responses to try to find ways to create a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Limitations Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is still significant genetic variation between the two and it is not obvious that immune responses will be elicited against both viruses. Additionally, as the virus continues to evolve, it is expected that more mutations will be observed, and as long as they occur outside of the epitope regions identified, they may not affect this analysis. Further T and B cell assays are important to identify the potential of the epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Pranita Kaginele, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubStrategies for vaccine design for corona virus using Immunoinfor - matics techniques Anamika Basu et al. bioRxiv preprint March 2, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422 Purpose To evaluate potential B cell and T cell epitopes present in non-structural protein 4 of beta coronavirus as a strategy for vaccine design against corona - virus. Study design Genome sequencing and analysis Level of evidenceN/A Methods Based on the non-structural protein NS4 in Beta coronavirus HKU24 obtained from the InterPro database (accession number A0A0A7UXD8), potential B and T cell epitopes were predicted using various methods, such as the Ka - laskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale, Stabilized matrix method, and a consensus approach which combines NN-align, SMM-align, and combinato - rial library methods. Then, population coverage was assessed, and molecular docking studies were performed for identified T cell epitopes. Findings -The peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG were considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respective - ly. These epitopes may be considered as potential peptides for a pep - tide-based vaccine for coronavirus. -The predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule. The epitope PTDTYTSVY was present in 58.87% of the Chi - nese population and 50.16% of the world population. Clinical ImplicationsThis study recommends potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes to use in a pep - tide-based vaccine for coronavirus. Limitations The study was limited in that this study requires in vitro and in vivo trials to determine effectiveness of these vaccine peptides. In addition, this study is a preliminary report that has not been peer-reviewed.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Audrey Sung, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEpitope-based peptide vaccine design and target site characterization against novel coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 Lin Li et al. bioRxiv preprint February 27, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.965434 Purpose To identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 as possible targets for vaccine development by using immunoinformatics approach. Study design De novo bioinformatics analysis Level of evidenceN/A Methods The SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence and all 3D structures were found in the National Cen - ter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and Protein Data Bank (PDB). Several programs were used to analyze the protein chemical and physical properties (e.g., half-life, molecular weight, etc.), including and and Analysis-Resource (IEDB), BcePred, and VaxiJen v2.0. There focus on antigenicity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity, and turns. Protein allergenicity, toxicity, and enzyme digestion was evaluated using Allergen FP 1.0, ToxinPred, and a protein digest server. Protein-epitope interactions were evaluated using PepSite. Global conservation of the S protein structure utilized the NGDC database's 138 SARS-CoV-2 virus strains from 38 worldwide locations. Findings - After evaluation, four B-cell epitopes are predicted to be non-allergenic and non-tox - ic, and identified as potential targets for vaccine research . None of them can be di - gested by multiple enzymes. - Two MHC-I and nine MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes are predicted to have high anti - genicity and to interact with various HLA alleles. - All identified epitopes were found in all the global SARS-CoV-2 samples. None of the identified epitopes are susceptible to digestion by multiple enzymes, which suggests that these epitopes would be stable. Clinical ImplicationsThis study provides a basis for the development of peptide-based vaccines against the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic . A vaccine would increase prognosis, lower infection rate, and subsequently lower strain on healthcare systems and workers globally. Limitations The study was limited to computational analysis and a de novo analysis; the epitopes identified require further in vitro and in vivo studies to demonstrate efficacy. SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a high potential for mutation so information gathered here might be obso - lete within the next year. This study has not been peer-reviewed.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Sharice Hall, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush SARS-CoV-2: Lessons from other Coronavirus Strains Eriko Padron-Regalado Infectious Diseases and Therapy April 23, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40121-020-00300-x Purpose To review the pertinent information about COVID-19 to help create a vaccine Study design Review Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Review the past and ongoing vaccine development efforts for clinically rele - vant coronavirus strains in order to help develop safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19. Findings - No vaccine is currently available for SARS-CoV-2. - While we want to develop safe and efficient vaccines, we should worry about adverse drug events as animal models and vaccination regimens have demonstrated the possibility of this occurring. - We need to address the possibility of short-term immunogenicity, which would happen if the virus induces production of neutralizing antibodies. - Exploiting T cell responses for coronavirus vaccination should also be con - sidered (along with B cell responses) as they are persistent and protective in animal models. - Employing the N protein of coronavirus for vaccination has the potential of providing long-term cross-protection. Clinical ImplicationsAs of April 2020, no vaccine is commercially available for coronavirus. Moving forward, we can study the MERS and SARS vaccine development pro - cesses to learn more about SARS-CoV-2. While creating a vaccine is of utmost importance, we must also realize the potential side effects of vaccines and should not be oblivious to this. The N protein of coronavirus has the po - tential for providing long term cross-protection. Limitations Coronavirus is highly infectious, which limits the progress of creating a vac - cine. Furthermore, it is difficult to find adequate animals or individuals to start vaccine trials.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Ahmad Gill, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPotent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody Xiaolong Tian et al. Emerging Microbes & Infections February 17, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069 Purpose To experimentally determine the cross-reactivity of several anti SARS-CoV antibod - ies with 2019-nCoV spike protein. Study design Basic Science Investigational Research Level of evidenceN/A Methods 2019-nCoV receptor binding domain (RBD) protein was expressed and purified. Its conforma - tion with its human receptor, angiotensin converting (ACE2), was predicted. Biolayer interferometry binding (BLI) assay was utilized to determine the binding affinity of SARS-CoV spike protein and 2019-nCoV RBD to human ACE2. Lastly, ELISA (utilizing high binding assay plates coated with purified 2019-nCoV RBD) and BLI (utilizing streptavidin-coated biosen - sors) assays were employed to measure the binding affinities of a series of representative SARS-CoV-specific antibodies reported to target RBD and Anti-CD40 anti - body was used as a negative control. Findings 2019-nCoV RBD bound potently to human ACE2 as determined by BLI, with an affini - ty comparable to that of SARS-CoV spike protein with human ACE2 (15.2 and 15.0 nM, respectively). Of the antibodies tested, only SARS-CoV specific antibody CR3022 was found to bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD. No competition in binding for 2019-nCoV RBD was found between CR3022 and ACE2 as determined by BLI. This suggests CR3022 recognizes an epitope that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site of 2019-nCoV. Protein sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD demonstrates they differ at the C-terminus residues. Clinical ImplicationsThis study points to CR3022 as a potential therapeutic for the treatment and prevention of 2019-nCoV. The lack of cross-reactivity from the other RBD targeting SARS-CoV-specific anti - bodies may have resulted as a consequence of the structural differences between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD. This study raises the possibility that a vaccine developed from epitopes outside the ACE2 binding site may be a more promising in inducing cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies . Limitations The study was limited by the small number of antibodies utilized and none of the tested antibodies showed cross-reactivity with the ACE2 binding site of 2019-nCoV, which is essential for the virus replication. Also, virus neutralization tests were not performed. More work will be needed for the development of novel monoclonal antibodies, which specifically binds to 2019-nCoV SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques Jingyou Yu et al. Science May 20, 2020 DOI: 10.1126/science.abc6284 Purpose To evaluate pre-clinical DNA vaccine candidates for the prevention of COVID-19 using a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study design Animal Trial Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Twenty-five adult rhesus macaques received one of six prototype DNA vaccines expressing variants of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and 10 macaques received a sham control. The animals each received two doses, one at week 0 and one at week 3. At week 5, S-specific binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were measured. At week 6, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2. The 6 vaccine variants were (1) full-length spike protein (S), (2) deletion of the cytoplasmic tail (S.dCT), (3) deletion of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail reflecting the soluble ectodomain (S.dTM), (4) S1 domain with a foldon tri - tag (S1), (5) receptor-binding domain with a foldon trimerization tag (RBD), and (6) a prefusion stabilized ectodomain deletion of the furin cleavage Findings Before challenge with SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated macaques exhibited NAb levels comparable to those of humans and macaques who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. S-specific and RBD-specific antibodies in vaccinated macaques functioned neutrophil phagocytosis, complement deposition, monocyte cellular phagocytosis, and NK cell activation. Vaccinat - ed animals had markedly lower levels of subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) as compared to sham controls in all groups except for S.dTM. Less immunogenic vaccines, such as S.dTM, showed partial protection in the lower respiratory tract but no protection in the upper respi - ratory tract, suggesting that it may be easier to protect against lower respiratory tract disease compared with upper respiratory tract disease. Clinical ImplicationsNAb, S-specific and RBD-specific titers at week 5 inversely correlated with peak sgmRNA levels, suggesting that high levels of all three antibodies are protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. NAb titers correlated with all antibody effector functions except for antibody-mediated NK cell activation, suggesting a primary role of NAbs in protecting against SARS-CoV2 infection.The S vaccine was found to be the most effective in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and protection in both anatomic compartments is likely necessary for pandemic control. Limitations This study does not address the expected length of protection from any of the six vaccines. It also does not address the issue of antibody-dependent enhancement of respiratory disease, which could be a significant safety concern. As an animal study, the results may not be gener - alizable to humans.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview et al. bioRxiv May 13, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093195 Purpose To determine the immunogenicity of an adenovirus-vectored vaccine against the spike pro - tein of SARS-CoV-2 in mice and rhesus macaques. Study design Animal Trial Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Thirteen mice were vaccinated with either an experimental adenovirus-vectored vaccine against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) or an trol expressing fluorescent protein (ChAdOx1 GFP). The following markers of humoral and cellular immunity were measured 9-14 days later: IgG titers against neutralizing antibodies, IFN- ELISpot responses the spike protein, and spike-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was then injected into 6 rhesus macaques, while the ChAdOx1 GFP control was injected into 3. The same immune markers measured in the mice were measured in the macaques. In addition, the macaques were challenged with the SARS-CoV-2 virus 28 days post vaccination. After challenge, clinical symptoms and respiratory signs were moni - tored, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue samples were measured for viral genomic RNA (gRNA) and viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). Findings A single ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination in mice and rhesus macaques produced robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Prior to challenge with SARS-CoV-2, vacci - nated animals had significantly higher levels of all measured immune markers as compared to controls. The immune response was predominately Th1 dominated. After challenge with SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated macaques had significantly reduced viral load in BAL fluid and respiratory tract tissue as compared to controls. None of the vaccinated macaques devel - oped pneumonia. Clinical ImplicationsThe significant immune responses measured in vaccinated animals, along with the marked - ly healthier clinical and histological presentation of vaccinated and challenged macaques suggest that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is effective at inducing protection against SARS- CoV-2. Importantly, there was no evidence of immune-enhanced disease in vaccinated ani - mals. Taken together, the findings suggest that an adenovirus-vectored vaccine against SARS- CoV-2 may be safe and effective in humans. Limitations Samples sizes were very small, with only 13 mice and 9 macaques included. All macaques were euthanized 7 days post-inoculation, so this study cannot provide insight into long-term side effects. As an animal study, the results may not be applicable to humans.VACCINE DEVELOPMENTReview by Leah Greenfield, MS1 Table of Contents "}
