While there's no scientific evidence to support this, many traditions value the third eye chakra. Have you ever wished you had a sixth sense? Some say to look no farther than between your eyes. The [chakras](/health/fitness-exercise/7-chakras) are believed to be wheel-like energy centers distributed throughout your body that affect well-being and perception. The third eye chakra, also known as Ajna, is considered to be the sixth chakra in the body. This chakra is said to be located in the center of your head, parallel to the middle of your eyebrows. It's believed to be linked to perception, awareness, and spiritual communication. Let's dive deeper into what the third eye is, what it can do, and how to open it. The third eye chakra is believed to be related to: - clarity - concentration - imagination - intuition - spiritual perception - universal connection This chakra is believed to be linked to the pineal gland, according to [Candice Covington](https://divinearchetypes.org/), author of \"Essential Oils in Spiritual Practice: Working with the Chakras, Divine Archetypes, and the Elements.\" \"The pineal gland is a pea-sized gland shaped like a pine cone, located in the vertebrate brain near the hypothalamus and pituitary gland,\" says Covington. \"It's a revered tool of seers and mystics and is considered to be the organ of supreme universal connection.\" Covington notes that the [pineal gland](/health/pineal-gland-function) plays a significant role in most cultures throughout the world. \"For example, in Ayurvedic philosophy, the third eye is represented by the Ajna chakra,\" she says. \"In Ancient Egypt, the symbol of the Eye of Horus mirrors the placement of the pineal gland in the profile of the human head.\" According to Covington, the pineal gland is the biological relative of the energetic third eye chakra. This tiny gland at the base of the skull produces [melatonin](/nutrition/melatonin-and-sleep), which affects [circadian rhythms](/health/healthy-sleep/circadian-rhythm) and reproductive hormones. Studies show a link between the [pineal gland](/health/pineal-gland-dmt) and N, N-dimethyltriptamine, also known as [DMT](/health/what-is-dmt), according to a [2019 research review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6709953/) This chemical is sometimes called \"the spirit molecule\" or \"the seat of the soul\" because of its supposed relationship to consciousness. Still, the link between the pineal gland and spiritual experience hasn't been scientifically proven. While there isn't scientific evidence to prove it, Covington believes that the third eye is a window to the spiritual world. \"Developing the third eye is the doorway to all things psychic,\" she says. \"The illusion of separation between self and spirit dissolves when the third eye connection is cultivated.\" What's more, Covington says you can run into problems if your third eye chakra is blocked. This can include: - confusion - uncertainty - cynicism - lack of purpose - pessimism \"While the physical eyes perceive the physical world, the third eye sees the true world \u2014 a unified whole with an unyielding connection to spirit,\" says Covington. She says the benefits of opening your third eye can include: - mental clarity - improved concentration - clear self-expression - strengthened intuition - a sense of bliss - decisiveness - insight While more research is needed about how the third eye can affect us spiritually and emotionally, a [ 2016 study](http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol27_no2/dnb_vol27_no2_153.pdf) suggests that smaller pineal gland volume may be linked to mood disorders like schizophrenia. Some people have hypothesized a link between the chakras and mental health, but this isn't accepted by mainstream science. The role of the third eye has also been discussed in parapsychology, or the study of unexplainable mental phenomena. Some believe that, when open, the third eye acts as a doorway for spiritual communication. This is said to include: - telepathy - clairvoyance - lucid dreaming - astral projection - aura perception Some traditions emphasize the need to open and harmonize all your other chakras prior to opening the third eye. This is said to establish the grounding and capacity necessary to handle the insights of higher consciousness. Otherwise, some believe that opening the third eye could be destabilizing. If you feel ready to open your third eye chakra, Covington suggests the following methods: - Activate your third eye. - Supplement your diet. - Apply essential oils. - Try sun gazing. - Practice meditation and chanting. - Use crystals. Activate your third eye chakra According to Covington, when you open your third eye, it's best to start with an activation practice. \"Start by sending gratitude to your third eye for your innate intuitive abilities and your connection to nature through the circadian rhythms that the pineal gland governs,\" she says. Supplement your diet Covington believes diet can play a key role in opening your third eye chakra. She advises that several foods may support and detoxify the third eye, including: - raw cacao - goji berries - garlic - lemon - watermelon - star anise - honey - coconut oil - hemp seeds - cilantro - ginseng - vitamin D3 \"These are all ingredients that aid purification of the pineal gland,\" Covington claims. It's important to note that there's no scientific evidence to support this. Apply essential oils While research suggests there are health benefits, the FDA doesn't monitor or regulate the purity or quality of essential oils. It's important to talk with a healthcare professional before you begin using essential oils and be sure to research the [quality](https://greatist.com/health/best-essential-oils-how-to-buy-essential-oils) of a brand's products. Always do a [patch test](https://greatist.com/health/patch-test) before trying a new essential oil. \"Essential oils are dynamic tools for healing and opening the pineal gland, and they facilitate states of spiritual awareness,\" says Covington. She recommends: Follow these steps to make an essential oil blend for your third eye chakra: - Gather one or several of the oils above, as well as a [carrier oil](/health/carrier-oil)of your choice. Because essential oils come in very strong concentrations for use in aromatherapy, always combine them with a carrier oil rather than using them directly on your skin. (And never ingest essential oils!) - Mix the essential oils with the carrier oil. For every 6 drops of essential oil, use 1 teaspoon of the carrier oil. - Apply the mixture directly to your third eye chakra. Chanting \"Om\" as you apply the oil can enhance the effect, Covington says. Some essential oils, especially citrus oils like lemon, can cause [photosensitivity]. Avoid sun exposure after applying citrus essential oils to your skin. Try sun gazing Sun gazing is a form of meditation that involves gazing at the sun, typically at sunrise and sunset. It's said to improve spiritual connection, increase clarity, and boost energy. Covington believes it can also help to open the third eye. \"The sun is a great source of power,\" she says. \"Gaze gently at the sun during the first few minutes of sunrise and last few minutes of sunset to boost your pineal gland.\" If you choose to sun gaze, be sure to follow [proper safety precautions](/health/mind-body/sun-gazing#safety). Otherwise, it's possible to damage your eyes. Meditate and chant \" [Meditation](/health/mental-health/types-of-meditation) activates visualizing the [decalcification of the pineal gland](/health/decalcify-pineal-gland), as its sacred nature is illuminated and directly connected to source.\" By \"source,\" Covington is referring to a higher power or the essential nature of all things. You may also like to add chanting to your meditation. \"Chanting causes the tetrahedron bone in the nose to resonate, which causes stimulation of the pineal gland,\" Covington claims. She says [chanting mantras](/health/mantra-meditation) can help to cultivate a feeling of appreciation and gratitude. Use crystals Crystals are believed by some to have healing energies. Covington believes they can also be beneficial when it comes to opening your third eye. \"Crystals are influential allies in the quest to awaken the third eye,\" she says. \"Use crystals and gemstones in the purple, indigo, and violet color palette. This color palette serves to awaken, balance, align, and nurture the third eye.\" Covington recommends the following crystals for third eye activation: [amethyst](/health/amethyst-healing-properties) - purple sapphire - purple violet tourmaline - rhodonite - sodalite You can place the crystal or gemstone between and slightly above your brow during meditation, or use a [crystal grid](/health/meditate-with-crystals#meditation-methods). There's no specific rule when it comes to how long it'll take to open your third eye. Some people believe it can take a few days, a week, a month, or much longer. Others say it can take years or even a lifetime of practice. In Covington's opinion, opening your third eye is a practice you should devote time to daily. \"Try spending 10 minutes each day consciously activating your third eye through meditation, chanting, prayer, dance, yoga, essential oil, and flower essence use,\" she says. However, it's important not to rush or try to force anything. Focus on enjoying the practice and doing what feels right for you, rather than trying to keep to any sort of time line. Covington says the answer is simple. \"Once you begin working with your third eye, you'll begin to receive guidance messages and visions,\" she says. \"Strive to have the courage to follow through on what your intuition offers and your third eye strength will only grow.\" The third eye chakra is sometimes referred to as our sixth sense and is believed by some to be linked to the pineal gland. However, there's no scientific evidence that proves the existence of the third eye. It's thought that an open third eye can lead to an increase in perceptive, intuitive, and spiritual abilities. Practices like meditation, sun gazing, and crystal healing are believed by some to help unblock the third eye, but there isn't research to support these claims.
