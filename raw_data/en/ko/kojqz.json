This paper deals with the use of biophotonics to give a probable explanation about the modus operandi of homeopathic medicines. Starting with the understanding that all living organisms are 'energy bodies', the author has discussed latest research findings in the field of biophotonics, kirlian technology, memory of water, bioluminicence and piezoelectric phenomenon to give a new understanding about energy medicine and transfer of 'therapeutic' information through homeopathic remedies and other forms of energy medicine. 1. The Vital Force - between archaic intuition and scientific reason The complementary / alternative medicine is empirically known to give very positive results. But there is still no coherent theory which offers a unitary explanation regarding the mechanisms which make these results possible. In spite of all the incontestable progress of scientific knowledge, we still find ourselves in situations, which make us describe the results of alternative medicine as \"magical\" or \"paranormal\", \"para-physical\" or \"para-psychical\" and so on. Most of the successes in complementary (non-allopathic) therapies, among which homeopathy is the most important, fall in this category. Homeopathic practice regards the integrative and holistic nature of the human being. For homeopathy, the physical body as well as the spirit (mind, intellect) and the soul (emotion, affection) are equally responsible for the ups and downs of one's health. An intuitive human attitude, whose roots are lost in illo tempore (ed-latin for 'indeterminate past') and which deals with the preservation of the unity / equilibrium of body and soul and spirit, in order to maintain one's health, is just starting to be adequately understood. The existence of this relationship is now well acknowledged, but the real problem lies in accounting for and validating it within the analytical instruments of scientific discourse. As Ioan Teleianu noticed, referring to the specific processes in homeopathic treatment: \"The intimate mechanism which, unfortunately, is not able to satisfy our whole need to understand any biological mechanism remains inexplicable\" [1993: 13]. Similarly, Anton Jayasuriya states: \"There is no material explanation up to this moment of the way in which these homeopathic remedies work which is accepted by everyone, although there are many medical proofs that homeopathic remedies have really cured patients. Yet, the empirical descriptions don't have scientific validity. The Vital Force phenomenon, the central thesis concerned with explaining health and illness, is a metaphysical explanation that doesn't fit with controlled trials in simulated experiences\" [1997: 34]. Fortunately, after two centuries of \"tacit\" (without scientific explanation) functioning from its official birth, we can today connect the very old intuition of homeopathic medicine and the very recent scientific contributions of biophotonics in order to put together \"physics\" (natural sciences) and \"metaphysics\" (humanistic sciences, philosophy and religion especially), for understanding our archetypal roots [Stanciulescu, 2003b]. These two connections now permit a rational explanation of our own states of consciousness and of our harmonious states of health: physical (biological), emotional (psychical) and intellectual (logical). *** A new integrative \"science of light\", of the invisible reality defined by the \"energetic-informational (EI) fields\" hierarchy - having BIOPHOTONICS (a very new science connecting biology and theory / technology of lasers) as a first level [1] - will assume the dignity of opening the human being towards the understanding of his / her own becoming. 2. Our \"being of light\": Interdisciplinary connections to homeopathy Our religions have always indicated that 'we' are primarily a form of energy, a part of the 'divine light'. But a human being is not only metaphorically speaking a \"being of light\" (pure Intellect and Energy). We could justify this statement with a complex of correlated arguments. We would begin with the intuitive practices of \"magic medicine\" (including, first, the old homeopathic practices) and continue to the scientific contributions of (bio)physics and (bio)chemistry, botany and zoology. We would then add to these the contributions of various medical sciences and of biotechnology (biophotonics), as well as to the fields of human sciences, such as philosophy, psychology, semiotics, etc to understand our existence as energy bodies. In the context of the present study, we will mention some of the most relevant arguments arising from these fields, to justify the idea that the \"Vital Force\", the \"field of life\", or the \"life principle\", postulated by homeopathy has an objective existence, as a bio(psycho) field resonating inside and also outside the human body. Each of the practical or theoretical arguments that we take into consideration could be suggestively connected to a certain aspect of homeopathic practices [2]. 2.1. The intuitive / practical models of the human being's energetic-informational (EI) structure have been proposed from illo tempore('indeterminate past'), namely: Magical thinking - considered that everything in this world is implicitly connected by the resonance of a very special (universal) \"soul\". The Kirlian or electro(no)graphic technology, using electrical procedures for amplifying the living body's emission of light and for impressing photosensitive paper, could prove the certitude that we are \"full of light\", that \"light-traps\" of energy and information are present everywhere in living bodies (cells, tissues, organs, organism). It is enough to see the electronographies of a drop of water, of a leaf or of a human finger (figure 1 a, b, c) [cf. Guja, 1993: fig. 22, 11, 20], to understand that the archaic intuition was amazingly true. In its different states, the \"complex light\" [3] is present everywhere in the world, unifying every form / thing of the (living) world by a \"holographic resonance\". It is exactly this \"soul\" and this \"resonance\" that are activated by a high potency homeopathic remedy, that permits a potency to keep the memory (information / field) of a certain substantial substratum (minerals, plants, animal products) and to transmit it to a human being through the correlated homeopathic remedy. |a)||b)| |c)||d)| |e)||f)| Figure 1: of (bio)light of a: a) graphite plaque; b) drop of water; c) leaf; d) dragon fly; e) human skin; f) human hand. Mythical and esoteric thinking proposed many names for the \"cosmic energy\" - the Polynesian \"mana\", the Indian \"prana\" and Chinese \"qi\", the Egyptian \"chu\" \"Universal Field\" etc. [4]. In all cases, it was considered the infinite reservoir of human energetic life resources - in terms of a wonderful modern hermeneutics. For example: The \"Universal Field\" gives rise to the fundamental force and matter fields, which then generate the DNA molecule - the material expression of the Unified Field, which creates and governs the flow of biological intelligence in all the various levels of physiological organization\" [Nader, 1995: 2]. From the biophotonics already postulated that such a \"universal energy\" could represent the synergy of the universal bioluminescent / bioplasmatic field emitted by the \"living substance\" present everywhere in the world [Stanciulescu, 2003b: 111]. Consequently, this energy is both: Determined by the human complex activity (physical, psychical and mental) and floating through different \"nets\" (micro-biostructures) [Macovschi, 1969] - such as nadis / meridians, nervous system - inside the human organism. Penetrating inside the human body, by using different natural or stimulated procedures, beginning with sleeping and finishing with spiritual procedures (meditation, praying, etc.) or with technical ones (acupuncture, for example). Homeopathic remedies could contribute to optimizing the interference relationship between the \"universal field\" and the \"individual field\", between \"Brahman\" and \"Atman\". For example, the good therapeutic results, obtained by connecting a homeopathic high potency / remedy and an acupuncture intervention proves - among other effects - that a certain resonance can be holographically established between the two types of radiation. The \"point\" (homeopathic remedy) and the \"universe\" (the energetic potential of the living world) are connected due to their resonance just as the \"individual soul\" is connected to the \"universal soul\" of the world. Religious conception of the human body, soul, and spiritual unity could be assumed - in biophotonic terms - as a relationship between the levels of the \"light fields\" generated by our biological / physiological activity (figure 2a) [Oldfield, Coghill, 1997: 223], by our emotional states (figure 2b) and by our mental involvement (figure 2c) [Guja, 1993: fig. 35b, 1a, d]. Such a used by homeopathic therapy [Vithoulkas, 1999: 65-66], acting at the complementary levels of the human being predominantly by: substantial (biochemical), energetic (electric and magnetic), and informational (photonic) effects. Figure 2: The bio-psycho-logical human bioluminescence (a) the auric field of a human healthy and ill cell; (b) elderly individual with Alzheimer's disease (dementia): higher density and intensity of streamers, specific to the old age, together with right / left asymmetry and extended inversions; (c) electronographic image of the pineal-pituitary complex (the \"third eye\"), responsible for the super-sensorial activity of the brain. It is exactly this complementarity of the effects that biophotonics involves. At the same time, we could appreciate that, by administering a \"unique remedy\", the homeopath acts firstly - by the resonance of this remedy's waves - at the level of a \"fundamental wave\" (defined by the harmony of the whole human personality, as an integrative complex: body, soul, spirit). Secondly, if necessary, some other \"harmonic\" remedies will be available for optimizing some particular malfunctions of the physical and psychical activity respectively. Unconventional (complementary) therapeutic practices, beginning with \"magic medicine\"activating different types of \"symbolical therapies\" (such as incantation, prayer, etc.) and finishing with modern bioenergetic practices (such as reiki, radiant technique, etc.) and homeopathy, have also described (by the clear-vision of certain super-sensorial persons), the presence of the seven \"bodies of light\"belonging to the human being (figure 3a) [cf. Brennan, 1993: 53]. Such intuitions can now be objectively interpreted by a high computational technology as well (figure 3b). Figure 3. The human body aura: a) the \"auric ovoid\" and its seven levels: an intuitive representation; b) the auric emission of a human subject taken with a normal camera and belonging to a person in a very excited intellectual state; a computational analysis of the \"human aura\" photograph above presented, clearly suggested the presence of the seven energy-information (EI) levels and their strong determination by a spiritual (mental / logical) activity [5]. We may consider the presence of different levels of energy-information of the human body as intuitive evidence that, when adjusted to a specific level of frequency belonging to the human aura, to organs or chakras, to tissues or to cells, etc., each type of potency will have its properly differentiated effects, for its resonant level. These specific remedies (corresponding to the different \"harmonic waves\" of the body, soul, spirit, states of health / illness) must be in specific resonance with the fundamental frequency of the unique remedy which homeopathic practices prescribe. 2.2. From a scientific (experimental and theoretical) perspective: Classical research by A.G. Gurvich, and by Denis Gabor, G. Protti, A.J. Ferguson and Otto Rahn, Harold Burr, Colli, Facchini and Rossi, T.I. Quickenden, has proved the presence of a \"mito-genetic low radiation\". This is an \"ultra-weak luminescence\"(bio-field) generated at the level of all living cells, a bioluminescence included in the spectrum of visible and ultraviolet radiation able to generate a specific order of cells' structure (figure 4) [cf. Lipkind, 1992: 475]. The specific \"DPM\" (Dynamic Preformed Morph), a \"vital pattern\" responsible for the human body morphogenesis respectively. Explained in the terms of biophotonics, to make active this \"morphogenetic pattern\" implies the effect of an invisible bio-field manifested in the UV spectrum of the electromagnetic scale, due to the quantum anti-Stokes rule and to the modulation in frequency generated by the optical activity of the cellular (liquid crystal) membranes [6]. Figure 4. According to biophotonics, the very well organized structure of the cellular tissue is determined by the coherent pattern of a bioluminescent (UV) field: a) the polarization of the cellular axes determined by DPM; b) the influence of DPM upon the distribution of a cellular stratum: phases A and B. Recent research by W. Sedlak and W. Nagl, R. Dobrin a.o., and by Fritz-Albert Popp and his collaborators, has demonstrated the constant presence of a cellular emission of biophotons beginning from a few biophotons to some hundreds of biophotons/cm2, as an ultra-weakly delayed bioluminescence (including the level of DNA). This coherent emission of bioluminescence (having the characteristics of a \"bio-laser\" emission) was demonstrated by using high technology and methodology, such as a photomultiplier, that is able to determine the Poissonian Photocount Statistics of a \"biophoton emission\" and the of \"delayed the \"biophoton emission\" and the of each biological system [Popp a.o., 1994: figure 5]. Such evidence could make understandable the nature of the bioluminescent emission (biofield) of living systems, first, and the resonant effects generated by homeopathic remedies at the level of this field, second. Figure 5. A \"delayed luminescence\" of daigremonianum bryofillum leaf at length wave = 67610 nm. The measurement of the bioluminescence rate after an exposure in red light lighting can be approximated trough hyperbolic diminishing low, while an exponential diminish (the punctuated line) cannot be spotlighted. The emission of biophotons generated at the level of biological systems (such as plants) and the experimental \"communication / resonance\" between plants and human beings represents a phenomenon that was demonstrated by Cleve Backster at the level of a unifying \"Life field\"(L-field) [Burr, 1972]. A historical experiment [7], recently realized, is more than relevant for this topic. The experiment proved that after a normal (spontaneous) emission of bioluminescence, a sample of lichen stimulated by human hands increased evidently the quantity of emitted biophotons (figure 6a,b) [Stanciulescu, 2003a: 259-269]. It seems clear that it is the \"Vital Force\" as bioluminescent field of the human body that stimulated such an effect [8]. Figure 6. A biophotonic stimulation of a lichen sample: a) the spectral variation of the biophoton emission before and after biostimulation. b) the variation of the number of biophotons before and after being energized Such an interdependence relationship between human and plant bioluminescence has a twofold importance for homeopathic therapy: a) to know that the presence of the therapist can influence the state of the patient in a certain way; b) to avoid interference between the human biofield and the remedy\"s wave information. Theoretical and experimental research by S.J. Singer, A. Guyton, Mae Won Ho, et al., has taken into account the presence of liquid crystals and their optical properties (determined by their transparency) at the level of cell membranes [Stanciulescu, Manu, 2001b: 129]. To prove the objectivity of such a transparency it is necessary to understand many homeopathic therapeutic aspects [Stanciulescu, 2003b: 53-57]. The state of health or illness of the human organism depends on the transparence degree of the membranous liquid crystals: if this transparence is normal, the organism will be healthy, if not it will be ill. By their resonating undulatory (photonic) effect or by their biochemical reactions, the remedies could implicitly stimulate the process of transparency, (by contributing to the arrangement of the liquid crystal on the membranous surface) or inhibit it (in the case of microbes, for example, which must be destroyed). Due to the transparency of the membranous liquid crystal, the specific wave of the remedies can be distributed inside the whole organism, penetration to the DNA level included, by generating adequate resonance phenomena. The presence of the liquid crystals - at the level of the substantial sample generating a potency - is able to explain why the potency must be strongly agitated. In this way, the piezoelectric properties of the (organic liquid) micro-crystals present in the substance and / or dilution liquid will determine by the generated pressure the liberation of substance's energetic-informational reserves (of electrons and photons). These will be homogenously diffused and indefinitely kept in the \"substantial\" and \"field memory\" of the dilution, first, as transmitted to the substratum of the final remedy, and second, as transmitted to the substantial vibrators (liquid crystals) and / or to the bioluminescent field of lactose. Figure 7. The biophotonic model of the membranous liquid crystals, generating: (a) the transparency (reflection, refraction and birefringence) towards light; (b) the light polarized dispersion; (c) the rotational magnetic dispersion; (c) these properties could originally explain the informational-energetic genesis of DNA helicoidal structure. The piezoelectric mechanism of transforming electromagnetic oscillations to mechanical vibrations and vice versa, at the level of biological systems (such as DNA, RNA, ATP, phospholipids of the cellular membranes, etc.), is sustained by the contributions of actual science [Coetzee, 2003: 2-3]. The ultra-thin crystals, such as the magnetite crystals present in the human brain especially and / or in the extra-cellular fluids, or the membranous liquid crystals, become piezoelectric oscillators, sensible to different light (electromagnetic) commands. Briefly, the (cerebral) mechanism is the following: a) The energetic-informational stimuli belonging to the exterior / interior (bio)fields determine - at the brain's level first - the ions release, that induce currents to the surrounding coiled dendrites. b) The micro-amperage magnetic field that results as a consequence stimulates the different types of crystals, by producing a circular, polarized and coherent \"light pulse\". This pulse - the bioluminescent \"Vital Force\", specifically - travels throughout the whole body, by changing the orientation of every molecule and atom within the body, and by restructuring the forms of the cells, of the organs, etc. We could conclude that the piezoelectric mechanism - always involved in the homeopathic mechanism - accomplishes the interface between the energetic-informational fields and the substantial substratum of the human body. Based on the piezoelectric phenomenon of the (liquid) crystals present everywhere inside the human body, many other unconventional therapeutic practices - magneto-therapy or electro-acupuncture, polarized light or laser emission, chromo-therapy, electro-crystalline therapy or sound-therapy - can be explained. These therapeutic practices - including homeopathy - in turn empirically demonstrate the interference established between the bioluminescent field of the body/organ/cell tissue and the different induced type of stimuli: cosmic, telluric, biological, technological, etc. From this, we can suggest a very important consequence for human health. According to our calculations [Stanciulescu, Manu, 2001a: 222-223], the energetic resources of the organism, necessary for metabolism, are much more than the daily 7.000 cal received by alimentation. Consequently, the human body must use other sources of energy / information to harmoniously sustain its \"Vital Force\", namely: light, vibrations and sounds, tastes and miasmas, etc. are translated at the level of the membranous systems of human receptors into electrons (energy) and photons (information). Intuitively, the affirmation of professor F.A. Popp [2003] that \"light is our food\" and that it is possible for certain persons to effectively use only light (cosmic energy) for survival is now understandable [Jasmuheen, 2003]. 2.3. By using some very special high technologies, all the above-mentioned properties of living systems were demonstrated as follow: a) Electron microscopy is able to validate empirically some very relevant aspects of our physical structural and functional characteristics, concerning the patterns of energetic-informational circuits within the body or the properties of the \"structured (organic) water\". This last technology, developed by the Japanese Masaru Emoto [2001], has clearly shown the structuring or non-structuring effects of different types of stimuli - biophysical and psychological, or homeopathic remedies - upon the \"memory of the organic water\" [9]. It is enough to follow two relevant photos (figures 8 a, b) in order to understand some very important aspects correlated to homeopathy: - water represents about 70% of our organism; consequently, its (non)structured configuration is determinative for human body states of health or illness; - positive states of consciousness determine a general structured state of organic / \"linked\" water of the human body, which will favor any process of healing; - therapeutic properties of a remedy depend on the structure of the water-solution used for diluting the remedy. (a) \"Thank you\" (b) \"You make me sick; I will kill you\". It is very important to understand now that, \"the energy or vibrations of the environment will change the molecular shape of water. In this sense, water not only has the ability to visually reflect the environment, but also molecularly to reflect the environment\" [Sharp, 2003: 2]. The possibility that mental states can affect the structure of water, implies that it is important to have a good attitude (optimistic, positive) about a particular (homeopathic) treatment. Positive mental thinking will better structure the whole biological water of the body, which will prepare it to assimilate the good information/energy of a certain (homeopathic) remedy. The hypothesis formulated by Hahnemann that the medicinal substance imprints its \"memory\", \"energy signature\" or \"life force\" onto the lactose or alcohol (water) solvent, that is released when taken by a patient, can now be sustained with scientific arguments. Trying to formulate a rational answer to the exciting question: \"How could a homeopathic remedy have any effect when there is nothing in it but water?\" Roger Taylor [2003: 20-21] uses very recent scientific research (belonging to quantum physics) concerning the \"memory of water\". According to these discoveries, water retains the memory of energies and substances with which it has had contact, so that a mass of water behaves in some ways like a quantum whole. The work of Jacques Benveniste proves that homeopathic information can be transferred by an electric and / or magnetic procedure from a succussed solution to another one, containing only water. Similarly, Cyril Smith potentised different quantities of water with different electromagnetic frequencies, proving by convergent strategies that the human being is resonating with the induced and memorized frequency. From all these experiments, it clearly results that living systems are able not only to receive the memorized information of the water, but to transmit their information to the water as well. The \"Vital Force\" is responsible for such a performance. In the same vein, due to this interference, it is commonly forbidden that a patient, or some other person, touch a certain remedy. This precaution avoids a possible interference of waves that could modify the original information of the remedy. The theory and technology of lasers (photonics), the basis of the first \"holographic\" effects, represents the mechanism of brain functionality (suggested by Karl Pribram) in the role of the pituitary / pineal complex as a very sensitive organ (the symbolic \"third eye\") for the influence of the \"(bio)light field\", etc. (figure 2c). As we have already argued [Stanciulescu, 2003b: 151-157], this is the cerebral organ most sensitive to (bio)electromagnetic field stimulation, and able to receive and to transform such stimuli into adequate subconscious commands. This process can explain many \"parapsychical\" phenomena, beginning with revelation and telepathy and finishing with miraculous vindication. The mechanism of holography has already been recognized as present in homeopathic practices. For example, as Anton Jayasuriya asserts that \"the relationship between the homeopathic remedy and its vehicle (the substantial support of water, alcohol or protein, etc.) with the human organism supposes some holographic laser mechanisms\" [1997: 100], able to transmit patterns directly to the implied substantial support. In fact, according to our knowledge, the decisive direct / technological experiment, which proves that our memory is also present in the auric field of the body, still has not been realized. But, other indirect (empirical) proofs could stand for such an experiment. It is known, for example, that the abyssal memory of a dying person actualizes in few seconds the details of the whole lifespan. In certain stress conditions we instantaneously find good solutions / answers to a life and death problem (an extremely dangerous situation, for example), from otherwise ignored cognitive patterns etc. In the same manner, and supported by the Fourier spectrum of the human aura, our body probably maintains the major pattern of our health state, which the body seems to \"forget\" when an illness becomes active. That is why, by introducing a homeopathic remedy into the deep memory of the organism, we introduce in fact a \"holographic bit of information\", the \"informational matrix\" containing the program of the organism's right functionality. High level (bio)photonics and optical technology, based on lasers and holographic technology, offers both: (a) An exemplary analogous model for understanding the high coherence level of the living systems\" bioluminescent emission [Popp a.o., 1992], for clarifying the holographic functioning of the brain [Pribram, 1971], of the verbal language genesis, etc. (b) The adequate instrumentation to create technical models for computational / digital analyses (by means of special computer software) of biological field data, recorded by video-camera, UV and IR photo-technologies etc.), and to make visible the different bio-psycho-logical states of the human being etc.; such analyses could highlight the invisible effects of a homeopathic therapy, for example, after its administration [Slawinski, 2003]. In this frame, we could mention two types of stimulating technologies, such as: - the medical laser radiation, the polarized light of the Zepter-technology, chromo-therapy, sound-therapy (cymatics developed by Dr. Peter Guy Manners) or the electro-crystalline therapy of Harry Oldfield, etc., using some artificial emission of light (waves) to amplify the energetic + informational activity of the human organism; - the new therapeutic Rife Technology, based on pulsed plasma energy transfer, realized by Jimmie L. Holman, able to cure very severe diseases, such as cancer; - the orgonic / radionic technologies realized by Wilhelm Reich, Thomas Tesla, Robert Pavlita, Karl Hans Welz a.o., that are able to preserve and release the natural radiation of the \"cosmic field\"in some technological accumulators. All these technologies, used as sources of artificial or natural EI, can influence the state of the \"life field\", that is, of the human aura, by resonance, because, as we have already observed, the (human) bioluminescence has all the properties of the \"cosmic EI field\". Consequently, they empirically demonstrate the interference established between the bioluminescent field of the body/organ/cell tissue and the induced stimuli of the \"complex light\". Among them, special attention should be paid to a recent Romanian innovative biotechnology [Stanciulescu, Apopei, Poenaru, \"biological laser\" active substance) of several natural ingredients (vegetable and animal), specifically selected and measured, placed on human body as a pendant, button, etc., having a specific design, form, color (frequency), state of aggregation, etc. Such an exogenous source of omeopathic effects is able to stimulate the EI of the living systems resources and to eliminate the causes of different illness states. Let us remember, in this context, the practice of the traditional American Indians, and not only, to wear permanently, at their neck, a magic \"medicine pouch\" full of vegetable and organic plants, of crystals, etc. The power of such magic substances was stimulated by the resonance or the light, of the human palms and prayer, by human love etc. In addition, a biophotonic resonator could be technologically activated by using a polarized colored light, a laser source of stimulation etc. As we haved already explained [Stanciulescu, 2004: 105-150], from a biophotonic point of view the homeopathic bioresonators have a double function: (1) an energetic function: to delivery by a resonance mechanism the internal nergy of the receptor system and to activy its growth / development / healing processes; (2) an informational function: to play the role of a \"disk-system\", able to remember to the ill organism (who lost its \"field memory\" / \"matricial memory\") its original \"soft\" (the normal functions of the metabolism, for example). It is enough to observe the amazing energetic and informational effects (figures 9, 10) generated by these external / exogenous homeopathic resonators, for understanding the real power of the homeopathic therapy. Figure 9. Seems of wheat, after first 12 days of growth: a) left sample: normal growth; b) right sample: growth stimulated by a biophotonic resonator Figure 10. The evident benefic change of human \"aura chakras image\" (frequency / color) from green-blue (a) to violet (b) and of the \"aura chakras graphs\" intensity from 70 % to 100%., after using a biophotonic resonator (analyze realized System\" computational technology, Johann Muller Dragoman, 2006). Such a mechanism of holographic / informational resonance (figure 11) becomes active (sensible) especially in the presence of some natural abnormal or normal (bio)electromagnetic field, its functionality being initiated by the resonance of the \"Vital Force\", which plays in this context the stimulatory role of a special \"natural laser\", as our biophotonic model of the human being extensively argues [Stanciulescu, 2003a,b]. Figure 11. The general mechanisms of homeopathic healing: the waves of the remedy / biophotonic resonator (namely the \"informational hologram\" of the emitter) specifically interacts with the waves of the receptor (cell, organ), by modulating / normalizing its own vibratory state, first, by remodeling the receptor's form (determining the liquid crystals repositioning), second. From a homeopathic point of view, the biological laser's active substance of a biophotonic resonator could be assimilated to a technological polychrest remedy, acting from the exterior of the human body [10]. The very large spectrum of action (frequencies) possessed by the selected active substances (a homeopathic solid complex) offers a high probability that the normal \"fundamental wave\" of a certain ill biological system (a person or, in certain condition, even a group of persons) is present and, by its benefic bioresonance, the harmony of the system can be reestablished. Such a possibility could fundamentally enrich modern homeopathic practice by concretizing the possibility of using the homeopathic remedy as a (quasi)permanent external source (converter) of radiation. Such an individual \"exogenous homeopathy\" could be the necessary step for accomplishing the amazing idea of Harry van der Zee [2003b]: to conceive a \"transpersonal homeopathy\" able to cure a whole human collectivity and, finally, the whole of humankind. * * * In conclusion, we could consider - on the one hand - that all the above-mentioned theories and their possible connections with homeopathy represent the intuitive support that is necessary for homeopathy to postulate the existence of the \"Vital Force\". At the same time, on the other hand, therapeutic practices sustain \"physically\" (and empirically) the old \"metaphysical\" intuitions of humankind. Therefore, we may assert that, on the one hand, all the above-mentioned objective research constitutes very strong experimental arguments favorable to biophotonics / \"biological lasers\" theory's major hypotheses: the presence of bioluminescence as an amplified and stimulated emission of radiation, the role of liquid crystal in the optical activity of living systems, the structural and functional characteristics of some hierarchical systems of \"biological lasers\", etc. On the other hand, the above-mentioned arguments justify the idea that the light - in all its \"created hypostases\"(generated by the integrative \"Uncreated Light\" of the Divinity) - plays an essential role in the bio-psychical and spiritual healthy life of the human being. FINAL NOTES [1] The principles of this discipline, having professor dr. Fritz-Albert Popp (Germany) as the first promoter, completed by the theoretical contribution of the \"biological lasers\" theory [Stanciulescu, Manu, 2002] - which assumed biophotonics as the science of generating, stocking and emitting biophotons / bioluminescence at the level of all the living systems, in their quality of \"biological lasers\" - will be largely presented in our next article. [2] Some parts of the present article have also been presented in [Stanciulescu, 2003 b,c; 2004b]. But, because it represents the introductory step for a further succession of articles, the present synthesis - containing some very new information too - is entirely justified. [3] As we have mentioned in another context [Stanciulescu, 2003b: 14], we have only metaphorically used the concept or \"LIGHT\" as an archetype of human EI metamorphoses. Usually, by saying \"light\", we have in mind only the visible spectrum of the electromagnetic waves. That is why we have proposed the syntagm of \"COMPLEX LIGHT\" for defining / covering all the possible states of electromagnetic radiation, already known (such as invisible microwaves, IR, UV, gamma, X ray, etc.), not enough known (such as bioelectromagnetic radiation / aura emitted by living systems) or unknown (such as \"universal living field\" or the \"divine hierarchies\" mentioned by Dionysius Pseudo-Areopagitus) to standard science. [4] An exhaustive synthesis of all these, which tries to define this \"X energy\", from mythical conceptions to scientific ones, belongs to Marco Bischof [2002]. [5] This photograph was taken during the first International Conference for Complementary Therapies, November 6-8, 1996, Arad, Romania. [6] These mechanisms, detailed in our books [Stanciulescu, Manu, 2001a,b], explain \u00ablight's metamorphoses\u00bb inside the human organism, determined by: (a) the antiStokes effect, supposing that at the level of the nonlinear systems (such as organic liquid crystals and different types of phosphates), the light / photons in the visible spectrum are absorbed and then (re)emitted, after being stimulated with infrared (IR) photons, according to the rule: Vemitted = Vvisible + Vinfrared ; (b) the doubling of the electromagnetic waves frequency passing through the membranous liquid crystal. The two mentioned effects having the consequence of a \"modulation in frequency\" of the visible electromagnetic waves inside the human body, specifically, their deviation towards invisible UV radiation. This invisible radiation could be identified with the \"vital force\" of homeopathy. [7] This experiment was realized using the statistic photo-counter technology of the International Institute of Biophysics, Neuss (Germany), in cooperation with the biophysicist Prof. Dr. Rajendra Bajpai (India), on August 30, 2003. [8] A very important detail, known only by me, is that all during the stimulation (5 minutes, from about 10 cm distance) I focused my mind positively towards the sample of lichen, by \"loving\" it and by \"asking\" to sensibly increase its \"vital force\". Throughout this process, I had in mind the presence of the \"universal field of energy-information\", praying for my \"transformation\" into a good \"channel\" for it, as happened in some other situations too [see figure 2b]. As a conclusion in the context of our homeopathic topic, it is essential to know that - as therapists or as patients too - first we must optimize our state of consciousness, our soul and state of mind, to obtain the body's best answer. [9] This technology supposes the following steps: a) the structuring of water by the influence of certain stimuli; b) the freezing of a water drop in a special cold-chamber; c) the use of electron microscopy to photograph the resulting ice-crystals. [10] Concerning the mechanisms of such a type of biophotonic resonator, some more details will be presented in a future approach, taking into consideration that this solution is practically recuperating / refounding the very old science of the \"exogenous homeopathy\".
