Manage symptoms with Atropin e. Instruct patient to contact healthcare providers (BC Cancer Nurse Telephone Line or Physician on call) to determine whether patient needs to come to cancer agency or go to emergency department for atropine treatment Prophylactic atropine may be indi cated for subsequent treatments Late Onset/Delayed Diarrhea Occurs more than 24h after administration Can be prolonged and lead to potentially life -threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalance if not proactively man aged Must be treated immediately with high dose loperamide Patient Education: - Always keep supply of loperamide at home (available at pharmacy without a prescription) - Take two tablets (4 mg) after 1st loose stool then one tablet (2 mg) every 2h until dia rrhea - free for 12h - Overnight may take 4 mg every 4h to allow longer sleep period - Loperamide daily dosage may exceed package recommendations. Reinforce importance of taking higher dosage to stop diarrhea - Contact healthcare providers (BC Cancer Nurse Teleph one Line or Physician) if diarrhea does not improve within 24h after starting loperamide or if diarrhea lasts more than 36h (as antibiotics may be prescribed) Special Considerations for Immunotherapy (Checkpoint Inhibitors ) Immune -Mediated Adverse Reacti ons Can cause severe and fatal immune -mediated adverse reactions including: enterocolitis, intestinal perforation, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, endocrinopathy, and toxicities in other organ systems Permanent discontinuation of treatment is recommende d for severe immune -mediated reactions Onset usually occurs during the beginning of treatment, but may occur months after last dose All patients should be given Ipilimumab Alert Card , or an immunotherapy alert card when treatment is started The information contained in these documents is a statement of consensus of BC Cancer professionals regarding their views of currently accepted approaches to treatment.
