This can be done through expression and distillation. Expression, also referred as cold pressing, expression is method used to extract oils from citrus fruits like lime, orange, tangerine, lemon, and bergamot. In the past, expression doesn't require any sorts of tools except for a sponge. After soaking the citrus rind or zest, it will be pressed against the sponge repeatedly to absorb the oil. The sponge will then be squeezed over a container to catch the oils and allow it to separate from its juices. After a few hours, the oils will be siphoned off and bottled. A modern type of expression involves using a blender-like device that's equipped with spikes. Once the citrus zest, rind, or peel is placed into the device, it will rotate and prod and prick the citrus until the oils are released. Oil will be collected at the bottom of the device and bottled immediately. Distillation, which most essential oils are extracted using the distillation process. In this process, the plant part is placed on a grid that's inside a container called still. The still is then sealed. The water, steam, or water/steam combination swirling inside the sealed still will slowly break down the plant to release its volatile components and turn it into steam. These components will then rise up and collect into the condenser. Once the condenser is cool, the components will revert back into liquid form and will be collected in a separate container.
