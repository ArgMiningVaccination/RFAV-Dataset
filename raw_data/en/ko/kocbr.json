Can Europe's doctors learn anything fromtheir American colleagues about how to respond? More than one third of Europe's cancer patients are using someform of complementary oralternative medicine (CAM),yet fewer than one in five of these patients have received advice from theirdoctor about the therapy they use, with the vastmajority acting on the basis of information fromfriends and family. These are among the keyfindings of the first Europe-wide study intoCAM use specifically in cancer patients, whichwas published this February in the Annals of Oncology (16: 655-663). Fourteen countries participated in the sur- vey, covering a total of 956 patients. In mostcountries, usage was around 30-40%. Two ofthe highest rates were reported in Switzerland(48.6%) and the Czech Republic (58.8%), con-sistent with previously documented high levelsof CAM use in neighbouring Germany, whichwas not included in the study. The highest useof all was recorded for Italy, at 73.1%, but as theauthors point out, the results may be skewedbecause the data came from a palliative careunit. At the opposite end of the scale, only14.8% of patients in Greece reported usingPat Healy CAM. The authors speculate that a combinationof lack of availability, high compliance with tra-ditional medicines, cultural norms and underre-porting for fear of being 'found out' by their doc-tors may partly explain why this figure is so low. Though CAM use in Europe still has some way to go to catch up with the US, where rateswell above 40% are consistently reported, acomparison with earlier studies shows thatEuropean patients are turning to CAM inincreasing numbers - indeed CAM is nowEurope's second fastest growing industry. The term CAM covers a wide variety of therapies. The most popular forms of CAMreported in the survey are herbal medicines andremedies, with homeopathy, vitamins and min-erals, medicinal teas, spiritual therapies andrelaxation techniques also widely used. A partic-ularly significant finding is that most patientsusing CAM were taking biologically based ther-apies (as classified by the US National Centerfor Complementary and Alternative Medicine),and that the use of herbal medicines tripledafter a cancer diagnosis. Interestingly, the typeof herbs used varies considerably by country:mistletoe in Switzerland, olive leaf paste inPatient Voice CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 61Greece, nettle leaves/tea in Turkey, aloe vera in Serbia and Spain, Ovosan in the CzechRepublic. Also reported were green tea, essiactincture, Chinese herbs, sage tablets,Echinacea, cod liver oil, fresh juice and vegeta-bles, vitamin E, glucosamine, chamomile, pep-permint, selenium, yeast extract, multi-vitamins,Ayurveda herbs, vitamin C, soya drinks, ginseng, mulberry carti-lage, calcium, magnesium), papaya tea, beetand carrot juice, a mixture of aloe, honey, rhakiand wine, and angelica herb. The survey notes that improvements in physical and psychosocial well-being andincreasing hope are the main reason for patientsturning to CAM. But it also finds that \"dissatis-faction with some aspects of conventionalhealth care, poor doctor-patient relationship,accessibility, perceived effectiveness and des-peration may also be key motivating factors.\" Soit is not surprising that patients are turning toCAM on the word of family and friends or themedia rather than information and adviceoffered by physicians and nurses. Some of these patients spend a lot of moneyon CAM - 123 euros on average, with the high- est reported amount being 4,140 euros a month.But more than half of all patients spend nothing,because they use herbs that come free. Like many cancer patients, Nazira Visram, from Cancer Voices in the UK, is willing to tryanything to improve her quality of life. But sheis careful to do so only in consultation with herphysicians. She has lived with a breast cancerdiagnosis for three years. Her conventionaltreatment was a lumpectomy, followed by sixweeks of radiotherapy and then tamoxifen. Buther reaction to the drug was so severe that shestopped taking it after 6 months. PAIN AND PANIC CONTROL Nazira was experiencing severe pain and foundimmediate help when she started using reflexol-ogy. She describes it as \"absolutely amazing\",helping with pain control and calming herenough to give her time to reflect and \"to get outof panic mode.\" She also tried yoga, whichtaught her to breathe correctly, which hasbecome part of her normal routine. She says:\"There is a lot to cancer. The psychological partis not understood. You are taken care of clinical-ly, but then you need signposting throughout thecancer journey.\" Her own conventional treatment carries a possible side-effect of a greater risk of osteo-porosis. She takes prescribed calcium tablets toreduce the risk and has cut back on dairy prod-ucts. She drinks soya milk and takes eveningprimrose, magnesium and zinc, \"things I thinkwill help me get a balance into my body.\" She hastold both her oncologist and general practitioner(GP) about her use of CAM because she feels itis important to keep her doctors on her side. Shealso has asthma, and acknowledges that \"I needtheir support if I run into difficulties.\" Nazira volunteers as an educator and train- er for Cancer Voices, an umbrella group of Nazira Visram, a volunteer with the UK patient and carer group Cancer Voices, believes a changeof attitudes is needed so that patients can feel able to talkto their doctors about any CAMs they usePatient Voice 62 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005patients' and carers' organisations, in the hope of improving communications between usersand health professionals. This has brought herinto contact with other cancer patients, so sheis aware of people who want to try out thingsthat have worked for others, without discussingit with their doctors. \"Cancer is individual andyour treatment is planned for you taking all per-sonal factors into account. What works for oneperson won't necessarily work for another. It isthis lack of knowledge that worries me.\" Shethinks some patients fear that discussing CAMuse with their doctors may affect their futuretreatment, underlining the need for better com-munications. Nazira wants action to changeattitudes so that patients feel able to tell their doctors about anything they introduce into theirlife style. Bradley Pearl, a GP working in a UK practice serving a multi-cultural population, has a relaxedattitude to certain CAM. He sometimes recom-mends homeopathy, because it uses vanishinglysmall amounts of substances, although he admits\"one never knows what is actually in it.\" His initial response to a cancer patient ask- ing about a herbal remedy they have read aboutwould be to find out exactly what the treatmentis. Just because something is herbal doesn'tmean it is harmless, he says, and there is evi-dence of some herbs interacting with a range ofprescribed medicines. He observes: \"People are often happier tak- ing something that is called 'herbal' rather than aprescription medicine, even though we knowexactly what is in it. Herbal medicines can con-tain anything - and most active things we knoware plant derived.\" Pearl says that alternative therapies are potentially a mine field, so it is important thatpeople using them should let their doctors know. NO EVIDENCE BASE Why do some doctors take a more conservativeview? \"As doctors we are interested in treatingpeople through evidence-based practice. Wewant to know what is there, what has beenshown to work and what has been shown to beless beneficial. Not many alternative medicineshave passed the gold standard of being properlyinvestigated through clinical trials,\" he says. Andhe points out that cancer patients are a particu-larly vulnerable group of people who \"are oftengrasping at straws and particularly open tocharlatan practitioners.\" Roger Wilson, cancer patient and now director of Sarcoma UK, says patients are entitled to make up their own minds -hopefully in an informed way COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE? Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine. An example is using aroma- therapy to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery. Alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. An example is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended bya conventional doctor.

Even the most highly qualified peoplecan take risks when they become patientsthemselves. Helle Viola Hangaard, a Danish GP, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. She hadbeen aware of a lump in her breast long beforeher diagnosis. When a mammogram confirmedshe had cancer, she had a mastectomy followedby chemo- and radiotherapy. She admits taking vitamins and antioxidants after another patient recommended them. Thekey motivation for trying these therapies wasthat it was something active she could do byherself. \"Having cancer turned my world upsidedown and I knew I had to change something.My marriage, my children and my job were allOK, so it had to be something else,\" she says. She did not discuss it with her own GP, arguing that as a qualified doctor herself, shewas well equipped to make her own decisions.But she stopped taking the antioxidants afterdiscovering that they can reduce the effective-ness of radiotherapy. Subsequently she alsogave up the vitamins. She says she was takingup to 11 vitamin pills a day and stopped\"because I was feeling so good.\" Asked if she gets cross with her own patients if they don't comply with her advice,Helle stalls and says she works with patientswith learning difficulties. But she admits thatshe does get cross with the patients' carers ifthey supply alternative medicines. Roger Wilson, director of the charity Sarcoma UK, finished his conventional treat-ment in September 2000 when, unknown tohim, his doctor believed he had only a year leftto live. He does not approve of alternative ther-apies but supports a complementary approach\"which recognises that no doctor knows every-thing and that patients are entitled to make uptheir own minds - hopefully in an informed and logical way which feels right for them.\" He takes a lot of supplements and usually discusses his use with his oncologist, exceptwhen he decided to use resveratrol. \"This is theactive good bit in red wine, and as he hadendorsed red wine, it seemed unnecessary.\" Roger takes selenium, a natural trace min- eral which has been lost to the western diet andmay destroy cancer cells. He also takes vitafla-van and Vitamin E, both antioxidants, and beta-carotene which converts to Vitamin A inthe body and is believed to inhibit tumour for-mation. He also takes zinc, starflower oil andfolic acid. Before taking these supplements, he was already taking multivitamins and Omega 3 fishoil. He drinks a lot of green tea and eats a dietbased on organic vegetables, fresh bread, andfish rather than meat.

Reprinted with permission from ESMOcasts that the doctors will eventually address the CAM history of patients as a routine part of tak-ing their medical history - a procedure that isalready under discussion in the US. Karin Schmidt, a researcher in complemen- tary medicine at the Peninsula Medical Schoolof the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth,argues that there is also a pressing need forhealth professionals to inform themselves moreon the CAM their patients are using. She isworking on a new website which will offer con-densed summaries on CAM therapies, which isdue to start in September and is financed by theEuropean Union. The hope is that this willprove a useful resource for doctors, and also pro-vide patients with a much-needed authoritativealternative to the many very dubious sources ofinformation currently found on the Internet. One suggestion put forward by the authors of the recent study is that Europe should followthe example of the US, where 64% of medicalschools offer courses in CAM. They point out,however, that this doesn't deal with the funda-mental problem that for most CAMs, reliableevidence-based information just doesn't exist,and without such evidence, doctors' reluctanceto advise on such therapies is understandable.They conclude that \"the need to increase theevidence base of CAM therapies using method-ologies that are appropriate and sensitive toCAM cannot be overemphasised.\"Patient Voice 64 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005checked to ensure that it doesn't conflict withprescribed medicines. He explains: \"I have seen patients die early as a result of believing 'snake oil' merchants (inone case a sharks fin merchant). I have also seenwhat it does to their loved ones and it is a des-picable trade. There are cases where traditionalmedicine cannot help, we all know that, anddoctors will admit it when they are up againstthe buffers. \"The snake oil merchants don't. For them it's the patient's fault if they don't live, and that Ican never forgive. Forget the money issues, it isimmoral. I know there are people who have sur-vived using an alternative approach, good forthem, but they are exceptions just as muchas I am.\" COMMUNICATION GAP The evidence that one in three patients inEurope are using CAM - most of them biologi-cally based CAM - raises some important issuesfor their doctors. Not least among them is thewell-documented problem that few doctors willknow which of their patients are taking what.
