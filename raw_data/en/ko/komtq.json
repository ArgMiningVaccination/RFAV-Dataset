They are different branches of the healing tree. Their methods seem totally different from one another. Both protocols recognize that within the person energies/forces exist and are constantly in motion. Hannaman, the founder of homeopathy, spoke of the vital force, while the acupuncturist (Traditional Chinese Medicine) practitioner spoke of Qi (pronounced 'chi') many centuries ago. Both treatment protocols are known to treat a wide array of illnesses, and provide cures when practised. Acupuncture uses very fine needles (which are seldom painful) to stimulate certain points along the meridians. These points, once stimulated, can produce varying results from pain relief to reviving patients. Its efficiency is in bringing to a normalcy the imbalance that is present in the body. With proper diagnosis, using Traditional Chinese Diagnosis, a practitioner is able to understand where and what the disorders are, and formulate the best action plan to treat it. Homeopathy also recognizes the importance of treating individuals as individuals and of understanding the whole person, as opposed to only understanding a single disease. Therefore, a typical examination would include history taking and examination, as they are all important in establishing the diagnosis. This makes it easy to understand what the true cause of the disorder is. Homeopathy treats by reportizing the patient's case, thus taking into consideration the patient's condition, personality, physical features, effects of external factors, such as environment, nature and time, and patterns of disease within the family. This approach makes it possible to cure any condition, but not many people will admit to that. Homeopathy and Acupuncture Both modalities of treatment can be combined and delivered in their original form to complement each other by practitioners trained in both arts. Homeosiniatry Homeopaths Weihe (of German descent) and Goehrum discovered that when certain diseases were cured by a homeopathic remedy, a point in the body that grew tender with pressure was relieved. During his research, Weihe was able to locate approximately 197 points. He also linked these points with particular homeopathic remedies which were prescribed for a specific disorder. He was able to use the points to confirm the correct remedy to prescribe when in doubt. This was known as Homeosiniatry. Strangely enough, these tender points are also described in TCM as Alarm points and As-shi points. Alarm points represent organs in the body. If there is a disorder in the organ's related energy channel, the respective alarm point will become tender. Homeopuncture Subsequently, a famous French author and acupuncturist, Roger de la Fuye (French Homeopath and Acupuncturist) researched and concluded that homeopathy can be used with acupuncture to treat patients. He was also able to utilize the points to confirm if the remedy was the proper one. Considering the effectiveness of each therapy, it is fair to say that combining these two therapies could be very fruitful. Homeopuncture in Practice Using homeopathy with acupuncture has brought about a union of the knowledge between the healing methods of acupuncture and homeopathy. Both treatment methodologies have shown their value in treating many disorders, and so in combination they can make possible even greater feats. If an acupuncturist were to say \"why bother... acupuncture can do anything\", this would only indicate ideological rigidity, and they would have failed to see that the idea of any treatment is to heal the patient as soon as possible and as effectively as possible. In combining the knowledge of the two systems, we become equipped to have a better understanding about the patient and the illness. This enables practitioners to treat patients more efficiently. Clinical Homeopuncture In recent years, the combination of acupuncture and homeopathy has revealed success in treating conditions that range from alopecia areata (hair loss) and skin disorders, such as leucoderma (Vitiligo) and psoriasis, to arthritis and many other conditions. The Procedure The needles are immersed in a liquid homeopathy remedy. The acupuncturist uses normal needling, or non-retention needling (in disorders that cover a greater area), on the affected area (in Chinese 'Ashi points'). 'Non-retention needling' is the use of acupuncture needles to puncture the skin and then removing it, instead of letting the needle remain in the skin as it normally would be. This is continued until the affected area has been completely pricked with the needle. After every one or two pricks, the homeopath lubricates the needle tip before puncturing the skin again. This might sound very painful, but in fact if you go to an experienced acupuncturist you will experience no pain or minimal discomfort, depending on the location being needled. Advantages 1. Nil or Minimal Aggravation Since acupuncture has a homeostatic quality, if there is any aggravation that occurs with homeopathy, it is completely exhausted or brought to a minimum; 2. On Remedies Some remedies might case side-effects because it is not the similimum. Even though this is the case, for homeopuncture one may choose to use a remedy that has a direct influence on the disorder, and focuses only on the disorder. Since both treatment protocols are natural, and treat the body as a whole, it may be a good idea to divide the forces. For example, a homeopathic remedy can be prescribed for the disease only, coupled with acupuncture using the regular points for the disorder (with Du20 BaiHui). The result, on many occasions, is that there are no aggravations; 3. The Remedy Remains Pure As the remedy is directly inserted into certain areas of the body, there is a smaller chance of contamination then when given orally; 4. On Potencies Combinations of potencies can be used, by having one potency for the homeopuncture, where the remedy reaches the patient via the needle, and another in the traditional homeopathic manner. Why? Because the homeopuncture remedy will act, for example, in Leucoderma; instead of using the similimum you may choose Sepia 6c or 12c with the needles and give the similimum in the oral form. Clinical Cases A great deal of research on homeopuncture was carried out at the Medicina Alternativa clinic in Colombo, Sri Lanka, under the guidance of the late Professor Anton Jayasuriya. The clinics there are significantly larger than most clinics here in the UK, treating a phenomenal 300-600 patients a day, and best of all, treatment is free. Case 1 Male 49 years-old. Severe Psoriasis all over the body for eight years. Treatment Homeopuncture using Nux Vomica 30c, Sulphur 30c. Case 2 Female 21 years-old. Ninety percent of the body was de-pigmented over a period of ten years. Background She was forced to leave the house because her husband didn't like the leucoderma. A few years after she got cured she remarried. Treatment Homeopuncture with Sepia 30c, given both orally and as homeopuncture. Case 3 Male. Psoriasis for 40 years. Treatment Homeopuncture with Nux Vomica 30c, Sulphur 30c, Psorinum 30c. Practitioner Note The two streams of healing have been brought together not just to satisfy some researchers' whims, but to enable practitioners to do justice to patients. Some individuals might have the skills to cure patients quickly with just one form of treatment, but for others combining the therapies can help them to improve the quality of the healing.

Thanks! - Luis Miguel Trapaga said.. hi, is it possible to list the details of: the specifics of the cases you have treated, for example, where where the lesions located, whether they due to blood deficiency, wind, damp, heat, cold or a combination of pathogens,the points that were needled, and the dosage of the remedies used. Otherwise there is very little to learn from your posts. With thanks, LMT - valiveti Nagabhushanam said.. Hahnemann writing on devided doses support this combination -----< Page - 158 > of the book Chronic diseases----- In this manner the homopathic physician will derive all the benefit from a well selected remedy, which can be obtained in any special case of chronic disease by doses given through the mouth. But if the diseased organism is affected by the physician through this same appropriate remedy at the same time in sensitive spots other than the nerves of the mouth and the alimentary canal, i.e. if this same remedy that has been found useful is at the same time in its watery solution rubbed in (even in small quantities) into one or more parts of the body which are most free from the morbid ailments (e.g. on an arm, or on the thigh or leg, which have neither cutaneous eruptions, nor pains, nor cramps) -then the curative effects are much in creased. The limbs which are thus rubbed with the solution may also be varied, first one, then another. Thus the physician will receive a greater action from the medicine homopathically suitable to the chronic patient, and can cure him more quickly, than by merely internally administering the remedy. This mode of procedure has been frequently proved by myself and found extraordinarily curative; yea, attended by the most startling good effects; the medicine taken internally being at the same time rubbed on the skin externally. This procedure will also explain the wonderful cures, of rare occurrence indeed, where chronic crippled patients with sound skin recovered quickly and permanently by a few baths in a mineral water, the medicinal constituents of which were to a great degree homopathic to their chronic disease. [*] The limb, therefore, on which the solution is to be rubbed in, must be free from cutaneous ailments. In order to introduce also here change and variation, when several of the limbs are free from cutaneous ailments, one limb after the other should be used, in alternation, on different days, (best on days when the medicine is not taken internally). A small quantity of the solution should be rubbed in with the hand, until the limb is dry. Also for this purpose, the bottle should be shaken five or six times. Convenient as the mode of administering the medicine above described may be, and much as it surely advances the cure of chronic diseases, nevertheless, the greater quantity of alcohol or whisky or the several lumps of charcoal which have to be added in warmer weather to preserve the watery solution were still objectionable to me with many "}
