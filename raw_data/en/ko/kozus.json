You can easily use these essential oil blends topically by making them into a roller and then simply rolling onto your pulse points just like you would perfume. Other good spots to use a roller include the bottoms of your feet (perfect if you're not fond of the smell of a particular oil), or down your spine. How to make a roller: First, pick up a pack of rollers. I usually snag rollers on Amazon. I have purchased [this inexpensive pack ](https://amzn.to/3ZXrTvB)on Amazon and love the frosted glass and lanyard on them. They also happen to make really cute gifts for friends, teachers, etc. - Just add the drops of oil to a 5ml roller ( [these rollers are simply gorgeous](https://amzn.to/35LatYa)!), - Then top the roller with your favorite carrier oil. [This one is my favorite carrier oil.](https://amzn.to/3kN9nS4) Keep Your Immune Boosting Essential Oils Organized and Handy so You're More likely to use them One of the biggest reasons I see that cause people to fail to use their oils is because they shove their oils in a cabinet somewhere and forget to use them or can't find them. Out of site, out of mind. I know for me, I used to have a big mess of rollers and oils on my nightstand that was cluttered and caused me to feel stressed. So, my husband started making me these pretty oil organizers with his 3D printer so that I could keep my mess organized! I love having my oils beautifully displayed on my nightstand (and kitchen and bathroom and living room....). I've made them available in my shop so you can also get your oils organized and beautifully displayed. The rose gold and rainbow are my favorite! There are many colors available and you can store 5ml bottles, 15ml bottles, and 10ml rollers in them.
