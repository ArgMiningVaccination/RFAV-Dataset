Consider, for instance, these news items published in April of this year: Three-quarters (72.5 percent) of employers have or want to have a wellness program that utilizes a health- risk assessment, according to a survey by United BenefitAdvisors. The survey polled 1,664 employers. More than 40 percent of U.S. companies have implemented obesity-reduction programs, and 24percent more said they plan to do so this year,according to a report from The Conference Board. Almost all employers \u2014 82 percent of small businesses, 90 percent of midsize businesses, and 99 percent of large companies \u2014 see value in implementing wellness programs,according to a study by the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America.About 57 percent of small businesses that value wellness programs haveimplemented them, compared to 79 percent of midsize businesses and 90percent of large companies. Wellness works for employers. According to a study published in the Feb. 11 issue of the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (JOEM), employers can save $6.65 in healthcare expenses for every dollar spent on acomprehensive employee-wellness program. All of these news items point to one thing: Companies are interested in reducing their healthcare costs by keeping employees well. You can help. Wellness programs are just one type of industrial or corporate consulting available to you. I think it is a good choice because wellness programs fit intoall types of business sectors \u2014 service, financial, manufacturing, fabrication,education \u2014 you name it. This issue's cover story looks at four types of industrial consulting \u2014 functional capacity testing, post-offer/preplacement testing, drug and alcoholtesting, and ergonomics evaluation and training. These areas of consulting moretypically (but not exclusively) deal with companies in the industrial arena. We hope our cover story will inspire you to explore new avenues for income generation.

The moment is here for chiropractic to emerge as the leader in industrial health services. But time is of the essence if you want to be part of this new wave ofoccupational providers. Industrial health services have four facets: DOT (Department of Transportation) drug testing and alcoholscreening, ergonomics, functional-capacity testing, andpreplacement/post-offer screening exams. We asked four experts in these fields to give us their opinions about the future of industrial chiropractic. Here'swhat they had to say. DOT COMPLIANCE TESTING According to Michael Megehee, DC, of Blue Mountain Chiropractic Clinic in Pendleton, Ore.,chiropractors are approaching an opportunity of a lifetime.\"Very soon, approximately 50,000 health professionals willbe needed to certify as DOT examiners,\" says Megehee,who is a project team member of the National Registry ofCertified Medical Examiners (NRCME), a panel of theFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The newly revamped DOT training and certification process is expected to be unattractive to a majority ofmedical providers whose schedules are already compressed.Plus, the new NRCME will not distinguish betweenallopathic and chiropractic providers. \"With more than 6,000,000 DOT-qualified U.S. drivers, this could well become a full-time service categoryfor many chiropractors,\" says Megehee. \"The DOT subspecialty of occupational health represents the greatest opportunity for chiropractorstoday,\" he continues. \"Commercial drivers are required tohave an exam every two years that is compensatedanywhere from $50 to $200. And when you promote theseservices, it's basically paid advertising for your practice.\" \"Many people think DOT drivers are only big-rig operators,\" says Megehee. \"But it's every driver operating avehicle over 10,001 pounds across state lines, and thatincludes equipment operators and even [package-delivery]drivers.\" A partner to DOT exams is drug and alcohol testing. Administrators need about two days of training. Add oneday of DOT exam training, and your total investment incertification should be about three days. Random drug and/or alcohol testing is a natural adjunct to DOT services, and it offers a high rate of retention for providers. \"The companies you serve comprise aconsortium from which the randomized test candidates are chosen. These consortiums tend to have longevity,ensuring a steady flow of business to your office,\" says Megehee. It's important to note that drug and alcohol testing require different credentials from DOT certification. Withfull credentialing, DCs can collect specimens, conductadditional testing, and obtain maximum compensation.And you may be able to delegate these duties to youroffice-support staff. Minimal equipment is needed to get started, but full software programs and a breathalyzer may cost about $3,000.Services can be performed at the job site or your office. Megehee adds, \"Chiropractors have a tremendous opportunity to expand into these services in the next twoto three years, but you need to decide now so you canensure your spot.\" He also has some additional advice. \"It's wise to look to the future and consider the importance of more passivemethods of care as you get older.\" He recommends takingall necessary courses and obtaining appropriatecertifications so you really know your material. \"Chiropractors have a significant advantage in this field right now, but you really need to know what you aretalking about,\" he emphasizes. ERGONOMICS With two diplomate credentials and nearly 30 years in chiropractic specializing in occupational health andergonomics, David Gilkey, DC, PhD, was already well- accomplished in these specialties before he addedcertifications in environmental health and occupationalsafety, and did an ergonomics professorship at ColoradoState University. It's no surprise he claims he's been in this field all his professional life. A turning point in his thinking occurred when he was working as a disability evaluator. \"It struck me that ourultimate goal as chiropractors should be to prevent whatwe treat,\" says Gilkey. He developed several successfulemployer programs to serve small- to midsizedorganizations. Then, he began training DCs in thenecessary skills for succeeding in occupational healthservices. The chiropractor should be the employer's best friend, muses Gilkey. \"If you understand the mechanisms ofinjury, you can influence risks. You also have multiple CONTINUED CHEC10p19.ps 6/4/08 11:18 AM Page 1920 C HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .COM VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008COVER opportunities within an organization. You can prevent on-the-job injuries,treat employees, or both.\" According to Gilkey, improving a bottom line is paramountto forming a long-lasting relationship,and DCs are already highly equippedto provide a range of industrial healthservices. These services includeworksite evaluations and ergonomicstraining, health and wellness training,pre- and post-employment exams,and employee assessments for worksuitability or compatibility. With additional training or certification, the services DCs canoffer include industry-specific hygieneand safety, and environmentalexposure services and advice withmanagement programs. Industry specialties include high- tech environments, heavymanufacturing, construction, officesettings, farming, and more. \"Nobodyhandles everything a business needs,\"says Gilkey. \"The commercialindustrial hygiene providers reallydon't want to offer back-safetyprograms or other niche serviceschiropractors can provide. So, alwayslook for where you can fill the gap.\" Gilkey recommends that DCs interested in providing industrialergonomics services take advantageof pertinent diplomate programs andall additional training available todevelop the highest level of expertisethey can. It's also essential to have a strategic plan for networking andapproaching businesses in yourcommunity. \"Be persistent,\" advisesGilkey. \"One thing leads to another.\" Many educational opportunities exist, ranging from diplomate-levelcourses to weekend training sessions. Costs to set up these services in your office vary greatly. You canchoose sophisticated equipment andsoftware or stick with the basicsneeded for patient assessment andsimple measurements. According to Gilkey, expensive equipment isn't necessary. \"You canstart out with as little as a clipboard,tape measure, grip dynamometer,protractors, and EMG.\" But your investment should correlate with your intended clients.Big-ticket equipment usually requiresrelationships with larger businesses tooffset your costs. A more modestinvestment in equipment works wellfor serving smaller organizations. FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY TESTING Simon J. Forster, DC, Forster Health Care Associates in Austin, Texas, has observed chiropracticservices from diverse vantage points. After receiving his chiropractic degree from the Anglo-EuropeanCollege of Chiropractic in Englandin 1989, he moved to Austin, wherehe has since built a successfuloccupational medicine andconsulting practice in which he .COM VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008COVER trains medical examiners. Recognizing the need for return- to-work standards in the United States, he joined the Texas Workers'Compensation Commission'sMedical Advisory Board where heserved on several committees. Forsterhas developed expertise in functionalcapacity evaluation (FCE),impairment rating, casemanagement, clinical outcomes,evidence-based care, and you practice evidence-based medicine,\" saysForster. \"There's a huge emphasis onreturn-to-work issues and the factthat the level of disability isincreased the longer a patient is outof work. In this environment, it'scritical to know how to assesspatients and what to recommend.\" According to Forster, DCs are well CONTINUED MEET OUR EXPERTS Michael Megehee, DC, operates TeamCME, which oversees certified medical examiners working for large companies, and Blue Mountain Chiropractic Clinic in Pendleton, Ore.

Unlike standard allopathic modelsthat require a chain of referralsbetween MDs and manual therapists,chiropractors can both diagnose andmodify treatment within a dynamicenvironment, providing care moreefficiently and effectively. To qualify as a functional capacity examiner, several skills are required.\"It's essential to be competent at jobdescriptions, job-site analyses, thereturn-to-work evaluation, and post-offer testing pertinent to the job,\"says Forster. However, these services offer considerable opportunity for both theindustrial and general practice. \"Ifyou understand functional testing, ittakes about 30 to 45 minutes toassemble evidence-based data that,when properly coded, will yield awell-reimbursed report,\" He says. And you may find these skills to be valuable in personal-injury andother med-legal cases. However, the benefits of these skills extend beyond the obvious.According to Forster, FCEs offermany opportunities to communicatewith all parties to the process, fromHR departments to insuranceadjustors. \"You may find that no jobdescription has been written, whichin turn requires a job-site analysis,\"he explains. \"And every time youmeet someone, it's an opportunity toget further referrals.\" His advice to DCs interested in this work is, \"Get well trained. It's awonderful marketplace forchiropractors, but you need to bewell educated to understand thesystem, perform quality work, and tohave credibility. This meansproficiency with testing parameters,testing correlations, datainterpretation, and reporting. This isfar beyond the basic vendor-provided'how-to.'\" The cost of setting up these services is highly variable and can bemore than $20,000, depending onthe equipment chosen. Moreelaborate setups include worksimulators, computerized lift force,strength- and motion-testing systems,push/pull sleds, and variable weightboxes, in addition to more standardexam equipment and instruments. Software programs are available that simplify reporting and record-keeping. \"Get educated and thentake your time,\" says Forster. \"Goinghigh-tech is expensive, but it offersaccuracy and efficiency. If you choosewell and apply various competenciesin your practice, you can have yourequipment paid off in about three tofour months.\" PREPLACEMENT, POST-OFFER EXAMS \"I put 100 percent of my time into chiropractic and 100 percent of my time into occupational consulting,\"says David A.

After helping on that project, he began to give safety talks at areabusinesses, followed by developing aproprietary work-safety program andWorkRite. Later, he obtained hisdiplomate in occupational health. Thorpe considers DCs to be the best equipped providers of theseservices because of their skills inphysical and neuromusculoskeletalconditions. \"We are specialists in theconditions and types of problemsthat are most costly to businesses,\"says Thorpe. \"As such, we are bettersuited to provide prevention servicesthan other professionals.\" But according to him, chiropractors need to overcome theiresteem issues. \"Today, chiropracticholds high status in this area, and itis known for having an advantageover other professions providingsimilar services.\" To succeed, DCs need to have knowledge of the occupationalhealth field, be properly certified,and be able to find creative solutionsfor companies. They also need to \"bemore service-oriented and lesstreatment-focused,\" says Thorpe. With a service-based protocol, everything is billable, not justtreatment. And, it's possible to provide these services on either a limited or full-time basis. \"These services can be astand-alone operation or a greatpractice-builder to complement aregular chiropractic practice,\" saysThorpe. His best advice for entering this field is to get adequate training \u2014you must know both federal and stateguidelines and have knowledge ofthe occupational health specialty. However, your initial investment in equipment can be minimal.Standard exam instruments alongwith some dynamometers are all youneed to get started.

Once you know that, you can plan to avoid a slowdown. Slow times are just one practice statistic that should be in your management bag. It's important for you to track anumber of other statistics, too. THE IMPORTANCE OF TRACKING An old adage says, \"If you don't know where you are going, you won't know when you get there.\" The sayingimplies you know your starting point \u2014 and yourfinishing goal. The same can be said of your practice: You need to know your starting point \u2014 the number of patients younow see and the amount of money you now make \u2014 soyou can set improvement goals. In other words, trackcertain statistics regularly, including: Patient visits per day; Patient visits per week; New patients per week; Actual income per day; Income per week; Average fee per office visit (not including new- patient fees); Patients per hour; and Percent of cash-payment patients, as well as various types of insurance. WORKING WITH STATISTICS The base statistical information you gather about your practice allows you to take action steps: Slow and busy days. Which days are the slowest? The busiest? How much do you earn on the slow days? Youmay discover it is not worthwhile to work on those days. Do you get inquiries about Saturday appointments? Some DCs would see more patients if they were closed onMondays, but open on Saturdays. Slow and busy hours. When do most of your patients come to see you? Most doctors find their patientswant to come before work (around 8 a.m.), at lunch time(between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.), and after work (from 4:30p.m. to 6 p.m.). If you want to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.and close for lunch at noon, you will make it harder forpeople to see you and make it easier for them to see adoctor who will accommodate their needs.

You may lose a few patients who can only come atspecific times, but you will gain a lotof time to implement a propermarketing system. Discovering when patient demand is slowest also allows you to makebetter use of your time. Don'tschedule during the slowest times.Instead, plan and execute marketingactivities, conduct staff training, orhold staff business meetings. Slow seasons. Which times of year are slowest? Once you knowthat information, you have theoption of taking a vacation withoutlosing much income. For example: Some doctors take vacations every year in July orSeptember. However, after an analysisof their practice statistics, they seethat because these are busy months, abetter time to vacation is late June. Or, you can anticipate a seasonal slowdown and plan activities inadvance to bring in more patients. Most- and least-effective marketing activities. Whichmarketing activities \u2014 advertising,public speaking, phone campaigns,mailing \u2014 have produced an influxof patients? Which produced theleast? What were the costs and thereturn on investment? Discontinue the least productive activities and concentrate on thosethat reaped the most rewards. Percentage of cash patients. If your percentage of cash patients isvery low, look for new ways to getmore cash patients and increase yourcash flow. Fees per office visit. Compare your average fee per office visit(excluding new patients) to those ofyour competitors. If your fees are notcompetitive, your practice is notearning what it should and may beheaded toward disaster. Raise yourfees. Patients will pay more for the best care. If you believe you offer the bestcare, charge for it! Patients per hour. You can gradually expand your ability tocomfortably see more patients byloading a regular hour with one extrapatient. For example: If you've never seen more than three patients per hour,pick a popular time and load it withfour patients. After you've successfullydone that, and trained yourself thatit's possible to work comfortably atthat speed, start scheduling morehours at four patients per hour. Gradually increase the number of people you treat by \"trimming thefat\" off your visits.

CIRCLE Page ECONOMICS WWW .COM VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008Change in modern, private healthcare practice hasoccurred rapidly, and the systems that contributed to theirsuccess as recently as five years agomay now be ineffective and obsolete. To create a modern, flourishing practice requires recognizing and breaking down roadblocks using contemporary tools and techniques. Roadblock 1: No cyclical calendar of events and promotions. Every office needs a detailed, comprehensive calendar of events and promotions. The competitive nature of today's private practice makes this tool mandatory. The calendar enables you andyour staff to know exactly what is expected on a daily,weekly, and monthly basis, and provides everyone withthe information necessary to execute the plan effectively.The schedule allows everyone to keep an eye on progresstoward short- and long-term goals. Whether you use a computer or pencil and paper, once you develop a template you only need to modify it. Roadblock 2: Haphazard hiring practices. Many doctors create roadblocks related to staffing. Conducting hiring in a haphazard way is a recipe for trouble. Prior to beginning the hiring process, put written procedures in place to ensure you will find and hire onlythe best qualified individuals. Include in your procedures such requirements as conducting background checks and verifying references.Doctors who skip these steps to hire quickly are invitingpotential chaos into their offices. Remember: It is your responsibility to your other team members to make sure any new employees you bring ontothe team have the inherent capacity to contribute to thesuccess of the team as the practice grows and expands. Don't hire a problem. Ensure you are hiring help for your team members by creating good hiring proceduresand adhering to them. Roadblock 3: Ignorance about reimbursements. You cannot survive if you fail to pay close enoughattention to your finance department. If you choose toparticipate in any third-party plans, thoroughlyunderstand what constitutes covered and noncoveredservices, exactly what the expected reimbursement willbe, and how long it will take to be reimbursed. Be sure your participation in these plans will not automatically obligate you to participate in other planswithout your knowledge and consent. You must also put a system in place to collect payment from self-pay patients and to collect on noncoveredservices. Roadblock 4: Poorly presented report-of-findings and care plans. Be thorough on the patient's first visit. Perform any essential diagnostic tests before beginningtreatment, regardless of third-party incentives not to do so. Patients and their families will remember the doctor who makes an accurate diagnosis and presents a care planthat gets the patient better within a reasonable time frameand within the patient's financial parameters. Present the report-of-findings and care plan truthfully, and thoroughly explain why you suggest the particulartreatment plan.

Roadblock 5: Failing to give patients the big picture. A component of practice that oftenseems forgotten today is ensuring youare giving patients the \"big picture\"of health, including lifestyles andsystems of healthcare that promotelong-term health, fitness, overall lifesatisfaction, and personal fulfillment. Some of these components may include the practice of well-patientcare, dietary supplements, massage,fitness programs, and physicaltherapy. Roadblock 6: Failing to make time for you. One of the biggest contributors to burnout anddissatisfaction among doctors inpractice is not having enough timeaway from the office. Maintaining a private practice is physically and psychologicallydemanding, and it taxes your mentaland emotional capacities. There is noway you can perform to your fullpotential if you are not rested and completely healthy. Strive to become more efficient in every aspect of your practicemanagement. Your goal should be toincrease efficiency and effectivenessin the office, so that with eachpassing year you see more patients inless time. This will allow you to take a more balanced approach toward work andpersonal time. You can then pursueother interests in your time off thathelp keep you fresh and passionateabout what you do \u2014 for many yearsto come.

Are you thinking about sellingyour practice? No doubt you have worked hard to create a valuable business, but the reality is the market for healthcare practices currently favors buyers, not sellers. Before you putyour practice up for sale, do some financial and emotionalsoul-searching to be sure you are ready to sell. Ask yourself: Are you ready? Verify that you can maintain your lifestyle or the retirement lifestyle you envision withoutthe income stream from the practice, and determine if youwill miss the challenges of running your own business. Can you stay on? If you enjoy the clinical side of the practice, but not the headaches of running thebusiness, consider staying on as a working doctor or in aconsulting capacity to the new owners. If you take back a note, your presence will help assure an inexperienced buyer will be successful and not default.Staying to help with the transition even for a short timecan be helpful in this situation. Of course, as a clinician orconsultant, you will receive income from the practice. Remember, not all buyers will want you to stay on beyond the transition period and this approach may limitthe number of interested buyers. Is the timing right? Factors, such as decreased reimbursements of workers' comp, Medicare, autoinsurance, and private insurance, have hit chiropracticpractices especially hard, and buyers worry the practicethat made $500,000 the last two years may have troublematching that income in years to come. Generally, unless you get an offer you can't refuse, it is best to wait if your state legislature is discussing new ruleswhich could affect future income, or if your largest payeris going to announce changes in their fee schedule. If your practice statistics and financials are weak, wait a year or more to sell so you can build up the practice andcorrect such faults as poor collections, decreasingrevenues, and new patient visits; dependence on just a fewservices for profit; and lack of systems in place for suchvital functions as collections, recalls, and marketing. If you determine the time is right to sell your practice: Get help. If you are ready to sell, get assistance from a practice broker experienced in selling your type ofpractice, or a practice-management consultant orhealthcare attorney knowledgeable in practice sales. Youmay also want to list your practice with a broker if youhave been unable to find a buyer on your own. Fees vary, as does their ability to market your practice, so shop around. Determine the value. Various formulas are used to value a practice, but these can only give you a range.Ultimately, the practice will be worth what a buyer iswilling to pay. In simplest terms, the value of your practice is the value of the tangible assets (equipment, furniture, etc.) plus thevalue of goodwill. Goodwill used to be much easier tomeasure because patients tended to stay with one doctor, butnow patients change doctors as they change insurance plans. Some factors that increase the value of your practice include a modern office, new equipment, ample parking,and office space; new patient and revenue growth over thepast three years; efficient collections with average days-in-collection less than 45; key staff willing to stay on; afavorable transferable lease; referral sources willing towork with the new owner; and transferable insurance PPOand HMO contracts in place. Determine sale details. The actual details of the practice sale may vary, but be aware of several items: Stock sale. While most buyers will insist they buy only the assets of the practice, try to sell the stock of the practicebecause it is more advantageous from a tax perspective. Point out to buyers that buying the stock may allow them to continue a favorable lease, while an assetpurchase may entail having to get new provider numbersfrom Medicare and other insurers. Have your attorney and accountant help structure the sale so that wherever possible income from the sale will beallocated to capital gains rather than ordinary income.The tax advantage is significant. Asset sale. Usually in the typical asset sale, the accounts receivable are either not for sale, or the buyer has anoption to buy them \u2014 but this is kept as a separate part ofthe purchase.

You can use the fact that an asset sale will interrupt cash flow for the buyer to convince him to purchasethe stock, providing a handsome tax advantage for you, the seller. No. 3 is false because it is usually better to wait and see what the new legislation will actually be. Potential buyers will know about thisissue and will assume the worst when putting a value on what they arewilling to pay for a practice in this kind of situation. The actual changesmay not be that bad. Most buyers will wait until the issues are resolved,leaving only extreme bargain hunters looking at your practice. No. 4 is false. It is better to \"buff up\" a practice that has declining stats. In a buyers market, only the top performers command the top prices.collection headaches. Cash sale. Try to get all cash, but if this is not possible, try to get 50 percent down and the rest in sixmonths to a year. In addition, hold thebuyer to a timetable for completing allnegotiations.

It stands to reason that finding the \"right\" person for this position is extremely important. The front-desk CA can either be a huge asset to your practice or a liabilitythat reduces your practice to shambles. She (or he) can bring in new patients by the droves or do away with existing patients one-by-one. She is on thefront line and is often the first person to make animpression on potential new patients. Instead of wasting hours interviewing the wrong people, here are some ways to work smarter \u2014 not harder. Write a job description. Understand, in writing, exactly the duties and responsibilities of the position andyour expectations in executing them. From this jobdescription you can derive the skills, knowledge, andexperience the position requires. Decide what type of employee you desire. Be specific about the personality traits this person shouldhave. Think about what type of person would relate wellwith your practice members. Then begin to visualize thisperson sitting at your front desk. Create an ad that attracts the specific person. Be explicit and detailed about the type of person youdesire, but not totally exclusive. Try to qualify the ad so iteliminates unqualified callers, however. You want it toreach out and grab the right people. Consider where you will advertise. Sometimes a smaller, more local newspaper will generate a goodresponse at a lesser cost. Even a weekly newspaper willwork and may be less expensive. Also, consider online advertising \u2014 especially if you want and need an individual with good computer skills.Online advertising may be more cost-effective than printadvertising. (Don't overlook the obvious: Place a \"helpwanted\" notice on your own Web site!) Hold an initial phone interview. On a resume, the right words can make anyone sound great. You, however,are looking for someone who isgreat \u2014 and one of the most important qualities of a front desk CA is telephonepresence. To save time and energy, conduct the initial interview with prospective employees over the phone. Choose a lessbusy day and schedule several hours for calls. Develop atelephone-interview form to fill out while speaking withthe respondent, so you can give a rating on a scale fromone to 10. Give a general synopsis of the job requirements, but don't go into detail \u2014 save the details for the face-to-faceinterview, if there is one. Let the potential employeeknow you are conducting a five- to 10-minute phoneinterview and will be calling some respondents back foran \"in person\" interview. If an applicant does not have a presence on the phone, don't waste your time continuing the interview process.On the other hand, if an applicant does have presence,continue in an informal way so he or she will feelcomfortable and relaxed. One of the most important questions to ask is, \"Tell me something about yourself you think I'd like to know.\" Ofcourse, you will be looking \"caring,\" \"dependable,\" \"hard working,\" and\"detail oriented.\" When the interview is done, confirm the phone number, tell him or her you will possibly be in contact fora face-to-face interview within 24 hours, and give theperson a rating on your telephone interview form. Set up a face-to-face interview. Invite only those with a rating of seven or higher to have a personalinterview, thus eliminating unqualified people with littleeffort. Schedule this interview quickly, even the same dayif possible. When you call individuals for a personal interview, listen to how they answer the phone when they are notexpecting you.

It's a component of yourdocumentation requirement anytimeyou perform an evaluation andmanagement (E/M) service. The purpose of your treatment plan is to direct what you plan to do with and for the patient during the next treatment period and usually up until the next scheduledre-evaluation. Despite its importance, however,documentation audits often show it missing from patientrecords. Although you may know what your plan is, remember the old adage: \"If it's not in writing, it doesn't exist!\" When writing or updating your treatment plan, include every service you plan to perform. Note not only your routine chiropractic manipulative treatment, but also anytherapeutic modalities or procedures you plan to use andany durable goods you plan to dispense. You'll also want to include home-care instructions, possible referrals you may make, and any restrictions toactivities of daily living. Essentially, this is part of theassessment portion of your documentation requirement. Although an updated treatment plan is part of your documentation for any E/M service, you can also update atreatment plan within your daily notes, outside of a formalE/M service. For example: If a change of treatment \u2014perhaps the discontinuation of electric muscle stimulation\u2014 is indicated on a routine visit, simply update the planand indicate the treatment change in your daily notes. Here are suggested documentation requirements for each type of service you may render: Manipulative treatment. When you're performing chiropractic manipulative treatment, you must indicateanatomical sites/areas to be treated, including frequencyand duration. You may also include the technique. Modalities. If you plan to perform modalities, such as electric muscle stimulation, ultrasound, traction, ordiathermy, include anatomical sites/areas of application,duration, and frequency. Not only should you list theapproximate duration for each treatment, but also theduration in time, such as \"three times a week for fourweeks.\" Therapy. Include anatomical sites/areas to be treated, duration, and frequency for all therapeutic procedures. Home care. If you are providing home-care instructions to the patient, such as pain control-relatedadvice, avoidance of any aggravating activities, posturalsuggestions, ergonomic advice, ADL (activities of dailyliving) modification, or diet and nutrition advice, listeach in your plan of treatment. Goals. Your goals \u2014 both short term and long term \u2014 are also important components of the treatment plan.Goals may address pain reduction, improved muscle tone,swelling reduction, increased range of motion, increasedstrength and flexibility, improved ability to perform ADLs,improved endurance, coordination and/or proprioception. An easy way to list these goals is to use your outcome assessment tools. For example: If your neck disability index indicates that the patient's sleep is moderately disturbed(two to three hours of sleeplessness), it is very reasonableto include as a short-term goal, \"Get the patient to mildlydisturbed sleep, one level of improvement, by the next re-evaluation.\" An excellent long-term goal would be, \"Improve patient's sleep to no trouble sleeping.\" These goalstatements can be found on the disability index form \u2014 awonderful tool for goal writing. Durable medical equipment. If you prescribe any durable medical equipment, such as braces, supports,custom-made orthotics, exercise balls, or similar devices,include them in your written goals. Be sure to note the necessity of such items and the desired outcome from using them. For example: If you plan to order custom orthotics for the patient, include a line that\"moderate pronation is noted on the left side, contributingTell it like it is: Your treatment plan By Kathy Mills Chang CONTINUED 11:37 VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008PRACTICE MANAGMENT to increased internal knee rotation.

Ifyou plan to x-ray the patient orperform manual and/or diagnosticmuscle testing, indicate why andwhen you plan to proceed. The treatment plan can be the linchpin in your ongoing record ofexcellent documentation. Completethis routinely at the beginning of care,as well as after each re-evaluation,and make it a part of the patient'spermanent record. When third-party payers or others request your plan of treatment, it'sready to go. Not only is this arequirement of your E/M documen-tation, it's also a terrific guideline tokeep you focused and \"on track\" withyour patient's treatment.

He has also targeted companies that employ drivers, such as deliveryand courier services, taxis, and pest-control technicians. These businesseshave to carry insurance policies ontheir drivers. The DC discoveredthat businesses with a regular safetytraining program become eligible forup to a 15 percent discount on theirpolicies. One agency actuallyprovided the chiropractor with a listof their insured companies so hecould approach them. The result of these talks is he gets new patients, and they aren't justinterested in pain relief. One newpatient, for example, asked himabout chiropractic and earaches. It is a hackneyed axiom, but true: Knowledge is power. It pays to stayon the bleeding edge of science.Armed with solid information youcan quickly hush critics whose onlyweapons are falsehood and fiction. Both chiropractors in the case studies have had similar successesand pursued similar avenues in safetyadvocacy. And both have developedsolid relationships with the people,employers, professionals, and civicleaders in their communities.

And in 2004, the most far-reaching study ever done in the United States \u2014 \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults: United States, 2002\" \u2014reported that nearly one in five Americans use naturalproducts, such as herbs, enzymes, and botanicals, andAmericans are showing a growing interest incomplementary and alternative medicine.

However, if you expand your practice into nutrition, remember you incur liability when you diagnose and treat.As with adjustments, you are liable for all nutritionaltreatments \u2014 whether you give a verbal recommendationor a documented supplement regimen. To reduce this liability, always use objective diagnostic tests. These tests: Keep you from playing a guessing game. Recommending supplements based on symptomdiagnostics alone is risky.

The patient suffered from Charcot neuroarthropathy (a degenerative joint destruction as a result of the combinationof trauma and impaired sensation), high cholesterol, highblood pressure, and was overweight (272 pounds). When the patient presented, he was taking two prescribed medications to lower his blood-glucose level,three for high blood pressure, and one for high cholesterol. To assess the full scope of factors contributing to his condition, comprehensive testing that included aurinalysis, tissue mineral analysis, and blood panel(consisting of chemistries, lipids, CBC panel,sedimentation rate, thyroid markers, and several othertests) was ordered. An assessment of the test results showed the patient'sA look at ferritin Ferritin is a protein found inside cells that stores iron so the body can use it later. The amount of ferritin in blood is directly related to the amount ofiron stored in the body. Excess stores of iron, indicated by high levels of ferritin, can increase cellular oxidative stress anddamage tissues. This may lead to insulin resistanceand abnormal glucose metabolism. 1,3 Several studies show that decreasing ferritin levels directly correlates to a reduced hemoglobinA1C. 1,3 Approximately 250 miligrams of iron exit the body with each blood donation thereby loweringoverall ferritin levels without significantly alteringother tests, such as serum iron. 2 High amounts of iron stored in the body can cause inflammation, thyroid problems, and add todiabetic symptoms. 1 References 1Jiang Rui, Manson JoAnn E, Meigs James B, Ma Jing, Rifai Nader; Hu Frank B.

The testsindicated he had: Glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels twice the clinical limit(despite his medications); A clinically high level of ferritin; High uric acid, which indicated signs of developing kidney disease; A low-functioning thyroid; and High levels of the toxins arsenic and nickel. The patient was urged to donateblood as a way to reduce ferritinlevels. T wo weeks after he donatedblood, a recheck of ferritin levelsshowed a drop of 35 points. Monthlydonations were recommended. As a result of comprehensive testing, this patient received: A personalized dietary plan; A personalized supplementation plan aimed at correcting theimbalances identified from thetesting; Chelation therapy; and Recommendations to donateblood order to ferritin fromhis system. (See sidebar, \"A look at ferritin.\") Three months after starting on the recommended regimen, the patienthad another comprehensive bloodtest to re-evaluate his condition.This objective testing showedmarked improvements including: Glucose decreased from 274 to 120; and Hemoglobin A1C dropped four points. These results occurred even though the patient was no longertaking any of his prescriptionmedications. So why did two prescriptions fail to control this patient's diabetes?Most likely, the medications onlyaddressed a portion of the patient'sproblems that were uncoveredthrough \"regular\" blood tests \u2014which would have identified theglucose and cholesterol problems, butnot the high levels of ferritin, uricacid, arsenic, and nickel. This case illustrates that without comprehensive testing, it isimpossible to know what otherfactors may be escalating a situation.

But, a number of behaviors can sabotage your habit of thinking and acting powerfully. Take note of these behaviors and what you can do to eliminate them. Saboteur No. 1: Arguing for failure. When someone offers a solution to a problem, is your first inclination to sayit won't work? And then do you come up with a number ofreasons why it won't work, such as: \"I've done that before\"or \"I don't want to be one of those chiropractors\"? Do you resist opportunities and quash possibilities with doubt before putting any effort into exploring them? Doyou attract team members who have these same attitudes? Solution: Rally for your own success. Successful entrepreneurs do not have a negative mindset. They areopen to possibilities and accept them as being valid untilproven otherwise. Successful individuals also seek to thrust their energy into emulating what has worked for others to get theresults instead of using their energy to prove whysomething won't work. A great internal check system is to follow your gut. Often your instincts say \"yes\" while your mind says \"no.\"Follow your instincts; fight for your success. Saboteur No. 2: Perpendicular vision. Perpendicular vision is limiting. Perpendicular vision happens when youlook down and plot each little step. Those little steps keepyou from taking big strides. Solution: Use parallel vision. Instead of looking down, keep your vision parallel to the ground. Look out. Thinkand act big! Getting caught up in the minutiae of each day is like trying to sprint in quicksand. Keep your eyes and habitsdirected far in front of you and the minutiae of the daycannot take hold. Saboteur No. 3: Fear. Fear paralyzes, yet most fears are unfounded. Fear encroaches on you as a result of weakboundaries and standards. Solution: Stay true to your beliefs and don't let fear lock you up. Establish strict boundaries and standards. They allow you to engage with everyone favorably. When you respectand enforce your own boundaries, you understandrejection is not personal. When a person says, \"No, thankyou,\" or \"Not right now,\" the rejection is not directed atyou; it is merely the person's decision. Successful individuals have been able to overcomePut power into your thinking and acting By Barbara Sturm, DCCHEC10p65.ps 6/4/08 11:53 AM Page .COM VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT great obstacles and setbacks and have learned to deal with rejection inorder to obtain their desired level ofsuccess. Consider, for example, howmany hard hits a successfulquarterback takes. Despite gettingknocked down and banged up, hegets up and keeps going, again andagain. Being fully engaged in life entails getting bruised and fractured attimes, and dealing with unexpectedshifts. You can either choose toembrace these obstacles and learnwhile moving forward or stayknocked down. Staying knockeddown, though, means you won't getahead. Saboteur No. 4: Desire for friction. Do you seek friction? For example: Do you feel there are always \"sides\" to things? Are you againstMDs, insurance companies, yourstaff, or others in your personal life?Do you always want others to\"prove\" things to you? Do youbelieve people are out to takeadvantage of you and others? These beliefs stir up negative feelings, creating friction. Friction isenergy, but it is not a very usefulform of energy for daily living. Solution: Listen before you form opinions and act. Believe in the bestin people, not the worst. Let othersact on their desire to help, support,and be a resource to you. Learn to trust.Thinking positively is not enough. Think positive, but go the next step:Act powerfully. Assess yourself to seeif you are sabotaging your ability tobe powerful. If you are, step out andstep up. You can do it.

But teamwork is not accomplished by merely throwing a group of people together. It requires a number of key elements: The right personnel. The combined talents, skills, and abilities determine the potential of the team. Hiringthe right people is key to running a profitable, successful,stress-free practice. Vision. Vision determines the direction of the team and can only come from you, the team leader. A practicewhose leader has no vision is like a pilot flying a planewithout a destination. Strong work ethic. Work ethic determines how willing the team is to get ready for upcoming marketingevents and to set new patient goals for those events. Astrong, purpose-minded work ethic ensures the team goes tothe event with the right attitude necessary to be successful. Your team's will to win is only as strong as their will to prepare to win. Enthusiasm. When your mission and purpose are strong, your team becomes so focused it can weather anyadversity that comes along. Adversity is a fact of business life. Strong teams weather adversity well because they know where they aregoing and what they are striving to accomplish everyday.They support each other in times of personal trouble. Strong leadership. Everything rises and falls on leadership. If your team is weak, it's because your leadership is weak. If your team's mission and purpose are weak, it'sbecause your mission or purpose is weak, or you have notlearned to communicate your vision and missioneffectively to your practice. When a team has greatleadership, its potential is unlimited. Leadership is not relegated to the \"top dog\" altogether. Each individual \u2014 each CA \u2014 needs to be a leader overhis or her area of authority and responsibility. A championship team needs strong leadership at every post \u2014 the front desk, clinic, financial department, andcommunity-relations area.

The team's overall success and impact are determined by how well each person carries his or her ownportion of the load. A \"one-mule\"team tires quickly, but a three-muleteam can work hard all day andaccomplish great things because theload is shared. Spirit of camaraderie. The three musketeers' slogan of \"one forall, and all for one\" is a pledge ofcommitment to give even their ownlives for the good of the kingdom, ifnecessary. Each team member in the office needs to take ownership of his or herjob and understand how that jobaffects all other jobs in the practice.If the job doesn't get done, eachperson knows the team's success willsuffer, and worse, the results patientsexpect will eventually suffer. Each person also understands the consequences of failing to do the job. Commitment to get along. Team members need to stay on goodterms with one another. Open,honest communication is a must. Confront issues head-on when it becomes apparent there is a lack ofcommitment, lack of responsibility,or poor attitude. Suggestion: To start the day off right (with a good attitude), committo greet each other enthusiasticallyevery morning, with full eye contactand a big smile. Make this a dailyritual.

These three \"P\" wordsare important to leaders, but not as important as a fourth \"P\" word \u2014people. Leading is not managing. It is about people. Managing is about controlling. And as almost everyone knows, it is not possible to control people. You manage things; you lead people. Leading is about people and inspiring them to do what needs to be done.Effective managers are good leaders. So, how is leadership done? How do you inspire qualitywork that is perhaps even more than you asked for? The answer is simple: Acknowledge, recognize, and respect the unique nature and value of each of the peoplewith whom you work. See each person's uniqueness andtreat him according to who he is. See her value andrespect her worth to the team. The answer to leadership is simple, but its implementation is not easy. Be interested in 'growing' your staff. And get involved in their growth as much as they are. Growth can be personal or professional. Some managers/business owners might argue, \"Why should Icare about the growth of my employees? Isn't it enough Igive them a paycheck?\" The most important 'P' word \u2014 people By Monica Wofford CIRCLE 199FREE INFORMATION CHEC10p70.ps 6/4/08 11:57 AM Page 70There is a large gap between \"enough\" and \"great.\" Managing is good enough; leading is great. And leaders take an active interest in developing their employees. However you take interest in your employees' growth, genuine interest will usually gain you respect, dedication,and often loyalty. More importantly, it will develop amore productive, fulfilled, and effective direct report. If in the past you have displayed little or no interest in the growth of the employees on your team, then startsmall. If you are not truly interested in developing youremployees, be aware that missing this step in yourleadership journey may cause you to stumble, or even failas a leader. Genuinely care about your staff. Politicians make strangers feel like close friends. Leaders makeemployees feel like friends. Treat employees with the same interest you would a close friend ona professional level. Make your employees feel as through you care about who theyare, and where they want to go.Give them guidelines, parameters,and tools for the journey. Rememberthe adage: \"People don't care howmuch you know until they knowhow much you care.\" Insincerity,though, is easy to detect, and manypeople react badly to it. On theother hand, if you can \"fake it untilyou make it,\" you may findemployees will positively reinforceyour behavior and showing you carewill become easier for you. Learn to forgive graciously. The people you work with and leadwill make mistakes. Mistakes aremade in varying degrees ofconsequences, yet most can andshould be forgiven. Give your employees guidelines, instructions, rules, and policies.Without knowledge of these things,they will make mistakes. And even if they haveknowledge of them, they may accidentally err. If you forgive their mistakes, the chances are good they will forgive yours. Monica Wofford is a nationally known trainer, author, and coach.

And by 2050, somepredict the U.S. population could be 70percent nonwhite. Diversity creates a challenge for all of us to understand, learn from, and respect one another. Diversity, however, poses other challenges to us as healthcare providers in theareas of touch, language, nonverbal communication, time,and our professional relationship with patients. Touch. When is it all right to touch someone with whom we have a professional relationship? Even if you arethe same gender as your patient, this can present aproblem, especially in some cultures. In some cultures, hugging and touching are accepted and expected. In other cultures, however, casual touchingis considered improper. Understanding when to touch(even in social situations) individuals of other cultures isimportant. Language. Even among people who all speak the same language, communication can be problematic.Naturally, language becomes more of an issue if you havepatients who speak another language at home and useEnglish with halting degrees of proficiency as a secondDiversity and its professional challenges By Angelica Redleaf, DC, and Christine Bond, EdD CIRCLE 172FREE INFORMATIONCHEC10p72.ps 6/4/08 11:58 AM Page 72language, or speak only their own language. Your challenges are many, even if you learn to speak the language of your patients. Words that may have a neutral meaning to you, for instance, may have a positiveor negative connotation to someone whose language isdifferent. Discourse patterns and styles of speaking can also cause misunderstandings. For example: In some cultures, communi- cating directly may be disconcerting, and certain topics maybe inappropriate and even disrespectful to bring up. Nonverbal communication. Facial expressions, gestures, posture, eye contact, and personal space all senddifferent messages, depending upon the patient's culture. For example: In our culture, making eye contact indicates open and honestcommunication, and when eyecontact is averted, it is thought theperson is hiding something. But in other cultures, making eye contact is an intimate gesture and isconsidered rude and disrespectful. Gestures are other potential sources of cultural misunderstanding.A \"goodbye\" wave, for example, maybe a signal to stop. Even worse, theOK sign used to indicate somethingpositive among English speakers maybe considered an obscenity or sign ofworthlessness in other cultures. Time. Americans are time- driven, and keeping an appointmentis almost sacred. But in othercountries, where people have adifferent relationship with the clock,time is not a driving factor. Being\"on time\" may mean arriving 30minutes after a scheduled time. If the majority of your patients come from a culture not driven bytime, consider not schedulingappointments at all. Let people knowyour hours and you will accommodatethem on a first-come, first-served basis. Perception of professionals. The ethnic, socioeconomic, andeducational background of yourpatients can affect how they relate toyou. Some people may automatically accept whatever you say becausetheir background dictates that authority figures are alwaysto be obeyed. Others, however, may challenge you \u2014especially if they perceive they come from a differentsocial or educational background.

When she found she couldmove, she got up. She didn't noticeany particular pain throughout theday, but the next morning, sheexperienced severe pain in her lowerback when she tried to get out of bed. She sank back into her bed, where she remained for the rest of the day. Melanie self-medicated with acetaminophen and some oxycontinpills left over from a root canal. Asthe week progressed, she found shewas able to get out of bed and shegradually increased her activity level.The next week she returned to workat the movie theater where she was amanager. However, she was only ableto work for a few hours before herback pain became intolerable. Several friends encouraged Melanie to seek the help of achiropractor, so she searched in theYellow Pages and made anappointment to see Dr. Gregg Tilson.Until that appointment, she hadnever been to a chiropractor before. Melanie told Dr. Tilson about her accident in the bathtub.

Treatments continued weekly for almost three months, but Melanieexperienced very little improvement.A failure to diagnose properly By Karen MillerLIABILITY MANAGEMENT CASE IN POINT Melanie Richards was a 56-year-old post- menopausal woman who never had backproblems until the day she slipped in her bathtub and landed on her backside. This case provides a number of learning points: When a patient does not respond to treatment as you expect, stop treatment, reassess the situation, and conduct further diagnostic tests. Consider taking spinal x-rays on women older than 50 years who have sudden onset of acute low-back pain, with or without trauma. Consider the unique circumstances of each patient before treatment, and rule out any pathology with x-rays. Always retake unreadable or inconclusive x-rays. Do not hesitate to refer x-rays to a radiologist for interpretation. If you notice any peripheral pathology outside your scope of practice on the films, refer the patient immediately to the appropriate specialist.LEARNING POINTS CIRCLE 170FREE INFORMATIONCHEC10p78.ps 6/4/08 12:01 PM Page 78VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 79She continued to complain of pain, not only in her lower back, but inthe thoracic region as well. Dr. Tilson adjusted her lower back and thoracic spine, and encouragedher to be patient, since strains taketime to heal. Finally, Melanie toldDr. Tilson she was going to seeanother doctor because she wasafraid there was something seriouslywrong and the treatments might bemaking her worse. She said the pain was interfering with her daily activities. Dr. Tilsontold her he would take x-rays to easeher mind about the pathology in herback, but she refused. She consulted an orthopedic surgeon, who took x-rays of her spine.The films revealed a vertebralcompression fracture at T11. An MRIruled out any other spinal abnormalitythat might be causing her pain. The medical doctor ordered bed rest for three days, along with painmedications. He instructed her toresume her normal activities as soonas the pain was under control, andthen to see a physical therapist. Healso told her to stop smoking. Hetold her if she did not respond to thisconservative treatment, he wouldconsider doing a vertebroplasty. She was also referred to her family physician for treatment ofosteoporosis. THE LAWSUIT Melanie filed a lawsuit against Dr. Tilson, alleging he had failed todiagnose a vertebral compressionfracture, failed to refer her to aspecialist for evaluation and follow up,and caused her undue pain andsuffering by delaying proper treatment. Because of her continuing pain, she was unable to perform the physicalexercises that would have strength-ened her back muscles and acceleratedher return to normal functioning. The case was settled in favor of the plaintiff. WHY THE SETTLEMENT? Dr. Tilson did not take an adequate history of Melanie, which would haveshown she was post-menopausal andat risk for osteoporosis. The historywould also have indicated she was asmoker, which contributes toosteoporosis. In addition, Dr. Tilsonfailed to take x-rays, which wouldhave revealed the fracture. With that revelation, he could have recommended appropriatetreatment until the fracturestabilized, and could have counseledher on how to avoid activities thatmight cause further fractures. Instead, Dr. Tilson treated Melanie for an extended period. Although shefailed to show improvement, hecontinued treatment instead ofconducting other diagnostic tests,including x-rays. Gentle chiropractic treatment is not contraindicated for patients withosteoporosis. But, continuingtreatments in the area of a vertebralcompression fracture can causesymptoms to worsen. This can beavoided by taking x-rays of any patientwith osteoporosis, or with risk factorsfor the condition, before treating.

CIRCLE 296FREE INFORMATIONCHEC10p79.ps 12:01 C HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008I am the medical director of a Florida healthcare practice owned by a businessperson whoprovides management services to the practice. I maintain complete care, custody, and control of thecourse of treatment and all decisions relating to officepersonnel and hours of practice. I am paid an hourlysalary and receive a bonus based on productivity. Do yousee any problem with this arrangement? This arrangement will cease to be legal in Floridaafter July 1, 2008. In order to avoid fraudulent billing, the Florida legislature passed F .S. 460.4167, which prevents anyoneother than a Florida-licensed chiropractor or professionalassociation from hiring another chiropractor as either anemployee or independent contractor. Some exceptions to this rule exist, but unless you are related to the businessperson who currently owns thepractice, the exceptions will not apply. You may wish to enter into an arrangement with a businessperson that permits you to purchase the existingpractice and have him or her provide managementservices to the practice. That would leave you free topractice chiropractic, which you do best, and leave thebusinessperson free to provide management services. If you decide to go that route, make sure you have a written agreement that does not violate any fee-splittingor anti-kickback laws.Constraints on business arrangements in Florida By Deborah Green, Esq. Q ALIABILITY MANAGEMENT ASK THE ATTORNEY CIRCLE 185FREE INFORMATION CHEC10p80.ps 6/4/08 12:02 PM Page 80VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 81I just graduated chiropractic school and want to lease space for my new office. I've just been madean offer by the physician/owner of a medical building. He's willing to lease me space in his building for30 percent of my gross income. What do you think? I think you weren't paying attention in practice-management class. Your lease payments may not be based on your practice's income. Your rent must be based on whateveramount is fair market value (FMV) for your community. FMV means the going rate for similar space in your community. For example: A square foot of space in a prime real-estate market could lease for hundreds of dollars,whereas a square foot in a depressed area could go for $15.As realtors say, it all depends on \"location, location,location.\" The fact the space is located in a medical building and you have a strong likelihood of receiving referrals isirrelevant. It is also irrelevant the landlord is a doctor. In order to make sure you are in compliance with the law, your lease should be in writing, for a period of atleast one year, and should set forth the amount of theFMV rent you will pay. To make things easier for you, your landlord may agree to stagger your lease payments. For example: If the FMV rent is $12,000 per year, instead of paying $1,000 permonth, you could structure the lease to pay $500 permonth for the first six months, and then pay $1,500 permonth for the next six months. Such staggered payments will give you time to develop some rollover in your insurance receivables and give yousome breathing space. Deborah Green, Esq., practices law in New York and Florida.

CIRCLE 168FREE INFORMATIONCHEC10p81.ps 6/4/08 12:02 .COM VOL54: I SSUE 10 J UNE 30, 2008The first issue most young DCs struggle with is whether to starttheir own practice, purchase a practice, or work for someone else. Let's sort out the factors involved in this decision and compare options. ATTRIBUTES FOR PRIVATE PRACTICE We'll begin with the decision of whether to work for yourself in a startup or purchase vs. working for someone. The primary decision factors are: Knowledge of business. Graduates who have knowledge of business operations in general and chiropractic practice in particular are good candidates forstarting their own or buying a practice. Confidence in chiropractic abilities. As stated in the StudentDC.com newsletter, chiropractic ability is aprimary factor in a successful practice. Your chiropracticskill set at the time of graduation is an importantconsideration in whether you feel confident in working inyour own practice. Funds available for startup. If you have a co-signer or some money for collateral on a business loan, you are ina good position to pursue a startup or purchase. Many new DCs are concerned they will not have enough money for the required collateral for a startuploan. If this is the case with you, go to the FinancialPreparation section of www.studentDC.com forinformation and insights. If you have a family, you may also find private practice intimidating. You may note that \"marketing ability\" was not listed as a decision factor. The ability to do personal selling andattract and retain patients is important no matter whichoption you choose. Certainly, if you are working for yourself, you'll have to get and keep patients, but even if you are working forsomeone else, you will be required to do patient marketingto earn bonuses and make a decent living. If you have decided to work for yourself, you will need to decide whether to purchase a practice or start your own. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR ALTERNATIVE If you have decided to work for someone else for a few years, you might consider becoming an independentcontractor. In this \"hybrid\" situation, you would be settingup your own practice within another practice. You would set up your own business entity (usually a sole proprietorship) and use the other doctor's facilities,equipment, and staff, but you would do your ownmarketing and develop your own patient base. This optionsaves you money, provides you with a built-in mentor, andallows both doctors the ability to have a colleague seepatients and share the overhead. TO STARTUP OR BUY? The final decision relates to starting your own practice vs. buying a practice. Here are some considerations: student DCcomwww.

Purchase an existing practice if: It is in the right location; You can negotiate an acceptable price; It has good employees in place; You can reliably determine it is generating profits consistently; You can reliably determine the information about the patients andfinancials is correctly stated; and You feel confident you can make a reasonable living at this practicewithin a year or two. In general, if you can find an acceptable practice in the area whereyou want to live, buying an existingpractice will save you time andmoney since the systems, equipment,and patients are in place, and thebusiness has a track record you canuse as a basis for financing. You can generally make a profit faster by purchasing a practice thanby starting one \u2014 if you can get itfor a reasonable price.
