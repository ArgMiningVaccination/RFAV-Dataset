However, the effectiveness of any dose over the recommended daily allowance has generated debate and controversy in medical, research, and alternative medicine fields.

Common side effects from too much vitamin C include diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and stomach cramps.

In addition to dietary changes, they recommend supplementing with up to 10 grams a day of vitamin C for a \"natural anti-histamine\" effect. However, [NYU Langone Medical Center reports, \"Vitamin C](http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=21414) is often suggested as a treatment for allergies, but the research results are preliminary and somewhat contradictory.\" Clinical studies on the effectiveness of high doses of vitamin C have been conducted for decades on a wide range of health issues including cardiac health, cancer, immune functions, AIDs, life-span, infections, and diabetes.
