We need to know you're here, and if applicable, update your patient information to keep it current. Bring with you: If you've been sent to the hospital from your physician's office, you must register before being seen in the Emergency Services department. If your physician has sent you to the hospital to be admitted to any other department, keep in mind that we need orders from him or her before that admission can be completed. If you or a loved one is arriving by ambulance, the clerk can handle your admission, or a family member can provide us with the information we need. While you're in the hospital, your care may be coordinated by a hospitalist, a physician who specializes in the care of hospitalized patients. St. Anne Hospital has a team of hospitalists to provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Your hospitalist will work closely with your personal doctor to ensure your care is coordinated and your provider will be fully informed about your progress during your hospital stay. If you have an appointed time for a test or procedure, please arrive 15 minutes early or as instructed by the scheduling staff in order to avoid delays. If you'll be going home following a procedure, you'll need to arrange for someone to drive you home. If staying overnight, you may choose to bring your own toiletries, but please leave valuable items (jewelry, cash, credit cards, etc.) at home. Please be prepared to list all medications and herbal supplements you take as well as previous surgeries, resulting complications and problems related to an anesthesia, medications or allergies. Each patient room has a telephone and TV. There is no charge for local calls; however, the hospital does not provide free long-distance phone service. All long-distance calls from our patients' rooms must be collect or charged to the caller's home phone number or credit card. Cell phones may be used inside the hospital so long as their use does not disrupt patient care or the care environment. "}
