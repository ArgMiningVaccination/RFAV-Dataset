Do you find it impossible to relax because you can't stop yourself from endlessly rehashing every decision, action, and thought? Do you have difficulty quieting your churning thoughts to focus on the task at hand? Does your mind kick into high gear just as you attempt to sleep and interrupt your rest with constant thoughts of \"what if\" and \"if only\"? Although everyone experiences stress, women can face a unique set of challenges and responsibilities that raise their stress levels well past those of their male counterparts. If you're like a lot of women, you're juggling about a million responsibilities and it requires an immense amount of effort and thought to keep them all afloat. Meditation can help you be in the present, help you focus, and improve your mood. \"Meditation is the process of being fully present and paying attention to the present moment. It helps heighten awareness of your emotions, thoughts, and experiences through techniques like quiet contemplation, inspirational readings, prayer, and self-reflection,\" according to [Glen Komatsu, M.D., chief medical officer](https://www.instituteforhumancaring.org/About-Us/Our-Team.aspx), TrinityCare Hospice and Providence Southern California Regional Palliative Care. \"The point of mindful practices is to ground us in the present moment\u2014to be fully present in the here and now. It's the anti-multitask,\" said Dr. Komatsu. \"Mindfulness meditation changes the brain's anatomy and structure in a positive way, thickening areas of the brain that govern compassion and happiness while downregulating areas that govern the fight-or-flight response.\" For women struggling for balance among all the components of their life, meditation can be a game-changer. \"We know that if you allow it, mindfulness works,\" said Dr. Komatsu.
