Unfortunately, we do not offer free samples. However, the majority of our Balance Me collection is available to buy in travel sizes so you can try our range before committing to buy full sized product. ARE BALANCE ME PRODUCTS NATURAL? Lots of products claim to be 'natural' and buzz words like 'eco-friendly', 'safe', and 'non-toxic' can cover a multitude of sins. Even parabens are 'natural' in so much as they are a by-product of the petroleum industry and that comes from the world's natural resources. Because it's 'natural' it doesn't make it good for your skin, or for the world. At Balance Me we are 'Honestly Natural'. When we say 'natural' we mean sustainable, renewable ingredients that are kind to your skin and to the earth. We feature the percentage natural on all our labels. Those below 100% are preserved with Ecocert approved nature identical complex that contains Benzyl Alcohol and Dehydroacetic Acid. WHY IS BALANCE ME NOT ORGANIC? If a brand has 10% organic ingredients, they can use the word 'organic' in their advertising. We could, therefore, claim we are organic as we use some organic ingredients in our product formulations. But for a skincare product to be truly organic, the base carrier ingredient needs to be oil. This means that some water-based ingredients that are more active, cannot be used and therefore the results and benefits of the products would be limited. We prefer to be known as a chemical free brand who uses plant-based active ingredients to deliver results rather than being an organic brand. ARE YOUR ESSENTIAL OILS PURE? Yes, we use 100% pure essential oils that are authentic and non-adulterated from trusted sources. We use high-grade essentials oils and where appropriate cold-pressed extraction. We never use harsh solvent extraction methods. DO YOUR PRODUCTS CONTAIN PALM OIL? We do use some ingredients derived from palm oil; however we only use ingredients that have come from suppliers of RSPO (Round Table of Sustainable Palm Oil). They are working hard to ensure that palm plantations are managed properly and are free from corruption to stop any further unnecessary rain forests being cut down. The supply of palm oil is now manageable and therefore there is no reason not to use it at this stage. Looking for another plant to obtain these oils from would only result in other areas of the earth being deforested to grow new plantations. The fact that these alternative plants yield on a fraction of the oils palm can produce doesn't make this an attractive and sustainable option. ARE BALANCE ME PRODUCTS PARABEN FREE? Yes, all our products are paraben free. We use an Ecocert approved preservative system containing Benzyl Alcohol and Dehydroacetic Acid. We are extremely dedicated to using only the finest ingredients that solve skin concerns without creating others and would not use anything we did not believe in. ARE YOUR PRODUCTS VEGAN FRIENDLY? Most of our products are suitable for Vegans and are clearly labelled. The exceptions are the following products that contain beeswax and lanolin: Super Moisturising Hand Cream, Stellar Balm, Cleanse & Smooth Face Balm. DO YOU TEST ON ANIMALS? We have never, and will never, test on animals and we do not distribute to countries where testing is obligatory. We do not source ingredients from companies which do test on animals. WHAT IS THE SHELF LIFE OF BALANCE ME PRODUCTS? Our products have a shelf life of 3 years if unopened. Once the product has been opened it has a shelf life of 6 months. Please refer to the expiration symbol on each product as it will detail the shelf life of each product once it has been opened. If you have any queries regarding your product, please contact our team at [customercare@balanceme.com](mailto:customercare@balanceme.com) WHAT PRESERVATIVES DO YOUR PRODUCTS CONTAIN? We use a gentle, nature identical preservative combination approved by Ecocert: Benzyl Alcohol and Dehydroacetic Acid. We are extremely dedicated to using only the finest ingredients that solve skin concerns without creating others and would not use anything that we did not believe in. ARE BALANCE ME PRODUCTS SAFE FOR PEOPLE WITH NUT ALLERGIES? Firstly, we would like to assure you that nut-based oils cannot be absorbed into the blood stream through the skin. However, if you are feeling unsure, we would always recommend that you check the ingredients to identify which products contain nut-based oils. We would always recommend consulting your doctor before using any products with nut-based oils in them if you have a nut allergy. DO YOUR PRODUCTS CONTAIN GLUTEN? A lot of our products contain Vitamin E which can come from wheat or soy sources and so unfortunately may contain gluten. Please check the ingredients carefully if you have an allergy. The following products are gluten free: Super Firming Body Oil, Wake Up Lotion, Pure Skin Face Wash, Flash Cleanse Micellar Water, Congested Skin Serum, Balancing Face Moisturiser. ARE BALANCE ME PRODUCTS NON-COMEDOGENIC? We do not test our products specifically for this condition, but we have no reason to believe our products are. We have never received complaints that our products clog pores from our Balance Me Insiders or from our customers. DO YOUR PRODUCTS REMOVE MAKE-UP? Yes, all our cleansers remove make-up and are gentle enough to remove eye make-up. You can find detailed information and suggested uses for each of our products on their respective product pages. We advise you to shut your eyes when applying products and if any product goes into your eyes, rinse thoroughly with warm water. SHOULD I USE A WASH CLOTH? A 100% cotton cloth is provided with our Cleanse and Smooth Face Balm. For all our other cleansers we recommend using a face cloth or cotton pads. WHERE ARE YOUR PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED? We proudly make all our products in the UK. Other Queries? If none of the above has answered your query please email us "}
