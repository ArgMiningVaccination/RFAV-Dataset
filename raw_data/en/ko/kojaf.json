Recover Chiro Care Services We provide advanced spinal correction utilizing state of the art chiropractic techniques. Never in the history of chiropractic have we been able to provide the level of help and expertise that now exists. These newer correction methods are even safer, more comfortable and more effective than ever before. Our Doctors of Chiropractic have years of training and experience in spinal adjustment. Decompression Traction Spinal decompression therapy is a non-surgical, pain-free approach effectively treating back and neck pain, sciatica, stenosis, and degenerative disc disease. It uses a computer-aided traction table to gently stretch the spine, creating a vacuum in the discs. This action pulls disc material back into place, relieving pinched nerves, and invites essential nutrients and oxygen for optimal healing. Unlike surgical alternatives such as laminectomy and microdiscectomy, this method bears no risks like infection, drug interactions or anesthesia, and promises minimal downtime with lasting symptom resolution. Corrective Exercise We teach our patients special \"blueprint\" exercises designed just for them to help strengthen and correct their own unique problem. These exercises can be performed in the comfort of your own home and can improve the effectiveness of your spinal correction by as much as 30-40%. In addition to skeletal misalignment, muscles and connective tissues can be out of place or strained by improper alignment and use. Specific exercises and stretches can help your body stay in balance and in health. Lifestyle Advice We believe in \"coaching\" our patients to modify certain activities to prevent exacerbating their health conditions. Our aim is to enable everyone to enjoy their favorite activities through a fulfilling, healthy lifestyle. Recognizing each patient's individuality, we collaborate to attain comprehensive health and wellness.
