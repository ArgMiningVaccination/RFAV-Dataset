[Shanghai Press](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/555292292/Shanghai-Press) Reviews for Practical Guide to Cupping Therapy 1 rating1 review - Rating: 5 Practical Guide to Cupping Therapy - Zhongchao Wu CHAPTER ONE Benefits and Attentions of Cupping Therapy With a history of thousands of years in China, cupping therapy is an important part of the Traditional Chinese Medicine, and is widely used in the medicine, surgery, gynecology, dermatology, ENT, and other departments through promotion by modern medicine, alleviating and even preventing and treating more than a hundred common diseases. However, cupping cannot be performed under all conditions. Techniques should be followed to take effect. Therefore, before cupping, one should not only understand its advantages and effects, but also know how to perform it in a scientific and effective manner, so that one can apply appropriate techniques to maximize the effects of cupping. 1. Benefits of Cupping Therapy Cupping therapy is applicable to a wide range of symptoms, and has certain effects on a variety of diseases, which can be alleviated and treated by such methods as acupuncture, massage, traditional Chinese treatment, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. In particular, it has good effects on various painful diseases, soft tissue injuries, acute and chronic inflammations, syndrome of wind-cold dampness arthralgia, and symptoms resulting from dysfunction of internal organs and obstruction of channels. Research has found that through the suction of the skin, pores, meridians, and acupoints, cupping can guide the transport and distribution of qi in the body, promote qi and blood in meridians, nourish viscera, organs, and tissues, warm the body, stimulate the functions of weak viscera, smoothen meridians, adjust the yin and yang balance of the organism, and also adjust qi and blood, thus achieving the purpose of improving health and warding off illness. The negative pressure generated in the cup during cupping therapy can cause local capillary congestion and even rupture, rupture of red blood cells, epidermal blood stasis, and the phenomenon of hemolysis, and then produce a group of histamine and histamine-like substances which will flow all over the body with body fluid, stimulating organs, strengthening their functions and activities, and enhancing resistance of the body. Stimulation of negative pressure can cause dilation of local blood vessels, promote local blood circulation, improve the state of congestion, strengthen metabolism, change the status of local tissue nutrition, enhance permeability of vascular wall and leukocyte phagocytosis activities, and strengthen the body's physical fitness and immune capacity. According to modern medicine, the suction of pressure in the cup to local parts of the body can speed up blood and lymph circulation, promote gastrointestinal peristalsis, improve digestion functions, as well as promote and accelerate the muscles and viscera to excrete and eliminate metabolites. After long-term practice, cupping therapy, which developed among common folks, has formed such characteristics as varied tools, varied techniques, and wide applicable parts of the body. Therefore, it can alleviate increasing number of diseases with the expansion of its scope of indications. Most diseases of the internal medicine, gynecology, traumatology, surgery, dermatology, ENT, and other departments can be alleviated by applying cupping therapy with good curative effects. In summary, the cupping therapy has advantages as follows: Mechanical stimulation: During cupping, the negative pressure in the cup can cause rupture of local capillaries to produce the phenomenon of autolysis, stimulate the body's microcirculation system, improve local blood circulation, and strengthen the body's protection and immune functions, thereby forming an optimal stimulation. Warm stimulation: During cupping, the heating action of the cup can promote the expansion of local blood vessels, increase blood flow, and speed up blood circulation, thus improving the blood supply and nutrient supply to the skin, promoting metabolism, and improving the patient conditions and restoring their health. Anti-inflammation and relieving pain: Cupping can promote local blood circulation. Strengthened local blood circulation can improve metabolism of inflammatory exudate and pain factors at local lesion, and further decrease or eliminate their stimulation to nerve endings, thereby eliminating inflammation, relieving pain and achieving the purpose of treatment. Detoxification: During cupping, the negative pressure in the cup can cause rupture of local blood vessels, thus directly discharging local accumulation of metabolic wastes, and at the same time, improving respiration of the skin, which is conducive to the excretion and detoxification of sweat glands and sebaceous glands, and increasing metabolism in human bodies. Regulating the immune function: Research has found that cupping can increase the total number of white blood cells, and at the same time, improve the phagocytic ability of white blood cells as the -globulin and -globulin in blood increase obviously under the effect of mechanical stimulation, bleeding and congestion, thus greatly increasing the body's defense immunity. Two-way optimal regulative effect: Cupping optimal regulation. Take cupping at Zhongwan point as an example, when the stomach and intestine are inhibited, cupping can excite the functions of stomach and intestine. When they are excited, cupping can inhibit their functions. Another example is cupping at Tianshu point, when constipation occurs, cupping helps relieve constipation. When diarrhea occurs, cupping can stop diarrhea. The two-way optimal regulative effect of cupping therapy is consistent with the improvement of disease. 2. Considerations and Taboos of Cupping Therapy During the cupping process, many aspects need to be considered, like cupping environment, correct cupping methods, cupping time, etc., which all influence the effects of cupping. Chapter Two will describe in detail the whole process from pre-cupping preparation to post-cupping observation of cupping marks, as well as the specific methods. While learning correct cupping methods, you should also be familiar with your own conditions, and clearly know the time when it is not suitable for cupping, so as to avoid adverse consequences. Below are the points of consideration and taboos of cupping, which will guide you to make full preparation before cupping. Attentions During cupping, keep the room warm, in case the patient catches cold. Do not practice cupping at the same area for a second time before the marks of the first cupping disappear. During cupping, the patient should try not to move so the cups will stay on. When several cups are used at the same time, the cups should not be placed too close to each other to prevent collision of cups or the stretching of the skin. Small cups and a small number of cups should be used for initial recipients and the weak and elderly people. Feeling warm, sore, tight, and sleepy during cupping is a normal phenomenon. Take off the cups if you feel obvious pain or discomfort, and perform cupping again after a short break depending on your situation. During cupping, be careful not to use too much alcohol, not to dip alcohol on the mouth of the cup to prevent the skin from being burned. Also pay attention to avoid the skin from being burned by boiling water and steam. For pricking cupping, disinfect the cupping tools strictly to prevent infection. Taboos Before cupping, first understand your own status to avoid the conditions where cupping should be contraindicated. Cupping should be prohibited or applied with caution for those who have any of the following circumstances: Cupping should not be applied to patients during the outbreak of systemic severe convulsions or epilepsy. Cupping is contraindicated for those with mental disorder or during outbreak of mental illness, those who bleed easily, or suffer hemorrhagic diseases such as allergic purpura, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemophilia, leukemia, and positive results of capillary tests, and those with a large range of skin diseases, skin ulceration, or severe allergic skin. Cupping should not be applied to patients with malignant tumors, because it will promote tumor spread and metastasis. During pregnancy, to avoid miscarriage or discomfort, cupping should not be performed on lumbosacral region, lower abdomen and nipples. Cupping is contraindicated for patients with severe heart failure, those with kidney illness experiencing kidney functional failure, and those with liver illness experiencing ascites due to cirrhosis and general dropsy. Cupping should be performed on thickly muscled areas with thick subcutaneous fat and less hair. Cupping should not be applied to body surface with large blood vessels, position of apex beat, delicate skin, position with obvious blood vessels, scars, and nose, eyes, lips, bone protrusion, and loose skin or skin with large wrinkles. However, the taboos and unsuitable areas of cupping therapy are not absolute. Those who have used this therapy to alleviate edema, mental illness, high fever, active tuberculosis and other diseases have not experienced adverse reactions, but have achieved very good results. No adverse reactions appear on some people when this therapy is performed on such areas as nipples, portion of apex beat, nose, ears, and external genitalia and anus. It should be determined depending on the actual case as application of cupping therapy in conjunction with other therapies also does good to appropriate indications, or can improve the curative effects. However, try to avoid cupping in case of the contraindications mentioned above during clinical applications. Be careful if the therapy must be performed. CHAPTER TWO Methods of Cupping Therapy Cupping is easy to operate and you can complete it easily on your own as long as you have fully prepared all necessary tools and abide by the correct cupping techniques. In the order of before, during and after cupping, this chapter describes in detail from the cupping tools to each link of operation methods in the cupping process, and the treatment after cupping to help you operate efficiently in the whole process. 1. Process of Cupping Therapy Before cupping, prepare all necessary tools such as cups, alcohol, cotton balls, pincers, and lighters per your own needs. In addition, appropriate tools should be prepared for some special cupping methods, for example, the kettle and the towel for water cupping, Chinese medicines, pot, etc., for herbal cupping. Set out different cups for the different positions during cupping. In general principle, the position chosen should make the patient feel comfortable, also fully expose the cupping areas to facilitate the operation. The number and size of cups should be subject to the severity of disease, physical strength, size of the affected area, age, skin elasticity, etc. Cups should be placed on smooth parts of the skin. Avoid wrinkles and protrusions, especially those areas with prominent bones. The most suitable areas for cupping are those with thick muscle fat layers and fewer blood vessels. Large cups can be used on the flat and muscular areas with thick subcutaneous fat, while small cups can be used on those narrow areas with thinner muscles and less subcutaneous fat (fig. 1). Small rubber cups or suction cups can be applied to some special areas, for example, Sibai, Hegu, and Taichong points. To remove cups, tilt the cup with one hand, and press the skin opposite to the cup with the other hand to form a gap, where the air will flow into the cup. Now, the cup will fall off because suction force disappears immediately. Cupping generally lasts for 10-15 minutes. It can be adjusted based on the specific conditions of the patients. In general, it lasts preferably long in winter when it is dry, but short in summer when it is damp. Fig. 1 A small-size cup should be used at hand joints. Be aware of infection after cupping. Normal skin reactions after cupping generally do not need special treatment, but blisters and other conditions, if present, should be treated promptly to prevent infection. Use antibiotics in the event of infection. After cupping, cupping tools should be cleaned and disinfected in due time and kept properly. Bamboo cups should be placed in a cool and dry place and avoid exposure to sunshine. 2. Commonly Used Tools The most important tools for cupping are cups. We can often see cupping therapists using different cups, for example, bamboo cups, glass cups, ceramic cups, metal cups, etc. Readers who are beginning to experiment with cupping may choose suction cups, and then gradually learn and practice the operation methods with other tools. When cupping at home, people may also use some daily necessities which can easily generate suction force. In addition, auxiliary tools are also essential, for example, combustion sources for fire cupping, carriers for burning such as alcohol and cotton. Below are brief introductions to commonly-used tools. Glass cup, a more commonly used tool at present, is made of heat-resistant glass, and has a large cavity but a small mouth, and a slightly outward mouth edge. Glass cups can be divided into different models according to the mouth diameter and size of cavity. Their advantages include pleasant shape, clarity and transparency, being easy to observe the changes of skins, and easy to grasp the degree of congestion, blood stasis and bleeding, especially suitable for pricking-bloodletting cupping and moving cupping methods. Their disadvantages are marked by fragility, quick to heat, and low burn threshold (fig. 2). Fig. 2 Pleasant-looking glass cups are commenly used since they make it convenient for the operator to observe skin changes. Bamboo cups are made of bamboo. Choose a solid and mature old bamboo, cut it at the joints, and use the end with joint as the bottom and the other end without joint as the mouth. Cut off the old skin, and make a cylindrical and waist-drum-shaped bamboo tube with slightly thick middle part and two slightly slim ends. The bottom and mouth of the bamboo tube should be flat, and its periphery should be smooth, 8-10 cm in length. Bamboo cups have advantages including lightness, durability, resistance to break, capability of absorbing liquid medicine, readily available materials, and convenience to produce. Their disadvantages mainly include proneness to dry, crack, leak, and opaque, and difficulty to observe the changes in skin color and bleeding (fig. 3). Fig. 3 Easily-made bamboo cups can absorb medicinal liquid. Ceramic cup is a general term for pottery cup and porcelain cup. The cups are more common in rural areas in northern China. Made of fired clay painted with black or yellow glaze, they are characterized by flat mouth and bottom, smooth inside and outside, slightly large middle, two slightly small ends, porcelain drum shape, appropriate thickness, and smooth mouth. Their advantages include low cost, big suction force, easy maintenance, and convenient to disinfect. Their disadvantages are marked by heaviness, fragility, difficult to carry, and inability to observe the changes of skin color within the cups (fig. 4). Fig. 4 It is not convenient to carry pottery cups and difficult to observe skin changes. Suction cup is a relatively modern cupping set consisting of vacuum cups, pistol grip hand pump, connecting pipes, etc., which forms negative pressure inside the cup using the mechanical principles. The vacuum cup body is transparent, making it easy to observe the changes of skin in the cup. Different from the traditional tools, the suction cups do not create negative pressure by burning, and are safer and more convenient, but their drawbacks are marked by no sense of warmth and inability to move (fig. 5). Fig. 5 The vacuum cups are more modern. Their transparency makes it convenient for the operator to observe skin changes. In addition to those cups described above, people will also use readily available alternative cupping tools during health care at home. These tools are jointly characterized by: small mouth and large cavity, flat and smooth mouth, no hurt to skin, heat-resistant materials with no risk to burn the skin, and capability of producing certain suction force. Therefore, teacups, small bowls, glass bottles, medicine bottles, and other daily necessities which satisfy these conditions can be used to substitute special cupping tools. Of course, if the conditions permit, better results can be achieved by using special cupping tools. The demonstrations in this book use transparent glass cups to help observe the skin conditions in the cups, and make the display of gestures more visible. Apart from the cupping tools described above, to obtain good cupping effects, auxiliary tools can be prepared based on personal needs, including materials for burning, products for disinfection and cleaning, needles, lubricants, scald ointment, etc. For example, you can prepare medical alcohol, paper, alcohol cotton balls, absorbent cotton pads, three-edged needles, plum-blossom needles, Vaseline, safflower oil (lubricants), pincers, haemostatic forceps, etc. (fig. 6). Fig. 6 Auxiliary tools. Selection of Cup Sizes Cups are generally divided into large, medium, and small sizes, adaptable to different people and targeted areas. So, how do you determine an appropriate size? These are the general methods: Depending on the characteristics of the body parts to be worked on: Large-size cups can be used on flat and muscular parts with thick subcutaneous fat, such as the chest, back, waist, abdomen, buttocks, and thighs; medium-size cups can be used on such areas as neck, shoulders, upper arms, front arms, and lower legs; and small-size cups can be used on those parts with rugged bones and weak muscles and fat, such as joints, head and face, hands and feet. Depending on the patient's physical conditions: Use large-size cups for strong and fat patients; and use small-size ones for weak, thin patients and old people. Depending on the patient's conditions: Use large-size cups or use several cups jointly for seriously ill patients or patients with greater extent of lesion; and use small-size cups or single cup for mildly ill patients or patients with a small extent of lesion. 3. Methods of Placing Cups Placing cups is a process of evacuating the air from the cups to produce negative pressure, and sucking them onto the skin. Most of the cupping techniques evacuate the air by using a flame to heat the cup, thereby creating negative pressure within the cup before sucking the cup onto the skin. Therefore, this method of cupping is called fire cupping. Besides flame, the air can also be evacuated by using steam to generate heat, using pistol grip hand pump of the suction cup, and other methods. Below are the introductions to several most commonly used methods of placing cups. After learning these techniques of placing cups and their respective characteristics, you may choose the most suitable one or more from them. Flash-Fire Cupping During operation, use a pair of haemostatic forceps to hold a 95% alcohol cotton ball, ignite and insert the cotton ball into the cup to rotate one or two seconds, and then after quickly taking out the cotton ball, place the mouth of the cup onto the appropriate body part. Be careful not to bake the cup mouth, so as not to burn the skin. Several more cups can be prepared so that quick replacement is possible if the mouth of the cup heats up. This method is applicable to various positions and cupping methods, and is the most "}
