The term 'resilience' has been used and heavily debated in the global hea lth sector since the W est African Ebola outbreak in 2014, which has exposed serious inadequacies of international and national institutions in health systems responding to shocks . Albeit a consensus on the growing significance of resilience in improving responses to system leve l shocks such as that from the COVID -19 pandemic, a plethora of research thus far has remained mostly at a theoretical level with the discussions focusing on definitions, concepts, and principles . The unanimous voice from health system researchers echo es these concerns and recommends that research gaps should be filled through more applied research rooted in real life cases. This thesis is a timely response to this collective call for applied research in the field of health system resilience. This research highlight s the vital role of resilient health systems in practical terms to prepare countries for future shocks, and bring out its crucial effect in bridging the disparate health and development agenda in order to address the nexus between humanitarian ai d and development cooperation. The empirical evidence based on countries' experiences responding to v arious shocks may illuminate valuable insight for practitioners and policy -makers to generate resilience - enhancing strategies for their own contexts. Aim and objectives The overarching aim of this doctoral research is to contribute to the health system resilience literature by bridging the gap between concept and practice of resilience in the health system through interrogating empirical evidence of low - and middle - income contexts. The specific objectives are: 1. To synthesize evidence on key features of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries 2. To improve the understanding of the characteristics of health system resilience based on a national response to a crisis and how countries can improve resilience in their health care systems 3. To explore the perspective of NGOs dealing with unexpected shock s on health systems and to reflect 12 on the practical implications of resilience for stakeholders in global health cooperation Methods In order to bridge the gap between the concept and practice of resilience in health systems, we employed methodologies th at may best capture the complex nature of the topic: a systematic review and qualitative approaches. The first study (Objective I) was addressed by a systematic review synthesizing key features of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countri es. It employed a best -fit framework synthesis approach, often used in a rapid evidence synthesis of qualitative data to generate context -specific models or programme theories that have potential relevance for policy -makers and field practitioners . We identified a best -fitting existing model of resilient health system s framework as an a priori framework to map and code the data from the included studies . The second and third objectives were tackled through qualitative studies that were based on semi -structured in -depth interviews with representatives of international organisations and non -governmental organisations (NGOs) in Myanmar (Objective II) and representatives of Swiss -based NGOs with on -going health project engagements in low - and middle - income countries (Objective III). The interviews were guided by semi -structured interview guides designed to explore the characteristics of resilience that have been salient or absent in responding to the crises and the different roles key stakeholders may ass ume to build resilience. Triangulation through supplementary data such as reports, event pictures and media clips provided by the participants was used to partially offset any potential recall bias due to the time gap between the actual event and data coll ection periods. Results and discussion Objective I) To synthesize evidence on key features of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries Empirical evidence of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries were reviewed by synthesizing the key features of resilient health systems. We proposed a refined conceptual framework for health system resilience that conceptually tracks the journey from the health system shock to the five attribu tes of the a priori themes. The five new themes, namely, \"realigned relationships,' 'foresight,' 'motivation,' 'emergency preparedness,' and 'change identified as the foundations of resilience , which can serve as critical inputs for unlocking the five resilience attributes from the a priori framework . Social capital, which comprises of trust, shared vision, and collaboration, have been found to be common to both health system strengthening and resilient responses to crises, hence proving pivotal in both cri ses and calm. The review prompted low - and middle - income countries to consider 13 building the foundations of resilience as a priority to better prepare for future shocks. Objective II) To improve the understanding of the characteristics of health system resilience based on a national response to a crisis and how countries can improve resilience in their health care systems Our previously developed framework on health syste m resilience was applied to examine the characteristics of resilience that have been salient or absent in Myanmar's response to Cyclone Nargis in 2008 . Strong social capital and motivation stemming from its deep -rooted cultural and religious networks were found as Myanmar's greatest assets that filled major gaps in the system. In contrast, its postcolonial and military legacy posed barriers towards investing in building its long -term foundations for resilience. In Myanmar's case, it can leverage its assets (social capital and motivation) as opportunities to achieve long -term health goals towards resilience. On a more practical level, Myanmar can invest on building its long -term infrastructures in remote areas, prioritise in human resource preparedness and redesign its institutions and organisational structures to serve its evolving purposes and to prepare for future shocks. Objective III) To explore the perspectives of NGOs dealing with unexpected shocks on health systems and to reflect on the practical implications of resilience for stakeholders in global health cooperation We examined how and to what extent Swiss -based NGO s with a focus on global health have dealt with unexpected shocks in the health systems of their partner countries and reflected upon the practical implications of resilience in development cooperation. We found that health system resilience is a collectiv e endeavour and a result of many stakeholders' consistent and targeted investments. These investments open up new opportunities to seek innovative solutions and to keep diverse actors in global health accountable. Strong governance, a bi -directional knowle dge exchange and the focus on leveraging science for impact can draw greater potential for resilience in the health systems. In this regard, the governments and the NGOs have unique points of contributions to target the strongest determinant of resilience, which was found as the degree of investments made for building long -term infrastructures and human resource development which are well -functioning prior to any crises. Conclusion The COVID -19 pandemic has been a wake -up call for all health systems to build and maintain core health system functions in order to prepare for, manage, and learn from disruptions. The following recommendations 14 outline what health system actors can do to improve resilience in the health systems : 1) Emergency preparedness: ensure that an emergency preparedness strategy and plan are built into the national health system at all levels Having an emergency preparedness strategy built into the national health system at all levels improves the chances t hat the strategies can be translated into action when required. The logical step for national level preparedness would be then to better embed the International Health Regulations ( IHR) into health systems. There should be stronger accountability towards i mproving countries' IHR core capacities through the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) exercise and country ownership is critical for the assessment results to align with its national action plan's pr iorities, budgets and targets. 2) Realigned relationships : establish strategic alliances through effective coordination mechanisms and public engagements An effective coordination mechanism with clearly established roles and decision -making protocols is a critical first step to harmonise divergent actors amidst emergency responses. A resilient health system responds to disruptions by establishing and renewing partnerships and alliances according to shared goals and visions. Engaging non -state actors in a systematic way was proven critical not only to disseminate key information but also to gain trust and legitimacy by involving citizens, communities and the private sector in the decision making processes. 3) Foresight: invest in the long -term slow variables of the health system infrastructure and human resources Building resilience is more than preparedness. Health system actors ought to take a long -term perspective, investing in building robust infrastructure over time and cultivating a cadre of health professionals that can function in both crisis and calm. Count ries ought to take a broader view of the health workforce and to make investments based on modelling and projections rather than from immediate surge capacity needs. 4) Motivation: foster strong political will and personal commitment One approach to encourage good political leadership can be to keep politicians accountable for their capacity to protect the health of their population through the use of participatory social media and data sharing. Establishing independent task force teams and participat ory consensus building forums can distribute power and leadership and share responsibility within the bu reaucratic system. D onors and NGOs ought to display a 15 deeper sense of humility and patience on first restoring the fabric of legitimacy in the communiti es and creating a platform where different actors can collaborate based on trust. 5) Change management: integrate new initiatives and reforms into the system prior to the crises Various new initiatives can build resilience when they have been well -integrated prior to any crisis . Well - adapted and scaled -up digital innovations can support the flexibility required in times of shocks. This is an area where the NGOs and international o rganisations can make unique contributions to leverage science for impact . It is important, however, to build on the unique contextual strengths of the country's health system structures in order for any new initiative to be contextualised and sustained. 16 CHAPTER 1 Introduction 17 1 Introduction 1.1 Increasing relevance of resilience in health systems Resilience is perhaps one of the most overused terms in the aftermath of a major pandemic such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19) without clarity of its scope of meaning, key facets and implications. There appears to be a consensus on the growing significance of resilience in improving system levels shocks, but research thus far has remained mostly at a theoretical level. Health systems have experienced major shocks and will continue to encounter various forms of disruptions as observed in the increased frequency and intensity of catastrophic events such as extreme weather events, natural disasters, political conflicts and pandemics. The term 'resilience' has been actively used and heavily debated in the global health sector since the West African Ebola outbreak i n 2014, which has exposed serious inadequacies of international and national institutions in responding to health system shocks (Haldane et al., 2017) . This failed initial response to the Ebola crisis facilitated joint respon ses by academia, think tanks and civil society groups to flag possible areas of systemic reform (Moon et al., 2015) and prompted publications on how best to characterise and measure resilience in health systems in or der to better prepare for the next crisis (Kruk et al., 2015) , (Kruk et al., 2017) . The theme of the Fo urth Global Symposium on Health Systems Research held in 2016, ' Resilient and responsive health systems for a changing world, ' highlighted the growing salience of resilience in development and health systems discourses. Resilient and responsive health syst ems have started to be regarded as a critical prerequisite to achieving broader health goals, in particular, Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Health Systems Research, 2016) , (Kutzin and Sparkes, 2016) . COVID -19 has wreaked havoc across the world but also reignited the prominence of resilience in health systems. Lessons generated from different countries and continents have been shared to underscore key domains of the health system that characterise highly effect ive national responses (Haldane et al., 2021) . Various international o rganisations have circulated consolidated evidence, summarising vital concepts, strategies and guidance for policy makers and practitioners to incorporate resilience into planning and policy reforms (Thomas et al., 2020) , (Rentschler et al., 2021) , (World Health Organization, 2021) . The renewed 18 focus on resilient health systems have also been evident in high income countries as Lancet Regional Health - Europe has released its special series and an accompanied webinar titled, ' Rebuilding resilient health systems for Europe .' There appears to be a consensus that catastrophic events mak e us re -evaluate our systemic strengths and weaknesses and create opportunities for reform (Lancet, 2021) . The intriguing aspect of the COVID -19 pandemic was that even the so -called high -performing health systems were overstretched to adapt, struggling with the basic supply of personal pr otective equipment and failing to reach the public with effective and accurate risk communication strategies (Legido -Quigley et al., 2020) . Not only does t his question the reliability of how health systems have been traditionally assessed but also calls for new resilience -specific measures based on its capacity to adapt, absorb, and transform in the event of a major shock (El Bcheraoui et al., 2020) . One of the main findings from the Ebola crisis in 2014 -2016 was that effective epidemic management drew more from increased community engagement and community -based interventions rather than from the dependence on infrastructure and clinical surveillance provided by the international community (Kutalek et al., 2015) , (Fallah et al., 2016) , (Kirsch et al., 2017) . Community resilience, encompassing leadership and social capital, had been the underlying source of a ccelerating recovery in the case of Liberia (Alonge et al., 2019) . The entry point to health system resilience, therefore, may be highly contextual. There is no doubt that successful interventions of any kind comes from contextualised and well -tailored solutions. It is vital that differing concepts of health system resil ience ought to be empirically tested and appraised through implementation research whether they can be operationalised and validated. The COVID -19 pandemic has demonstrated that learning can be generated and shared in all directions, and that there are str engths from low - and middle - income countries that can be exported to the high -income counterparts as well (El Bcheraoui et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the world has observed through the pandemic that strong and resilient health systems are not a product of a single country's achievement but a result of collective efforts to adopt a systemic approach to learning that is grounded in experien ces, shared understanding, and co -production of research (Gilson et al., 2021) . 19 1.2 Defining the scope of health system resilience The term 'resilience' originates from the Latin word 'resilire,' which means to 'bounce back.' The concept's earliest usage traces back to 19th century shipbuilding, and it was academically first used in the fields of civil and mechanical engineering (Holling, 1973) , (Hollnagel et al., 2007) . The key feature of resilience as that of 'bouncing back' to its equilibrium after a disruption is referred to as resilience engineering (Folke, 2006) . Resilience thereafter shifted from simply describing machinery to more complex social systems where the systems can evolve through a process of adaptation and transformation (Pike et al., 2010) . Over time, resilience has become a multidisciplinary lexicon ranging from ecology, economics, art, literature to psychology (Alexander, 2013) , (Bodin and Wiman, 2004) , (Fletcher and Sarkar, 2013) . One of the earlier definitions of resilience was shaped in ecology as 'a system's ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between populations or state variables,' which has influenced other disciplines to embrace the concept of resilience as the capacity of individuals, population or system to absorb a shock whilst retaining functions of its original state (Alexander, 2013) . Discourses on livelihood approac hes have highlighted the social determinants of health by building resilience to improve healthcare access in the context of a wider society, which became the precursor of resilience -related research in the health system (Obrist et al., 2007) . Absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities are three key components of resilience which have often featured in literature to better understand the levels of resilience that can be strengthened (B\u00e9n\u00e9 et al., 2012) , (Lebel et al., 2006) , (Kagwanja et al., 2020) . Absorptive capacity is defined as the 'ability to absorb event impacts using predetermined coping responses (Cutter et al., 2008) . Later, a more dynamic interpretation of resilience suggested that social systems may respond to shocks in a variety of ways; not only through absorbing the shocks and returning to its original equilibrium, but also advancing thro ugh learning or adaptation, and even reaching a new state of equilibrium that may indicate transformation (Holling, 1986) , (Adger et al., 2005) . Adaptive capacity points to the ability of a system to adjust to change, pacify the effects, and cope with a disruption (Burton et al., 2002) . Meanwhile, transformative capacity refers to the ability to 'create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic or social structures make the existing system untenable' (Walker et al., 2004) . What is commonly observed in these transformational changes is that these shifts are not merely of technical nature 20 but a complex combination of \"technological innovations, institutional reforms, behavioural shifts and cultural changes (O'Brien, 2012) \" that implies challenging the status quo to reach a systemic change. Figure 1 shows how these capacities may lead to different results: persistence, incremental adjustment, and transformative respons es. The divergent outcomes may be linked with the intensity of the shock and the degree of change required. As the system moves from absorptive, to adaptive, and finally to transformative resilience, the costs and risks to transform become higher than were it to retain its current state (B\u00e9n \u00e9 et al., 2012) . Figure 1. The 3D resilience framework (B\u00e9n\u00e9 et al., 2012) The direct emergence and use of resilience in health has been a relatively recent phenomenon as the concept was initially applied to describe how the health system in rural Ghana underwent a significant structural change after a shock (Blanchet and James, 2013) . The concept of resilience improved the way health systems could be understood as complex adaptive systems (Blanchet and James, 2013) . In the aftermath of the Ebola crisis in 2014, Kruk et al responded to the growing demands of multilateral institutions by developing a resilience framework that illustrates five key characteristics of a resilient health system and proposing a resilience index to measure resilience (Kruk et al., 2015, Kruk et al., 2017) (see figure 2). Here, health system resilience is defined as 'the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crisis; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and informed by lessons learnt during the crisis, reorganise if conditions require it (Kruk et al., 2017) ,' capturing all three components of resilience aforementioned in figure 1. 21 Figure 2. Resilient health system framework modified from (Kruk et al., 2017) Kruk et al's framework has been further tested in Liberia to understand how its health system evolved through responding to the 2014 -15 Ebola epidemic. The study revealed the failure to sustain the influx of the so -called \"fast variables\" of international support consisting of temporary structures, surveillance teams, and isolation facilities; true resilience, on the other hand, requires longer term investments in the slower variables of infrastructure and human resource development that take deliberate eff orts to build prior to any crises (Ling et al., 2017) . Hence, building resilience is more than preparedness, but investing in the right enabling preconditions and institutions (Kruk et al., 2017) . Similarly, Blanchet et al proposed a new model of resilience focusing less on resilience outcomes but understanding resilience as an underlying management and governance capacity of the system (Blanchet et al., 2017) . Resilience is defined here as 'the capacity of a health system to absorb, adapt and transform when exposed to a shock and still retain control over its structure and functions.' As depicted in figure 3, the four operational dimensions, which are interlinke d with each other, characterise the management of resilience in health systems (knowledge, uncertainties, interdependence and legitimacy) (Blanchet et al., 2017) . Kruk et al and Blanchet et al's frameworks provide a meaningful lens to characterise the ideal state of system - level resilience and the governance capacities required for resilience, but does not offer practical application points for practitioners, policy -makers, and other stakeholders on how to work towards building resilience. 22 Figure 3. Conceptual framework modified from (Blanc het et al., 2017) In addition, a crucial aspect of resilience is that it not only applies to acute shocks on systems such as from an outbreak of a war, epidemic or natural disaster, but also when systems are subject to chronic stresses in the cases of leadership failures, frequent staff turnovers, and drug shortages, with growing emphasis on building everyday resilience (Kruk et al., 2017) . Everyday resilience is the capacity of health systems to continue delivering quality services albeit chronic challenges (Gilson et al., 2017a) , and which in turn helps the systems to respo nd better to sudden shocks as well (Barasa et al., 2017) . In low - and middle - income countries, these chronic stresses are the norm and are often internally generated from insufficient organisational capacities. Everyday resilience in s uch a context depends upon new forms of leadership that supports problem -solving and embodies mutual respect where multiple actors can influence learning outcomes through collaborative social networks. Gilson et al highlights that as much as leadership cap acities require individual agencies, systemic resilience is derived from scaling up this agency to organisational level and nurturing organisational capacities (Gilson et al., 2017a) . These different conceptualisations of resilience in health systems outlined above are the beginning of a journey to explor e which relevant actors and agencies are involved in resilience building, what characterises systemic resilience, and how practically we may build resilience to better prepare for the upcoming shock. 23 1.3 Resilience landscape: policies and players Ensuring resilience in health systems have a broader legal and policy underpinnings. The International Health Regulations (IHR) are an instrument of the international law endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2005 that stipulates member states' rights a nd obligations in dealing with public health emergencies that have cross -border implications (World Health Organization, 2005) . With its purpose to provide a public health response to the international spread of diseases, the IHR have remained central to the global health security agenda since 1969. The following core capacities have been established as requirements for health systems of member states (World Health Organization, 2005) : i) the a bility to detect and assess events (ensure that surveillance systems and laboratories can detect potential threats, and understand the nature and potential severity and impact of the event in order to be able to make decisions in public health emergencies) ; ii) notify and report events (report specific diseases, plus any potential public health emergencies, to the World Health Organization (WHO) through a network of 'National IHR Focal Points'); iii) verify and respond (countries are expected to be able to implement and preliminary control measures immediately and respond appropriately to public health risk and emergencies). The WHO has worked directly with member states to support the implementation of IHR core capacity requirements, for instance, through the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) exercise which deploys a team comprised of domestic and international experts in the assessment of the core capacities at national level and develops a national action plan to strengthen the country's IHR capacity through multi -sectoral action (Bell et al., 2017) . Despite such efforts, the effectiveness of the IHR ha ve been put under scrutiny in a number of occasions: the aftermaths of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2014 Ebola outbreak and the 2016 Zika outbreak. The WHO was criticised for its delayed response and the IHR State Parties were not fully implementing its review recommendations (Kluge et al., 2018) . Though the IHR ha ve been regarded as one of the strongest tools to exert global health governance, the execution still relies heavily on national capacities and cooperation. T here are no formal enforcement mechanisms to penalise the members states' failure to notify the WHO of a potential Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) nor to force member states to comply with the IHR obligations (Katz and Fischer, 2010) . As a result, the IHR core capacities have been poorly implemented in some countries, especially as they pertain to resource -poor and vulnerable nations, as the IHR capacities appeared to have operated i n silos with the country's own health system functions (Kluge et al., 2018) . This parallel system was 24 observed in 2007 when the Indonesian Government refused to share c ritical information about the avian influenza virus strains as required by the IHR due to its failed attempt to secure a vaccine (Fidler, 2008) . The knowledge gap about the novel influenza viruses didn't merely indicate a breach of IHR mandates, but a serious threat to collective global health security. Epidemics and pandemics are a good reminder that global health security is only guaranteed if all states including fragile and failed states are protected and that improving the capac ity of every country to identify and prevent health threats are in the interest of the global community, let alone a moral imperative (Frieden et al., 2014) , (Heymann et al., 2015) . The role of IHR in facilitating collective action to achieve globa l health security, however, continues to remain in question in light of the changing landscape and multipolarity of actors in global health governance. There are undoubtedly multiple actors and stakeholders involved in the sphere of global health governanc e relevant for resilience building : natio n states, United Nations organis ations (UNOs), international organis ations (IOs), Non Civil society organisations (CSOs), Multi -national corporations (MNCs) and Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to name a few. These actors end up serving multiple functions, as funding sources, planners, implementers and evaluators. The line between the expected and actual roles of these actors can be blurred at times (Ng an d Ruger, 2011) . Moreover, the emergence of powerful non -state actors such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and multinational pharmaceutical companies have added complexity to this dynamic. The WHO's framework of Engagement with Non -state Actors (FENSA) reflects this need to establish new modalities for engaging with the growing number of CSOs, philanthropic foundations, private corporations and academic institutions (Buse and Hawkes, 2016) . Albeit the proliferation of global health actors making inter - organizational coordination more challenging, this diversification of global health governance has in turn also opened new opportunities for innovative solutions to problems (Held et al., 201 9). Not only has global health governance become more inclusive, it has allowed diverse actors to take leadership roles and enable various perspectives to shape the global health agenda. One notable example is the creation of new institutions and govern ance arrangements triggered by a regional or global pandemic. In response to the Ebola epidemic in 2014 - 2015, United Natio ns Mission for Ebola Emergency R esponse (UNMEER), a first ever United Nations ( UN) emergency health mission, was created and Global Eb ola Response Coalition (GERC) was established as an independent coordinating mechanism. Whilst in the field, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has assumed the leading role in the first phase of the response and applied pressure on the WHO to accelerate support (Held et al., 2019) , breaking 25 conventional approaches to governance. As evident in the Ebola response in 2014, the multipolarity of global health actors have made global health governance and its outcomes inevitably more political (Kickbusch, 2016) . The COVID -19 pandemic has yet again accentuated this role of politics in driving global health governance not necessarily towards the a chievement of collective goals but towards protecting national interests. Raged by criticisms against his government's pandemic response, President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to stop funding the WHO and conduct an independent investigation of its performance (Micahel D. Shear, 2020) . The President went on to announce in a press conference that he would terminate the United States (U.S.) membership in the WHO (David J. Lynch, 2020) . This unilateral decision by a soverei gn head of state has serious implications on the legitimacy of the global health governance role provided by the WHO. Furthermore, the politicization of health in the U.S. has indisputably contributed to the intensification of vaccine hesitancy movements. Propelled initially by the President's publicly downplaying of the COVID -19 pandemic and promoting unscientific therapies (Gollust et al., 2020) , the perceived seriousne ss of the virus and the willingness to comply with non -pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing measures have been more influenced by partisan politics than any other factors (Allcott et al., 2020) . Within the U.S., voters of President Trump were 35% more likely to reject vaccinations for COVID -19 (Callaghan et al., 2020) . Vaccine hesitancy and nationalism are clearly beyond the problems of the U.S. As of August 2020, the U.S. , European Union, United Kingdom and Japan had secured an estimated 1.3 billion dose of potential COVID -19 vaccine doses (Paton, 2020) . Such forward purchasing contract s have marginalised low - and middle - income countries' potential to acquire vaccines, exacerbating inequalities between continents, regions and countries (Nhamo et al., 2021) . Fortunately, the fragmented nature of global health governanc e has offered opportunities for collaborative movements as well. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a foundation that takes donations from public, private, philanthropic and civil society organisations, established a COVID Vaccines Development Taskforce in February 2020 and has i dentified nine COVID -19 candidate vaccines to support with the aim to make COVID vaccines inclusive. Since the launch of COVID -19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX), a worldwide initiative to bring equitable access to COVID -19 vaccines, in June 2020, the WHO h as successfully brought high - 26 income countries and even China to commit to supporting the initially identified 92 low income countries (GAVI, 2020) . Among the donors pledging to COVAX, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, corporations and wealthy individuals consist of the major funders alongside countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany. The c urrent geopolitical landscape is shifting; in terms of resources, connectivity and geopolitical status, a wider range of actors are now participating and shaping the way global health priorities are set (Fisher and Green, 2004) . The WHO The Pan -European Commission on Health and Sustainble Development recommended in its recent report t o strengthen health governance at global level by establishing a Global Health Board under the auspices of the G20 and to develop a Pandemic Treaty that holds governments accountable and to enact a global pandemic vaccine policy that enables the availabili ty and distribution of vaccines for all (McKeen, 2021) . Yet, as observed, the traditionally powerful group of states are no longer the dominant players. New f inancing mechanisms, new institutions and new alliances are challenging the way we frame the next global health agenda and how it ought to be governed (Kickbusch, 2016) . Embracing this contextual complexity and acknowledging the evolving nature of global health governance and cooperation is crucial when interrogating resilience in the health system and preparing for the next crisis o f any nature. This thesis sheds light to the different actors and their perspectives responding to systemic shocks and what resilience means in their respective contexts in light of IHR responsibilities and global health security goals. The detailed accoun ts of Myanmar's undergoing cyclone Nargis and the different NGOs and their partner countries responding to various shocks on their health systems will illuminate lessons and insights relevant for the future players of global health governance. 1.4 Research gaps and rationale A group of global health system researchers have convened in March 2021 to discuss and identify priority research areas for health system resilience reflecting on lessons from COVID -19 and other health emergencies (Saulnier et al., 2021) . The unanimous voice from the table of researchers was that research gaps should be filled through more applied research rooted in real life cases. Case studies and lo ngitudinal approaches that invite practitioners, policy -makers and the public into the co -production of research may be able to shift 27 resilience discourses from mere concepts to actual practices (Saulnier et al., 2021) . Co-production of research assumes a shared understanding of problems and approaches to solutions (Jordan et al., 2009) , a process known as collective sensemaking , which promotes mutual learning and improved health system decision making practices (Gilson et al., 2021) . Albeit a consensus on the growing significance of resilience in improving responses to system level shocks such as that from the COVID -19 pandemic, the plethora of research thus far have remained most ly at a theoretical level with the discussions focusing on definitions, concepts, and principles (Bhamra et al., 201 1), (Turenne et al., 2019) . So far, there h as been a dearth of critical appraisals on how these differing concepts of health system resilience have been operationalised and applied in empirical settings (Biddle et al., 2020) . This thesis is a timely response to this collective call for applied research in the field of health system resilience. It aims to better understand resilience through multiple perspectives and different country -based empirical evidence. The rationale behind this research stems from the growing relevance and significance of resilie nce in the context of increasing frequency and intensity of shocks on health systems as mentioned earlier in this chapter. As Kutzin et al put it, \"health system strengthening is what we do; resilience is what we want\" (Kutzin and Sparkes, 2016) . This thesis starts with a systematic review to synthesize empirical evidence of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries and applies th e refined conceptual framework produced by the review to two qualitative studies thereafter to test the applicability of this new framework in several contexts. This research will highlight the vital role of resilient health systems in practical terms to prepare countries for future shocks, and bring out its crucial effect in bridging the disparate health and development agenda in order to address the nexus between humanitarian aid and development cooperation. Our findings are grounded in countries' experie nces responding to various shocks, which will offer valuable insight for practitioners and policy -makers to generate resilience -enhancing strategies for their own contexts. The pursuit of resilience will seek integration between the different actors involv ed in global health and guide consensus -building approaches to policy and practice. 28 CHAPTER 2 Aim and Objectives 29 2 Aim and Objectives 2.1 Aim The overarching aim of this doctoral research is to contribute to the health system resilience literature by bridging the gap between concept and practice of resilience in the health system through interrogating empirical evidence of low - and middle - incom e contexts. The insights generated from this research may guide policy and practice on how best to characterise and improve resilience whilst preparing for potential shocks and stressors in the health system. Three specific objectives have been establishe d to achieve this aim (Figure 4). 2.2 Objectives The specific objectives are: 4. To synthesize evidence on key features of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries 5. To improve the understanding of the characteristics of health system resilience based on a national response to a crisis and how countries can improve resilience in their health care systems 6. To explore the perspective of NGOs dealing with unexpected shock s on health systems and to reflect on the practical implications of resilience for stakeholders in global health cooperation Figure 4. Specific Thesis Objectives 30 2.3 Thesis structure The main findings of this thesis are presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 as a series of articles published by or submitted to peer -reviewed scientific journals. Chapter 4 begins by reviewing the empirical evidence of resilient health systems in low - and mi ddle- income countries (Objective I). We synthesize key features of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries and propose a refined conceptual framework identifying five new themes that are foundational for unlocking Kruk et al's resili ence attributes (Kruk et al., 2017) . In Chapter 5, we apply the new framework to examine the characteristics of resilience that have been salient or absent in Myanmar's response to Cyclone Nargis (Objective II). Chapter 6 examines how and to what extent Swiss -based NGOs have dealt with unexpecte d shocks in the health systems of their partner countries and to reflect upon the practical implications of resilience (Objective III). This chapter analyses the key attributes of resilience that targeted investments may influence and the different roles k ey stakeholders may assume to build resilience. In Chapter 7, we present an editorial clarifying the connection between civic capital, a component of social capital, and resilience by highlighting that civic capital is a key ingredient in resilience requir ed by health system actors to manage and recover from crises. Chapter 8 provides a general analysis of the key findings from the chapters above and presents broader implications and recommendations for future research. 31 CHAPTER 3 Methodology 32 3 Methodology As the thesis chapters take a stand -alone format of a series of published articles, detailed description of the study design and applied methods have been incorporated within the respective chapters. Nevertheless, this chapter intends to present general me thodological and analytical approaches employed to achieve the study objectives. 3.1 Methodological approach Unlike in material science and engineering, the concept of resilience in health systems requires embracing a view of resilience as a complex adaptive system (CAS) where a combination of absorptive, adaptive and transformative strategies are employed in managing shocks (Barasa et al., 2017) (B\u00e9n\u00e9 et al., 2012) . This complex paradigm of the health system necessitates creating the right preconditions to enable the syst em's effectiveness towards resilience (Barasa et al., 2017) . These preconditions are dependent upon the health system's contextual history, governance structure and cultural aspects which are not quantifiable. Hence, this thesis applied methodologies that may best capture these complexities, through a systematic review and qualitative approaches. Multiple country cases and stakeholders representing different levels will offer a diversity of perspectives of health system actors and stakeh olders und ergoing various shocks. Table 1 presents an overview of the methods applied per study objective. Table 1. Methodological approaches applied by study objective Objective I. II. III. Methods Best-fit Framework Synthesis In-depth Interviews In-depth Interviews Participants/Studies N=12 N=12 N=20 Data collection period Sept 2019 Jan-Feb 2020 April -June 2021 The first study (Objective I) was a systematic review synthesizing key features of resilient health systems in low- and middle - income countries. It employed a best -fit framework synthesis approach, often used in a rapid 33 evidence synthesis of qualitative d ata to generate context -specific models or programme theories that have potential relevance for policy -makers and field practitioners (Carroll et al., 2013) . We identified a best -fitting existing model which in our case was Kru k et al's resilient health system framework (Kruk et al., 2017) as an a priori framework to map and code the data from the included studies (Carroll et al., 2011) . Kruk et al's model has been chosen due to its corresponding resilience index which is relatively comparable across different contexts. The framework's validity has also been empirically tested in Liberia's 2014 -15 Ebola epidemic analysis (Ling et al., 2017) , (Barker et al., 2020) . Our review only included applied cases since 2014 when the concept of resilience has actively been used in the context of health systems and where a major shock of political, environmental or epidemiological nature have occurred. 12 studies from low - and middle - income countries met the final inclusion criteria. For screening and data extraction, EPPI -reviewer 4 was used to allow authors to collaborate on the same platform. Additional themes and elements identified by the synthesis have been summarized in to our refined model of health system resilience, building on the a priori framework and extending its themes. In this regards, the best -fit framework method was deemed appropriate to achieve our objective to synthesize empirical evidence of resilient heal th systems. The second and third studies (Objective II and III) were qualitative studies that were based on semi -structured in-depth interviews with representatives of international organisations and non -governmental organisations (NGOs) in Myanmar (Objec tive II) and representatives of Swiss -based NGOs with on -going health project engagements in low - and middle - income countries (Objective III). The interviews were guided by semi - structured interview guides designed to explore the characteristics of resili ence that have been salient or absent in responding to the crises and the different roles key stakeholders may assume to build resilience. Triangulation through supplementary data such as reports, event pictures and media clips provided by the participants was used to partially offset any potential recall bias due to the time gap between the actual event and data collection periods. All interviews were conducted by the author in person with no prior exchanges between the participants and the data collectors . The interviews have been audio -recorded following informed consent and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was conducted using a data -driven thematic analysis closely following the steps outlined in the framework method (Gale et al., 2013) . All transcripts were coded line by line using MAXQDA 2018 and thereafter analysed. Both studies used the refined conceptual framework developed by the systematic review (Objective I) to develop the analytical framework and to create the final 34 framework matrix which would be the basis for the key results. 3.2 Ethical considerations Ethical clearance for all studies included in this thesis have been obtained initially in Switzerland by the Ethikkommission Nord -west und Zentralschweiz (Req -2019 -00348) and approved subsequently in Myanmar by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Public Health and the Ministry of Health and Sports of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (2020/Research/4). Furthermore, written informed consent have been provided by all study participant. 35 CHAPTER 4 Enhancing the Understanding of Resilience in Health Systems of Low - and Middle -Income Countries: A Qualitative Evidence Synthesis Pauline Yongeun Sonja Merten1,2, Wai Wai Han5, Kaspar Wyss1,2 1) Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland. 2) University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. 3) Social Science Research Unit, University College London, London, UK. 4) Faculty of Humanities, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, Sou th Africa. 5) Department of Medical Research, Ministry of Health and Spo rts, Yangon, Myanmar. * Corresponding author Published in the International Journal of Health Policy and Management, July 2020, 10:11 36 4 Enhancing the Understanding of Resilience in Health Systems of Low - and Middle - Income Countries: A Qualitative Evidence Synthesis 4.1 Abstract Background: A country's health system faces pressure when hit by an unexpected shock, such as what we observe in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic. The concept of resilience is highly relevant in this context and is a prerequisite for a hea lth system capable of withstanding future shocks. By exploring how the key dimensions of the resilient health system framework are applied, the present systematic review synthesizes the vital features of resilient health systems in low - and middle -income c ountries. The aim of this review is to ascertain the relevance of health system resilience in the context of a major shock, through better understanding its dimensions, uses and implications. Methods: The review uses the best -fit framework synthesis approach. An a priori conceptual framework was selected and a coding framework created. A systematic search identified 4284 unique citations from electronic databases and reports by non -governmental organisa tions, 12 of which met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and coded against the pre -existing themes. Themes outside of the a priori framework were collated to form a refined list of themes. Then, all twelve studies were revisited using the new lis t of themes in the context of each study. Results: Ten themes were generated from the analysis. Five confirmed the a priori conceptual framework that capture the dynamic attributes of a resilient system. Five new themes were identified as foundational for achieving resilience: realigned relationships, foresight and motivation as drivers, and emergency preparedness and change management as organisational mechanisms. Conclusion: The refined conceptual model shows how the themes inter -connect. The foundations of resilience appear to be critical especially in resource -constrained settings to unlock the dynamic attributes of resilience. This review prompts countries to consider building the foundations of resilience described here as a priority to better prepare for future shocks. 37 4.2 Background Emergence of 'resilience' as a concept in the health sector A country's health system faces severe pressure when hit by an unexpected shock. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in December 2013 took nearly a year until it was officially declared as an international public health emergency (World Health Organization, 2014b) ; yet, by that time it had already spread to neighbouring countries and caused major disruptions in the functioning of their health systems and beyond (World Health Organization, 2014b) . In 2018, the Ebola Virus returned to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite the joint efforts of the Ministry of Health and relev ant partners in implementing control measures, treatment and prevention efforts have been severely hampered by the on -going military conflict and civilian displacement (WHO Regional Office for Africa, 2019) . The concept of resilience has become ever more relevant with the current responses to the Covid -19 pandemic and is emerging as a prerequisit e to building a strong health system that would withstand future health shocks. The term resilience was first used academically in the fields of mathematics and engineering (Hollnagel et al., 2007) , (Bodin and Wiman, 2004) and the key feature of resilience as that of 'bouncing back' to its original equilibrium after a displacement is known as resilience engineering (Folke, 2006) . Resilience has a long history of application in art, literature, law, science, and engineering (Alexander, 2013) . This concept was soon after applied in the domains of ecology (Bodin and Wiman, 2004) , and later to psychology where its early work focused mainly on trau ma-affected individuals (Luthar, 2006) , and then to embrace the whole communities (Fleming and Ledogar, 2008) . Discourses on livelihood approaches have highlighted the social determinants of health by building resilience to improve health care access in the context of a wider society (Obrist et al., 2007) , which became the starting point of resilience -related research in the health system. The direct emergence of resilience in health, however, has been a relatively recent phenomenon, as a response to the Ebola crisis (Kruk et al., 2015) and there have been efforts to characterise and measure health system resilience to allow comparison across different contexts (Kruk et al., 2017) . Health system resilience is defined as the capacity to prepare for and effectiv ely respond to crises whilst retaining core health system functions when a crisis hits. Another aspect concerns the capability of the system to reorganise itself to meet the evolving needs of the situation (Kruk et al., 2015) . It is para mount to note that the concept of resilience is not only applicable to acute external shocks but also to chronic conditions that have the potential to undermine the fabric of the health system. Examples are the organisational challenges resulting in human resource and drug shortages, which requires everyday resilience (Kruk et al., 2017) , (Gilson et al., 38 2017a) . Hence, building everyday resilience of the health system is linked with the strengthening of the overall health system. Several scholars among many embedded in health system's research proposed conceptual frameworks in order to elucidate the complex nature of health system resilience. Blan chet et al developed a model of health system resilience, describing it as a governance capacity to absorb, adapt and transform itself in case of a shock (Blanchet et al., 2017) . Kruk et al responded to demands from multilateral organisations in the aftermath of the Ebola crisis in 2014 by creating a framework describing five key characteristics of a resilient health system and a proposed res ilience index corresponding to those five characteristics to measure resilience (Kruk et al., 2017) . Why is this synthesis important? Despite a growing consensus that health system's resilience is imperative in order to prepare for the next pandemic, a recent literature review revealed that there is a considerable gap between the theoretical foundations of resilience and its empiric al application in the literature (Biddle et al., 2020) . . Furthermore, due to the dearth of empirical evidence from low - and middle - income countries, th ere is little evidence to guide countries in strengthening health system resilience with contextualized application points for resource -constrained settings. By exploring how the key five dimensions of resilient health system framework are applied in re al life cases (Kruk et al., 2015) (Figure 5), the present systematic review provides a synthesis of the vital features of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries. The focus is on applied evidence of health system res ilience using Kruk et al's health system resilience framework as the a priori conceptual framework (Kruk et al., 2017) . As reiterated by v arious ( 2015) , (Kutzin and Sparkes, 20 16), (van de Pas et al., 2017) ), the Ebola crisis in 2014 had been the defining moment upon which the concept of health system resilience, or the lack thereof, was brought to the domain of the health sector, and the international community has formed a consensus around the importance of building a foundation of resilient health systems. Therefore, only literature since the Ebola crisis in West Africa has been considered in our analysis. This review has also not included Covid -19 related studies as the search and analysis have been conducted before the occurrence of the pandemic. The findings and implications of th is study, however, remain highly relevant, as low - and middle - income countries will be facing the devastating effect of the pandemic as we speak. Nevertheless, this has not been our scope and will require further research. Objectives The aim of this systematic review is to ascertain the relevance of the concept of resilience in relation to health systems in the context of a major shock, through a better understanding of its dimensions, uses and implications, as described in 39 current lit erature. The framework synthesis will serve to improve understanding of: 1) the common key features of a resilient health system in low - and middle -income countries, building on Kruk et al's framework on health system resilience 2) other features that are critic al in the context of low - and-middle income countries outside of Kruk et al's framework that may indicate capacity for resilience 4.3 Methods A priori conceptual framework: resilient health system framework A best -fit framework synthesis approach was selected for this qualitative synthesis, as this method provides a means to build on an existing published model and to test its relevance for a wider population (Carroll et al., 2013) . An a priori conceptual framework was first selected and a coding framework created based on its key themes and sub -themes. The selected a priori framework developed by Kruk et al was chosen due to its corresponding resilient index, as the authors deemed the measures relatively comparable and easily applicable across different contexts. In addition, Kruk et al's framework has already been empirically tested in the cases of Liberia's Ebola epidemic, which provided a good rational for selection (Ling et al., 2017) , (Barker et al., 2020) . The a priori framework is predicated on five essential characteristics that indicate a resilient health system (Kruk et al., 2015) , (Kruk et al., 2017) . Figure 5. a priori Framework for Health System Resilience (Kruk et al., 2017) The following coding framework was generated based on the a priori conceptual framework, which guided the subsequent data extraction and analysis processes. Other recurrent themes associated with resilience were also noted. 40 Table 2. The Coding Framework: a priori Themes and Sub -themes Themes 1. Aware 2. Diverse 3. Self - regulating 4. Integrated 5. Adaptive Sub- themes i) knows health system capacity i) effectively respond to range of health needs i) isolate threat and maintain core function i) coordinate with non - health actors i) shift resources to meet need ii) knows risks and population ii) adequately finance health systems ii) leverage outside capacity ii) engage citizens and communities to build trust ii) promote rapid local decision making iii) communicate iii) link healthcare provision to public health iii) evaluate to improve iv) coordinate primary and referral care Resilience and the building blocks of the health system The themes and subthemes of Kruk et al's resilience framework and other recurrent themes were recognised as elements of resilience, matched to the six building blocks of the health system (World Health Organization, 2007) and noted as either a strength or a weakness in each study of health system responding to a shock. The elements that did not match any of the traditional building blocks were grouped under 'others.' The map was reviewed by all the authors and consensus was reached for it to be used as an analytical tool. The top five most prominent elements of the health system in the synthesis of all papers were later presented in the refined conceptual model of health system resilience as 'fundamental elements of health systems.' Search strategy and study selection Literature search was conducted in September 2019. The following relevant electronic databases were searched for eligible studies: MEDLINE, Ovid [2014 onwards] Ovid [2014 onwards] Web of Science Core Collection Scopus Global Health Library for WHO databases (Regional indexes) Epistemonikos Evidence Aid 41 A filter was applied for qualitative studies published from January 2014 onwards, as this was the time when the concept of health system resilience first received attention after the Ebola crisis in Africa. We used supplementary search techniques to identify studies not indexed in the databases listed above, by searching grey literature. As the topic is at the nexus of public health, political science, social science, and international development, databases and websites pertaining to a range of these multidisciplinary topics were considered. The following National Insitute for Health and Clinical Excellence: www.nice.org.uk In addition to the electronic searches described above, we looked into websites of governmental health authorities, specific emergency outbreaks (e.g. Ebola), used citation chasing and handsearching strategies for topical journals from 2014 -2019. We also contacted experts and practitioners in the field for internal reports a nd unpublished literature. See Appendix for a detailed search strategy, which has been adapted for other databases. As the aim of this synthesis was to better understand the key features of a resilient health system in low - and middle - income countries based on empirical evidence, the review only included applied cases where a major shock of political, environmental, and epidemiological nature had occurred. Primary studies were included if they used qualitative study designs such as case studies, ethnogr aphies, and qualitative process evaluations, and studies that used both qualitative methods for data collection (e.g. focus group discussions, individual interviews, observation, diaries, document analysis, etc.) and data analysis (e.g. thematic analysis, framework analysis, etc.). Only studies published in English language were considered. The following table summarizes the inclusion and exclusion criteria: 42 Table 3.

Shocks of political, environmental, and epidemiological nature were consider ed for our analysis. First, study title and abstracts were screened for relevance and full -text articles were obtained for the second stage of screening for final eligibility. Detailed reasons for articles excluded were recorded and compared between authors to agree on discrep ancies. Two authors independently reviewed all title/abstracts and full -text formats for the two -stage screening process. A systematic search identified 4,284 unique citations from key electronic databases and reports by non - governmental organisations. Of the 4,284 articles, 449 articles were discarded as duplicates, and an additional 3,764 articles were excluded for irrelevance. 71 full -text articles were assessed for eligibility, which resulted in a further 59 exclusions. Studies were excluded because the y did not use qualitative methods, and the focus of resilience was not systemic but of individuals. Most of the grey literature reports did not meet the inclusion criteria due to compromised quality and the lack of depth in analysis. Twelve studies met the final inclusion criteria and were included in the synthesis. 1 World Bank Group, 2019. https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519 -world -bank -country -and-lending -groups 2 Ibid. 43 Figure 6. PRISMA Diagram of the Literature Search Characteristics of included studies Table 4 outlines the characteristics of the included studies. Overall, there was rich diversity in terms the geography (continent) and types of shock (environmental, political, epidemiological) covered in the papers. Four articles were from Asia, six from Africa, and two from the Middle East, representing a good contextual diversity. With regards to the nature of the shock, three were environmental, three were political, and six were epidemiological. As all studies were from low - and middle - income countries with comparable levels of health system, the findings were more likely to be transferrable and the common themes easily generated. All papers were of qualitative nature, discussed findings, experiences, perceptions, and lessons learnt responding to the shock, w hich revealed critical aspects of the capacity of resilience in its health system. 44 Table 4.

A standard extraction tool was developed to extrac t relevant descriptive data and to code findings against the a priori coding framework. Basic data such as author, year of publication, study aim and objective, study type were extracted, as well as any relevant contextual information, description of the s hock, and theoretical framework used. Themes outside of the a priori framework were collated to form a refined list of themes. Then, all twelve studies were revisited using the new list of themes to analy se them in the context of each study. One reviewer w as responsible for the whole data extraction and a second reviewer reviewed 10% of a random sample of the included papers for quality assurance. Quality assessment The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative research was adapted as a scoring system for the quality appraisal of included studies (CASP, 2018) . Two authors independently appraised the quality of the papers considering the CASP scores and additional questions to assess the study quality by consid ering the study's use of theoretical frameworks, robust analytical method, in -depth interviews and focus group discussions in the case of primary qualitative study. Each study was given an overall rating of outstanding, fair, and poor. After discussing dis crepancies, the authors agreed to include all twelve studies regardless of the final rating, as studies that may not have ranked highly in the quality appraisal can still add value in corroborating the findings from higher quality studies with stronger exp lanatory power. 4.4 Results Ten themes were generated from the analysis. Each of the theme was then compared with the elements of the health system that best corresponded to health system building blocks. We have distinguished 'Health system elements' as detailed components of the he alth system that manifested as strength or weakness of the given context when responding to crisis. The elements were grouped into the corresponding WHO health system building blocks (World Health Organization, 2007) . The first five were adapted from the a priori conceptual framework that characterizes a resilient health system: aware, diverse, self - regulating, integrated, adaptive. Dynamic attributes of health system resilience As described by Kruk et al, resilient health systems share key features that seem to a pply across diverse contexts and nature of shocks. 47 Aware First, a resilient health system is aware of its system capacity and risks. Awareness is the capacity to detect and interpret local warning signs and quickly call for support (Kruk et al., 2017) . It can be measured through the knowledge and distribution of its health system assets, having an active epidemiological surveillance system, and an open communication channel that makes relevant information accessible through various forms of media (Kruk et al., 2017) . In the aftermath of the 2011 Van earthquake, it was evident that Turkey's rescue teams on the ground did not have sufficient information regarding the available resources and lacked the capacity to locate collapsed buildings. This led to a significan t waste of time and resources for onsite inspections and heavy reliance on local sources that could have been spared with a systemic approach to surveillance. One interviewee noted that \"it was difficult to find maps of the area to locate collapsed buildings, and gather information ab out the number of victims (Achour et al., 2016) .\" This indicates how a lack of aware ness of its geo -registry of human resources, supplies and facilities during calm can cause a chain of inefficiencies when crisis hits. On the other hand, in Lebanon, during the Syrian refugee crisis that placed a considerable burden on its health system d ue to the unprecedented influx of refugees, the primary health care department, along with the epidemiological surveillance unit, played a crucial role in ensuring effective and ongoing surveillance of its disease burden (Ammar et al., 2016) . Key data of emerging infections and outbreaks were monitored and reported. Effective immunization coverage and the activation of its early warning and response system allowed f or a successful prevention and control of communicable diseases such as measles, polio, cholera, and tuberculosis even during a crisis (Ammar et al., 2016) . Awareness is associated with a strong health information system, as manifested in the included studies by a functioning surveillance and reporting system, as well as a transparent communication channel to the public. Table 5. Relev ant health system building block for 'awareness' Health System Building Block Health Information Systems Health System Element Transparent communication to the public and sensitization using the media functioning surveillance and reporting system # of studies shown as strengths 3 2 # of studies shown as weakness 3 1 The presence or lack of awareness were found to be critical in grasping and monitoring key information for the system to 48 respond effectively in crisis situations (Achour et al., 2016) , (Ammar et al., 2016) , (Curran et al., 2018) , (Lin et al., 2014) , (Ling et al., 2017) , (Otu et al., 2018) , (Purohit et al., 2018) , (Thiam et al., 2015) . Having an independent epidemiological surveillance unit within the Health ministry and regularly sharing the findings with other relevant ministries and the public not only served its purpose to deal with impending arising health needs but also had a stabi lizing effect of gaining the trust of the partners and its people. Diverse Second, a resilient health system responds to a diverse range of health care needs. Diversity here refers to the capacity to address a broad range of health challenges arising due to the crisis and meeting varying needs of its population (Kruk et al., 2015) . It can be measured through its scope of health services available in primary care, adequacy of government health expenditure and financial protection mechanism s (Kruk et al., 2017) . Diversity was de monstrated in how the Chinese government handled the varying health needs after the devastating effects of the Sichuan earthquake in 2008. After dealing with the acute care stage of earthquake victims, treatment of non -earthquake related illnesses and chro nic disease patients became the country's next medical focus. \"40% of the patients in Wenchuan county were over 60 years old....vulnerable population - such as older people, women and children - were highly represented, and the need for chronic health care w as great (Lin et al., 2014) .\" Hospitals sent medical tea ms daily to temporary settlement areas to provide primary care services and health education for this population groups. In addition, three months after the earthquake, more than 40% of the earthquake survivors in the heavily affected counties suffered fro m post -traumatic stress disorder. China's Ministry of Health quickly mobilised and dispatched experts and volunteers to offer mental health and socia l services, a targeted gesture to meet the impending needs of its population (Lin et al., 2014) . In contrast, Liberia's Ebola crisis in 2015 revealed that in its early response, no health services were available because most health facilities were shut down (Ling et al., 2017) . Even in later stages, the clinics that gradually opened offered limited health services. This was because prior to Ebola, health services were segregated into disease -based programmes according to international funding availability. The dependence on external support led to a highly verticalized health programming with patchy performance, giving no consideration to building a long -term health care system; for example, malaria was managed well whilst maternal health was not. The same pattern was repeated during Ebola, as Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) that relied on external funding operated and health facilities used as triage stations to screen for Ebola symptoms, but most primary care facilities and hospitals were closed or offering limited services (Ling et al., 2017) . Diversity is associated with leveraging internal and external resources effectively to deliver a wide range of health services to 49 its people, as exhibited by relevant studies. Table 6. Relevant health system building block for 'diversity' Health System Building Block Service Delivery Health Financing Health System Element Diverse range of health services offered to meet impending needs of target population groups Leverage internal and external resources effectively # of studies shown as strengths 4 4 # of studies shown as weakness 1 2 The theme of diversity highlighted the importance of having a system -based approach to resilience, as countries require a strong foundation of health financing mechanisms, infrastructure, and human resource pool to flex its capacity when the diverse heal th needs arise (Achour et al., 2016) , (Ammar et al., 2016) , (Lin et al., 2014) , (Ling et al., 2017) , (Alameddine et al., 2019) . It was evident during the Ebola crisis that the reliance on short -term donor -based progra mmes diverted the country's priority away from building a lasting health system (Ling et al., 2017) . Self-regulating Third, a resilient health system is self -regulating and offers undisrupted health services to its people. Self -regulation is the ability to contain and isolate health threats while delivering core health services (Kruk et al., 2015) . It can be measured through its collaboration agreements with regional and global actors, especially non -state and private providers and a database of service delivery alternatives for affected and unaffected populations (Kruk et al., 2017) . As soon as Ebola hit, health facilities were shut down in eastern and central Liberia, or they were severely understaffed, or barely functioning. Health care workers fled and there were limited county health team funds and capacity to respond to the crisis. As most primary care facilities and hospitals closed, de aths occurred as a result from the void of health services (Ling et al., 2017) . In the case of Lebanon during the Syrian refugee crisis, however, the Lebanese health system sustained a level of financing services at all levels, primary, s econdary, and tertiary. The Ministry of Health maintained and even improved contracting terms with private hospitals by including performance measures in the contracts to achieve required service volum es at specified quality levels. As a result, the provis ion of health care was sustained throughout the crisis and primary health care centres and hospitals from both public and private sectors have remained operational (Ammar et al., 2016) . As demonstrated in all relevant studies, this stark difference in the capacity of self -regulation appear to be attributed to the level 50 of leadership and governance upholding the health system (Ammar et al., 2016) , (Lin et al., 2014) , (Ling et al., 2017) , (Alameddine et al., 2019) , (Ager et al., 2015) , (McPake et al., 2015) . The ministry of health has taken the lead in these exemplary countries to set up collaborative agreements with a wide range of actors to ensure that the system runs and service s extended to its people without disruption (Ammar et al., 2016) , (Lin et al., 2014) , (Alameddine et al., 2019) , (Ager et al., 2015) . Table 7. Relevant health system building bloc k for 'self -regulation' Health System Building Block Leadership and Governance Service Delivery Health System Element Collaboration with a wide range of actors (other ministries, private, public, NGOs, etc) Undisrupted services in times of crisis # of studies shown as strengths 8 2 # of studies shown as weakness 3 1 Integrated Fourth, a resilient health system has a formal unified coordinating channel that is integrated and coordinates with non -health actors and engages with the community to respond to crisis. Integration is the capacity to bring together diverse actors, ide as, and groups to come up with solutions and initiate action (Kruk et al., 2015) . It can be measured through an existence of a national emergency coordination system, platforms for dialogue with community leaders, and various working groups a nd their roles and protocols (Kruk et al., 2017) . Evidence of integration was apparent in multiple settings (Achour et al., 201 6), (Ammar et al., 2016) , (Curran et al., 2018) , (Lin et al., 2014) , (Ling et al., 2017) , (Otu et al., 2018) , (Alameddine et al., 2019) , (Ager et al., 2015) , (McPake et al., 2015) . Turkey took a proactive approach to merging many directorates to reduce bureaucracy and opt for a single approach for emergency response by having the Ministry of Health's Disaster and Emergency Coordi nation Centre (SAKOM) be in charge of the overall coordination in the disaster area (Achour et al., 2016) . In the heat of the Boko Haram insurgency, the exceptional coordination between Nigeria's State Ministry of Health and security forces enabled health workers to go to work during curfe w hours (Ager et al., 2015) . Critical in these coor dination efforts were also the role of the community. Community members in Nigeria organized transportation access to health services and served as key sources of information, bridging the health care workers to the communities. They provided spiritual, em otional, and social support to each other to cope with the crisis together (Ager et al., 2015) . In Liberia, however, a haphazard coordination between government actors and NGOs, and the lack of 51 transparency in budget management and Ebola surveillance data, exacerbated community suspicion. As a consequence, one NGO respondent described that this lack of coordination at every level led to a paralysis in actual progress and movement (Ling et al., 2017) . The capacity to integrate, therefore, comes from a strong foundation of leadership and governance and is also related with the government's ability to communicate with its people in a transparent and consistent manner to gain the trust of its populace. Once the community engagement is strong, resilience in the health system is easily exhibited at all levels. Table 8. Relevant health system building block for 'integration' Health System Building Block Leadership and Governance Other Health System Element Successful coordination structure created for the crisis Strong community trust and engagement based on respect of culture # of studies shown as strengths 5 2 # of studies shown as weakness 2 2 Adaptive Fifth, a resilient health system is adaptive to the evolving situation and deals with the crisis with flexibility. Adaptivene ss is the ability to transform in ways that improve function in the face of highly adverse conditions (Kruk et al., 2015) . It can be measured through provisions to reallocate funds in emergency, management capacity of local health teams, agreement to delegate authority and funding in crises (Kruk et al., 2017) . It was paramount that countries quickly shifted its modus operandi to the evolving situation. Fo r instance, when strict curfew measures were introduced to restrict movement during the insurgencies, the Hospital Management Board in Nigeria called its senior physicians and nurses to make a formal change to the health worker duty shifts. Instead of thre e 8-hour shifts, two 12 - hour shifts were established, which ensured continuity of staffing at facilities given its curfew restrictions (Ager et al., 2015) . During the insecure period, medicine stock was redistributed to the facilities most affected by the i nflux of refugees in Lebanon. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and health authorities in Lebanon bought 25% of the annual stock of medicine to prepare for emergency and ensure continuous availabilit y of medicine (Alameddine et al., 2019) . Evident in Nigeria's account of the response to its Ebola outbreak, huge su ms of money were made available to manage the outbreak and monetary incentives were provided by the Lagos State Government for medical volunteers 52 to draw up life insurance policies and other incentives to reward those who work in the treatment centres (Otu et al., 2018) . All these efforts are in line with leadership and governance especially at decentralized levels where resources can be shifted an d allocated flex ibly to meet the evolving situation and changing needs.

Relevant health system building block for 'adaptive' Health System Building Block Leadership and Governance Health Financing Health System Element Successful decentralization of responsibilities Fundraising and flexible allocation of resources to meet needs # of studies shown as strengths 3 4 # of studies shown as weakness 3 2 Foundations of resilience Five new themes were generated from a thematic analysis of the data extracted from all the included studies. These themes did not fit neatly into the a priori framework, but came up as reoccurring themes that revealed a pattern in itself. These new themes were realigned relationships, foresight and motivation, change management, and emergency preparedness. Based on their functions, these five new themes were re -grouped into two sub -categories: drivers of resilience and organisational mechanisms. The drivers of resilience were features of resilience that propelled the health system to overcome structural barriers, whilst the organisational mechanisms were the enabling structures of the health system that activated resilience. These two sub -categories compleme nt one another, as the dimensions of software and hardware are both required in building the resilience of the health system. Drivers of resilience: realigned relationships, foresight, motivation First, a resilient health system responds to disruption by realigning working relationships and building mutual trust between countries, teams and individuals to work collaboratively towards shared goals. Despite diplomatic controversies between neighbouring countries, China sought relief experts and rescue ope ration equipment soon after the Sichuan earthquake. China even accepted support from at least three private relief teams in Taiwan, with whom China had a long tense relations (Lin et al., 2014) . This was an exemplary decision that showed a new working relationship overcoming historical and cultural boundaries i n times of crisis under a shared goal to save lives. Likewise, St. Mary Lacor hospital in Gulu, a well -equipped, faith -based, NGO hospital filled the gap in the health sector in Northern Uganda. The Ebola 53 outbreak placed a significant pressure in its healt h system that had been affected by two decades of conflict. It offered a consistent and high standard of care, and created a safe space for people fleeing violence. (McPake et al., 2015) . In the cases of China and Uganda, ex ternal partners played a positive role, as there were trust and openness that overcame barriers to work towards the same vision. This was not the case in Ebola -stricken Liberia. The Ministry of Health and NGOs were hesitant to disclose funding and Ebola surveillance data, which led to community suspicion and paralysis in relief efforts (Ling et al., 2017) . In Guinea during the Ebola crisis, the main challenges encountered by the frontline health workers and communities stemmed from the lack of trust and shared goals. \"The coordinators have been parachuted from the top, without asking for our opinion,\" a he alth personnel from one prefecture attested. There were strong resistance from the communities to Ebola control interventions because of the lack of proper sensitization measures for safe burial practices. The use of foreigners instead of locals in raising awareness further eroded the trust and was seen as an invasion (Thiam et al., 2015) . It was clear that the human components, in this case, the respect of local culture and engagement of the communities, contributed to building trust, which were foundational in achieving resilience of its system. Second, a resilient health system has foresight to invest in long -term slow variables of th e health system infrastructure and human resources. One of the common patterns of failed approaches to responding to a crisis was to prioritize on the so -called 'fast variables.' This was most evident in Liberia during the Ebola crisis, as donors and NGO f unding focused heavily on delivering these 'fast variables' in the form of temporary infrastructures, surveillance teams, infection prevention supplies, and isolation units t hat reached Liberia within months, whilst disregarding a longer term health system resilience. There were huge investments towards health worker training on infection prevention, but no emphasis on building a cadre of well -trained nurses that can serve the health system as a whole (Ling et al., 2017) . Similar problems plagued Sierra Leone and Nigeria during the Ebola crisis, as the health workforce was chronically understaffed, demotivated, and ill -equipped. These factors exacerbated the growing mistrust between service providers and communities (McPake et al., 2015) . In Nigeria, a medical doctor reported that \"a big challenge was a lack of standard quarantine station. The decision to use hospital Y as a treatment centre was a late o ne.\" Likewise, a lack of long -term infrastructure was reported to be one of the main c hallenges faced (Otu et al., 2018) . Meanwhile, in Lebanon, deliberate Ministry of Health policies to establish a career path for nurses, investing in training mo re nurses, and increasing nurses' salaries all contributed to a steady increase in the number of nurses working in the Lebanese health system even during the Syrian crisis. The health workforce catered to both refugee and Lebanese populations in 54 challenging times (Ammar et al., 2016) . Turkey a lso invested heavily in improving the structural capacity of its infrastructure by launching the EUR 1.129 million Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness (ISMEP) project. A significant reform work for healthcare infrastructure renovati on was undertaken to construct new healthcare facilities, and renovating existing facilities to mitigate seismic risk that are resistant to earthquakes (Achour et al., 2016) . These were all efforts to ensure long -term infrastructural readiness before the crisis. Building resilience is much more than preparedness, as echoed by Kruk et al, that it is about investing in systems and other 'slow variables' that can build a strong health system that functions both in crisis and in calm (Kruk et al., 2017) . Third, a resilient health system shows a high level of motivation, exhibited by strong political will and personal commitment . A strong sense of political will from the government had a stabilizing effect for frontline workers and the public. In Nigeria, the State Governor paid multiple visits to the hospitals and other facilities in the aftermath of major insurgencies and took active measures to improve infrastructural conditions, drug supplies, and human resource capabilities (Ager et al., 2015) . Chinese President Hu Jintao ordered a rapid disaster response effort to help the victims and communicated to reassure the public minutes a fter the earthquake. Premier Wen Jiabao also flew to the area within 90 minutes after the earthquake to manage rescue efforts. Interviewees reported a positive influence of these decisive leadership and political will. \"His presence on the scene had a posi tive impact on subsequent decisions, as the premier made such decisions with direct knowledge of the situation (Lin et al., 2014) .\" In Kenya, cholera outbreak responses were exemplary, which stemmed from committed health care workers willing to work overtime despite resource limitations. One health worker no ted \"if it were not the passion, the spread would have gone up, because without funds you have to have the passion to work on it.\" A deep personal commitment of frontline workers held the health system together no matter how fragile and resource constraine d the context seemed. Often these health care workers felt a sense of achievement and reward when they overcame resource challenges and showed a strong coordination between partners at the clinic and community levels (Curran et al., 2018) . These first thr ee themes namely, realigned relationships, foresight, and motivation, were shown to be the key intangible 'drivers of resilience' that enables the system to cope with shocks even in resource -constrained settings. These themes also relate with the health sy stem building blocks that require a permanent and long -term investment. Table 10. Relevant health system building blocks for the 'drivers of resilience' Health System Building Block Service delivery Human resources for health Other Health System Element Long -term adequate supply Staff Strong community 55 infrastructural readiness of trained health workforce motivation and commitment trust and engagement based on respect of culture # of studies shown as strengths 3 3 4 2 # of studies shown as weakness 5 4 0 2 Organisational mechanisms: change management and emergency preparedness Fourth, a resilient health system has a well -integrated system of new initiatives and reforms. There was a remarkable difference between the Jordanian and Lebanese systems during the immediate crisis periods, relating to the newly introduced health system reforms, the Family Health Team model and the E -Health system. In Lebanon, both reforms had onl y recently been introduced and placed a significant burden on its staff to fill both paper and electronic records. In contrast, these reforms had been implemented relatively early in Jordan. One of the support staff mentioned that staff got relieved with t he introduction of the e -health and the appointment function was helpful in managing high flow of patients which came with the crisis (Alameddine et al., 2019) . New initiatives and reforms on health system can only build resilience when well-integrated into the system. On the contrary, recent major changes to the health system governance in Kenya, specifically the dece ntralization of health services, may have contributed to the confusion of roles, reporting, and supply chain management. Some health care workers believed that the confusion of roles and responsibilities during the cholera response was due to the transitio n from a national health system to a decentralized system managed by county governments (Curran et al., 2018) . A study in Kilifi, Kenya identified a similar health system challenge, where the system's devolution seemed to aggravate issues (Nyikuri et al., 2015) . Changes in the health system structures and initiatives that are not fully integrated into the national health system appeare d to have exacerbated challenges experienced from the crisis. Fifth, a resilient health system has an emergency preparedness strategy in its national health system and implements it at al l levels. The Ministry of Health in Lebanon called upon international agencies to consider a strategy to integrate planning, finan cing, and service delivery by embedding refugee health care within the national health system. Through an establishment of a steeri ng committee, a \"Lebanese crisis response plan\" was drafted outlining all funding sources, activities, and coordination effor ts. This integrated approach to refugee health care made it possible for the refugees to settle and access the same level of heal th 56 care in Lebanon rather than to have a parallel system of delivery and financing systems care that are concentrated in the ca mps (Ammar et al., 2016) . Having a strategy is however only the first step. Turkey had a four -tier triage protocol in times of the earthquake: ambulatory, delayed, immediate, and deceased. This protocol, however, was not always used during the evacuation and dispatch processes. An interviewee stated that \"everybody knows what triage is, but they don't use it.\" Having a policy and strategy in place did not automatically translate into practice. As evident in Turkey's case, the triage protocol which was excellent on paper turn ed out t o be futile during the emergency (Achour et al., 2016) . When evaluating flood prepar edness in Sri Lanka, only around 13% of the health facilities had an emergency plan, all of which were in writing. Most health care workers never received trainings nor had received any instructive documents on disaster preparedness from the central govern ment (Farley et al., 2017) . The frustrations of the lack of systematic planning were echoed from hospital officials in India as well. \"We Indians are bet ter at dealing with a crisis situation, meaning we can tackle the crisis very well but we don't have a long term planning. Though the experience has increased awareness about influenza preparedness. Still we don't have public health machinery to document the influenza burden (Purohit et al., 2018) .\" These additional two themes which focused on change management and emergency preparedness served as 'operational mechanisms' for the system to be equipped with preparedness strategies that can be translated into action when required. Thes e themes relate with leadership and governance of the health system to establish laws, policies, and strategies and have the mechanism to enforce them at all levels. Table 11. Relevant health system building blocks for the 'organisational mechanisms of resilience' Health System Building Block Leadership and governance Health System Element enabling law, policy and strategy and enforcement Health system reforms well integrated and established # of studies shown as strengths 7 2 # of studies shown as weakness 1 2 4.5 Discussion Ten themes generated from this review were mapped onto a refined conceptual model as presented in Figure 7,: five themes indicative of resilient systems from Kruk et al's original framework (Kruk et al., 2017) , and five new themes that were attributes leading to resilience. As health systems are complex and evolving in nature, it is vital that resilience is viewed as a capac ity 57 that can be built rather than a static attribute, which underpins this review's findings (Topp, 2020) . Similarly, there is now a call to conceptualise health system strengthening, not just health system structures (Witter et al., 2019) . Common to both health system strengthening an d resilient responses to crises is social capital, which is comprised of relationships, trust, shared goals and collaboration. Social capital is pivotal in both crisis and calm, and critical in building the health system as well as t o enhance resilience. Blanchet et al used systems thinking and complexity theories to frame the governance of resilience as a capacity to anticipate and respond to uncertainties across a complex system, drawing on different forms of knowledge supported by the legitimacy of trust ed institutions and widely held norms (Blanchet et al., 2017) . Biddle et al applied this framework to the empirical literature and found that studies typically addressed single components of health systems rather than an inter -connected system as a whole and found a marked discr epancy between the frameworks of resilience and the applied cases of resilience, discrediting the legitimacy of the framework (Biddle et al., 2020) . By using a best -fit framework synthesis, this review employed Kruk et al's resilience framework, which was built upon the experiences from the Ebola response and frameworks from other disciplines (Kruk et al., 2015) , (Kruk et al., 2017) . Not only did the re view confirm the applicability of the framework's themes, but also revealed additional themes in the literature. These empirical findings confirm the role of trust and institutional legitimacy proposed by Blanchet et al and add to Biddle et al' s empirical analysis by identifying social capital as a key interconnecting mechanism to unlock the resilience of a health system. There are several additional observations that are relevant in explaining the mechanics of resilience. Figure 7. Refined Conceptual Model of Health System Resilience 58 First, when there is an acute shock, the health system has to consider the numerous challenges that are amplified by its uniq ue contextual vulnerabilities. This was evidenced in Nigeria where insecurity and movement restrictions from the insurgencies bred fear and anxiety in people that led to a mass migration of health workers, exposing the already fragile human resource for health conditions (Ager et al., 2015) . Likewise, an abrupt transition from a national to a decentralized system in Kenya led to major confusion in roles and responsibilities that resulted in inefficiencies in the cholera response efforts due to duplicated roles and coordination failures (Curran et al., 2018) . Fridell et al's recent scoping review underscores the importance of adjusting t o long -term changes in the health system as a key feature of resilience which reflects the country's leadership and governance (Fridell et al., 2020) . Hence, health systems should first focus on building its 'everyday resilience,' to deal with the day-to-day, chronic struggles arising from its weak gov ernance and political and economic instabilities that are inherent in the system, in order to better prepare fo r future shocks (Gilson et al., 2017a) , (Barasa et al., 2017) . Second, the foundations of resilience appear to be critical especially in resource -constrained settings to unlock the dynamic attributes of resilience suggested by Kruk et al (Kruk et al., 2017) in order for the system to achieve resilience. This requires a systems thinking approach to redefine the health system to serve its evolving purpose (Arnold and Wade, 2015) . Whether it be health systems of institutions or countries, taking a purpose -driven approach compels a transformation in its leadership, comm unication strategies, infrastructure, stakeholder engagement, and data surveillance methods (Pronovost et al., 2017) . This interplay between the foundations and the dynamic attributes of resilience extends Abimbola and Topp's definition of resilien ce as 'adaptation with robustness.' The authors argue that a daptation without robustness results in coping, whereas adaptation in the context of robustness brings resilience (Abimbola and Topp, 2018) . Robustness here refers to the capacity of the system to recover from shocks (Abimbola and Topp, 2018) . It is the designing and redesigning of the country's institutions in anticipation of future shocks, which is precisely the building of long -term foundations resilience with a purpose -driven approach. The criticism that came from India's hospital officials regarding the tendency of Indian public health services to ignore planning needs until a crisis demanded a response is the evidence of 'coping' as a result of the lack of foresight required to quickly shift the health system's purpose to deliver health services in crisis (Purohit et al., 2018) . A health system with a clear vision in serving its people in both crisis and calm will duly strengthen its health system infrastructure and train its human resource cadre to build the foundations of its health system. Only then, can the system exhibit the dynamic features of resilience, being 'aware' of its capacity and risks, meeting the 'diverse' needs, and 'adapting' to the evolving situation. Third, strong working relationships, often realigned , provided a glue to the health system that enabled low - and middle - income countries to overcome resource constraints and structural barriers. This shared sense of vision to deliver health services to 59 crisis -affected population enabled two historically te nse nations to overcome political barriers and a faith -based NGO hospital to fill the void of the public health care system (Lin et al., 2014) , (McPake et al., 2015) . This notion is echoed by Barasa et al's systems intangible 'software' (e.g. norms, power, trust), which was identified as the key driver of resilience that can activ ate the attributes of system resilience (Barasa et al., 2018) . Topp stresses that health systems are social systems manifesting complex power relations, and that resilience is highly dependent on the way the health system is governed (Topp, 2020) . Blanchet echoes the importance of developing legitimate institutions that can enable systemic resilience (Blanchet et al., 2017) . The cases of highly resilient health systems in this review exhibited 'realigned relationships' as a response to shock management, which indicates that the gove rnance structure of the health system was temporarily shifted in favour of the common goal. Existing bureaucratic procedures, hierarchies, decision -making protocols were at times bent in order to work on collaborative terms. Finally, this review h as confirmed that the facets of resilience are not only reserved for strong health systems in high -income countries, but are capacities that can be acquired through a process of reflection, learning and devising creative ways of bu ilding the foundations of resilience. The review's inclusion of only low - and middle - income countries highlights the key features of resilience regardless of the status of its health system. Van des Pas' view of resilience as a moral obligation for all count ries implies that buil ding resilience is an investment towards extending global public goods for health (van de Pas et al., 2017) . Strengths and limitations This review is the first to apply a best -fit framework synthesis approach to identify key features of resilience using empirical evidence. This allowed us not only to test Kruk et al's framework with empirical data, but to build o n it through further empirical analysis. It also has the potential to make a timely contribution to the global health systems literature based on its refine d conceptual model that can be applied to low - and middle - income contexts. It adopts systematic met hods and internationally recognised reporting standards.As the review commenced before the Covid -19 outbreak, however, studies from the latest pandemic has not been included. The authors were still able to draw upon their immediate experiences during the p andemic in different contexts to recognise gaps in the evidence. Among these were the lack of attention given to social determinants of health, health inequalities, and the role of party politics, all critical aspects revealed from the Covid -19 crisis that affect resilience. Further studies should explore elaborating on these topics and for these concepts to be substantiated with real w orld evidence, and to be tested for their applicability in high -income countries as well. 4.6 Conclusion To date, this is th e first review to test the attributes of resilience specifically in the health sector and which offers a refined 60 framework that can be applied in low - and middle - income settings. This review prompts low - and middle - income countries to consider building t he foundations of resilience described here as a priority to better prepare for future shocks. These foundations for achieving resilience are realigned relationships, foresight, motivation, emergency preparedness, and change management. A collective respon se on the topic is of prime importance for all countries in order to adhere to the International Health Regulations (IHR) and its global health security agenda if we are to minimize the damage of the next pandemic.

Design and Setting This is an explanatory qualitative study exploring the institutional capacity of resilience in Myanmar's health system. Analysis proceeded using a data -driven thematic analysis closely following the framework method. This process enabled comparisons and co ntrasts of key emergent themes between the participants, which later generated key results describing the foundational assets, barriers and opportunities for achieving resilience in Myanmar. Participants The study comprised of 12 in -depth intervi ews conducted with representatives from international organisations and non - governmental organisations. The inclusion criteria to recruiting the participants were that they had directly been a part of the Cyclone Nargis response at the time. There was a ba lanced distribution of participants across UN, bilateral, and NGOs and most of them were either Myanmar citizens or expatriates with extensive working experience based in Myanmar. Results Key findings elucidate the characteristics of resilience that have b een salient or absent in Myanmar's response to Cyclone Nargis. Strong social capital and motivation propelled by its deep -rooted culture and religion served as Myanmar's greatest assets that filled major gaps in the system. Meanwhile, its post -colonial and military legacy posed barriers towards investing in building its long -term foundations towards resilience. Conclusions This study revealed that resilience in the health system can be built through strategic investments towards building the foundations of resilience to better prepare for future shocks. In the case of Myanmar, social capital and motivation, which surfaced as its foundational assets can be channelled into opportunities that can help achieve its long -term health goals, accelerating its journey towards resilience in the health system. 63 5.2 Introduction Health system resilience The 2014 -15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa served as a turning point in global health. Resilience was introduced as a concept relevant in the discourses for health system strengthening as well as for crisis management in fragile settings (Health Systems Research, 2016) . Since then, there has been a plethora of literature trying to define, measure, and characterize the concept (Barasa et al., 2018) , (Fridell et al., 2020) , (Biddle et al., 2020) . Resilience is once again receiving more attention than ever with the failure to contain the on -going battle against Covid -19 pandemic. Health system resilience is defined as the capacity to prepare for and effectively respond to crises whilst retaining core health system functions when a crisis hits. An important aspect concerns the capability of the system to reorganise itself to meet t he evolving needs of the situation (Kruk et al., 2015) . Several scholars among many have proposed v arying conceptual frameworks in order to elucidate the complex nature of health system resilience. In the aftermath of the Ebola crisis, Kruk et al responded to the growing demands of multilateral organisa tions to illustrate five key characteristics of a r esilient health system and a proposed resilience index corresponding to these five characteristics to measure resilience (Kruk et al., 2017) . Blanchet et al proposed a new model of resilience as an underlying management and governance capacity to absorb, adapt and transform itself in case of a shock (Blanchet et al., 20 17). Gilson et al and Barasa et al introduced the idea of 'everyday resilience,' highlighting the capacities and resources that are required when delivering health services every day, which have to be built over a l onger period to address chronic deficiencies in the health system (Gilson et al., 2017a) , (Barasa et al., 2017) . Building on these ideas, Grimm et al have synthesized empirical studies from low - and middle - income countries to confirm Kruk et al's five attributes of resilience and to id entify five new characteristics that can serve as foundations to be prioritized in resource -constrained settings to unlock system -level resilience (Grimm et al., 2021b) . As Grimm et al's five key foundations of resilience are critical inputs to activate Kruk et al's five key attributes of resilience, the paper has employed the five key attributes to develop the interview guide. The analysis applies Grimm et al. 2021's framework composed of ten characteristics of resilience to test its applicability in Myanmar's specific context. In addition to the relevant frameworks, the role of the communities is critical when discussing resilience in low - and middle - income countries. A few empirical studies have revealed the vital role community engagement plays in building trust in the 64 health system, which is in turn intricately linked with effect ive management of crises (Barker et al., 2020) , (Bhandari et al., 2020) , (Alon ge et al., 2019) . Cyclone Nargis and its legacy for Myanmar A category three Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar on the 2nd of May, 2008, affecting more than 50 townships and devastating mainly the Ayeyarwady Division and its capital, Yangon. It is recorded as Myanmar's worst natural disasters in recorded history (Tripartite Core Group, 2008) . Within this area, the official death toll was estimated 138,000 (Univers ite catholique de Louvain (UCL), 2021) , but the damage had severely affected at least 2.4 million lives in the most affected regions. Not only did the cyclone result in a widespread destruction of homes and major infrastructure, but close to 75% of the health facilities were damaged in the affected townships. Most of the destroyed facilities were that of primary health care, which exacerbated healthcare access to the rural poor and amplified economic inequalities (Tripartite Core Group, 2008) , (Warr and Aung, 2019) . The Myanmar government at the time missed the critical period following the cyclone to implement essential measures to save lives and provide relief efforts (Stover a nd Vinck, 2008) . The agreement to issue visas for foreign humanitarian aid workers and allow international assistance came three weeks after the storm, only after the UN Secretary -General Ban Ki -moon visited Yangon to plead with General Than Shwe, the h ead of the military state (UN Press, 2008) . To this day, the response to Cyclone Nargis reverberates lessons for the international community. Objectives The aim of this study is to understand how the characteristics of health system resilience have played out in Myanmar's response to Cyclone Nargis and to explore ways to improve resilience at the system level. Using a refined conceptual framework for healt h system resilience developed previously, this paper analyses Myanmar's assets and barriers to achieving health system resilience and highlights the lessons learnt from its devastating past with the hope that the lessons may be transferrable to other count ries (Grimm et al., 2021b) . 5.3 Methods Study setting This is an explanatory qualitative study exploring the organisational capacity of resilience in Myanmar's health system. Myanmar was recently ranked second on the Global Climate Risk Index of countries most affected by extreme weather events from 1999 to 2 018 (David Eckstein, 2019) , and 17th out of 191 countries on the Index for Risk Management (INFORM), which assesses the risk of hum anitarian crisis and disasters that could overwhelm national capacity to respond 65 (European Commission, 2019) . It is prone to various natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, droughts, and fires, which have intensified with the effects of climate change (UNOCHA, 2017) . Myanmar's national health plan (2017 -2021) highlights Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as its overarching goal and the Ministry of Health and Sports have initiated steps to improve compliance to the International Health Regulations (IHR) in the recent years (Minis try of Health and Sports of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, 2016) , (Pyone et al., 2020) . Initiated by the Union Minister of Health and Sports, Myanmar was the third country in the Southeast Asia region to take part in the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) in 2017 to assess the country's capacity under the IHR to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats (World Health Organization, 2017) . In order to follow -up on the recommendations from the JEE findings, Myanmar's Ministry of Health and Sports have developed a five year National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS) (Ministry of Health and Sports, 2018) . These efforts demonstrate the country's political will to embark on a journey towards building the foundations of health system resilience. Study design and participants The study comprised of 12 in -depth inter views conducted between January and February 2020, with its participants purposively selected through a snowball sampling of relevant referrals via contacts introduced through the author PYG's existing network whilst working and living in Myanmar (Naderifar et al., 2017) . This proved as an effective method to track participants that had been directly involved in the response efforts of Cyclone Nargis in 2008. In order to partially offset a possible recall bias due to the time lag between the actual event and data collecti on, triangulation through supplementary data such as event pictures, reports and media clips were provided by the participants when available, to add to the validity of t he data collected. Among the many stakeholder groups, only those who had represented o r currently represents international organisations and non -governmental organisations have been included in the interviews. There was a balanced distribution of participants across affiliations and nationalities. There were five UN staff, three bilateral r epresentatives, three NGO workers, six Myanmar citizens and six expatriates. As the interviews targeted a single stakeholder group, the 12 interviews were shown sufficient to reach data saturation (Guest et al., 2006) . Data collection The interviews lasted between 1 -1.5 hours respectively and were conducted in -person by the author PYG (PhD Candidate) in English. There were no prior exchanges between the participants and the data collector and the interviews were held in private office spaces of the participants. A semi -structured interview guide was developed to explore the roles of the 66 participant, actions taken as an organisation, and perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses in the health system at the ti me of the crisis. The questions were framed around Kruk et al's five dimensions of resilience (Kruk et al., 2015) . See supplementary file for the full interview guide. All interviews have been audio -recorded following informed consent and thereafter transcribed verbatim. Interviewees were approached a second time via video conference in order to verify the accuracy of the transcripts. Data analysis Analysis proceeded using a data -driven thematic analysis, closely following the steps of the framework method (Gale et al., 2013) . Verbatim transcriptions and field notes were reviewed for familiarization and verified for accuracy. Follo wing the development of an initial codebook inspired by the ten themes previously developed by the author's team, all transcripts were coded line -by-line using MAXQDA 2018. A hybrid of deductive and inductive approaches provided for a broader structure of the categories and flexibility of codes from the open coding process. As illustrated in Figure 8, Grimm et al's conceptual framework was used to develop the analytical framework (Grimm et al., 2021b) . The framework was then applied systematically to chart the relevant summary of the transcript with direct quotations structured around 10 categories and 21 codes, resulting in a complete framework matrix. This process enabled comparisons and contrasts of key emergent themes between the participants, which later ge nerated key results describing the foundational assets, barriers and opportunities for achieving resilience in Myanmar. A few of the interviewees provided feedback on the final analysis through a subsequent virtual meeting arranged by the author. Figure 8. Grimm et al's health system r esilience framework 67 Ethical considerations The proposal for this study was approved in Myanmar by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Public Health and the Ministry of Health and Sports of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (2020/Research/4). It has also received clearance in Swit zerland Ethikkommission Nord -west und Zentralschweiz (Req -2019 -00348). Patient and public involvement The research was done without public involvement. 5.4 Results The results section presents key findings elucidating the characteristics of resilience that have been salient in Myanmar's response to Cyclone Nargis. The results are categorised into assets, barriers, and future opportunities for achieving health system resilience. Foundational assets that can unlock Myanmar's health system resilience Strong social capital comprised of informal channels and trusted networks Most participants pointed to the extensive role that the informal sector plays in filling the gaps of the health system. A ca se in point, the ambulance system in Myanmar is currently charity -based and subjected to resource availability from various donors. The township hospitals themselves have to seek out appropriate charity groups to maintain the referral system comprised of ambulances and drivers. Likewise, when Cyclone Nargis hit, there were various community -based organisations as first responders of t he crisis, offering food, shelter and basic commodities to the affected villages. Strong social capital in Myanmar were exhibited mainly through informal channels, whether it be via monasteries and community - based charity groups. They were able to operate without legal mandates and special memorandum of understanding, precisely because they have obtained people's trust and leveraged the familiarity of their own network. One NGO worker described: \"There was an existing social community that was ready to d onate to religious events and they were actively involved and participated in the relief efforts after Nargis hit. Each village has a social committee and the religious leaders in the monastry have their own shelters for the affected people who sought refu ge. The communities themselves know their needs and gaps the best, which can build resilience.\" (I09) In a context where access to the affected regions were limited for the first three weeks after the cyclone, community engagement proved vital in offering timely support. It was apparent that participants who visited the affected areas 68 experienced severe logistical challenges. Some of the areas were only accessible by boat or in off -road conditions where a robust 4x4 vehicle was required. In this endemically challenging environment, mobile clinics were established to reach the communities in remote areas. All the more in these contexts, community -based resilience was not optional but imperative. \"People had to travel long distances to access health care, wh ich severely limited preventative care and people accessing the health system...One thing that consistently stood out to me was the incredible self -sufficiency of the communities themselves, their resilience, and their ability to get back on their feet with the limited resources that they had.\" (I11) Referring back to the example of charity -based ambulances, a few participants stated their concerns that this heavy reliance on informal channels can in turn be a barrier towards building basic systematic preparedness, as often these groups can run without standardized procedures and beget further inequalities in service delivery. A basic preparedness however is not equipped because of this reliance on informal channels. Not all township hospitals have ambulances. Apparently, there is no standard. An amb ulance and a driver are not part of a township health department set up. (I06) As evidenced through Cyclone Nargis, social capital albeit informal in nature served as an asset for Myanmar in both crisis and calm. Cultural and religious commitment as a pr opeller for motivation Underpinning the strong social capital lay the commitment of community -based groups as the backbone of relief efforts. Many attested that Myanmar's history of prolonged isolation and under -development led to a stronger demonstration of resilience at the community level especially in a situation of emergency. In Myanmar, volunteerism is a common method of civic participation (Dove, 2017) . The motivation for this commitment appeared to have stemmed from the people's religious and cultural beliefs to give to charity and donate to the less fortunate, which al so manifested in the case of Nargis. A UN staff member shared: \"People in a community supporting other people in need is a powerful response. Most believe that it's because they were closed off for so long, and it was just helping themselves, and the nature of the general beliefs and teachings of the country. People will go to churches, pagodas, temples, monastries or other public buildings to shelter, and the community there will provide food for a couple of days generally.\" (I07) Traditional social w elfare support groups revolving often through informal channels played a vital role at the village level and many self -help groups sprung up spontaneously to join the momentum (World Health Organization, 2014a) . The 69 monasteries even had an informal system to store food collected through donations and shared them with the communities in need. They were the sole sources of aid in the immediate aftermath of Cyclone Nargis until support arrived from the government and UN agencies, which proved as a clear asset. Several interviewers echoed that these social determinants of religion and culture provided a supporting environment for subsequent relief projects to flourish. \"The Buddhist culture compels people to donate to those in need and the monks. The first responses ha ve always come from the people/monasteries, later from the government and finally from the UN agencies. It's because it's part of the culture, all these donations.\" (I01) \"There are social determinants at play in the response to Nargis. At the time of the disaster, 90% of the people were Buddhist. Those from non -affected townships even came. Came to donate. This is the culture of Buddhism. Supporting environment was religion.\" (I05) Community resilience in Myanmar seems to have been built on a stronger foun dation because it stems from religion and culture as a motivating force. The powerful source of solidarity within some of the affected communities weathered through generations of political and ethnic divisions. Barriers to Myanmar's journey towards res ilience Historical legacy affecting transparency, openness and decentralisation When reflecting upon the aftermath of the cyclone, all participants called out the lack of transparency and openness in how the government had dealt with the crisis at hand. The government at the time did not convey the exact situation analysis to the publ ic, withheld key information about the cyclone, and controlled data such as the degree of damage and casualties incurred. Such lack of transparency not only undermined public trust towards the government but also limited international response teams from a ccessing Myanmar, which resulted in an overall delay in collective response efforts. \"The government at that time was so quiet and the civil society has not seen the first response from the government. INGOs were not able to access the area until three we eks after the cyclone hit. Perhaps, this is the reason why the government also tried to hide the information as much as possible, for instance, the number of casualties, number of shelters required, etc. We learnt the lack of government information is tied to the lack of accountability.\" (I10) Though the reasons may be complex, most respondents pointed to Myanmar's long history of military rule that has operated based on a rigid hierarchy and centralized decision -making system, a context that may not have b een conducive for disaster management. There was no proper disaster management mechanism in place; rather, coordination was led through the health cluster. As it had been a highly centralized system, however, the senior general still had the final say and was initially not 70 open to collaborating with the outside world. \"Everything had to be reported and decided by the senior general (Than Swe)..Whatever he said, everybody has to do it.\" (I04) To this day, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is signed at t he national level, not with the state. The requests may be made locally, but the final say comes centrally. One participant stated that this hierarchical structure produces dissonant voices at different levels, complicating the decision -making process and posing a risk of not meeting the actual needs on the ground. Another participant echoed this sentiment: \"Myanmar is too centralized, which poses a key challenge towards building a resilient health system. Evidence - based planning at the local level is not possible. For example, prevention of the polio outbreak that occurred in Hpa-bun would have been possible if local collaboration with the ethnic organisation could be done at the state level, where states have the decision making power and have fiscal dece ntralisation.\" (I06) Many participants pointed to theadded layer of complication from the presence of ethnic armed groups in self -administered zones that are run independently of the government as a result of its ongoing strife towards independence (Jolliffe, 2015) . These special subnational administrations run by multiple ethnic groups not only have their own health system parallel to tha t of the Myanmar government but selectively collaborates with local NGOs and community -based groups where there are no conflicts of interest. One participant shared that the polio outbreak in May of 2019 in one of these self -administered regions was particu larly difficult to contain due to lack of information shared and restricted access to the area. \"Often ethnic health organisations work in these areas to provide services, and some are in fact coordinating well with the ministry. But, access can be difficult, as in the case of the polio outbreak, and the ethnic health organisation wouldn't let the ministry in nor UN agencies. They only allow one NGO they trust to have access. \"If you're looking at some kind of outbreak, there is a needed preparedness element by the ministry, but they also need to consider this other factor that is not something that other countries should necessarily worry about.\" (I06) Often UN agencies and NGOs offer to bridge these gaps in services, yet these two parallel systems pose great challenges for international actors to maneuver through the bureaucracies in these conflict zones. It is an ongoing challenge that Myanmar needs to overcome in order to reach an inclusive state of resilience at the national level. Lack of investments in long -term variables of resilience Cyclone Nargis revealed the fragility of its health system, especially the areas that had required long -term inv estments. One participant that had worked with the UN agency during this time depicted how dire the situation had been. 71 \"The basic fabrics of the health system were not existing. There was not a place to even fit supplies, medicines and computers. Many Rural Health Centres ( RHCs ) were not functioning well, many times lacking midwives and essential medicine. The nurse to patient ratio was too low and building the nursing infrastructure was critical.\" (I04) According to these first -hand accounts, Myanmar still had a very basic infrastructure, township hospitals covering up to 200,000 people, and a rural health centre serving around 20,000 -25,000 people (Tripartite Core Group, 2008) . A typical rural health centre had a midwife but this was not necessarily the case in remote and hard -to-reach villages. Health worker shortages came up in all the interviews as a major obstacle for Myanmar's achieving its Universal Health Coverage goal, let alone its journey towards resilience. One UN staff indicated that on average only 54% of the sanctioned health worker posts are filled in Myanmar and building a strong human resource cadre that is evenly distributed across the health system requires a conscious long -term commitment and investment from the government. \"Though development cooperation can support buildings, supplies and equipments, robust human resources require a long-term commitment and investment that should come from the government..I mean, the largest issue of Myanmar is that you have only 54% of sanctioned posts filled. Even the 54%, if you see differences in regions.\" (I06) All participants stressed the importance of investing in long -term infrastructure, including its health workfo rce across the country, particularly focusing on extending its health system coverage to remote and vulnerable areas in order to build resilience of the health system as a whole. However, the stark inequalities in remote areas and the frequent staff turnov er at all levels of the government were reflections of poor working conditions and weak human resource policies. Participants currently working for a major UN agency shared that funding additional trainings may not be the solution to this health workforce challenge. \"Because of the weakness in the human resource policy, and the working nature of the government job, many government staff are resigning, quitting their jobs. We are losing qualified candidates. Human resource is a major challenge...I know many trainings were supported by organisations and donors, but the problem is the retention of human resource. After the trainings, they move or resign. I think training should not be the key weakness.\" (I02) Some specifically referred to the importance of fore sight for these long -term commitments. There seems to be a significant gap between plans on paper and implementation as mentioned by one civil society representative: \"The challenge in the state/region is human resource shortages, especially medical doct ors. The analysis of the ministry of health national health plan reveals that across the country there is a health service gap due to the lack of 72 human resources. There are not enough medical doctors trained through the medical universities. The government already has a plan, but there is a big implementation gap.\" (I10) Myanmar's future for resilience Harnessing social capital to unleash the power of collective civic duty through civil society groups As echoed by multiple participants, Myanmar appears to have the ingredients for resilience within its own respective communities. Not only did existing community -based groups act as first responders of Cyclone Nargis albeit decades of dictatorship, but eve n the coordination took place naturally and provided mutual support. It was simply the people exhibiting civic duty and playing their due role in the society. One representative of a local civil society group shared that health sy stem resilience may be rea ched when civil society groups build community resilience and start working together with a health system that is also investing in building its strengths. \"At the time of the cyclone, the local civil society groups in each area organised and coordi nated with each other by themselves. We haven't seen any government, like red cross, or police. We haven't seen any solider. During the Cyclone Nargis, we have seen the communities, the people, how did they respond. They came out to the street and they sup ported each other. They tried to remove all the trees and blocks. We learnt from them. We have strong resilient communities. Communities know best what the biggest challenge and needs are in those areas. If we work together, community resilience strengthen ing and health system strengthening, we could be working towards resilience.\" (I10) The informal channels of self -formed community -based groups can be a strong basis for the institutionalization of civil society groups that have a rather complicated relati onship with the government. Since Myanmar has opened up in 2011 under President Thein Sein, its reform process has gradually enabled a platform for civil society to establish civil liberties thro ugh its '2008 Constitution,' with the article 354 stating the right to freedom of expression, assembly and association (Buschmann and Soe, 2020) . Furthermore, the Parliament has enacted the Association Registration Law, which defines and clarifies local and international non -governmental organizations and stipulates requirements to register with the government. These r eforms have gradually shifted the landscape of civil society engagements at all levels of the country. Even at the national level, the government has been more receptive to the inputs of the civil society groups, including the Ministry of Health and Sport s with many of its community -driven development projects. There are certainly growing opportunities for civil society groups to participate in the various development sector working groups (Asian Development Bank, 2015) . One participant reflects on the evolution of civil society engagement since Cyclone Nargis and projects that no 73 crisis can be handled without the involvement of the country 's civil society groups. \"The health system at that time was already weak and the ministry of health didn't have a strong coordination with the civil society or community groups. The government organised many meetings but had no idea how to work with the local civil society. Only in the last four years did this relationship change. The minister of health stressed the importance of working with CSOs across the country. If an outbreak were to happen, the ministry of health cannot handle the situation with out civil societies.\" (I10) Connecting its overarching health goals with long -term investments to improve resilience As Myanmar is situated in a disaster -prone area, it has naturally developed a local expertise over time through handling its yearly flo ods. One participant stated that there is an emergency fund stipulated by law to set aside a disaster management fund that can be used to support sub -national levels in case of a potential crisis. How the legal frameworks and plans align with its budgeting and allocation, however, is a different issue. A recurring theme that transpired when discussing the government's response to the cyclone and other subsequent crises were the emergence of discrepancies between planning, budgeting and implementation. As t here has been no clear alignment between its long -term health policy and crisis management, the targeted investment towards building system -level resilience has also lagged behind. \"There is very remote connection between planning and budgeting. It happ ens both at the national and local levels. Preparedness is there on paper.\" (I06) One participant called this the ability to \"expand and contract,\" which also corresponds to the concept of adaptiveness in Kruk et al's framework. It is exhibited by the abil ity to reallocate its resources to where it is most needed on time and to delegate the authority to the appropriate decentralized administration when necessary (Kruk et al., 2017) . It is a vital characteristic of resilience, which is a by-product of long -term investments and painstaking reforms (Kutzin and Sparkes, 2016) . \"This kind of planning, the constant expansion and contraction that you would need in an environment like Myanmar tha t's so natural disaster heavy, is difficult.\" (I07) Many participants agreed that Myanmar ought to invest towards building long -term infrastructure especially in remote areas and prioritize in its human resource preparedness in order to build resilience in the system for future shocks. This may involve employing creative ways to increase staff retention through the engagement of the private and non -profit sectors. More importantly, however, these plans ought to connect back to its overarching national goal for Universal Health Coverage 74 and its momentum to strengthen its commitment towards International Health Regulations. \"In order to improve health system resilience, it is necessary to improve infrastructure needed at the village level... A challenge in buil ding the long -term capacity of health workers, however, is the frequent turnover of staff. Mostly staff assigned for the rural health centres are based there for 1 -2 years and move to a better place. Turnover was quite quick.\" (I09) 5.5 Discussion This study explored the degree to which key characteristics of health system resilience manifested in Myanmar's response to Cyclone Nargis and their respective historical and socio -political determinants. As health systems are complex and evolving in natur e, it is important to predicate this study on the view that resilience is a capacity that can be nurtured with time and commitment (Topp, 2020) . Moreover, facets of resilience should not be seen as disconnected inputs, but rather a holistic result of targeted investments and a series of structural reforms (Grimm et al., 2021b) , (Kutzin and Sparkes, 2016) . In the case of Myanmar, it had been the 'everyday resilience' of its frontline workers and communities that had been built through its day -to-day chronic struggles in the context of its weak governance and political and economic vulnerabilities, that in turn prepared them for the unexpected shock (Gilson et a l., 2017a) . As depicted in Figure 9 , key themes that emerged from the analysis have been organised into assets, barriers and future opportunities in describing Myanmar's journey towards resilience. Figure 9. Assets, barriers and opportunities for Myanmar's journey towards health system resilience First, social capital and motivation have surfaced as key foundational assets in Myanmar that are indicative of its community 75 resilience. The power of collective civic duty filled the service gaps that the government had failed to provide in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone. The social capital present in Myanmar during Cyclone Nargis were comprised of informal channels and trusted networks in the communities, its motivation stemm ing from a deeper faith rooted in religion and culture. A recent qualitative synthesis highlighted social capital as the interconnecting mechanism common to both health system strengthening and resilient responses to crises, a powerful tool that can unlock resilience of the health system (Grimm et al., 2021b) . This study extends the not ion a step further by demonstrating that the power of social capital can go beyond its health system capacity. Social capital may in fact play a more important role in providing relief from the cyclone , just as it had been reported as being more vital in m itigating the spread of the Ebola virus than any donor -driven short -term interventions (Alonge et al., 2019) . The pivotal role social capital plays in building community resilience have been well documented by other studies in the context of both natural and man -made disasters (Bianca, 2018) , (Aldrich and Meyer, Saulnier, 2021) . When communities themselves start carrying out critical health system functions, this collec tive momentum for community resilience prompts what Barker et al calls a 'fortuitous cycle' of increased trust, improved communication and continued meaningful community engagement, all of which are crucial preconditions for enabling health system resilien ce (Barker et al., 2020) . Second, Myanmar's historical legacy of prolonged military rule and a lack of long -term investments posed as major barriers to achieving resilience. Th e lack of transparency and openness stood out as the biggest obstacle towards crisis management, which undermined public trust towards the government and hampered international response teams from accessing Myanmar in the initial stages. Myanmar is a prime example of a post -colonial state which development experts describes as a 'conflict trap' (Smith, 2007) . The legacy of the colonial experience, ethnic insurgencies, and a successive military rule, shifted all of its government's priorities to regaining its national sovereignty and ensuring security through increased military spending (Than, 1998) . Consequently, little had been left for health and social welfare, with only approximately 2% of its Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) spent on health care shortly before the cyclone hit (World Heal th Organization, 2014a) . It is no surprise that Myanmar's health system was fragile and not ready to handle a disaster of such magnitude. Governance practices influence organizational resilience and decentralized governments are certainly at an advanta ge to exhibit the necessary flexibility and timely responses required in crisis management (Barasa et al., 2018) . Having a decentralized governance structure itself, however, does not guarantee a successful response. China had no national disaster management agency nor related policies during the Sichuan earthquake, but effectively controlle d the emergency with its President's charismatic leadership and vertical administrative structure (Lin et al., 2014) . Myanmar's centralized and 76 hierarchical system could have been used for Myanmar's advantage, but an adequate disaster management had not been the priority of the government. A common pattern acro ss failed attempts in responding to a crisis was to prioritize on the 'fast variables,' delivering services in the form of temporary shelters and supplies without considering its longer -term infrastructure building, as it had been in the case of Liberia du ring its Ebola crisis (Ling et al., 2017) . Building resilience, however, is much more than preparedness, as Kruk et al states, that it requires investing in systems and its corresponding 'slow variables' that can function in both crisis and calm (Kruk et al., 2017) . A health system that has a clear foresight for its people will strengt hen its health system infrastructure and train its human resource cadre to build the foundations of its health system (Grimm et al., 2021b) . In the context of Myanmar, it would mean to apply a systems thinking approach in examining its past shortcomings and redesigning its institutions and organisational structures to serve its evolving purpose and prepare for future shocks (Arnold and Wade, 2015) . Third, Myanmar may channel its assets into opportunities by using its growing civil society platforms and leveraging its long-term national health goals. Cyclone Nargis revealed that Myanmar has the key ingredients for resilience within its own communities through its people exhibiting their civic duty. Civil society has had a long history in Myanmar dating back to its informal Buddhist associations in the traditional kingdoms and various other religious groups organizing social and welfare programmes durin g its colonial period and beyond (Kramer, 2011) . Since Cyclone Nargis, the space for civil societies further expanded throug h its legal reforms but at the end of the day only a few have been able to obtain official registration and secure a sustainable funding mechanism (Kramer, 2011) . According to the Civil Society Survey conducted in 2019, despite its marked progress, a wide range of obstacles still remain and hinder civil societies from reaching their goals (Buschmann and Soe, 2020) . Myanmar has set ambitious national goals to reach Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and to improve compliance to the International Health Regulations (IHR) in order to ensure healthcare and health security for all (Ministry of Health and Sports of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, 2016) , (Ministry of Health and Sports, 2018) . As evident in its neighbouring countries, however, civil society engagement and community feedback loops for policy and decision -making processes have shown as prerequisites to accelerate progress towards achieving these compendium of goals (Yeoh et al., 2019) . Trust and accou ntability at all levels in the system are what builds the 'capacity of legitimacy,' a crucial component of resilient health systems, that can only be strengthened through an inclusive consultation process of engaging communities and civil society groups (Blanchet et al., 2017) . Myanmar has to realize that strategically leveraging these opportunities may be the fastest route to building resilience. 77 The findings of this study offer tangible suggestions for Myanmar to invest on building its hard and soft long -term infrastructures in remote areas, prioritising in human resource preparedness, and redesigning institutions and organisational structures to serve its evolving purposes and to prepare for future shocks. Study Strengths and Limitations This study is empirical in nature, building on a health system resilience conceptual framework developed from a previous systematic review. The fram ework has been tested for the first time for its applicability in a lower -middle -income country. Regarding the study design, the long time lag between the actual event and data collection introduces a potential recall bias, which was partially offset by tr iangulation through supplementary data such as reports, event pictures and media clips provided by the participants. The topic of health system resilience has a potential to make a timely contribution to the health systems and policy research community, wi th lessons generated that can be transferrable to other contexts. Due to Covid -19 pandemic's travel restrictions imposed during the data collection period, the study only represents the view of international organisations and non -governmental organisations , restricting the scope of the study to the perceptions of a single stakeholder group. Further studies should explore capturing a wider range of stakeholders, the perceptions of communities, frontline workers and government staff that may be able to offer a more holistic view of the phenomenon. 5.6 Conclusion This study revealed that resilience in the health system can be built through targeted investments towards building the foundations of resilience to better prepare for future shocks. In the case of Mya nmar, social capital and motivation, which surfaced as its foundational assets, may be channelled into opportunities that can help achieve its long -term health goals, accelerating its journey towards resilience in the health system.

A qualitative analysis of the perspectives of Swiss NGOs Pauline Yongeun Grimm1,2*, Kaspar Wyss1,2 1) Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland. 2) University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. * Corresponding author Published in Globalization and Health , May 2022, 18:55 79 6 What makes health systems resilient? A qualitative analysis of the perspectives of Swiss NGOs 6.1 Abstract Background: Resilience has become relevant than ever before with the advent of increasing and intensifying shocks on the health system and its amplified effects due to globalization. Using the example of non -state actors based in Switzerland, the aim of this study is to explore how and to what extent NGOs with an interest in global health have dealt with unexpected shocks on the health systems of their partner countries and to reflect on the practical implications of resilience for the multiple actors involved. Consequ ently, this paper analyses the key attributes of resilience that targeted investments may influence, and the different roles key stakeholders may assume to build resilience. Methods: This is a descriptive and exploratory qualitative study analysing the pe rspectives on health system resilience of Swiss -based NGOs through 20 in -depth interviews. Analysis proceeded using a data -driven thematic analysis closely following the framework method. An analytical framework was developed and applied systematically res ulting in a complete framework matrix. The results are categorised into the expected role of the governments, the role of the NGOs, and practical future steps for building health system resilience. Results: The following four key 'foundations of resilience' were found to be dominant for unleashing greater resilience attributes regardless of the nature of shocks: 'realigned relationships,' 'foresight,' 'motivation,' and 'emergency preparedness.' The attribute to 'integrate' was shown to be one of the most crucial characteristics of resilience expected of the national governments from the NGOs, which points to the heightened role of governance. Meanwhile, as a key stakeholder group that is becoming inevitably mo re powerful in international development cooperation and global health governance, non -state actors namely the NGOs saw themselves in a unique position to facilitate knowledge exchange and to support long -term adaptations of innovative solutions that are i ncreasing in demand. The strongest determinant of resilience in the health system was the degree of investments made for building long -term infrastructures and human resource development which are well - functioning prior to any potential crisis. Conclusion s: 80 Health system resilience is a collective endeavour and a result of many stakeholders' consistent and targeted investments. These investments open up new opportunities to seek innovative solutions and to keep diverse actors in global health accountable. The experiences and perspectives of Swiss NGOs in this article highlight the vital role NGOs may play in building resilient health systems in their partner countries. Specifically, strong governance, a bi -directional knowledge exchange, and the focus on le veraging science for impact can draw greater potential of resilience in the health systems. Governments and the NGOs have unique points of contribution in this journey towards resilience and bear the responsibility to support governments to prioritise inve sting in the key 'foundations of resilience' in order to activate greater attributes of resilience. Resilience building will not only prepare countries for future shocks but bridge the disparate health and development agenda in order to better address the nexus between humanitarian aid and development cooperation. Keywords: Health System Resilience, Complex Sho cks, Qualitative Research, NGOs 6.2 Background Since the 2014 -15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, a deluge of literature has been published to elucidate the concept within the health sector, as traditionally the term had been discussed mainly in the engineering sciences, ecology and developmental psychol ogy (Barasa et al., 2018) , (Fridell et al., 2020) , (Biddle et al., 2020) , (Turenne et al., 2019) . Health system resilience is by and large described as the capacity to prepare for and effectively respond to crises whilst retaining core health system functions (Kruk et al., 2015) . Varying conceptual frameworks help break down the complex nature of health system resilience. One of the first frameworks developed was that of Kruk et al in the aftermath of the Ebola crisis, responding to the growing demands of multilateral organisations to illustrate the key characteristics of a resilient health system and a proposed resilience index to measure resilience (Kruk et al., 2017) . Blanchet et al suggested a new model of resilience as an underlying management and governance capacity to absorb, adapt and transform itself in case of a shock (Blanchet et al., 2017) . Gilson et al introduced the idea of 'everyday resilience,' highlighting the strategies and capacities that a re required to address both chronic stressors as well as acute shocks in the health system (Gilson et al., 2017a) , (Barasa et al., 2017) , (Kagwanja et al., 2020) . Grimm et al have synthesized empirical studies from low - and middle - income countries to build on Kruk et al's five characteristics of resilience and to identify five additional char acteristics that serve as foundations that may be prioritized in resource -constrained settings to activate system -level resilience (Grimm et al., 2021b) . The five 'changed been identified as foundatio nal 81 for health systems to unlock the following attributes of resilience described by Kruk et al: 'aware,' 'diverse,' , (Grimm et al., 2021b) . A critical consideration for the discourses of health system resilience that has not been widely discussed is t he state's level of fragility, which may undermine efforts to build resilience in the first place (OECD, 2008) . As many NGOs that part took in this study operate in fragile, weak or failed states, this paper will give full acknowledgement to the underlying contextual complexities that co uld affect one's journey towards resilience. As the world has wrestled with a pandemic that has intimately affected the course of our daily lives, the level of extreme weather events, natural disasters, conflicts, and economic recession are amplifyi ng existing inequalities. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reductions (UNDRR) reported that there has been a two -fold increase in climate -related disasters in the past twenty years compared with the previous twenty years, with evidence of climat e change increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the future (IPCC, 2012) . The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has released its 2021 Emergency Watchlist of humanitarian crises that are expected to deteriorate over the coming years, exacerbated by the triple threat of conflict, climate change and COVID -19 (International Rescue Committee, 2021) . Research on health system resilience is highly r elevant in the 21st century in such a context where an interlinked global economy, porous borders and easy influx of people, goods, and services imply pathogens to travel at a much faster pace than control measures can be put i n place. The effects of globa lization have reverberated through the world's undergoing the COVID -19 pandemic and have outpoured publications on the topic of resilience in health systems around the world. In response to the increasing frequency and intensity of these catastrophic event s, various international organisations have released consolidated evidence and guidance for policy makers and relevant stakeholders to incorporate resilience into policy and planning. For example, the World Bank's latest report outlines five pillars of res ilient health systems and offers priority areas for government actions, drawing upon lessons from disaster risk and emergency management practices (Rentschler et al., 2021) . World Health Organisation (WHO)'s Regional Office for Europe has also put forward a new policy brief, outlining concepts and strategies to strengthen health system resilience and providing proposed indicators to assess resilien ce by topic area (Thomas et al., 2020) . Despite such promising momentum, the link between applied research and implementation remain at infant stages and gaps exist in streamlining and contextualizing this gargantuan list of recommendati ons for practitioners. This paper addresses this nexus by adding to the empirical evidence of health system resilience through analysing the perspectives of NGOs working in the field of global health being regularly exposed to shocks and at the same time acting in 82 the forefronts of health service delivery and health systems operations. As a key stakeholder group in international development cooperation and global health governance, non -state actors namely NGOs have responsibilities to protect and work alongside the national governments in times of crises and to offer appropriate support in the areas where they cause no further harm. Objectives Using the example of non -state actors based in Switzerland, the aim of this study is to exa mine how and to what extent NGOs have dealt with unexpected shocks in the health systems of their partner countries and to reflect on the practical implicatio ns of resilience for the multiple actors involved. This paper analyses the key attributes of resil ience that targeted investments may influence, and explores the different roles key stakeholders may assume to build resilience. 6.3 Methods Study design This is a descriptive and exploratory qualitative study analysing the practical experience and perspectives of health system resilience through 20 in -depth interviews of Swiss -based NGOs conducted between April and June of 2021. Study participants The par ticipants were purposively selected through a snowball sampling of relevant referrals from Medicus Mundi Switzerland (Nad erifar et al., 2017) , a network comprised of Swiss organisations active in international health cooperation. Organisations with a global outreach and an active ongoing health portfolio in low - and middle - income countries were included. Albeit the heter ogeneity of the organisation's target groups and approaches to programmes, the 20 interviews nevertheless represent a single stakeholder group and therefore has shown to be sufficient to reach data saturation (Guest et al., 2006) . Data collection The interviews lasted a round one hour respectively and were conducted by the first author (PYG) in English. There have been no prior exchanges between the participants and the data collector and the interviews were held on zoom due to the pandemic restrictions. A semi -structured interview guide was developed to explore the following key topics: 1) background of the participant's organisation; 2) experience of health system shocks in partner countries; 3) perceptions of health syste m resilience and its dimensions; 4) self -assessme nt; 5) preparedness for future shocks. All interviewees were prompted on their views on key resilience attributes based on the respective shocks experienced. See appendix 1 for the full interview guide. A ll 83 interviews have been audio -recorded following inf ormed consent and thereafter transcribed verbatim. Independent of the number of interviews to approximate data saturation, an iterative approach to data collection and analysis confirmed that dat a saturation was indeed reached as a result. Data analysis Analysis proceeded using a data -driven thematic analysis, closely following the steps of the framework method (Gale et al., 2013) . Verbatim transcriptions were reviewed for familiarization and verified for accuracy. Following the development of an initial codebook inspired by the ten themes previously developed by the author's team (Grimm et al., 2021b) , all transcripts were coded line -by-line using MAXQDA 2018. A hybrid of deductive and inductive approaches provided for a broader structure of the categories and flexibility of codes from the open coding process. The codebook, themes and categories initia lly developed by the first author (PYG) were reviewed and validated by the second author (KW). Any differences in interpretation were resolved through internal discussions. As depicted in figure 1 0, Grimm et al's conceptual framework was used to develop th e analytical framework. The framework was then applied systematically to chart the relevant summary of the transcript with direct quotations structured around 14 categories and 37 codes, resulting in a complete framework matrix. This process enabled compar isons and contrasts of key emergent themes between the participants, which later generated key results describing the prominent dimensions of health system resilience and the key roles expected of stakeholders to build resilience in the health systems. Figure 10. Grimm et al's health system resilience framework (Grimm et al., 2021b) 84 6.4 Results Twelve female and eight male interviewees participated. The majority of the participants were either managing directors or project managers of Swiss NGOs having operations in low - and middle - income countries. Two of the interviewees were based in the partner country as project managers, and the remaining participants were based in Switzerland having close and regular contact with their respe ctive in -country partners. Most organisations have ongoing project engagements in Africa, whilst a few of them oversee projects in Asia, Middle East, Eastern Europe, and South America. The primary target groups of the key informants' organisations are summ arised in table 1 2. Table 12.

The results are categorised into the role of the governments, the role of th e NGOs, and practical future steps for building health system resilience. Governments: governance and responsibility Health systems with strong 'foundations of resilience' may unleash greater attributes of resilience The participants overall had a solid understanding of health system resilience based on their experience managing programmes and projects in low - and middle - income countries. When asked of the most critical component of resilience, the responses fit into one of the foundations of resilience that serve as inputs into the health system that would activate resilience attributes described in Grimm et al's framework (Grimm et al., 2021b) . As depicted in figure 1 1, among the five foundations, four were considered dominant for unleashing resilience attributes. 'Change management,' however, did not emerge as a key foundation from the interviews. 85 Figure 11. Dominant foundations of resilience among NGO respondents The first foundational element is 'realigned relationships,' which was seen to provide a strong basis of resilience at the system level. Establishing trust and collaborations across differences appeared in particular to offer a source of strength against a ll kinds of external shocks. \"But, these (external shocks) are not the biggest headaches as long as you have a good team and partnerships that are build on trust.\" (I03) A participant stressed the importance of investing in the initial networking and buil ding of connections as they form the foundation of solid working relationships that can overcome and counteract future shocks. These good working relationships on the ground were what enabled projects to proceed with minimal interference albeit wider conte xtual disruptions. The answer lies not in a hypothetical system, but in the people that own and carry out the vision of the projects. \"If you are really engaged with the technocrats on the ground who are still working in the health system, you can still ac hieve lots of your goals. So, I think the investments especially in the beginning, the investments into the networking and the building of the relationships are key to overcoming and counteracting those shocks which anyway you cannot influence. If a presid ent dies, he dies, and of course there is a state of emergency and so on, but 86 as long as you have good relationships on the ground, people are still willing to continue with the project because they believe in it, having a strong ownership.\" (I06) Building trust, however, does not spring up organically; rather, it entails longstanding collaboration, a cadre of trained staff, an established organisational structure and most importantly a shared vision that stems from a collective sense of ownership. \"In order to establish the trust, you also need some structure, trained staff, you need a mindset to be able to go there and do that.\" (I15) The second foundational element 'foresight' helps to see the importance of investing in long -term functional infr astructure, prioritising in human resource readiness, and focusing on overall health system strengthening. One participant pointed out that a functioning health system, which is not guaranteed in all countries, should take precedence over resilience buildi ng. More important than having a specific disaster preparedness plan is obviously to strengthen the overall health system. Severa l participants underscored that a preventive approach to resilience is especially necessary in low - and middle - income setti ngs, as the building of infrastructure, equipment, well -trained health workers and responsive communities take intentional investments to cultivate. \"to make it more resilient, I think it is less important to have a specific disaster preparedness, but rather to strengthen the health system as such.. It's not about once you have a crisis, then you need to react. You need to really strengthen the system before. Indeed a system with a sufficient number of infrastructure, equipment, medication, well -trained health workers, and community which is interacting well, is quite resilient.\" (I08) The third foundational element 'motivation' when instilled at the community level builds community -based preparedness and resilience, a precondition for enabling health sy stem resilience. In resource -constrained settings, community resilience can be one of the best preventive strategies for countries to build health system resilience. One respondent explicitly depicted communities as the \"drivers of the health system,\" an i ndispensable gateway to project sustainability. \"Not only the perception of integration, of participation, on feedback mechanisms, but also as the driver of the health system. Communities are part of our common approaches and most of our projects acknowl edge sustainability through communities.\" (I04) In the context of failed or fragile states, strong community structures may serve as the sole source of continuous developmen t and fill vacuums created by the lack of state governance. This was apparent in t he case of one of the respondents working in Afghanistan where the solidarity from the communities abridged decision -making structures and facilitated resilience. \"Sometimes you could not work with the government, in the case of Taliban. Then, the development agency tries to 87 build up the community structures and then strengthening them. They are still there and always there. Especially in times of crises they can easily be activated and there is a lot of solidarity and short decision -making structu res and agile. This is a big factor when it comes to resilience of a community and of supporting the health system.\" (I06) The fourth foundational element 'emergency preparedness' was best exhibited through financial investments and resource preparedness, vital prerequisites to activating resilience. Many highlighted that resources are the bedrock of any development work including that of resilience building. The consequence of financial gaps in fragile states that resulted in shortages of all basic needs w ere proven detrimental, exacerbating vulnerability to future shocks. \"If we look into some of the things they've done well, like investments in the adequate health service package in the health facilities, it always comes with some resources obviously. Fi nance gaps are critical and we see this in countries like Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, where the gaps in terms of all basic needs, in terms of health are so massive\" (I04) There is always a trade -off, however, in investment decisions, which also applies in the case of investing in resilience. A respondent recommended that countries set aside a portion of their GDP dedicated to resilience, whether it takes the form of a socia l insurance or improved health coverage. Financial investments towards emergency preparedness and resilience building are undoubtedly a precondition for a strong foundation of resilience. \"So, in my point of view, it is a matter of money.. as there is al ways a trade -off in decisions. For instance, do we do less cancer treatment and invest in resilience?\" (I01) \"(For resilience building I would advise the government) Make sure you have enough financial resources. 20% of your GDP? You need financial resourc es. The work to increase these resources and to decrease individual risks through social insurance system. Work towards universal health coverage and health insurance.\" (I08) Key resilience attributes expected of national governments: 'Integrate,' 'Adaptiv e,' 'Diverse' The attribute to 'integrate' was shown to be one of the most significant characteristics of resilience expected of the nation al governments from the NGOs, followed by the attributes to be 'adaptive' and 'd iverse,' as depicted in figure 12 . The figure visualises the frequency of responses by the participants when asked about the most prominent feature of resilience expected of governments. 88 Figure 12. Dominant resilience attributes Most of the participants in one way or another emphasized how important it is to have a solid governance system and to have a government that exemplifies responsibility in responding to health system shocks. Governments were ultimately seen as duty bearers, and the sustainability of any project requires good governance to plan, invest, and anticipate future shocks. \"(to build resilience you need) good governance. Governments are the duty bearers and you can have shiny health infrastructure and train staff for a period of time but then i f it's not sustained with good budget planning, good investment, good governance, then everything can fall apart quickly.\" (I20) The NGOs expected the governments to assume a stronger coordination role to minimise duplication amongst external and internal partners, and to provide guidance based on the needs of the population. A respondent echoed that a badly equipped primary health care system often stems from an underlying fragility of governance, more so than from dilapidated infrastructures or ill -trained staff. \"What I often see what is lacking is a really strong coordination role of the government to make the best out of wh at is coming from the inside and outside. Often there is a lack of guidance to be honest. We have still issues where there are two organisations doing exactly the same work in the same region which is a waste of money. More guidance would also help in maki ng the system more resilient.\" (I06) 89 Though many partner countries may not have foresight and long -term planning as strengths, they exhibited exceptional skills to be 'adaptive,' which was proven more vital in fragile contexts where the shocks are multiple and continuous. One participant described this 'adaptive' attribute as an attitude to change, switch gears and seek new ways to deal with the evolving situation when thorough planning is not possible. \"I think the attitude to be able to change, switch g ears and to find new ways and to be creative somehow and to deal with situations where you can't plan everything, this resilience, that's a resort where i've learnt and still learn from Uganda.\" (I03) Another respondent underscored that this attitude to b e adaptive and flexible was a clear indication of resilience shown by the Haitians responding to the devastating earthquake in 2010. There was clear self -sufficiency to intervene even before any external help had access to the area. This improvisation is a clear indication of the 'adaptive' attribute of resilience. \"A part of resilience of the Haitian people is, they for me, they are the best at improvisation. They are very bad at preparation and foreseeing. They are very bad at anticipation. I remember wh en we had the floodings before the earthquake, immediately before and after the collapsed bridges, they have built up kiosks and you could get transports through the rivers. That's the way we could transport from one side to the other side. Thanks to this improvation. It was the same after the earthquake. Even without the help of external organisations, privately they have built up streets. Well, this is a positive side of resilience.\" (I05) The third most prominent resilience attribute expected of the gove rnments was to be 'diverse,' allowing care to extend to new and diverse needs arising from the crises. Endemic health problems, such as cholera and measles, forced governments to make difficult decisions between conflicting priorities. If the shock was sub stantial, the already scarce resources were redirected to dealing with the immediate crisis whilst leading to major disruptions in routine care. \"If you take the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ), it's a clear example. Very recently we had Ebola now. But, even before we had other Ebola outbreaks. You could have seen that COVID was not seen as an issue because they had at the same time, cholera, Ebola, measles and other outbreaks. So for them, in terms of prioritisation, you will see that is difficult. (I04) \"What we noticed but our partners is that already scarce resources that were there are redirected then to COVID -19 sensitization, personal protective equipment ( PPE) and taken away by budget that you actually have for other purposes. T his is something all partners experienced and noticed.\" (I15) Health needs arising specifically due to the crisis, such as mental health issues, are often neglected and undervalued. In a 90 resource -constrained setting, life -saving and treatment -based approac hes crowd out equally key services such as trauma care and counselling services. \"I think the mental health systems are undervalued and understaffed. As global North, we are not prepared for the fall-out of the pandemic from a mental health aspect and w hen I think about that it's such a taboo even where it's much more available versus in low -income countries, it's very much relying on the informal networks. And that's something we are worried about. Take India as an example. Post traumatic stress disorde r is a real thing and we're not sure whether the community health workers are equipped to be able to deal with that or even to see it within themselves.\" (I10) NGOs: perspectives and roles in resilience building The alignment of resilience with organisational priorities As illustrated earlier in table 1 2, each organisation has a distinct priority area of intervention and primary target groups, whether it be maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, or people with disabilities. Nevertheless, over the years of implementation, the organisations realized the benef it of an overall health system strengthening approach to achieving their goals, which is why many of them have expanded their health programmes to take on a broader health system strengthening agenda. This meant an increased project investment towards trai ning health workers, refurbishing key health infrastructure, and restocking supply of medicines as such. \"it has to do with that we really expanded much more into health system strengthening that we have to look at it holistically from all sides. That wa s why it was a logical step to introduce this aspect of resilience and even to highlight it. We wanted to highlight it as a cross -cutting issue so that we actively work on it.\" (I06) In the same light, more NGOs started to view resilience as a cross -cuttin g issue. This has shifted their disease -specific perspective towards a more holistic, health system strengthening approach to programming, enabling multiple sectors working collaboratively to weave resilience into their respective programmes. \"For us, but this is only recently with the new strategy since 2020, we look at resilience as a cross -cutting issue. We look at resilience when it comes to the engagements with the communities. But we haven't looked at it from a purely health system resilience aspect. That's also anyway a fairly new perspective on health system.\" (I06) Meanwhile, one NGO regarded resilience as an ultimate goal, even specified within the health results chain of its programmes with an underlying logic that \"healthy people contribute to r esilience.\" This impact -driven approach to resilience brought about a fresh perspective that disaster risk management serves the purpose to build resilience for all. 91 \"The ultimate impact from the disaster risk management is that the resilience of the commu nities is improved, and the ultimate impact of our health result chain is that the health state of the people are improved. If you look at resilience and the resilience that we use as part of the resilience framework of the federation, is that healthy peop le contribute to resilience. So, actually the ultimate impact should be resilience for everybody.\" (I01) NGOs' unique role for resilience building: knowledge exchange and science for impact The NGOs believed that albeit their different views on resilience within their organisations, they nevertheless have a unique role in building resilience of their partner countries' health systems thereby referring to the areas of knowledge exchange a nd innovations. Almost all participants believed that capacity building at both organisational and individual levels would be one of the best investments towards fostering resilience. There were already significant contributions from the NGOs through skills tra inings of frontline workers and medical professionals. A participant believed that future investments should also prioritise in strengthening the capacity building of frontline workers and the communities in particular to equip resilience on the ground whe re the NGOs may draw on their strengths. \"We still have some interesting things to bring is really the work at the community level and really building the capacities in terms of delivering first response at the community level, training community lead ers and key community representatives with the basic package of first aid and mental health support. It doesn't necessarily need to be super technical. We can identify some people with basic backgrounds in social work or even first aid is accessible to any one really. So that's really where we are trying to make a difference.\" (I20) One NGO pointed out that improving the capacity of the ministry of health itself and better coordinating with the ministry of education for licensing can also have an enormous ef fect in facilitating policy dialogue and enhancing the training quality of the entire system. The expected impact would be at a wider level as opposed to that from vertical programmes. \"(what NGOs can do) Supporting people from far and really stren gthening the capacity. I think NGOs can change enormously the way they work and absolutely collaborate with the ministry of health to improve the capacity. There are gaps everywhere, from medical point of view, psychological. I think NGOs should really spe cialise on these and supporting ministry of health rather than vertical programmes. And they could really reinforce the capacity of the central level and not only peripherical level. The NGOs should be involved in changing the current training and dialogui ng with the ministry of health that the current initial training for health providers are improved.\" (I09) An additional role NGOs may take on is to facilitate dialogue and knowledge exchange not only from North to South, but also from South to South, wher e good practices can be mutually shared. 92 This is what I see a bit as our role that when we have a good experience in Chad, we try to also make use of it and have this exchange (South South exchange), to facilitate the knowledge exchange.\" (I06) As most NGOs focused on a priority area of intervention, whether it be women and children's health, gender violence, or HIV/AIDS, the NGOs were able to see issues from multiple angles, working with various ministries and partners to have their interventions benefi t from a cross -sectoral approach. Resilience in most cases provided a link to connecting these different sectors. \"Looking a bit beyond the health system. Women for example have been affected by fistula. They are not just physically affected but also psy chologically and often they are isolated. Even if they are cured from the fistula, they still are super marginalised as they have been an outcast. So, we are also supporting with income generating activities to strengthen their opportunities with financial independence, which also in turn strengthen their resilience towards shocks in the future.\" (I06) Finally, the NGOs can support their partner countries to leverage science for impact. As the demand for adopting new digital tools and innovations is growing , one NGO interviewed has started introducing new mobile applications to improve children's medical diagnosis and treatment, strengthening the overall primary health care system in rural West Africa (Enric Jan\u00e9, 2018) . In addition, innovative training modules have been adopted for health workers in order to adapt to the evolving context as well. This emerging need for digital approaches such as teleconsultations or telemedicine was most evident during the COVID -19 pandemic when travel restrictions compelled all exchanges to switch to virtual means. It will not work for all contexts, but the NGOs may be able to fund relevant technological and innovation gaps arising in their partner countries to maximise imp act. \"The entering of digitalisation to health workforce training, duel training models, how to use them for health workforce, that's for us the core element.\" (I08) Future Outlook: Practical steps towards resilience building Complex nature of future sho cks The shocks experienced by the low - and middle - income countries were no longer a disconnected, one -time event, but a series of complex, interconnected shocks that are increasing in both frequency and intensity. The nature of shocks were classified as political shocks and protracted conflicts, natural disasters and climate change, pandemics or epidemics, and financial crisis or economic shocks. \"But the Sahel being so volatile with so many factors of stress and shock interconnecting, it's quite difficult to 93 achieve impact..and most importantly for us, how it (conflicts) interacts with the prevalence of natural disasters in an area and just having exacerbate vulnerabilities where we work. So, the combination of these factors together..But at the same time, we have to acknowledge that this (epidemics/pandemics) is also a risk that is going to continue and it is linked with environmental degradation. We know that environmental degradation may lead to more health issues and epidemics.\" (I20) The most distressing aspect of all these shocks were that either multiple shocks were occurring in a country simultaneously o r a shock has led to further shocks, a ggravating contextual vulnerabilities and diminishing the impact of the NGOs' interventions. For instance, a participant described how the financial crisis in Zimbabwe led to political and social unrests , which brought about a total shutdown of the health care system. Then the arrival of the COVID -19 pandemic and massive lockdowns thereafter, further depreciated the value of the currency. In many contexts, the root causes of the shocks were often interconnected and the NGOs found this a severe bottleneck to achieving impact. Hence, it appeared necessary for the NGOs to take a holistic approach beyond the health sector to understanding the shocks and stresses in the system in order to better interrogate resilience. \"It was a whole cascade of things. There wa s the currency collapsing, political distress and strikes of course, people who got very upset...That (economic crash) was 2019 and then corona came. It was really bad. You had a very fragile system, and then you had the economic collapse, then you had strik es, so literally there were no people in the hospitals anymore, in the pharmacies. If people had problems, public health was not existing anymore. Then came corona and massive lockdowns, the value of the money was down.\" (I11) Strongest determinant of resilience: investing in context -based long -term health system hardware and software According to the participants, the strongest determinant of resilience in the health system was the degree of investments mad e for building long -term health system infrast ructures. Health systems are comprised of hardware and software components (Sheikh et al., 2011) . Hardware such as physical buildings, equipment, ambulances were equally critical as system software such as strong capacity of human resources and a shared work ethic. One respondent emphasi zed that the combination of these hardware and software ought to be sufficiently established and functioning prior to any potential crises. \"(the most important element in health system resilience is) to have sufficient supplies, to have stocks, to ha ve sufficient human resources, to have an infrastructure that withstands disasters that's non -existing. So, what resilience are we talking about if even the basics are not there. That's where I personally feel that the issue should be to work and contribut e towards a resilient health system. Maybe first of all a functional and after the functional, 94 resilient, as that is not guaranteed in all countries.\" (I01) Many organisations saw that rather than having a specific disaster preparedness plan, an overall strengthening of the health system would better contribute to building systemic resilience. For instance, when there are committed and competent nurses in the field, they would be the ones administrating COVID -19 vaccinations and serve in the frontlines during the crisis. \"to make it more resilient, I think it is less important to have a specific disaster preparedness, but rather to strengthen the health sys tem as such. Is there much more nurses on the spot, more midwives on the spot, these people stay on the spot also in a flooding or in an Ebola crisis, or in a COVID crisis. If you have a health workforce, they can do a COVAX vaccination now. If you don't h ave them, you can't. It's not about once you have a crisis, then you need to react. You need to really strengthen the system before. Indeed a system with a sufficient number of infrastructure, equipment, medication, well -trained health workers, and communi ty which is interacting well, is quite resilient.\" (I08) When approaching resilience building, it is crucial to understand and build on the unique contextual strengths of the country's health system. Whether it be through existing community health worker s tructures, doctor brigades, or traditional birth attendants, countries themselves should leverage their health care system's assets to see what works best in their give n context. \"Why not distribute it through the house doctors when this is our network di stribution? It's a matter of knowing your health system well enough. I think one important thing for resilience is to build on the strength of the system that you have. Know the strength, build on them.\" (I01) \"For example, we work with traditional birth a ttendants. They are not considered part of the health system in many countries but still they are the closest to the patients and therefore it's good to work with them and to make their services better. So, it's not an either or. You have to look at the pi cture and see where it makes more sense in the moment in time to strengthen which system.\" (I06) A case in point comes from Cuba where the government had invested in building a family doctor system, allocating a doctor and a nurse to serve each catchment a rea. During the COVID -19 pandemic, this system was fully utilised to enable a door -to- door service to monitor the health of its people and conduct contact tracing. \"For example, one of the ways to prevent COVID was to look closely to the person that has symptoms or there were contacts. They used family doctors and medical students going from door to door everyday to check the temperature of the people. 20,000 medical students. Because of this, the first two waves of COVID in 2020 were very well 95 controlled by the government because of this. The contact cases were alerted and ones that were vulnerable or had health problems they went to the hospitals to follow up. At the end of 2020 there were only a little more than 100 deaths in the whole Cuba.\" (I14) 6.5 Discussion This article illuminates insights from Swiss NGOs dealing with unexpected shocks in the health systems in their partner countries. The key findings were summarised into the roles of the governments and the NGOs in resilience building, whilst acknowledging the unique contextual factors that ought to be considered in the process. The following four key 'foundations of resilience' were found to be dominant for attributes: 'realigned relationships,' 'foresight,' 'motivation,' and 'emergency preparedness.' The attribute to 'integrate' was shown to be one of the most crucial characteristics of resilience expected of the national governments from the NGOs, which points to the heightened role of governance and the government's res ponsibility as the primary duty bearer . The NGOs saw themselves in a unique position to target their investments towards facilitating knowledge exchange and supporting long -term adapations of innovative solutions that are increasingly demanded in their par tner countries. The investments from NGOs are not merely monetary but rather an opportunity to seek innovative solutions to problems and to keep diverse players in global health accountable. Finally, context -based long -term health infrastructure surfaced a s the strongest determinant of resilience, which would serve as entry points for future investments. This research also offers a timely response to the recent call for a shift of resilience research from theory to practice by employing a bottom -up approach to applied research (Saulnier et al., 2021) . The experiences and perspectives of the NGOs reflected here echo the standpoints of practitioners and communities they rep resent on the ground, and add a multidisciplinary lens to understanding resilience. Furthermore, the role of non -state actors, namely the NGOs have become inevitably more powerful not only due to its large and diversified funding channels, but also due to its growing governance capacity in applying pressure to conventional leaders within global health governance to provide necessary checks and balances. The Ebola epidemic in 2014 has revealed that M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, an NGO, can assume a leading role to jump start relief efforts, to apply pressure on the WHO to accelerate support and to assist governments' compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR) (Held et al., 2019) . The following observations draw on the insights on the role of different stakeholders and their respective contributions towards resilience building. First, the underlying view of resilience as a cross -cutting issue for many NGOs enables a holistic approach beyond the health 96 sector for its interrogation. This study fou nd that the nature of shocks in the health system are often complex and its root causes interconnected between multiple societal disciplines. For example, the financial crisis in Zimbabwe led to political and social unrests, which paralysed the health care system. The advent of the COVID -19 pandemic and lockdown measures have further depreciated the currency, leading to a vicious cycle. Hence, t he interviewees conceded that a health system strengthening approach have typically helped reach their programme g oals more effectively than focusing solely on their distinct priority area of interests , whether it be maternal child health, HIV/AIDS, or people with disabilities . Furthermore, placing resilience within the NGOs' strategy have altered their disease -specif ic perspectives and provided a link for different sectors and disciplines to work collaboratively together. Drawing from the social network analysis, the value of interdependence is described by Blanchet at al as the capacity of resilience to engage with a diverse group of actors belonging to a wider socio -political structure (Blanchet et al., 2017) . A platform of cross -sectoral actors workin g harmoniously at the sub -national level has for example been observed in Kenya where health facility staff, sub -county managers and local public administrators had worked in conjunction to pacify political tension (Kagwanja et al., 2020) . Gilson et al define this proc ess as collective sensemaking , an approach to organise different actors in achieving collective health goals based on pow er sharing and trust building. Collective sensemaking has been manifested in the process of the NGOs shifting their disease -specific lens towards a holistic health system perspective in managing their programmes and weaving resilience into their respective strategies to better prepare for future crises (Gilson et al., 2021) . Haldane echoes the power of this holistic approach to resilience by stressing that in the management of the COVID -19 pandemic, the high -performing countries adopted a comprehensive response with multi -ministry task forces to draw upon capacities within an d beyond the health system (Haldane et al., 2021) . South Korea's appro ach to the pandemic control has also been e xemplified by a synergy of collaborative governance, confiding in the civil society and the public for its effectiveness (Choi, 2020) . Resilience building is best approached from a collaborative angle involving diverse actors. Second, the role of robust governance was a feature of resilience expected of national governments by the majority of the interviewees reflecting Swiss NGOs. The European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies released a report summarising the key lessons generated from the COVID -19 pandemic. One recommendation was to improve health governance at the global level through creating a Global Health Board under the auspices of the G20 and to draft a Pandemic Treaty that holds governments accountable to those in need (McKeen, 2021) . From our interviews with the NGO representatives, however, it was apparent that the governments were ultimately seen as duty bearers, determining the effectiveness of the coordination of partners and the sustainability of contributions. Even International Health Regulations 97 (IHR), which is regarded as one of the strongest tools to exert global health governance, is heavily dependent on national capacities and cooperation (Kluge et al., 2018) . Many NGOs that participated in this study, however, operated in fragile, weak or failed states, and such fragility may undermine efforts to build resilience in the first place. Unlike in stable cont exts where states and citizens negotiate societal needs and obligati ons, fragile states lack this political process to reconcile the state-society expectations and to establish legitimacy (OECD, 2008) . In the context of fragility, our study participants observed that strong community structures filled vacuums created by the lack of state governance and f acilitated resilience through the solidarity of the participating communities. This expanded concept of governance in the health system includes a range of governance agents including patients and communities as well as sub -national actors influenced by fo rmal and informal rules shaping their dynamic (Brinkerhoff et al., 2014) . Participatory political processes reinforce resilience of the state by offering collectively agreed strategies to deal with shocks (OECD, 2008) . Furthermore, communities that cooperate for a common good to exercise their civic duty, which is an indication of a higher civic capital, are proven to be more resilient to crises and recover faster than their fragmented counterparts (Grimm and Saulnier, 2021) . Hence, the everyday practice of governance may be equally influential in the achievement of equity and thereafter resilience (Gilson et al., 2017b) . Third, as the NGOs pointed out, they can leverage their global and local presence to foster a bi -directional knowledge exchange and to support thei r partner countries utilise science for impact. Well -adapted digital innovations can support the flexibility required in times of crises. During the COVID -19 pandemic, the countries that have been pre -equipped with digital innovations such as telemedicine have reaped its benefits particularly during the restrictions of the pandemic (Bhaskar et al., 2020) . We see evidence of contextualised digital solution transforming the way health workers in rural areas diagnose and treat children with increased accuracy and greater impact (Enric Jan\u00e9, 20 18). There has also been numerous small -scale cost - effective innovations that have been initiated at community and health service and hospital level (Tharanga and Fernando, 2021) . Alam et al rightly point out that a bi -directional exchange of innovations between the global South and North will contribute to resilience building in the long run (Alam et al., 2021) . NGOs are in the position to facilitate this knowledge exchange and to fund relevant technological gaps by targeting and redirecting their investments . A caveat here is not to be complacent with short -term adaptations that simply add responsibilities to the individuals in the frontlines, but to focus on long-term adaptations of in novations through an incremental process of continuous organisational learning, knowledge exchange, and trust building where the impact can be sustained (Lyng et al., 2021) . Finally, the strongest determinant for resilience identified by the NGOs were health system hardware and software that require long term inv estments (Sheikh et al., 2011) . The findings were consistent with that of other resilient research, 98 revisiting the importance of investing in the 'slow variables' such as building a sustainable career path of essential health workers and improving the structural capacity of its health in frastructure catering to its context -specific risk (Kruk et al., 2017) , (Grimm , (Harris et al., 2017) . Barasa et al, however, point out that effective planning processes, management capacities, and productive work cultures, all representing system software compon ents, may matter more to resilience than adequately resourced hardware of the system. A strong software can effectively navigate through its complex power dynamics to influence action for strengthening the other parts of the health system (Barasa et al., 2017) . A purposeful designing and redesigning of the country's institutions in anticipation of future shocks will prevent the system from 'coping ' (Abimbola and Topp, 2018) or developing 'maladaptive' practices (Gilson et al., 2020) in response to acute stressors and shocks. True resilience reflects an ongoing journey of the country's institutions and participating actors to gradually process through its absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities (B\u00e9n\u00e9 et al., 2012) , leveraging its unique contextual strengths and offsetting its health system vulnerabilities. Study Strengths and Limitations As an applied research, this study builds on a health system resilience conceptual framework developed from a previous systematic review and complementary research on Myanmar (Grimm et al., 2021b) , (Grimm et al., 2021a) . This article presents empirical evidence on health system resilience through analysing the perspectives of NGOs operating in low - and middle - income countries. The topic of health system resilience has a potential to make a timely contribution to the health systems and policy research community, with lessons generated that can be transferrable to all contexts that operate in close partnerships between the global South and North . Due to the COVID -19 pandemic's travel restrictions imposed during the data collection period , the study only represents the view of Swiss -based NGOs, restricting the scope of the study to the perceptions of a single stakeholder group. As the interviewees were selected using a snowball sampling strategy through existing networks, this was applied through the Swiss network which the authors are a part of. In addition, it was also possible to virtually connect with many participants based in the field where projects took place. The heterogeneity of the NGOs' size, primary target groups, and areas of interest, however, may pose limitations for a generalised application of the study. Yet, the diversity of the participants' nationalities and previous work experiences have potentially added to the robustness of the findings. Further studies, however, shou ld explore capturing a wider range of stakeholders, the perceptions of communities, frontline workers and government staff that may be able to offer a more holistic view of the topic. 99 6.6 Conclusion s Health system resilience is a collective endeavour and a result of many stakeholders' consistent and targeted investments. These investments open up new opportunities to seek innovative solutions and to keep diverse actors in global health accountable. The experiences and perspectives of the Swiss NGOs in this article highlight the vital role NGOs may play in building resilient health systems in their partner countries. Specifically, strong governance, a bi -directional knowledge exchange, and the focus on l everaging science for impact can draw greater potential of resilience in the health systems. Governments and the NGOs have unique points of contribution in this journey towards resilience and bear the responsibility to support governments to prioritise inv esting in the key 'foundations of resilience' in order to activate greater attributes of resilience. Resilience building will not only prepare countries for future shocks but bridge the disparate health and development agenda in order to better address the nexus between humanitarian aid and development cooperation.

Pauline Yongeun Grimm1,2*, Dell D. Saulnier3 1) Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland. 2) University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. 3) Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden * Corresponding author Published in the International Journal of Public Health (Young Researcher Editori al), June 2020, 66:1604064 101 7 Civic Duty: A Booster for Resilience? Though the COVID -19 pandemic has taken centre stage in our lives, climate change, conflict, and economic recession still threaten our systems and societies. The capacity of systems and societies to absorb, adapt, and transform when exposed to a shock and still retain their core functions is called resilience. Building resilience is one way of managing such crises. One important driver of resilience may be social capital (Aldrich and Meyer, 2015) , which plays an important role during times of crisis and calm (Grimm et al., 2021b) . A component of social capital is civic capital. Civic capital comprises values that support cooperation for the common good and civic engagement. We argue that civic capital is a key ingredient in resilience and that communities, health systems, and governments require civic capital to effectively manage and recover from current and future crises. Communitie s with more trust, civic engagement, and tighter networks, can recover better than more fragmented counterparts after a crisis. Civic capital increases trust among community members, leads to more sharing of critical information and cooperative partnership s, which seems to be a foundation for resilience (Aldrich, 2010) . The role of civic capital in the recovery process is evident in the aftermath of three major disasters: the Kobe Earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, and the Indian Ocean Tsunami. Proxy indicators to measure the strength of civic capital were levels of trust in fellow citizens and government institutions, time and energy spent on civic duties, and the ability of citizens to mobilise cooperatively. Despite drastic differences in income levels, people in Kobe an d India had more civic capital than people in New Orleans, mirroring the efficiency and sustainability of their recoveries (Aldrich, 2010) . The social contract that promotes civic capital may be shaped by the definition of a \"successful\" response to a crisis like the COVID -19 pandemic. Many governments responded to COVID -19 by prioritising goals like suppressing transmission or \"flattening the curve\" and used metrics like number of cases, reproductive rate, and occupancy rate of intensive care beds as indicators of pro gress and success. In some cases, stringent interventions like lockdowns and cancellation of routine healthcare appointments took a heavy toll on the health of non -COVID patients. For example, it marginalised cancer care and reduced support for other chronic conditions (Rosenbaum, 2020) . Countries that took a top-down authori tarian approach may have successfully suppressed transmission over the short term at the expense of community ownership, eroding the vital precondition of trust that legitimises resilient systems (Loewenson et al., 2020) . Another example of civic capital is that of South Korea, one of the few countries that neither introduced a formal lockdown nor closed its borders. Instead, South Korea focused on meticulous contact tracing and strict, consistently applied quarantine rules. In combination with active civic engagement, these strategies effectively contained further spread of the virus (Dong et 102 al., 2020) . During the first few months of the pandemic from January to May 2020, the trust index for the government of South Korea increased by 16% and its citizens expected the government to take the lead in the pandemic response (Edelman, 2021) . This coincides with high levels of individual adherence to public prevention protocols. Choi attributes South Ko rea's success to the synergy of collaborative governance: civil society and the public strongly determine the effectiveness of this system (Choi, 2020) . While Sweden followed the same strategy as many countries to \"flatten the curve,\" the Public Health Agency mainly implemented voluntary measures, in line with Swedish law, which prioritizes voluntary public health measures and limits the government's power to set sweep ing national restrictions (Klamberg, 2020) . In Sweden, the Public Health Agency's recommendations are assumed as a citizen's civic duty. Social trust is a long-standing value in Swedish culture (Irwin, 2020) and along with contextual factors like comprehensive sick leave policies, thi s trust increased cooperation during the pandemic without more restrictive measures. Relying on civic duty alone, however, is insufficient: Sweden struggled to coordinate COVID -19 health response across administrative levels, which contributed to the failure of the government's stra tegy to protect the elderly (Melin and Enander, 2020) . A society with stronger civic capital has the advantage of trusting in the government in its institutions, and the ability to rely on shared values and norms that support collective governance in times of crises and calm. This legitimacy fosters change and lets societies and systems learn; it is the foundation of resilience. The drivers of civic capital in a society are complex. A society is motivated by its history, constitution, culture, religion, and social norms. Scholars have shown that civic capital can grow if a society empowers self -initiated local groups and invol ves them in decision -making (Krishna, 2007) . As an example, tax incentives have increased participation in community -based groups and changes in village layout have improved network and trust within communities (Aldrich, 2010) . Governments may find that identifying and customising contextually relevant policy levers that build civic capital are worthwhile endeavours that increase their country's resilience in the next crisis. 103 CHAPTER 8 General discussion and conclusions 104 8 General discussion and conclusions 8.1 Overview of key findings The overarching aim of this thesis was to contribute to the health system resilience literature by bridging the gap between concept and practice of resilience in the health system through approaching the topic from multiple perspectives and country -based empirical evidence especially that of low - and middle - income contexts. Three specific objectives have been set out to achieve this aim: I) To syn thesize evidence on key features of resilient health systems in low- and middle - income countries (Chapter 4); II) To improve the understanding of the characteristics of health system resilience based on a national response to a crisis and how countries ca n improve resilience in their health care systems (Chapter 5); III) To explore the perspectives of NGOs dealing with unexpected shocks on health systems and to reflect on the practical implications of resilience for stakeholders in global health cooperatio n (Chapter 6). Chapter 4 reviewed the empirical evidence of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries by synthesizing the key features of resilient health systems. We proposed a refined conceptual framework for health system resilience that conceptually tracks the journey from the health system shock to the five attributes of resilient health systems from Kruk et al's a priori themes. The five identified as the foundations of resilience , which can serve as critical inputs for unlocking Kruk et al's resilience attributes. Social capital, which comprises of trust, shared vision, and collaboration, have been found to be common to both health system strengthening and resilient responses to c rises, hence proving pivotal in both crises and calm. The review prompted low - and middle - income countries to consider building the foundations of resilience as a priority to better prepare for future shocks. Chapter 5 applied our previously developed fra mework to examine the characteristics of resilience that have been salient or absent in Myanmar's response to Cyclone Nargis. Strong social capital and motivation stemming from its deep -rooted cultural and religious networks were found as Myanmar's greates t assets that filled major gaps in the system. In contrast, its postcolonial and military legacy posed barriers towards investing in building its long -term foundations for resilience. In Myanmar's case, it can leverage its assets (social capital and motiva tion) as opportunities to achieve long -term health goals towards resilience. On a more practical level, Myanmar can invest on building its long-term infrastructures in remote areas, prioritise in human resource preparedness and redesign its institutions an d organisational structures to serve its evolving purposes and to prepare for future shocks. Chapter 6 examined how and 105 to what extent Swiss -based NGOs with a focus on global health have dealt with unexpected shocks in the health systems of their partner c ountries and reflected upon the practical implications of resilience in development cooperation. We found that health system resilience is a collective endeavour and a result of many stakeholders' consistent and targeted investments. These investments open up new opportunities to seek innovative solutions and to keep diverse actors in global health accountable. Strong governance, a bi -directional knowledge exchange and the focus on leveraging science for impact can draw greater potential for resilience in t he health systems. In this regard, the governments and the NGOs have unique points of contributions to target the strongest determinant of resilience, which was found as the degree of investments made for building long -term infrastructures and human resour ce development which are well -functioning prior to any crises. Chapter 7 presented an editorial clarifying the connection between civic capital, a component of social capital, and resilience. We argued that civic capital is a key ingredient of resilience required by health system actors to manage and recover from crises because strong civic capital is indicative of a higher trust in governments and institutions, and this collective approach to governance is what improves resilience. 8.2 Critical discussions This thesis has contributed to improving the understanding of health system resilience based on the specific objectives defined, and the insights generated will have practical implications especially suitable for low - and middle - income countries when bui lding resilience in their given context. Objective I) To synthesize evidence on key features of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries The contribution of this thesis was that it synthesized empirical evidence on key features of resilient health systems in low- and middle - income settings and proposed a refined conceptual framework that can be applied when preparing for the next crisis. Our framework presents critical inputs that are required in health systems that can enable resi lience. The current frameworks in health system resilience thus far have assumed resilience either as a desirable outcome to strive for or an essential capacity to build (Topp, 2020) . Kruk et al's five attributes of resilie nce is a good case in point, as the framework describes the key characteristics of a health system, which are 'outputs' that are dependent on a context of strong national and local leadership, committed health workforce, sufficient infrastructure, and glob al support (Kruk et al., 2017) . Our new framework (figure 12) has confirmed these five attributes as 'outputs' of resilience. The five new 106 themes resulting from our analysis, namely, the foundations of resilience have been introduced as vital 'inputs' that serve as preconditions to unlock Kruk e t al's resilience attributes (Chapter 4). Figure 13. Refined Conceptual Model of Health System Resilience (Chapter 4) On the other spectrum, Blanchet et al's framework which has been adapted from the social -ecological literature, sees resilience less as an outcome but as a governance capacity. The four operational dimensions (knowledge, uncertainties, interdependence and legitimacy) were introduced as governance capacities that can bring out the absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities that are indicative of resilience in health systems (Blanchet et al., 2017) . Our framework embraces governance and leadership as one attribute of resilience when for example there has been successful coordination structure created for the crises and successful decent ralization of responsibilities. These are indications that health systems are well 'integrated' and 'adaptive' (Kruk et al., 2015) , exhibiting the desired outputs of resilience. Hence, our framework uniquely presents resilience in health systems as a journey tracked from the initial health system shock and depicts the foundations of resilience that can serve as inputs to activate resilience outputs. The myopic view of resilience has been called out by Biddle et al's literature review that studies on resilience typically address a few components of health systems rather than considering the inter -connected system as a whole. Our synthesis included an exercise in which elements of resilience were matched to the six building blocks of the heal th system (World Health 107 Organization, 2007) that surface d as strengths or weaknesses when responding to crises. This analytical stage was crucial in order to take a holistic view of resilience in light of the traditional building blocks of the health system and how it connects with the resilience foundations an d attributes identified in our study. Systematic reviews on organisational resilience based on empirical evidence either have taken a cross -disciplinary approach including experiences from non -health sectors or have referred mostly to studies from high -income countries (Barasa et al., 2018) , (Biddle et al., 2020) . The COVID -19 pandemic has made it explicit that the so -called high - performing health systems are not necessarily the most resilient (El Bcheraoui et al., 2020) . The opposite is also true; health systems in resource -constrained contexts may equal ly embody resilient features that can be shared as lessons for all. The rationale for restricting the inclusion criteria to only low - and middle - income countries in our synthesis was to level the playing field by identifying features of resilience that ar e found in similar contexts where traditional health system building blocks may not be fully functioning. 'Realigned relationships, 'foresight,' 'motivation,' have been identified as drivers of resilience that can help health systems overcome structural ba rriers and 'change management,' and 'emergency preparedness,' as organisational mechanisms and enabling structures that can activate resilience. These foundations of resilience are what empowers low - and middle - income countries to move through the absorpt ive, adaptive and transformative capacities in response to a shock. Barasa et al's systematic review on organisational resilience may view the foundations of resilience as organisational hardware and software (Barasa et al., 2018) . What we refer to as drivers of resilience is what Barasa et al l abels as the system's intangible software such as norms, power and trust, which determines the relational aspects of system actors (Elloker et al., 2012) ; when it comes to our organisational mechanisms, Barasa et al points to the system's hardware and tangible software, encompassing human resources, inf rastructure and management skills that provide structure to the system (Sheikh et al., 2011) , (Barasa et al., 2017) . What is missing in this discourse is what motivates health systems to evolve in the first place. The observation that health systems and services are complex, adaptive but also deeply social in nature (Greenhalgh and Papoutsi, 2018) brings us to conclude that individuals or groups comprising the health systems take action only when there is a vested interest to do so (Topp, 2020) . Our framework thus takes a purpose -driven approach in acknowledging that shared values and visions are what compels individuals, institutions and systems to transform its leadership, communication style and data surveillance methods (Pronovost et al., 2017) . This requires a systems t hinking approach to redefine the health system to serve its evolving purpose (Arnold and Wade, 2015) . Collective sensemaking , an approach to organise 108 different actors in achieving collective health goals based on power sharing and trust building, is a crucial process in managing power dynamics within the health system and to streamline conflicting interests (Gilson et al., 2021) , which is the driving force behind the foundations of resilience identified in our framework. In summary , our new framework provides an applicable reference point for health systems in low - and middle - income countries to prioritise investing into the key foundations as a way to improve their preparedness and resilience for future shocks. Objective II) To improve the understanding of the characteristics of health system resilience based on a national response to a crisis and how countries can improve resilience in their health care systems The framework developed from this thesis has been empirically applie d to explore how a national response to a crisis can expose characteristics of resilience and whether the lessons generated can be transferred to improve resilience in other health systems in similar contexts. For this purpose, we have chosen Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia classified as a lower -middle -income economy by the World Bank (World Bank, 2022) . Myanmar is constantly at risk of natural disasters, its coastal regions prone to cyclones and tropical storms while the whole country experiences periodic earth quakes (Wor ld Health Organization, 2014a) . Cyclone Nargis, a category three cyclone, had been Myanmar's worst natural disasters of its recorded history, disrupting at least 2.4 million lives and damaging close to 75% of the health facilities in the affected townsh ips (Tripartite Core Group, 2008) . The key findings from our study revealed that strong social capital and motivation were the key foundations of resilience Myanmar embodied as their greatest assets in the health system. We define social capital as a process of building trusting relations hips, common understanding and shared actions that serve as a basis for individuals, communities and institutions to mobilise for collection action (Loeffler et al., 2004) . The power of collective civic duty emanating from Myanmar's strong social capital filled the service gaps that the government had fai led to provide in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone. This momentum was comprised of informal channels and trusted networks in the communities, motivated by a deep -rooted faith in religion and culture. Our finding is exceptionally meaningful because th e cyclone response occurred despite the backdrop of a long -standing military rule and a complicated colonial history. With the military coup that took place on the 1st of February, 2021, however, Myanmar's transition to 109 democracy and its capacity to provi de adequate health services during the COVID -19 pandemic have been severely restricted (Han et al., 2021) . The United Nations Security Council assembled an emergency meeting and drafted a resolution condemning the military action and calling for the release of detainees to restore its democracy (United Nations , 2021) . Meanwhile, the people of Myanmar have started a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), exhibiting peaceful resistance on the streets and various social media platforms to restore justice and democracy. Health workers have actively been on the front lines of the CDM resulting in temporary closures of public hospitals and medical and nursing universities (Soe et al., 2021) . Myanmar is yet again facing an extreme external shock in the health system caused by a double threat of a global health crisis and a military coup (Rocha et al., 2021) . The same source of motivation for collective social action that brought Myanmar back up from Cyclone Nargis will serve valuable for it to reclaim justice and exhibit systemic resilience. In the aftermath of Nepal's earthquake in 2015 and Sierra Leone's Ebola outbreak in 2014, the health workers in both contexts exhibited everyday resilience in consistently serving in their roles albeit limited support and lack of critical infrastructure (Raven et al., 2018) . The major difference between the two cases were, however, the establishment of a relationship based on trust between the health workers and t he communities; in Nepal, a strong sense of cohesion and community action was observed, where health workers played a central role in driving the relief momentum. Yet, in Sierra Leone, the health workers themselves were highly stigmatised and mistrusted by the communities out of fear from infection (Raven et al., 2018 ). Legitimacy is created only when institutions and norms are established based on an appropriate context and social acceptance (Blanchet et al., 2017) . Therefore, community trust and ownership is a critical precondition for any kind of health system engagement. A community with a strong existing social capital can jump start this process due to the trust and legitimacy endowed upon collective actions. One of the most critical findings of this thesis is the role of social capital as an interconnecting mechanism common to both health system strengthening and resilient responses to crises. In Myanmar, social capital acted as the accelerator th at facilitated resilience beyond its health system capacity. The same pattern has been observed in Liberia, for example, with leadership and social capital playing a more significant role in controlling the 2014 Ebola epidemic than any short -term vertical initiatives to deliver health services (Alonge 110 et al., 2019) . Stro ng social capital, described in terms of the strength of bonds and connections at community level, trusted community channels, and trust among health system stakeholders, facilitated collection action and drew effective responses from the health system (Alonge et al., 2019) . The power of social capital was also evident i n routine vaccination activities. Where there is strong social capital and shared collective value, positive messages and experiences about vaccines built people's trust in vaccinations (Ozawa et al., 2016) . This may explain why communities with strong social capital may show higher immunization coverage (Nagaoka et al., 2012) . The underlying mechanism is that societies with a stronger social capital have h igher trust in governments and institutions and are open to taking a collective appro ach to governance. When communities themselves start carrying out critical health system functions, the collective momentum for community resilience prompts what Barker et al calls a 'fortuitous cycle' of increased trust, improved communication and continu ed meaningful community engagement, all of which are crucial preconditions for enabling health system resilience (Barker et al., 2020) . In resource -constrained settings, community resilience is one of the best preventive strategies for countries to build health system resilience. Fosterin g social capital ought to be approached at three levels: bonding with communities, bridging communities, and linking communities through ties with financial and public institutions (Mathbor, 2007) . Any activity whether it be political, religious, cultural, or recreational that promotes effective coordination at the grassroots level is a starting point for bonding within comm unities. When communities join other communities in the society to form a coalition, this leads to bridging. Finally, when these communities establish ties with different actors representing the government, non -governmental organisations (NGOs), United Nat ions (UN), foundations, the synergy created will be exponential (Mathbor, 2007) . Civil society groups in Myanmar have mat ured through the bonding, linking and bridging stages of social capital. These existing social communities exhibited great resilience through formal and informal community -based groups coming together as first responders of the Cyclone to offer food, shelt er, and basic commodities to the affected villages. Long before the Cyclone, however, Myanmar already had existing social committees at village level, well acquainted with the surroundings and ready to mobilise for a common cause. Similarly, during the 201 4 Ebola epidemic, effective coordination of recovery efforts and information sharing came from action committees in the slums of Monrovia comprised of youth leaders, which later evolved into branches of district -level administration and linking communities with the local and central 111 governments (Alonge et al., 2019) . The re should be a paradigm shift amongst government officials and policy makers to give sufficient emphasis on social capital as they would for any other capital or infrastructural support rendered in response to a crisis. Deliberate strategies to build socia l capital and trust within and between communities and institutions long before any crisis will ensure improved national responses to shocks and resilient health systems. Objective III) To explore the perspectives of NGOs dealing with unexpected shocks on health systems and to reflect on the practical implications of resilience for stakeholders in global health cooperation The key findings from Chapter 6 add a multidisciplinary lens to understanding resilience. We are starkly reminded of the importance of global health security every time the world collectively fails to control a pandemic. The changing landscape and multipol arity of actors in global health governance have undoubtedly made collective decision making more complicated than ever before. Albeit the ongoing debates on the legitimacy of non -state actor s in global health , the NGOs in particular have become inevitably more prominent in global health governance not only due to its large and diversified funding streams, but also due to its growing governance capacity in applying pressure to conventional leaders of global health by providing the necessary checks and balan ces. In addition, the investments from NGOs are no longer merely monetary but an opportunity to stir partners towards innovative solutions to problems and to keep diverse players in global health accountable. The influential role of these non -state actors, however, is a double -edged sword. On one hand, some non -state actors such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have exerted greater power than many nation -states. With their enormous financial prowess they enable investments for global health but also influence how and what prioritise are financed (Smith, 2010) . These have been predominantly vertical programmes focusing on diseases instead of strengthening the overall health systems. (Buse, 2004) . In response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, NGOs and donor funding focused heavily on delivering the 'fast variables' in the form of temporary infrastructu re, surveillance teams and infection prevention supplies without consideration of the longer term health system. Huge influx of investments went towards health worker trainings on infection prevention, but no emphasis was given to building a well -trained n urse cadre 112 that can serve the health system as a whole (Ling et al., 2017) . As a key stakeholder in development cooperation and global health governance, non -state actors such as the NGOs have the responsibilities to protect and work alon gside national governments in times of crises and to offer appropriate support where the investments can be sustained and that preparedness can lead to resilience. Our study found that the NGOs can best support countries' resilience building process when they leverage their local and global presence to facilitate a bi -directional knowledge exchange from the global North to the global South, and also from South to South and even from South to North. This exchange includes supporting partner countries to max imise science for impact. During the COVID -19 pandemic, countries that have been equipped with digital innovations such as telemedicine have reaped remarkable benefits particularly during the restrictions of the pandemic (Bhaskar et al., 2020) . In the early months of the pandemic, 'scientific globalism,' a pattern seeking open and collab orative science to advance knowledge and address joint challenges, was observed where the proportion of scientific articles that were based on international collaborations was higher than the historical average (Lee and Haupt, 2021) . Such collaboration was also occurring even between researchers in the opposite political alliances, as in the case of the U.S. and China (Fry et al., 2020) . We have coined this term in our systematic review (Chapter 4) as 'realigned relationships,' a critical foundation of resilience wher e the system is able to respond to disruptions by realigning working relationships and building mutual trust between countries, teams and individuals to work collaboratively towards shared goals, even if it means overcoming historical and cultural norms. M ultilateral collaboration between countries is crucial when responding to global public health emergencies (Jit et al., 2021) ; yet, it is proven difficult to achieve, as governments often end up prioritising domestic challenges and dropping longe r- term global commitments (Frieden et al., 2012) . Leaving such political games aside, NGOs can target and redirect their investments towards scientific innovations, research, and capacity building to bring the divergent actors together for a common cause. As found throughout thi s thesis, investing in the 'slow variables' of the system such as building a sustainable career path for essential health workers and improving the structural capacity of its health infrastructure will support countries move beyond disaster preparedness an d build a stronger health system that can function in both crisis and in calm (Kruk et al., 2017) . The role of NGOs in resilience building is especially crucial for fragile and conflict -affected settings where 113 the states lack the capacity to lead the political process to establish legitimacy, build trust, and reconcile the state -society expectation (OECD, 2008) . In such a context of fragility, our studies found that strong community structures and civil society groups are able to fill the vacu ums created by the lack of state governance and facilitate resilience through the solidarity of the participating communities. This was evidenced in the accounts of Myanmar during the Cyclone Nargis where community engagement was the main source of timely support in the first three weeks after the Cyclone where access to the affected regions were cut off from external support (Chapter 5). It was also testified by respondents working in Taliban -led Afghanistan where the communities served as the sole source of continuous development and drove the decision -making processes (Chapter 6). These communities exhibited high social and civic capital and with their shared values and norms exercised collective governance. This capacity of 'legitimacy' is an important component of resilient health systems and which can only be strengthened through an inclusive process of engaging communities and civil society groups (Blanchet et al., 2017) . However, this sense of social cohesion and participatory governance should be extended to local governments and formal institutions if resilience should be nurtured at the system level. The momentum should be bottom -up; building up local governments that closely reflect the traditional identities and values of the communities and to harness the existing societal bonds to bestow authority to manage their own affairs (Kaplan, 2009) . This approach will require donors and NGOs to display a deeper sense of humility and patience on first restoring the fabric of legitimacy in th e communities and establishing a platform where different actors can collaborate based on trust. 8.3 Methodological considerations In order to bridge the gap between the concept and practice of resilience in health systems, we employed methodologies that m ay best capture the complex nature of the topic. Chapter 4 was a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), a type of systematic review that systematically brings together findings from primary research that uses qualitative methods of data collection and analy sis (Flemming and Noyes, 2021) . Specifically, we used a best -fit framework synthesis approach, often applied in a rapid evidence synthesis of qualitative data to ge nerate context -specific models or programme theories that have potential relevance for policy -makers and field practitioners (Carroll et al., 2013) . Chapter 5 and 6 were primary qualitative studies 114 based on semi -structured in -depth interviews and which employed the refined conceptual framework developed by the systematic review (Chapter 4) for analysis. By using a two -step approach, first conducting a systematic review and later applying the framewor k developed for further empirical studies, this thesis aims to increase validity of the new framework whilst establishing a greater understanding of resilient health systems from multiple perspectives, drawing from the rich interpretations based on the exp eriences and views of study participants. Though methodological strengths and limitations have been discussed within the relevant chapters, broader considerations pertaining to the validity and credibility of our overall findings are elaborated in this cha pter. 8.3.1 Systematic review findings A best -fit framework synthesis approach was used to synthesize key features of resilient health systems in low - and middle - income countries and to propose a refined conceptual framework illustrating how the themes interconnect (Chapter 4). The following sections discuss the study's quality by using a set of criteria to assess its methodological rigour and the framework's validity. Methodological rigour and confidence of findings: As this study falls under the umbrella of a systematic review of qualitative evidence, also known as qualitative evidence synthesis, we made reference to the Cochrane's Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC)'s template (Glenton et al., 2021) al., 2021) , and the ENTREQ statement (Tong et al., 2012) for the development of the initial protocol as well as for the final write -up. A comprehensive search strategy was devised with the support of an external expert to ensure quality check. We then closely followed the specific methodological steps of a best -fit framework synthesis approach by deductively starting with a 'good enough' framework, but also inductively taking the approaches of a thematic synthesis to develop themes until all data have been accounted for (Carroll et al., 2011 ), (Carroll et al., 2013) . Quality appraisal of the included studies has been conducted prior to the data extraction by two authors independently using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative rese arch, one of the most commonly used tools in qualitative evidence syntheses according to Cochrane and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (Noyes et al., 2018) . The authors have rated each study closely following the checklist criteria and gave a final rating of outstanding, fair, and 115 poor. After discussing d iscrepancies, the authors have collectively decided to include all 12 studies, as it was deemed there were sufficient higher quality studies with stronger explanatory power that can compensate for the lower quality studies. The studies that didn't rank hig hly were still able to corroborate the findings from the studies with higher ratings. After completing the review, the GRADE -CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) approach can be used to assess how much confidence we can p lace in the review's findings to provide a reasonable representation of the health issue or interest (Lewin et al., 2018) . The following four components contribute to the assessment: (1) methodological limitations (2) coherence (3) adequacy of data (4) relevance. Table 13 outlines the definitions of the four components of th e CERQual approach and table 14 describes what each of the ratings indicate. Table 13. Definitions of the components of the CERQual approach (Lewin et al., 2018) Component Definition Methodological limitations The extent to which th ere are concerns about the design or conduct of the primary studies that contributed evidence to an individual review finding Coherence An assessment of how clear and cogent the fit is between the data from the primary studies and a review finding that synthesiz es that data. By 'cogent' we mean well supported or compelling Adequacy of data An overall determination of the degree of richness and quantity of data supporting a review finding Relevance The extent to which the body of evidence from the primary studies supporting a review finding is applicable to the context (perspective or population, phenomenon of interest, setting) specified in the review question Table 14.

As reference to table 15 , the key summary of our findings were evaluated based on the relevant primary studies contributing to the review findings, assessment of included studies according to the four components (methodologic al limitations, coherence, adequacy, relevance), and the final assessment of confidence in the evidence. Two of the findings were rated with high 116 confidence, in which the findings were deemed robust for policy decisions and real world application. The othe r two of the findings were rated with moderate confidence, indicating that the review would benefit from a higher quantity and quality of primary research to increase the review's overall confidence. 117 Table 15. CERQual Summary of Qualitative Findings Table from our synthesis Objective: to improve the understanding of: 1) the common key features of a resilient health system in low - and middle -income countries, building on Kruk and colleagues' framework on health system resilience. 2) other features that are critical in the context of low - and-middle income countries outside of Kruk and colleagues' framework that may indicate capacity for resilience. Perspective: Lessons learnt, findings, perceptions, experiences relating with responses to an external shock that would unveil the capacity of health system resilience, building on the a priori conceptual framework for analysis Included studies: Qualitative or mixed methods studies of low - and middle - income countries that underwent a major shock since 2014 Summary of review finding Studies contributing to the review finding (author surname and year of publication) CERQual assessment of confidence in the evidence Explanation of the CERQual assessment 1.

This enabled us to test our a priori framework (Kruk et al., 2017) with relevant empirical data, but also to bui ld on it through further empirical analysis. The framework uniquely illustrate resilience as a journey that a system undergoes from the initial shock and portrays the foundations of resilience that can se rve as inputs to activate resilience outputs. Having embraced the socio -political determinants of health, it is applicable for the wider health system including ministries, organisations, hospitals, and communities to collectively reflect upon areas of investments required to build resilience prior to a cri sis. The framework has been applied and tested for two primary studies in this thesis and has proven useful as a comprehensive analytical tool. The framework has restricted its inclusion criteria to analyse primary studies from only low - and middle - income countries. As the COVID -19 pandemic has made it clear that the so -called high -performing countries are not necessarily more resilient and better prepared for crises (El Bcheraoui et al., 2020) , the framework ought to be extended and substantiated for its applicability in high -income countries as well. Finally, the framework has adopted a purely qualitative angle without including any quantitative studies nor measurable indices. The coding framework and its respective themes and sub -themes have been generated based on the a priori framework with referenc e to Kruk et al's resilience index (Kruk et al., 2017) , but the included primary studies and the analytical framework have been built around qualitative research methods. Considering the wider literature, all the frameworks on health system resilience thus far have been operationalised exclusive ly in qualitative research (Kruk et al., 2017), et al., 2017) , (Barasa et al., 2017) . Very few empirical studies have explicitly applied a conceptual framework for data collection nor capture the complex dimensions of resilience revealed in the frameworks (Biddle et al., 2020) . In this regard, our framework would provide a solid basis to operationalise health system resilience, but it would benefit from a matching quantifiable metrics that can measure critical components of the framework, such as the foundations of resilience, which could potentially be used for programme monitoring and budgeting purposes. 8.3.2. Qualitative findings Semi -structured in -depth interviews were used to explore the following research questions: 1) To improve the understanding of the characteristics of health system resilience based on a national response to a crisis and how 119 countries can improve resilience in their health care systems (Chapter 5); 2) To explore t he perspectives of NGOs dealing with unexpected shocks on health systems and to reflect on the practical implications of resilience for stakeholders in global health cooperation (Chapter 6). Four criteria are widely used to assess the rigour of qualitative research: credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability (Guba et al., 1994) . These criteria are considered comparable to internal validity, reliability, objectivity, and external validity in quantitative research (Guba et al., 1994) . Credibility: Credibility ensures that the re search findings are trustworthy and the chosen methodology is well justified. The first marker of credibility is the alignment between the theoretical framework used, how it is used to answer the research question, and the connection it has with the data c ollection method, analysis and results (Stenfors et al., 2020) . We have chosen semi -structured in -depth interviews for data collection, as the method best addresses the complexities of the experiences, perceptions and recommendations associated with the topic and offers insight to the 'how' and 'why' questions posed. Then, the refined conceptual framework for health system resilience developed from our previous systemati c review (Chapter 4) was used to build the analytical framework. A data -driven thematic analysis following the steps of the framework method with an open coding process enabled flexibility beyond the initial structure. The authors used both deductive and i nductive approaches to uphold structure and flexibility in addressing the research question. According to Stenfors et al, the number of respondents or the length of observation do not guarantee high quality research; rather, the depth, richness and appropr iateness of the data determine its rigour (Stenfors et al., 2020) . All the participants were purposively selected through a snowball sampling of relevant referrals via contacts introduced through the first author's existing network while working and living in Myanmar (Chapter 5) and referrals from Medicus Mundi Switzerland, a network comprised of Swiss organisations active in international health cooperation (Chapter 6). Some of the interviewees themselves acted as referrals as well to suggest relevant participants. This was proven as an effective method to include a narrow group of participants who meet the selection criteria whether it be having direct involvement in th e response efforts of Cyclone Nargis in 2008 (Chapter 5) or having active ongoing health programmes in low - and middle - income countries as a Swiss -based NGO (Chapter 6). It was also noted that sufficient interviews were conducted to exhibit adequate 'info rmation power,' to show that we have reached the 120 appropriate depth and breadth of data to address the research question (Varpio et al., 2017) . In addition, in order to partially offset a possible recall bias due to the time lag between the actual event and data collection, triangulation through supplementar y data such as event pictures, reports and media clips have been obtained from the participants to enhance credibility. It is widely recognised that triangulation technique can corroborate evidence collected from diverse sources and support a richer unders tanding of the phenomenon of interest (Varpio et al., 20 17). A few interviewees were approached a second time via video conference in order to verify the accuracy of the transcripts and to confirm the alignment of the results with participant responses. This process is called 'member reflections,' a strategy to increase credibility of the analysis by presenting the preliminary findings to the participants for input and elaboration (Stenfors et al., 2020) . Dependability: Dependability is the extent to which the research can be replicated in similar conditions. High quality research has an analytical strategy and framework to guide coding decisions with clearly defined steps (Stenfors et al., 2020) . Both of our qualitative studies have devised a codebook with all the categories and codes that have been discussed and agreed upon by all the authors. Based on the codebook, open coding was c onducted using MAXQDA 2018 by a single author but the final framework matrix was completed with extensive discussions with all the authors involved. The framework matrix is a detailed chart of verbatim quotes systematically arranged according to the agreed categories and themes, which is a crucial account of the analytic stage. The methods section of the manuscript (Chapter 5 and 6) describes in detail how the steps have been undertaken in order for other researchers to follow the same procedure if necessar y. The authors have generated key themes summarised them in the results sections, which are evidences of sound qualitative research. Confirmability: Confirmability refers to the link between the data and the findings, which can be identified through detailed descriptions and use of quotes from the interviews (Stenfors et al., 2020) . The analysis of both studies have been meticulously guided by verbatim quotations from the interviews and have been included throughout the manuscript to substantiate the key findings. Though a formal audit trail was not conducted, triang ulation of multiple sources and reference to additional reports and literature have been used to strengthen confirmability of the findings and to prevent investigator's bias. 121 Transferability: Transferability suggests whether the research findings may be a pplied to another setting, context or group (Houghton et al., 2013) . Our studies have provided thick descriptions of the participants, the research process, the events transpired , and a full interview guide in order to offer a rich contextual background. Findings pertaining to the characteristics of resilience that are salient or absent in crisis management (Chapter 5), and the roles of relevant stakeholders in resilience building (Chapter 6) could potentially benefit health system actors in similar contexts from low - and middle - income settings. The transferability judgement, however, ought to be ultimately made by the readers, according to their own contextual settings (Korstjens and Moser, 2018) . 8.4 Policy and practice recommendations The COVID -19 pandemic has been a wake -up call for all health systems to build and maintain core health system functions in order to prepare for, manage, and learn from disruptions. The practical aspects of acute emergency preparedness and the long -term structural c hallenges to health systems are equally important fo r building resilience in health systems. The key implication of our findings is that health systems in low - and middle - income countries may activate resilience attributes when the following foundations of resilience are does that practically mean and how does this translate into policy and programme action plans? The following recommendations outline what health system actors can do to impro ve resilience in the health systems. Various case examples drawn from the COVID -19 pandemic and best practices from the literature will validate the respective suggestions. 1) Emergency preparedness: ensure that an emergency preparedness strategy and pla n are built into the national health system at all levels Having an emergency preparedness strategy built into the national health system at all levels improves the chances that the strategy can be translated into action when required (Chapter 4). Heymann et al warn the global health community against reinventing the wheel through creating new institutions in response to new crisis but rather to strengthen the existing platforms and to revisit the International Health Regulations (IHR) 122 as a fundamental too l to ensure global health security (Heymann et al., 2021) . The logical step for national level preparedness would be then to better embed the IHR into health systems. There should be stronger accountability towards improving co untries' IHR core capacities through the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), a simulation assessment exercise comprised of domestic and external experts that can help assess gaps and develop a national action plan to strengthen the IHR capacity (Kluge et al., 2018) . Indonesia exemplifies the cascading benefit of the JEE on its commitment towards enhanced emergency preparedness at all administrative levels. Indonesia conducted the JEE of IHR core capacities in 2017 which was soon followed by the development of a nati onal action plan for health security (2020 -2024). There were efforts to align the new national action plan's priority activities, budget and targets closely with the JEE outcomes and outputs. The strength of the JEE exercise was that it generated high -level political commitment across coordinating ministries but also facilitated innovative approaches to expand emergency preparedness to the subnational levels. Since 2018, emergency preparedness was included in the minimum service standards developed by the M inistry of Home Affairs, and meeting such standards were mandatory for each district and municipality. All hospitals and health centres have now been mandated to assess preparedness and operational readiness for identified risks in their catchment areas. (Rai et al., 2020) . As evident in the JEE of Indonesia, country ownership is critical for the investments to be sustained and the activities to be institutionalised. The global health community should further invest into this momentum to ensur e that local core IHR capacities are functioning to detect, report and respond rapidly to future outbreaks. 2) R ealigned relationships : establish strategic alliances through effective coordination mechanisms and public engagements An effective coordinati on mechanism with clearly established roles and decision -making protocols is a critical first step to harmonise divergent actors amidst emergency responses. This thesis demonstrated that a resilient health system responds to disruptions by establishing and renewing partnerships and alliances according to shared goals and visions (Chapter 4). This requires effective coordination within the health sector across horizontal and vertical levels of the government, but also outside of the health sector with non -government stakeholders, civil society groups, corporations and communities. One of the greatest lessons generated from the COVID -19 pandemic was that successful responses were more 123 reliant on the coordination mechanism as well as relevant government actors ' capacity to jointly work across differences, rather than the countries' existing political system nor the extent of decentralisation (Sagan et al., 2021b) . The pandemic responses in countries like France, Finland and Israel were led by the head of government's office, whilst in Greece and Lithuania, the Ministry of Health represented governmental response. Yet, more importantly, it was found that creating a separate coordinating committee improved inter - sectoral governance at the central level involving key sectors in an emergency response (Greer, 2020) . In addition, engaging non -state actors in a systematic way was proven critical not only to dissemin ate key information but also to gain trust and legitimacy by involving citizens, communities and the private sector in the decision making processes. As discussed in Chapter 5, trust and accountability at all levels in the system are what builds the 'capac ity of legitimacy,' a crucial component o f resilient health systems, which can only be strengthened through an inclusive consultation process of engaging communities and civil society groups (Blanchet et al., 2017) . From Brazil to Scotland, open and self -selective public participation mechanisms through town hall meetings, petitions or crowdsourcing exercises, have been shown useful for policy makers to enhance the chance of effective policy implementations and to improve the chances of public adherence (Norheim et al., 2021) . A recent health system resilience checklist developed from relevant stakeholder views in Bangladesh rated coordinating with private and public partners and e stablishing close relationships with communities as highest priorities to ensure health system resilience (Meyer et al., 2020) , which further confirms our recommendation. 3) Foresight : invest in the long -term slow variables of the health system infrastructure and human resources As emphasized throughout this thesis, building resilience is more than preparedness. Health system actors ought to take a long -term perspective, investing in building robust infrastructure over time and cultivating a cadre of health professionals that can function in both crisis and calm. The strongest determinant for resilience identified by the NGOs in Chapter 6 were health system hardware and software that require lo ng term investments (Sheikh et al., 2011) . The findings were consistent with that of other resilient research, revisiting the importance of investing in the 'slow variables' such as building a sustainable career path of essential health workers and improving the structural capacity of its health infrastructure catering to its context -specific risk (Kruk et al., 2017) , 124 (Harris et al., 2017) . Even in Western Europe, the intensive bed capacity varied by a fact or of five, implying that some health systems were not prepared to meet the exponential demand of services in case of a public health emergency (McKeen, 2021) . On the contrary, one of the key factors that led to South Korea's successful response to the initial phase of the COVID -19 pandemic had been infrastructural readiness that came from applying the lessons generated from the previous epidemics. University h ospitals in Seoul have been equipped with ventilators, extra -corporeal membrane oxygenation facilities, and negative pressure intensive care units that had been constructed after the SARS outbreak in 2003, novel influenza of 2009, and the MERS -CoV epidemic of 2015. The same infrastructures have been immediately utilised as critical care hospitals catering for critical COVID -19 patients (Oh et al., 2020) . Furthermore, countries ought to take a broader view of the health workforce and to make investments based on modelling and proje ctions rather than from immediate surge capacity needs. Since the Covid -19 pandemic, the U .S. have taken measures to expand the long -term prospects of public health workforce, employing more public health specialists and administrative staff to support con tact tracing and quarantine measures (Chen et al., 2020) . In Guinea, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 -2015 has provided a momentum for health systems reform with a focus on health workforce development. The Guinean government implemented a health system recovery and resilience strategy with an intention to recruit 6, 000 staff within two years and increase their wages by 40% (van de Pas et al., 2019) . Despite lingering issues of urban -rural inequalities in health worker deployment and a labour market mismatch between skilled graduates and available jobs in the market, the reform itself has been a courageous first step to wards long -term structural resilience building. 4) Motivation: foster strong political will and personal commitment A strong sense of political will from the government was found to have a stabilising effect for the frontline workers and the public (Ch apter 4). Motivation was also brought up by the NGOs as a critical element to build community -based preparedness and resilience, a precondition to enable health system resilience (Chapter 6). Having good political leadership is clearly essential but difficult to guarantee particularly in times of a public health emergency. One approach can be to keep politicians accountable for their capacity to protect the health 125 of their population through th e use of participatory social media and data sharing. In addition, establishing independent task force teams and participatory consensus building forums can distribute power and leadership and share responsibility within the bureaucratic system (Sagan et al., 2021a) . These approaches, however, are usually beyond the control of the ordinary people. A more realistic are a to influence would be to nurture community resilience and motivate frontline health workers. Community resilience in Myanmar was strong during Cyclone Nargis because it was built on a foundation of religion and culture as a motivating force. The power o f solidarity weathered through generations of political and ethnic divisions because there was trust as a backbone (Chapter 5). This momentum of social cohesion and participatory governance will be sustainable when they are extended to local governments an d formal institutions where resilience can be nurtured at the system level (Kaplan, 2009) . This approa ch will require donors and NGOs to display a deeper sense of humility and patience on first restoring the fabric of legitimacy in the communities and establishing a platform where different actors can collaborate based on trust. Linking community actors up ward to local government authorities will be critical as evident in improving the overall maternal health of Uganda (Ekirapa -Kiracho et al., 2016) . Tapping into community capacities require governments, NGOs and International organisations to systematically review and identify how to leverage local resources, build capacities and bridge partnerships from within (George et al., 2016) . In many cases, committed health workforce had been one of the key drivers of resilience that enabled th e health system to overcome shocks in resource -constrained settings. One way to ensure health workers motivation is for the health system to prioritise their physical and mental well -being (Barasa et al., 2018) . A systematic review revealed that retaining and motivating health staff require a combined strategy of financial and non -financial incentives such as increased wages, improved living conditions, further education and training opportunities for professional advancement, and good supervision (Willis -Shattuck et al., 2008) . In some cases, recognition by the c ommunities and the supervisors were reported as one of the most motivating factors for health workers (Dieleman et al., 2006) , (Franco et al., 2004) . A health workforce that feel valued and supported will be sufficiently motivated to withstand any contextual difficulties. 5) Change management: integrate new initiatives and reforms into the system prior to the crises Changes and reforms in the health system can cause major disruptions whe n they are not fully incorporated 126 into the system. Various new initiatives whether it be e -health information system, decentralised health management, or new supply chain methods, can build resilience when they have been well -integrated prior to any crisis (Chapter 4). For example, well -adapted and scaled -up digital innovations can support the flexibility required in times of shocks. This is an area where the NGOs and international organisations can make unique contributions (Chapter 6) . The demand for new digital tools and innovations is growing but their scale up requires sufficient resources and technical assistance. As shown how an NGOs' introduction of a new mobile application can im prove the overall primary health care system in rural West Africa (Enric Jan\u00e9, 2018) , technological and innovation gaps can be filled by NGOs to leverage science for impact as described in Chapter 6 of this thesis. A successful scale up of innovations and new initiativ es require first and foremost a user -centric design that is context -appropriate (Lab rique et al., 2018) . Ghana's example of scaling up digital health based on end -user insights highlighted the importance of engaging community health workers in remote communities from the design and development process, which can revolutionize the uptak e of technology and bring measurable benefits to the health system (Novartis Foundation, 2010) . There should be sufficient investments in training and motivating the end -users as well as to support the relevant government ministries and local authorities to establish accountability mechanisms and repo rting structures to create an enabling environment for technological innovations to be further rolled -out (Labrique et al., 2018) . As mentioned in Chapter 6, it is crucial here to build on the unique contextual strengths of the country's unique health system, whether it be through existing community health worker structures, doctor bri gades or traditional birth attendants. These diverse structures will serve as assets in the communities for new initiatives to be contextualised and sustained. 8.5 Opportunities for future research Further research would be recommended to strengthen the lingering research gaps in health system resilience and to make resilience research readily applicable in the frontlines. First of all, our new conceptual framework (Chapter 4) has restricted its inclusion criteria to primary studies from low- and middle - income countries. As the COVID -19 pandemic has made it clear that the so -called high - 127 performing countries are not necessarily more resilient and better prepared for crises (El Bcheraoui et al., 2020) , the framework ought to be extended and substantiated for its applicability in high -income countries as well. The framework's va lidity could be further tested and applied in multiple country settings, for instance employing a case study comparison to juxtapose the framework's use in high -income and low - and middle - income contexts. It would also add value for the framework to be ap proached vis -\u00e0-vis the current frameworks developed by the WHO, World Bank, and different international NGOs for the purpose of emergency preparedness and whether the concepts may be applicable for different stakeholder groups. Second, due to the COVID -19 pandemic's travel restrictions imposed during the data collection period, the research only represents the view of International organisations and NGOs, restricting the scope of study to the perceptions of a single stakeholder group. Though the diversity of the participants' nationalities, previous work experiences have potentially added to the robustness of the findings, future studies should explore capturing a wider range of stakeholders, especially the perceptions of communities, frontline workers, and local government authorities who may be able to offer a more holistic view of the topic. Third, there were insufficient attention given to the other determinants of resilience, arising from social, financial, and political dimensions, which are all critical aspects that have been revealed from the COVID -19 crisis that affect resilience. Future studies could explore elaborating on these topics and shed light on how the role of governance in different political structures (e.g. socialist, autocratic, d emocratic systems) can have an impact on resilience. Finally, our thesis overall took a purely qualitative method without including any quantitative studies nor measurable indice s. The coding framework and its respective themes and sub -themes have been gen erated based on the a priori framework with reference to Kruk et al's resilience index (Kruk et al., 2017) , but the included primary studies and the analytical framework have been built around qualitative research methods. Considering the wider literature, all the frameworks on health system resilience thus far have been operationalised exclusively in qualitative research (Kruk et al., 2017) . Very few em pirical studies have explicitly applied a conceptual framework for data collection nor capture the complex dimensions of resilience revealed in the frameworks (Biddle et al., 2020) . In this regard, our new framework would benefit from a matching quantifiable metrics that can measure critical components of the framework, such as the foundations of resilience, which could potentially be used for plannin g, budgeting and monitoring purposes. 128 References ABIMBOLA, S. & TOPP, S.
