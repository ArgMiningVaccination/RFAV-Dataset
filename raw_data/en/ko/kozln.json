We conducted this review to inform a deliberative methods demonstration conducted as part of the Community Forum project, which seeks to expand public input to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Effective Health Care Program and its comparative effectiveness research enterprise, as well as to advance the field of public deliberation. The deliberative methods demonstration, fielded in fall 2012, entailed 72 sessions conducted using four distinct deliberative approaches. Participants were randomly selected members of the public residing in the Sacramento, North Carolina, Chicago, and Washington DC areas; groups were demographically diverse and composed of 12 to 24 members. In conducting the literature review, we sought to understand the following: (1) What are the fundamental conceptual and philosophical underpinnings of public deliberation? (2) What are the defining characteristics of deliberative methods? What are the distinguishing features among methods? (3) How has p ublic deliberation been used previously, across fields and to address health issues in particular? Has public deliberation been applied to health research? (4) What comparative studies about public deliberation have been conducted, and what has been found? (5) How are outcomes of public deliberation measured? (6) What are the necessary conditions for successful deliberation and what can inhibit it? (7) What are the key implementation considerations that foster successful and high quality deliberation? Our review was dr iven by the practical need to design and implement an empirical study of public deliberation. Therefore, the analysis of the available literature focuses on information that inform strategies to obtain public input on questions related to comparative effec tiveness research in health. Methods To determine the literature review scope and process, we developed a conceptual framework. We also conducted 17 key informant interviews with experts in public deliberation, technology - based deliberation, and CER to obtain information about public deliberation that might not be in ES-2 the literature and to gain insight into the utility of public input to health care decisionmaking, and more specifically to comparative effectiveness research. We then developed a search strategy and inclusion and exclusion criteria to guide decisionmaking about whether or not to include an article in the final set for abstraction (Exhibit ES. 1). We narrowed all searches to English language resources dated 2002 to 2010 to focus on recent examples of public deliberation but included resources dated prior to 2002 if our team members identified them as seminal works. Exhibit ES.1.

Based on the final search strategy, we searched literature in PubMed, ERIC, EBSCO, National Bureau of Economic Research, and Cochrane databases. Across all databases, the team reviewed 1,665 abstracts for relevance. Although we focused primarily on peer- reviewed literature, we expected that many of the most recent applications of public deliberat ion would be found in grey literature, defined as literature that was not peer -reviewed but met the inclusion criteria. This literature included presentations, white papers, trade publications, issue briefs, and book anthologies. We identified relevant gre y literature by seeking publications from organizations that are widely known to be practitioners of public deliberation, such as AmericaSpeaks, Viewpoint Learning, The Jefferson Center, and Public Agenda. ES-3 Results Identified Resources From the peer- reviewed and grey literature, we identified and reviewed 206 unique resources. The abstraction team determined thirteen of these to be irrelevant, yielding a final set of 193 abstracted peer -reviewed articles and grey literature. We collected and reviewed an addi tional 106 resources over the course of the project that were primarily conceptual in nature or which elaborated on abstracted articles; we did not abstract these additional resources but cited them when relevant to the discussion below. Of the 193 abstracted articles, w e classified the majority as single empirical studies (n=94). Of these, four included a control group and had a design aimed at a comparison of deliberative outcomes for a deliberating group and its control. A breakdown of the abstracted literature by topic is in Exhibit ES. 2 and by strength of evidence in Exhibit ES. 3. Exhibit ES.2.

Definitions of Public Deliberation The literature presents public deliberation as grounded in the philosophy of deliberative democracy, a specific area of political science whose proponents argue that members of the public should be thoughtfully engaged in and informed about the issues that shape their public life. The process of public deliberation involves members of the public in the careful weighing of multiple, often competing arguments on moral or ethical social issues through facilitated discussion. Deliberation is governed by the principle of mutual sharing of perspectives and respect for differing points of view (Jacobs, Cook, and delli Carpini, 2009; Burkhalter, Gastil, and Kelshaw, 2002). Despite the range of methods of public deliberation descri bed in the literature, the literature is fairly consistent in suggesting that public deliberation is a distinct method of obtaining public input on decisions that are important to society. Public deliberation asks participants to develop solutions about societal problems or issues posed to the group (i.e., the \"deliberative topic\") that inherently evoke competing morals, ethics, or values and for which a range of prospective viewpoints and solutions exist. Characteristics of the Deliberative Process Delibe rative processes share three broad characteristics: A sponsor seeks input from members of the public. Sponsors of public deliberation include public agencies and private organizations. Participants are generally lay persons who are engaged in the process w ith the perspective of members of the public, as opposed to stakeholders who might have a vested interest in the deliberative topic, field, or area of study. Participants consider an ethical - or values-based dilemma. Questions appropriate for public deliberation do not have a simple technical answer or solution. Instead, ES-5 they involve a tension or dilemma, usually characterized by values and ethics inherent in the issue at hand. The dilemma presented tends to be controversial and relevant to current public policy. The process of deliberation is designed to allow the negotiation of competing viewpoints held by the public on societal problems, such as the equitable distribution of scarce resources, which need to be negotiated in order to establish laws and pol icies that govern people's public lives (Gutmann and 2009; Daniels and Sabin, 1997; Chambers, 2003; Young, 2000). The process includes educational and discussion -based components (i.e., the \"information phase\" and the \"deliberation phase,\" Goodin, 2008). In the information phase, participants are given accurate, balanced information about relevant positions and issues through educational materials, experts, or other sources (Fishkin and Farrar, 2005; Abelson, Forest, Eyles et al. , 2003; Luskin, 2007). In the deliberation phase, participants engage in dialogue and the active exchange of reasons and justifications for their preferences, opinions, values, and positions about the matter at hand. Participants are asked to conscientiously engage in an intellectual discussion and receive the perspectives of their fellow participants with openness (Fishkin and Farrar, 2005; Burkhalter Chambers, 2003; Young, 2000; Luskin, 2007). Goals of Public Deliberation Based on the literature, we identified several goals of public deliberation, listed below. To obtain informed public opinion. Traditional forms of public consultation elicit \"top of mind\" responses - reactions that are not necessarily considered or informed. Because public deliberation is grounded in an educational process and the exchange of reasons underlying beliefs and opinions, it generates informed public opinion (Jacobs et al., 2009; et al., 2002). To obtain input that includes underrepresented individuals and groups . For a variety of reasons, traditional methods of obtaining public input may not effectively capture the views and values of minority groups. Publi c deliberation intentionally convenes diverse groups, so that all members have the opportunity to learn from one another in the process of refining their views ( Smith & Wales, 2000; Button & Ryfe, 2005). The informed public opinion obtained through deliber ation thus includes views informed by a full range of experiences, as well as the views of members of minority groups themselves. To garner insights into social values and ethical principles . Public deliberation is designed to allow discussion and negotia tion concerning complex social issues . It generates insights into the public's values and ethical principles on social issues, which can then be used to shape social decisionmaking ( Rawlins, 2005). To establish the legitimacy and promote the acceptance of public decisions . Because it brings the views of lay people to decision makers, deliberation can ES-6 promote legitimacy and acceptance of social decisions among members of the public (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004; Arvai, 2003; Button & Ryfe, 2005 ). Although the focus of public deliberation is on obtaining input that will affect public policy and programmatic decisions, many authors also highlight the effects of deliberation on participants as important outcomes. These include: Improved understanding of the comple xity of decisions. Participants in deliberative processes often gain an increased appreciation of the complex tradeoffs inherent in decisions affecting the public, a point underscored in reference to decisions regarding health programs ( Abelson, Forest et al., 2003). Enhanced civic -mindedness . Deliberation can foster civic- mindedness in individuals involved in the process, \u2014both increasing their concern for issues affecting t he community at large and expanding their capacity for altruism and understanding of others' experiences ( Fishkin, 2009; Gutmann al., 2008; Young, 1996 ). Uses of Public Deliberation As described earlier, the issues that are best suited for public deliberation involve fundamental ethical an d social dilemmas. Issues appropriate for deliberation remain unresolved or warrant revisiting because of emerging developments or changing perspectives; for example, as medical evidence advances, the various values or ethics involved in decisionmaking may also evolve. An important requirement for issues addressed through public deliberation is the potential for finding common ground. By asking participants to take a broad perspective, deliberation elicits social values and principles to inform decisionmak ing and is therefore appropriate for issues that affect society. However, s ome issues are so morally fraught that deliberation may not be an option (Mansbridge, 2010; Mendelberg, 2002). For example, issues that are deeply engrained in religious or cultural views, such as physician -assisted suicide, may not be appropriate for deliberation. As described by one set of authors , deliberation cannot be used to make \"incompatible values compatible\" (Gutmann and Thompson, 2004, p. 11). The literature includes appl ications of public deliberation covering a range of social issues in education, environmental policy, civics, biotechnology, bioethics, public health, and health care. Some f ields , such as environmental policy and biotechnology , have a much longer history of deliberative methodology than health policy. Topics that have been addressed through public deliberation range from community to global concerns. T opics found in the literature include: whether and how society should address global climate change (The J efferson Center, 2007) , whether and how to obtain surrogate consent for research participation among patients with dementia (Kim, Wall, Stanczyk et al., 2009) , and how to prioritize programs and services to address community health concerns (A belson, Eyl es, McLeod et al., 2003) . ES-7 Deliberative Methods We identified nine discrete deliberative methods within the literature: citizens' juries, citizens' panels, consensus conferences, planning cells, Deliberative Polling\u00ae, deliberative focus groups, issues forums, study circles, and 21st Century Town Meetings\u00ae Number of participants . The most important defining features include: Length of individual sessions Duration/number of sessions Mode of deliberation (face -to-face or online) Use of experts and the opportunity to cross -examine experts Additional variations include the following: Recruitment methodologies (e.g., random selection) Provision of educational materials Use of breakout groups Communication between sessions among participants Topic or agenda -setting responsibilities afforded to participants Consensus as goal Use of polling or measurement Cost Deliberative Tasks Deliberative tasks are the activities that sponsors or conveners of public deliberation ask participants to undertake. Among 105 appl ications of public deliberation observed in the literature review, we identified five deliberative tasks. Although these tasks are not mutually exclusive, they illustrate the nature of the tasks that have typically been brought to the public as the focus of deliberative activities: Priority setting and resource allocation . Participants are asked to choose among alternatives (e.g., designing health insurance benefits with limited resources). Risk assessment . Participants are asked to consider the risk -benefi t tradeoffs of certain actions, interventions, or exposures (e.g., risk to personal privacy). ES-8 Guidance on ethical or values -based dilemmas . Participants are asked to consider the ethics and values involved in an issue (e.g., ethical issues involved in technologies that extend the human lifespan). Development of policy guidance, recommendations, or tools. Participants propose or develop guidance that is intended to inform policy (e.g., solutions to community- based issues). Determinations of decisionmaking authority. Participants are asked to consider who or which entities have authority (e.g., considering who should determine health priorities) . Fundamentally, all these tasks are undertaken to learn new information from the public as inputs into decisionmaking. The majority of the applications of public deliberation observed in the literature entailed tasks that were classified as the development of policy guidance, recommendations, or tools. Participation in Public Deliberation Participants in deliberation can be recruited through a variety of methods, such as random or convenience sampling. As will be discussed later, recruiting a diverse samp le is an important component of public deliberation. In some cases, ensuring that the small- scale deliberative process is representative of the broader public may also be a goal (Fishkin, 2009; Parkinson, 2004; Davies, Blackstock, and Rauschmayer, 2005). Recruitment approaches should align with the goals of the particular deliberative process. Where conveners want a representative sample, random sampling may be used. However, the literature is incomplete with regard to drawing conclusions about how representative deliberative processes have been of the broader population. Few applications that used random sampling compared participants with non-participants. Even when the sample is demographically similar to the population of interest, the opinions and views of participants may not represent those from the population at large because of small sample sizes (Rowe and Frewer, 2000). Because inclusion of traditionally underrepresented groups is a goal of many deliberative processes, conveners may employ quota or stratified sampling with targets for certain groups to ensure adequate representation (Parkinson, 2004). Many applications of deliberation in the literature relied on volunteer or convenience samples or hybrid approaches to recruitment, often as resources dictated or because inclusion of different populations was easier with certain approaches. A promising finding in the literature is that, at least in the United States, most individuals say that they are willing to participate in deliberative processes. ES-9 Public Deliberation in Health Deliberation is useful in health policy because dilemmas based in ethical , equity, economic, or other deep -seated concerns are common . The application of deliberative methods to health care began in the 1990s within the United Kingdom's National Health Service (Abelson, 2010) as an outgrowth of increasing needs on the part of health policymakers and public policy scholars for more informed, effective, and legitimate methods to involve the public and patients in decisions affecting them. In the area of health and health policy, d eliberation has been used to understand public views on how to: Allocate scarce resources and assign accountability . (Abelson, 2009; ) Set priorities for public action . (Rosenbach, Lee, Hwang et al. , 1997) Assess the risk -benefit tradeoffs and the distribution of risks and benefits across societ y associated with decisions, policies, or actions. (Willis, MacDonald, Gibson et al., 2010; Nelson, Andow, and DeVries et al., 2010) Increase political leverage. (Citizens' Health Care Working Group, 2006) Resolve public conflict over fundamental ethical and moral dilemmas, such as the conflict between individual liberty and societal well-being and over the definition of what constitutes societal well- being . (Gutm ann and Thompson, 2004) Consider public ethics and values in the design and implementation of new health care policy or practice. (Abelson, 2010; Murphy, 2005) Increase individual and community interest and knowledge. (Fishkin, 2009) Determine the appropr iate use of information and criteria setting . (e.g., for decision- making) (Lenaghan, 1999) Among the 105 applications of public deliberation, we found 67 applications relevant to health These studies addressed such topics as the use of telemedicine in the United Kingdom (Mort and Finch, 2005), the use of cost- effectiveness ratios as a criterion in Medicare coverage decisions in the Unite d States (Gold, Franks, Siegelberg et al., 2007), and government provision of mammography for women ages 40-49 in New Zealand (Paul, Nicholls, Priest et al. , 2008). Evaluating Public Deliberation We identified 28 articles that evaluated public deliberation, including descriptive case studies, evaluative case studies, nonrandomized comparisons of public deliberation, and randomized experiments. The outcome measures used in evaluations of deliberation can be divided into four broad categories, assessing: (1) processes for implementing deliberation, (2) quality of discourse, (3) impact on participants' knowledge and attitudes, and (4) impact on individual participants' ES-10 and societal decisions. Most of the outcomes found in the literature focus on the process of deliberation rather than on the ultimate impact of deliberation on decisions. (1) Processes for implementing the deliberati on. These measures seek to answer this question: Was the deliberative process implemented in a manner that supported the quality of discourse and the stated goals of deliberation? Evaluations that focus on these measures describe what strategies work best, on the basis of observations about the process, without regard to systematic measurement of the outcome of the process. Procedural elements tend to be assessed qualitatively. They include aspects of deliberation that can be manipulated by the conveners: educational materials, facilitation, representativeness, transparency, early involvement of participants in the process, and the use of the findings from deliberation consistent with the expectations set with participants (Rowe and Frewer, 2000; Rowe and F and Hartz -Karp, 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009, p. 13). Cost -effectiveness has also been measured (Rowe and Frewer, 2005). Findings from the literature review indicate that elements of the deliberative process that promote richer deliberation and increase participants' satisfaction with the process include clarity of task, equal opportunity to contribute, independence of the process from external influence or bias, and representation of individuals who are potentially affected by the deliberative topic (Rowe and Frewer, 2000, Fishkin, 2009). (2) Quality of discourse . This set of measures focuses on the extent to which deliberation results in high- quality discourse. Measures reflecting the quality of discourse include fairness, competence, equal participation, active participation, civil atmosphere, opportunity for adequate discussion, respect for the opinions of others, and awareness of different perspectives (De Vries et al. , 2010; Kim et al. and 2007). These constructs are evaluated through participants' self -reports of their experience, researchers' observations, and/ or review of session transcripts. (3) Impact on participants' knowledge and attitudes . These measures assess the effect of the deliberation on the participants' knowledge, attitudes, perspectives, values, beliefs, opinions, or policy preferences on the deliberative topics. These outcomes are typically measured through pre/post surveys. The knowledge and attitudes assessed are both specific to the topic (i.e., change in knowledge and attitudes about the topic) and generic (i.e., change in attitudinal patterns among the partic ipants). Studies of deliberative processes have consistently reported changes in knowledge as measured by objective pre - and post -knowledge assessments; changes in beliefs, opinions, or values; and change in participant perception of priorities or policy preference (A belson, Eyl es, et al., 2003; De Vries et al. , 2010; Fishkin, 2005; Viewpoint Learning, Inc., 2004). (4) Impact on individual participants and societal decisions . Ultimately, deliberation is conducted to obtain information that will influence decisions. As described earlier, a second impact can be the effect on participants' civic- mindedness. Th ese impacts ES-11 are the most distal effects of deliberation and the most difficult to measure. Evaluations of these effects are complicated by a broad range of other environmental factors that may be affecting the policies or other decisions that are the subject of deliberative processes. A few evaluations have assessed the impact of deliberation at the individual behavior and societal level s, using measures outlined below : o Impact on individual participants . Measurement constructs include c ivic- mindedness and capacity, engagement in the political process, sense of self - efficacy, sense of empowerment , political efficacy and solidarity, and anticipated post-meeting activity related to deliberation issues (Fishkin, 2005: Fishkin and Farrar, 2005; Deng and Wu, 2010) . These constructs are assessed as change between pre- and post -deliberation attitudinal patterns measured with self - reported participant surveys. Further, deliberation has also been shown to encourage people to adopt a societal perspective and to be more civic -minded and engaged (Melville et al., 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009) . o Impact on society. Measurement constructs include the effect of public input on specific laws, policies, or practices and on decisionmakers' intentions to act on the results of deliberation. These constructs are usually assessed through case studies or surveys of decisionmakers who may use the findings from the deliberation (Abelson, Forest et al. , 2009). Few randomized experiments of deliberation or its alternatives and few well designed comparative studies have been conducted . Thus, the evidence base on the effectiveness of one form of deliberation compared to another, on how various aspects of the deliberative process contribute to outcomes, and on the impact of applying different modes of deliberation (i.e., online versus face -to-face) is limited. Discussion of approaches to record and summarize deliberative dialogue is very limited in the literature, as is the discussion of approaches to reporting the results of deliberative activities to the sponsor of the activity or other decisionmakers who would benefit from the information. Critical Components to Consider in Designing and Implementing Deliberative Processes Although there are a variety of deliberative methods and approaches, the literature reveals several fundamental conditions needed to foster successful public deliberation: Conveners must use balanced, accurate information to educate the participants and inform the deliberation . An atmosphere of conscientiousness and reason- giving must be established during the deliberative process, whereby participants engage in the thoughtful exchange of their positions and rely on reason- giving . Deliberative groups should have diverse perspectives. Through del iberation with people who have different experiences and worldviews, individuals are expose d to new ideas and become oriented to the collective or to society at large. ES-12 The diversity of perspectives should be given voice and consideration through equal opportunities to participate . These four conditions underlie decisions made in the design and implementation of deliberative sessions, such as the definition of the study population, recruitment strategies, use of educational materials and experts, and f acilitation \u2014the building blocks that together comprise the full design of a deliberation. Exhibit ES.4 draws from the literature to describe the prerequisites for successful, high quality deliberation. Exhibit ES.4. Summary of critical components of successful deliberation Components of the deliberative process Conditions Fostering Successful Deliberation Deliberative topics Effect on policy and the common good: The topic for deliberation should be an issue about which participants can make a meaningful contribution and affect policymaking within an acceptable timeframe (Lukensmeyer and Brigham, 2002; Chafe, Neville, Rathwell et al., 2008a; Carson and Hartz -Karp, 2005; De Stefano, 2010). Recruitment strategies Inclusion and \"universalism\": The deliberation should be representative and inclusive of diverse viewpoints and allow for equal opportunity to participate (Jacobs et al., 2009, p. 10; Carson and Hartz -Karp, 2005). Diversity: The deliberation should include multiple perspectives, including those of individuals who are traditionally underserved, unaffiliated, or disenfranchised (Barabas, 2004; Lukensmeyer and Lieres and Kahane, 2006). Recruitment screening for desired participant characteristics Conscientiousness: Participants should listen to others' arguments and make an effort to use reason through the deliberation (Fishkin and Farrar, 2005). Respect: Participants should respect the opinions of others (DeVries et al., 2010). Belief in deliberation: Participants should believe that deliberation is an appropriate mode of conversation (Burkhalter et al., 2002). Analytic and communication skills: Participants should possess the skills needed for the deliberation, such as, numeracy (Burkhalter et al., 2002; Gold et al., 2007). Motivation: Participants should have sufficient motivation to learn about the topic and participate (Burkhalter et al., 2002). Expect ation setting and preparation Strategy: Conveners should decide who the key decisionmakers are and how the deliberative output can be used (Lukensmeyer and Brigham, 2002). Assurances of influence: Conveners should provide participants with the assurance t hat their voice will be heard and that the deliberative process will influence policy and decisionmaking (De Stefano, 2010; Carson and Hartz -Karp, 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009, p. 13). Clarity: Conveners need to define the participation tasks to manage participants' expectations and prevent the occurrence of misunderstandings or disputes (De Stefano, 2010; Chafe et al., 2008a). ES-13 Exhibit ES.4. Summary of critical components of successful delibe ration (continued) Components of the deliberative process Conditions Fostering Successful Deliberation Information component Accuracy: Conveners must use accurate information in deliberation (Fishkin and Farrar 2005; De Stefano, 2010). Competence or supporting informed dialogue: Educational material should include appropriate and sufficient context and history on the issues, be balanced and fair to all perspectives, leave room for citizens to create new options, and have credibility with all audiences (Lukensmeyer and Brigham, 2002; Abelson, Forest et al., 2003). Process Transparency: The process should be transparent to multiple stakeholders external to the process and to the participants (De Stefano, 2010; Kohn, 2000). Completeness: The process should include balance in arguments offered and answered on either side of the issue (Fishkin and Farrar, 2005). Fairness: Fairness in the process requires equal distribution of opportunities to participate meaningfully (Abelson, Forest et al., 2003, DeVries et al., 2010; Kohn, 2000). Public policy/decision makers Assurances of influence: Conveners should provide participants with the assurance that their voice will be heard and that the deliberative process will influence policy and decisionmaking (De Stefano, 2010; Carson and Hartz -Karp, 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009, p.1). Creating process for systematizing citizen input: Members of the public should have an opportunity to continue to influence policy on the issue; further, topics brought to deliberation must be issues about which policymakers are amenable to public input (Lukensmeyer and Brigham, 2002). Mutual trust and credibility: Participants and decisionmakers need to experience trust and credibility through transparency, active participation, and prioriti zation of the deliberation (Kohn, 2000; Lukensmeyer and Brigham, 2002). Facilitation and environment Open -mindedness: Participants should be encouraged to remain open -minded, and should be assured that there is space to understand and reframe issues (Cars on and Hartz -Karp, 2005; Barabas, 2004). Safe public space: The environment should support a fair and productive dialogue with equal opportunities for participation and respect (Lukensmeyer and Brigham, 2002). Standards of reasonableness: Facilitators shou ld emphasize that the arguments posited should appear to be well reasoned; arguments should appeal to others' rationales, and participants should publicly declare the reasoning behind their positions (Kohn, 2000; Jacobs et al., 2009). Implications for the AHRQ Community Forum Deliberative Demonstration Findings from our literature review, combined with expert input from the Community Forum Technical Expert Panel (see Appendix), contain implications for AHRQ's Community Forum project \u2014and for others intending to use public deliberation to elicit informed public input to address a policy decision \u2014including the following considerations: (1) Establish clear intent and goals for the use of public input . Extensive literature demonstrates the importance of being cl ear to participants on how the results of the public deliberative process will be used to inform decisionmaking, public policy, and program directions. Early involvement of key decisionmakers will promote transparency and promote the uptake of the public i nput. ES-14 (2) Ensure that the goals for public deliberation inform the deliberative tasks and methods. Consider tradeoffs among deliberative methods and their features, including group size, session duration, and group composition, and assess their implication s for quality and feasibility of deliberation. (3) Ensure transparency of the deliberative process to promote legitimacy and public acceptance. An important indicator of transparency is independence of conveners and managers of the deliberation process fr om the sponsoring organization. (4) Adapt recruitment methods to the goals of deliberation and the intended populations. An approach that appeared repeatedly in the literature was multipronged recruitment, coupling random sampling with targeted recruitment efforts to ensure representation by groups disproportionately affected by the decision under consideration. (5) Design , test , and ensure access to balanced, fair , and factually accurate educational materials. M aterials should be highly accessible, meaning that they should be written in plain language and understandable by all participants. Formative research may be useful. (6) Recognize that expert facilitation is central to high quality discourse. T he facilitator is ch arged with establishing an open, safe atmosphere to foster deliberation and to ensure that participants are practicing reason -giving and have an equal opportunity to participate; training is critical. (7) Ensure optimal use of technology within and outside the deliberation , with equal access and ease of use for all parties. P articipants must have access to the required resources (e.g. Internet connectivity) or the resulting inequities may detract from the deliberative process. The literature presents a comprehensive discussion of the principles of public deliberation, the goals and tasks of the deliberative process, and the range of methods that have been developed. The applications identified in the area of health point to interest in the values and ethi cs underlying public views on the distribution of health resources, priority setting, and other research and policy questions. Public deliberation has a role in providing insights for decisionmakers, in promoting public acceptance of decisions where community members have contributed, and in increasing the civic -mindedness of participants. This literature review underscores the current lack of information regarding the impact of various design choices on the effectiveness of deliberation. In addition, it w ill be important to document, going forward, how public input obtained through deliberative process affects policies, programs, and other decisions. This information will both contribute to our ability to assess the value and impact of deliberative input a nd demonstrate to participants the value of their involvement. 1 Chapter 1. Introduction This report presents findings from an extensive literature review and key informant interviews on the use of public deliberation as a method for increasing public input for health research. We conducted this review to inform a deliberative methods demonstration conducted as part of the Community Forum project, which seeks to expand public input to the Agency for Healthc are Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Effective Health Care Program and its comparative effectiveness research enterprise, as well as to advance the field of public deliberation. The deliberative methods demonstration, fielded in fall 2012, entailed 72 sessions conducted using four distinct deliberative approaches. Participants were randomly selected members of the public residing in the Sacramento, North Carolina, Chicago, and Washington DC areas; groups were demographically diverse and composed of 12 to 24 me mbers. The report is organized into the following chapters: Chapter 1. Introduction Chapter 2. Methods for the Literature R eview and K ey Informant Interviews (KIIs) Chapter 3. Overview of Public D eliberation Chapter 4. Public D eliberation M ethods Chapte r 5. Public D eliberation T asks Chapter 6. Participation in Public D eliberation Chapter 7.

Implications The literature review and key informant interviews (KIIs) had four overarching goals: (1) Review the relevant history of, and innovations in, deliberative methods as applied to ethics and values -based decisions in health car e (including related fields, as they provide lessons directly applicable to project goals). (2) Explore methods for obtaining deliberative input into CER and the appropriateness of applying different deliberative methods to garner informed public input on CER. Explore the suitability of deliberative methods for questions that require members of the public to deliberate, weighing competing values and priorities to address dilemmas related to CER. 2 (3) Review how public deliberation has been evaluated by researchers a nd others , including how organizations have used and assessed the value of input obtained through deliberation (i.e., what constitutes valuable, high- quality, and relevant citizen input and how that input is most optimally and appropriately used). (4) Inform and justify the approach to AHRQ's Community Forum deliberative demonstration , including the design and evaluation of mechanisms for eliciting informed public input. 3 Chapter 2. Methods for the Literature R eview and Key I nformant I nterviews In this section, we describe our methods for conducting the literature review and KI interviews. Conceptual Framework Prior to beginning the literature review and KI interview s, we developed a preliminary conceptual framework to guide the identification of topics to include in the literature review and to discuss with key informants (Exhibit 2.1). We developed and subsequently refined the conceptual framework on the basis of the input of internal team members and a review of several key articles on deliberative pro cesses. Exhibit 2.1. Conceptual framework for the literature review and key informant interviews The conceptual framework highlights (1) the inputs for deliberative processes (sponsor, problem, individual characteristics, and factors associated with th e deliberative process, including the deliberative method used); (2) the immediate, mid -, and long -term outcomes for deliberation; and (3) the environmental factors that affect the overarching context in which deliberation occurs. Conceptual Framework: Inputs The decision to engage a community in deliberation is first governed by the needs, desires, and motivations of a sponsor or an entity that seeks public input into a social, economic, health care, or other public issue (i.e., the problem). In addition, the participants in deliberation bring to bear on the problem their knowledge (e.g., from prevailing societal and norms, media discussion/saturation, empirical data), experience, and other individual characteristics (e.g., values, ethics, priorities, cult ure, self -efficacy). Other inputs associated with the deliberation Long -Term Societal Health system Stake -holders Decision support for subsequent research Mid-Term Citizen input into policymakingImmediate Informed guidanceDeliberation Framing of the question or concept Educational materials Group characteristics, expectations, dynamics, composition, and size Tools and resources (e.g., technology) Facilitator characteristics and facilitationDeliberator characteristics Knowledge about the problem Experiences Participant characteristics-Social / cultural identity -Knowledge, attitudes, beliefs -Values and preferences -Self-efficacy Sponsor Problem for public input (e.g., CER )Inputs Anticipated Outcomes Environmental context (e.g., media context, national dialogue about health care costs, access, and quality)4 include the educational materials provided by the sponsor in advance of and during the deliberative sessions and the framing of the problem or question. The deliberative process also is influenced by the tools and resources available for deliberation (including mode of presentation and interaction, for example, online versus face- to-face deliberation), group characteristics and composition, and moderator/facilitation characteristics. Conceptual Framework: Anticipated Outcomes In our conceptual framework, anticipated outcomes include the most proximal effect of deliberating (i.e., the discussion and discussion outcomes). Outcomes are anticipated to be the immediate effect of deliberation at b oth the individual and group level and more mid- term outcomes of increased public input into policy -making and long -term outcomes for decision support (e.g., stronger evidence base, willingness to translate evidence into practice), the health system (e.g., approaches more aligned with the public's needs and preferences), and society (e.g., improved population health). Guiding Topics and Questions for the Literature Review and Key Informant Interviews Working with the internal team, we reviewed the conceptual framework and developed guiding topics and questions for the literature review and KI interview s (see Exhibit 2.2). Exhibit 2.2. Guiding topics and questions for the literature review and KI interv iews Topic Guiding questions Background on deliberation What are the philosophical/ideological motivations or rationales for deliberation?

To what extent are the design and approach to deliberation the mechanisms that maximize\u2014 or undermine\u2014the quality of input and participation and the outcome measures used in assessing deliberative approaches? How does the delivery of these methods affect the use of and inform the scalability of these methods? How do the individual differences in the characteristics or attitudes of participants affect public deliberation? Tools and materials What is known about educational materials and other preparation for participants? How can a topic be selected and framed in a way that is best suited for deliberation? How are participants prepared for and informed about each method? What tools and materials have been used to prepare citizens for deliberative methods?

What are the implications of emerging technology tools for deliberative methods? Application of deliberative methods For what kinds of topics/questions/issues are deliberative methods most appropriate?

Guiding topics and questions for the literature review and KI interviews (continued) Topic Guiding questions Implications for deliberating about CER issues What does the study of deliberative methods tell us about applying these methods to gaining informed public input on ethica l and values -based health care decision topics, such as those central to CER research and policy decisions? How is CER similar or dissimilar to other topics that are subject to public deliberation? What are the implications for obtaining informed public input on CER from underserved or disadvantaged populations both nationally and internationally? Key Informant Interviews We conducted key informant interviews to inform the literature review; the key informants identified key pieces of literature, potential study questions, areas of investigation, and additional insights. Working in conjunction with AHRQ and members of our internal team, we identified 14 potential key informants in several areas of interest: public deliberation (theoretical underpinnings and practical purposes), comparative effectiveness research, and the use of technology tools in public deliberation. Two key informants were AHRQ staff members in the Center for Outcomes and Evidence and U.S. Preventive Health Services Task Force. We emai led prospective interviewees to explain the Community Forum project and request an interview. Of the original 14 prospective key informants, nine responded. Of the individuals who did not respond, three did not respond to the invitation, and two responded affirmatively; however, we were unable to connect with them in follow -up communications. In light of this, the team added several additional names to the list, and between September 19 and December 3, 2010, we conducted 17 interviews. Key informant intervi ew participants are listed in Appendix A. To guide the key informant interviews, the team developed a semi -structured interview protocol (Appendix B). We varied the questions depending on a key informant's area of expertise (e.g., public deliberation, technology tools, CER). The protocol included questions on the following topics: Defining public deliberation (features/qualities; appropriate applications of public deliberation) Implementing public deliberation (achieving input from hard -to-reach groups; facilitating; having a decision goal such as consensus) Evaluating public deliberation (what constitutes \"successful\" deliberation and how to measure success) Using technology tools in deliberation Determining the applicability of public deliberation to quest ions related to CER 7 Interviews were conducted by trained interviewers and lasted approximately one hour. All interviews were simultaneously transcribed by a note -taker and were audio -taped for later reference. The lead interviewer analyzed all interview transcripts by searching for key themes and generating summaries and reviews for comment by the team. The full report on key informant interviews is presented in Appendix C. Literature Review Exhibit 2.3 describes our overarching approach to the literature review task. Exhibit 2.3. The AIR team's systematic approach to the literature review Search Methodology In planning the literature review, we first sought input from several members of our project team who are thought leaders in the field of deliberative methods. These individuals provided input regarding literature and reference lists to ensure that our rev iew included key studies of deliberative processes and the works of deliberative theorists. Our strategy for identifying additional peer -reviewed and grey literature is described below. We narrowed all searches to English language resources dated 2002 to 2010. We included resources dated prior to 2002 if our internal team members identified them as seminal works. First, we developed inclusion and exclusion criteria to inform our decision- making regarding the relevance of an abstract to the literature revi ew (Exhibit 2.4). These criteria were used to define the search strategy and to help the reviewers determine whether an article should be included or excluded from the final set of articles for abstraction.

We then conducted tests of these key search terms to determine the volume and relevance of literature that each search term would return. After preliminary testing of the key search terms, we developed and tested two approaches for identifying a core set of articles: Search 1 contained only the key words \"deliberation\" or \"deliberative.\" Search 2 contained broader public eng agement terminology (see Exhibit 2.5). Our team librarian implemented a \"test\" of these two search approaches within PubMed, yielding 591 and 556 articles (Search 1 and 2, respectively). To determine which approach was a better foundation for subsequent s earches, we assessed the overlap in articles identified through Searches 1 and 2 and the relevance of the articles returned by each search. This approach enabled us to see whether the inclusion of more specific terminology for broader public engagement (i. e., Search 2) yielded a substantial number of additional resources that would have been missed had we searched only on \"deliberative\" or \"deliberation\" alone (i.e., Search 1). Three team members shared the task of flagging relevant abstracts. One team mem ber reviewed the abstracts and identified relevant articles, and a second team member verified the first 9 reviewer's assessments. The numbers of articles identified in the initial Search 1 and Search 2 approach, as well as the number of articles identified as \"relevant\" for abstraction, are shown in Exhibit 2.5. Exhibit 2.5. Comparison of initial search approaches (Searches 1 and 2) and corresponding search results *Note: \"Hit\" rate designates the percentage of articles for each search deemed relevant to our literature review based on review of their abstracts. In reviewing the overlap of Searches 1 and 2 (i.e., Search 2a in Exhibit 2.5), we retained 42 of 99 (42%) overlapping abstracts for abstraction. A reviewer examined abstracts for those articles in Search 2 that were not in Search 1 to see whether it was worthwhile to continue to look at Search 2 distinctly and whether Search 1 was missing any relevant articles. Of the 457 articles that were in Search 2 but not in Search 1 (Search 2c), 62 (14%) were selected for abstraction. Because of this low hit rate, we did not pursue Search 2 any further as a base set of search terms. We conducted subsequent searches on the basis of the abstract set identified in Search 1. Upon examining the initial results of the Search 1, we found that many of the nonrelevant articles pertained to cognitive deliberation (i.e., thinking and philosophies surrounding cognition; Search 1 (Potential Master Category): 42 \"Hit\" rate: 42% Search 2b: In Search 1 but not in Search 2 (i.e., EXCLUDE the overlapping articles in 2a from Search 1) Yielded: 400 articles (reviewed in subsequent Search 1-based strings) Search 2c: In Search 2 but not in Search 1 (i.e., EXCLUDE overlapping articles in Search 2a from Search 2) Yielded: 457 articles Relevant: 62 \"Hit\" rate: 14% 10 deliberate thought versus acting by instinct, habit, or impulse). Thus, we further restricted Search 1 by excluding the following search terms related to narrowed search further reduced the base articles in Search 1 from 591 to 492 abstracts. Based on this narrowed base set of search key words, we implemented subsequent searches (Searches 3 -15). The purpose of Searches 3 -15 was to narrow the overall search by specific key words that corresponded to sections of the conceptual framework to facilitate the identification of subsets of articles that pertain to a particular topic area (e.g., deliberative methods types). The total universe of search terms includes the narrowed Search 1 and Searches 3-15. Information about the content of those searches (including key words), the number of abstracts they yielded, and the number of abstracts that were judged to be relevant for a bstraction from the PubMed returns is provided in Exhibit 2.6.

Grey Literature Search Methods Although we primarily sought to focus on the peer -reviewed literature, we expected that many of the most recent applications of public deliberation would be found in the grey literature, defined as literature that was not peer reviewed but that met the inclusion criteria listed in Exhibit 2.4. 12 This literatur e included presentations, white papers, trade publications, issue briefs, and book anthologies. We identified relevant grey literature by seeking publications from organizations that are widely known in the field of public deliberation, such as America Speaks, Viewpoint Learning, The Jefferson Center, and Public Agenda. We also solicited recommendations from key informants and members of our internal project team. Our search of the grey literature was targeted and therefore not exhaustive. The grey literature we have included represents the work of active current practitioners of deliberative processes. Of the identified peer -reviewed and grey literature, 206 unique resources were obtained and reviewed. Thirteen of these were ultimately deemed irrelevant by the abstraction team, yielding a final set of 193 abstracted peer -reviewed articles and grey literature. Additional articles were found through hand searching. Data Abstraction Across all sources (peer -reviewed and grey literature), we abstracted 193 art icles through the process described below. As we reviewed the articles and abstractions, we continued to identify additional resources that addressed possible gaps. We reviewed but did not abstract these additional 106 resources. The team entered and manag ed all references in an Endnote database. To abstract the literature, we developed an initial abstraction form in Excel that was piloted by abstracting two articles. We then modified the abstraction form and developed an Access database on the basis of th e modified final abstraction form (see Appendix D). A team of 10 abstractors underwent two rounds of training and one feedback session on the topic of the literature review and abstraction form. The abstractors also received written guidance designed to aid their abstraction task (see Appendix E). Senior members of the project team reviewed completed abstractions and, as needed, provided targeted feedback to abstractors. Exhibit 2.7 shows the counts of the abstracted literature by relevance to the literature review based on the abstractors' classification. Exhibit 2.7.

One team member also identified, for each writer, which of the additional 106 \"reviewed but not abstracted\" resources were of most relevance to his or her sections. Although many of these additional resources were theoretical, writers noted which of these articles recounted studies of specific deliberative processes or other relevant information for inclusion and were appropr iate in certain tabular counts. Strength of Evidence Exhibit 2.8 presents the strength of evidence for all abstracted articles. Exhibit 2.8.

Of these, only four included a control group and had a design aimed at a comparison of deliberative outcomes for a deliberating group and its control. A further breakdown by analytic method is provided for the remaining single empirical studies. A subset of abstracted single empirical studies (n=68) comprised specific examples of a deliberative methods application. For this subset, we f urther considered strength of evidence with regard to the internal and external validity of the studies. We classified the 68 single empirical studies that were examples of deliberative methods applications by three variables: presence of a control group, random assignment to groups, and whether the study population was drawn to be \"representative\" of a larger community or population. These judgments were made by the abstractors in the course of reviewing the articles. The presence of a control group and random assignment to conditions together speak to internal validity (i.e., our ability to draw causal inferences). Representativeness speaks to the external validity or generalizability of study findings beyond the immediate sample. 14 Exhibit 2.9 breaks down the 68 single empirical studies through a cross -tabulation of control group and random assignment, providing an overview of how many have \"high,\" \"medium,\" or \"low\" internal validity. Exhibit 2.9. Indicators of internal validity in deliberative methods ap plications (single empirical studies only) Control Group? Random assignment?

We classify these five studies as \"high\" on internal validity. The 46 studies (68%) with neither a control group nor random assignment to a comparison condi tion are generally descriptive studies and case examples that are made quasi - experimental by the inclusion of pre -/post -assessments related to the deliberation. We classify these as \"low\" on internal validity. The remaining 17 studies we classify as \"mediu m\" on internal validity. Exhibit 2.10 shows the internal validity of the deliberative methods applications in relation to our indicator of external validity (i.e., having a representative sample or establishing representativeness through recruitment to mee t a target demographic composition reflective of the population). Forty -one percent of the 68 single empirical studies established a representative participant sample. However, only two of the 68 demonstrated both high internal validity and high external v alidity based on our classification scheme. Exhibit 2.10.

Overview of Public Deliberation In this section, we review the broad characteristics of deliberative processes, discuss their historical foundation, describe the broad uses of deliberative processes, and review the potential benefits. Characteristics of D eliberative Processes Public deliberation is a process in which members of the public engage in the careful weighing of multiple, often competing, arguments on moral or ethical social issues through discourse, governed by the principle of mutual sharing of perspectives and respect (Jacobs, Cook, & delli Carpini, 2009; Burkhalter, Gastil, & Kelshaw, 2002). Public deliberation is a unique methodology for obtaining public input on societal decisions and engendering civic responsibility and social decision-making. It requires participants to develop solutions about societal problems or issues posed to the group (i.e., the \"deliberative topic\") that inherently evoke competing morals, ethics, or values and for which a range of prospective viewpoints and solutions exist. As such, many consider it a necessary condition for a robust democracy. Deliberative processes share three broad characteristics: 1 Input is sought from the members of the public. Participants in public deliberation ar e generally lay persons who are engaged in the process with the perspective of members of the public, as opposed to stakeholders who might have a vested interest in the deliberative topic, field, or area of study. Participants are faced with an ethical - or values- based dilemma to resolve through deliberation. Questions appropriate for public deliberation do not have a simple technical answer or solution. Instead, they involve a tension or dilemma, usually characterized by values and ethics inherent in the issue at hand. Further, the issues tend to be controversial, timely, and relevant to current public policy. In this way, deliberation is an exercise designed to allow the negotiation of competing viewpoints held by the public on societal problems that cannot be resolved by technical information alone, such as the equitable distribution of scarce resources (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004, p. 10; Daniels & Sabin, 1997). In a democratic society, these dilemmas need t o be negotiated in order to establish laws and policies that govern people's public lives (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004; Fishkin, 2009; Daniels & Sabin, 1997; Chambers, 2003; Young, 2000). The process includes educational and discussion -based, or deliberative, components (i.e., the \"information phase\" and the \"deliberation phase\"; Goodin, 2008). In the information phase, participants are given accurate, balanced information 1 In Section 9, we review the specific components of the deliberative process in detail. 16 about the positions and issues of relevance through educational materials, experts, or other sources (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005; Abelson, Forest et al., 2003; Luskin, 2007). In the deliberation phase, participants engage in dialogue and the active exchange of reasons and justifications for their preferences, opinions, values, and positions about the matter at hand. Participants are asked to conscientiously engage in deliberation of the issue at hand and be open toward the perspectives of their fellow participants (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005; Burkhalter et 2003; Young, 2000; Luskin, 2007). Foundations of Public Deliberation With conceptual underpinnings in political philosophy, the ideal of public deliberation is grounded in philosophies of the social contract and bonds among individuals and institutions that shape political and social life. Such deliberation is a means to bolster democratic life, include underrepresented groups, and propel moral reasoning and mutual understanding. Public deliberation as a practice has been in use since ancient Greece. The philosophies of Aristotle, Plato, Immanuel Kant, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, John Rawls, John Dewey, Robert Dahl, Lawrence Kohlberg, Jurgen Habermas, and many others have shaped contemporary normative constructions of deliberation, its form, and its purposes. Habermas is credited with the reemergence and application of deliberation to democracy (i.e., deliberative democracy) through his concerns for legitimacy, the balance between the collective or public will and individuals' rights, and the development of moral reasoning (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004; Doheny & O'Neill, 2010). With a concern for the development of moral and ethical understanding, Habermas explored the social psychological and psychological aspects of moral development and discourse ethics (Habermas, 1990; Doheny & O'Neill, 2010). His theory of staged moral development undergirds the ideal effect of the deliberative process on the individual: through four phases of development, individuals move from hesitancy to engagement to posses sing a concern for the collective that rivals their personal self -interest (Doheny & O'Neill, 2010; Habermas, 1990). Public Deliberation and Deliberative Democracy The fundamental attributes that distinguish public deliberation from other methods of publi c consultation stem from its foundational roots in theories of deliberative democracy. Deliberative democracy is conceived as an \"ideal\" to be achieved. Gutmann and Thompson (2004) define deliberative democracy as a form of government in which free and equal citizens (and their representatives), justify decisions in a process in which they give one another reasons that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible, with the aim of reaching conclusions that are binding in the present on all citizens but open to challenge in the future. (p. 7) 17 Deliberative democracy is distinct from a \"minimalist democracy\" that relies merely upon traditional voting and tallying of votes in service of electing a leader for a finite set of time, with the procedure repeated a gain at the end of that duration. As described by Goodin (2008), All [a minimalist democracy] asks of citizens is to cast a ballot from time to time: in most places, if and only if they feel like it... [it] does not ask them to pay attention to public debates on the issues of the day. It does not ask them to get together with others to discuss the issues. It does not ask them to justify their voting decision to anyone else. Still less does it ask people to take a position publicly to get actively involved in campaigning to persuade others that they should vote the same way. (p. 1) Deliberative democrats argue that democracy should be designed to encourage individuals to come together, discuss issues and problems that affect them in common, and formulate mutua lly acceptable solutions to those problems. As a form of both political participation and public consultation, deliberative democracy provides the unique opportunity for citizens to engage in a process designed to promote fairness in the expression of ideas and for policymakers to hear voices of traditionally disengaged or disenfranchised citizens and the multitude of perspectives that exist about a topic. For Goodin (2008), a distinguishing characteristic of the deliberative democracy movement is its translation of political theory into deliberative practice. Goodin cites the host of \"micro - deliberative\" innovations (e.g., citizens' juries, consensus conferences, deliberative polls) 2 that \"show us what deliberative democracy might look like in miniature\" (p. 2). In short, public deliberation is fundamentally a group process that includes the convening of \"mini-publics\" for a purposeful discussion (e.g., to inform decision- making) about public or societal issues that will have an impact on members of the society (Fishkin, 2009). Small- scale deliberative processes, which include representative samples, may serve as a means to address broad societal issues. Appropriate Uses of Public Deliberation Ac cording to one set of authors, \"the general aim of deliberative democracy is to provide the most justifiable conception for dealing with moral disagreement in politics\" (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004, p. 10). From this perspective, deliberation is called for when competing courses of action exist and the choice between them requires a weighing of alternatives (Walton, 2006; Fishkin & Farrar, 2005). Therefore, the issues that are most well suited for public deliberation involve fundamental moral and social dilemmas or issues of trust and legitimacy that affect the larger so ciety. Issues appropriate for deliberation remain unresolved or warrant revisiting because of new developments or changing perspectives and then often demonstrate potential for finding common ground. 2 These specific approaches are discussed in more detail in Section 4, which describes deliberative methods in detail. 18 Deliberative processes present an opportunity to weigh the \"principles and values involved as well as the circumstances and consequences\" of the topic of debate (Gracia, 2003, p. 230). Deliberation can also be a means for reconciling divergent points of view. The role the public plays in negotiating these topics resides in the core values that are evoked by the topics for deliberation. An important part of the deliberative process, then, is to shed light onto the nature, origin, and malleability of these values. Some issues are so morally fraught and some groups are in such deep conflict that consensual deliberation may not be an option (Mansbridge, 2010; Mendelberg, 2002). For example, issues that are deeply engrained in religious or cultural views, such as abortion or physician -assisted suicide, may not be appropriate for deliberation, particularly among individuals who hold completely counter beliefs and values. In other words, deliberation cannot be used to make \"incompatible values compatible\" (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004, p. 11). Deliberation, nonetheless, can be used as a vehicle to learn more about the nature of a moral disagreement and potentially reframe the disagreement. Where the potential for common ground exists, deliberation is an appropriate tool. However, because deliberation is inherently focused on openness and a willingness to explore the potential validity of other perceptions and truth claims, issues of deep -seated conflict may be better resolved (if they can be resolved) through other channels. Potential Benefits of Public Deliberation Deliberation can foster the exploration of varying viewpoints and, through mutual justification of held positions, expose individuals to new ideas and arguments, identify and develop informed reasoning, give voice to underrepresented groups, promote accept ance of public decisions, foster civic -mindedness, make values inherent in technical issues more visible, and provide more information or evidence on topics. Expose Individuals to New Ideas and Arguments Public deliberation builds on traditional forms of c ivic engagement by asking individuals to engage in a deeper level of thought and communication around an ethical or a values -laden topic (Chambers, 2003; Burkhalter et al., 2002; Gastil, Black, Deess, & Leighter, 2008). In this way, one potential benefit of deliberation is that it encourages individuals to listen thoughtfully and carefully to new ideas and counterarguments (Jacobs et Mansbridge, 2010; Burkhalter et al., 2002). Compared with other forms of public consultation, the process of deliberation reveals how the public would feel about an issue if it were educated on the nuances of the issue, were asked to think openly and critically, and were to discuss the issue with peers (Fishkin, 2009; Friedman, 2007). 19 Identify and Develop Informed Opinion a nd Reasoning Deliberation also addresses a concern about the quality and level of reasoning that informs traditional public conversations (Fishkin, 2009; Gutmann & Thompson, 2004; Chambers, 2003). Many see value in deliberation because it requires individuals to declare publicly the reasoning for their opinions and preferences (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004). Through the declaration of reasoning, individuals are more accountable to draw upon arguments that are meaningful and valid for the larger group or society (Jacobs et al., 2009). Further, deliberation, as an exercise, reveals how information and values interact to form beliefs, perspectives, and preferences. It is where information and values intersect that public deliberation has the opportunity to effect change. When the intent is to equip policymakers and decision- makers with the information needed to make decisions and move forward in certain policy or research directions, deliberative public input may rende r more valuable information than other forms of public consultation. Deliberation also has more benefits than mechanisms for eliciting public opinion that generate initial reactions from individuals (e.g., polls, focus groups) (Fishkin, 2009). Traditional opinion polling may not provide adequate insight into how the public feels about and understands these issues because it highlights the central tendency in a distribution of possible responses, is time - limited, and is often not well reasoned (Fishkin, 2009; Barabas, 2004; Rawlins, 2005). Without a careful process, the extent to which well -reasoned, careful decisions are being made by citizens and on behalf of citizens is doubtful. Fishkin (2009) argues that opinion polling that elicits mere \"top of mind\" r esponses \u2014often those not based on a careful consideration of multiple forms of evidence \u2014does not support discourse and intellectual inquiry but rather undermines its purpose, which is to learn about the public's preferences and values. Aggregated responses overwhelm or mute minority responses that may carry important value, particularly for policymakers. Rawlins (2005) argues that opinion polling and surveys designed to obtain immediate and often misinformed reactions to certain topics by members of the pub lic do not sufficiently support the level of discussion and deliberation necessary for decision- making. Give Voice to Underrepresented Individuals and Groups Deliberation can also fill voids where representative democracy may not include all perspectives, particularly for disadvantaged groups (Smith & Wales, 2000). Some argue that without acknowledging the inherent inequalities that exist in a liberal democratic society, the \"social choice mechanisms,\" such as voting, that enable people to participate poli tically are also shaped by political, social, and economic inequality (Smith & Wales, 2000). Traditional notions of social choice mechanisms presuppose that individuals' opinions and preferences are fixed and that collective opinion is based on an aggregat ion of multiple perspectives and important differences (Smith & Wales, 2000). These social choice mechanisms assume that individuals hold immutable, distinct, and well- reasoned preferences (Button & Ryfe, 2005). Deliberative democracy, however, acknowledge s that traditional democratic institutions do not necessarily 20 guarantee the inclusion and expression of the range of perspectives and suggests that deliberative dialogue could be used to promote openness to new preferences (Button & Ryfe, 2005). As such, some argue that the deliberative process can transform traditional social choice mechanisms by allowing equality in expression (Smith & Wales, 2000). Convening a representative sample, particularly for the traditionally underrepresented, is an implementatio n challenge and will be discussed in Chapters 4 and 9. Promote Legitimacy and Acceptance of Public Decisions Deliberative processes can also promote legitimacy and acceptance (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004; Arvai, 2003; Button & Ryfe, 2005). This outcome of del iberation is closely related to the \"openness\" to alternate viewpoints that is encouraged by deliberation. Where decisions affect the collective, a deliberative process that incorporates multiple perspectives and values aids policymakers and promotes legit imacy of the policymaking process (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004). Members of the public, when informed that policies emerge from a participatory process with the public, are more accepting of the results. They have greater confidence in policies that reflect t he decisions of people like themselves than the decisions of the scientific community alone (Arvai, 2003). Foster Civic -Mindedness The concern for creating a more civic -minded group of individuals can be a key motivation for using a deliberative methodolo gy. Deliberation is a tool that can foster civic -mindedness in individuals \u2014in both how individuals perceive matters affecting their communities (or the country) and their capacity for social interaction and altruism (Fishkin, 2009; Gutmann & Thompson, 2004; Gastil et al., 2008). Many theorists and practitioners argue that deliberation requires participants to be expansive and empathic in their preferences and expression of opinion. Through deliberation, participants develop \"social objectivity,\" an increase in their social capacit y and competency (Young, 1996). Thus, participants develop more social knowledge, gaining greater insight into what is considered just and right through the exercise of deliberation (Young, 1996). If successful, the empathy and civic -mindedness resulting from deliberation resolve an \"economy of moral disagreement\" through the reason- giving required by deliberative processes. Deliberation does not require that participants compromise their moral understandings in the interest of agreement; rather, it attemp ts to find points of convergence based on reasoning and by encouraging individuals to be expansive and open in their views, particularly for matters concerning the collective or greater good (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004). Similarly, Fishkin (2009) describes how Tocqueville (and later Mill) understood that citizens who discuss public problems together value the collective interests higher than their own personal interests. This \"public spiritedness\" may be fostered as participants begin to increasingly value the wider community's interests more (Fishkin, 2009). 21 Make Values Inherent i n Technical Issues More Visible In addressing social and moral dilemmas, deliberation can elicit the ethics and values inherent in a novel issue (e.g., policy -making about new techn ologies; Iredale, Longley, de Cock Buning, Broerse, & Bunders, 2008). This information about the values and ethics involved in an issue can help public officials see where the challenges are and develop tailored strategies (Rawlins, 2 005). Deliberation helps individuals see where there are overlapping values and distinguish where there are values that cannot be reconciled (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004). Provide More Information o r Evidence o n Topics a nd Improve the Quality of Political Decisionmaking Deliberation may also be effective in providing more information or evidence on a topic and thus may involve the creation of new solutions that have not been previously considered because members of the public \u2014particularly those individuals most affected by an issue\u2014serve as a source of information. Through the educational component, the preparation necessary for deliberation, participants' capacity to contribute meaningfully to the process is enhanced (Gregory, Hartz -Karp, & Watson, 2008). Not only are participants in deliberation bringing to bear a new form of evidence on a topic related to social values, but the scientific understanding of the issue and the values also are intertwined and defined by one another (Lehoux, Daudelin, Demers -Payet te, & Boivin, 2009). This development can, in turn, engender trust in policies, institutions, science, and other members of the public. Given the growing complexity of health care decisions \u2014both personal and societal \u2014the ability to incorporate more informa tion may produce more detailed, nuanced, and thoughtful deliberations and decisions. Public Deliberation Today In its varied forms, public deliberation is occurring in many countries, amid many different cultures and value systems. Some countries use public deliberation methods more extensively than others. For example, in our literature review, we identified multi ple examples of public deliberation in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Canada, Australia, Denmark, and New Zealand. Other countries with examples of deliberative processes were South Korea, Taiwan, Tanzania, United Arab Emirates, Spain, and Italy. In the Unite d States, public deliberation is a relatively recent phenomenon that has largely been brought about by grassroots efforts regarding social issues (Jacobs et al., 2009). A 1998 survey of 396 U.S. organizations involved in citizen deliberation found that int erest in public deliberation since 1990 had increased significantly (e.g., two- thirds of the organizations were founded after 1990). The same survey indicated that the momentum for public deliberation in the United S tates is primarily driven by local effor ts, which have connections to state or federal entities (Jacobs et al., 2009). 22 Within the United States today, a few organizations are convening a substantial number of deliberative processes on a variety of public policy or social issue topics . Exhibit 3.1 shows a sampling of these conveners in the United States and describes their activities. Exhibit 3.1.

Public Deliberation Methods In this section, we provide an overview of the specific deliberative methods identified in our literature review. The deliberative method refers to the basic architecture of the process, including the number of participants, the length of the sessions, and the number of sessions. Other structural features, such as the use of witnesses or experts, methods for recruiting participants, expertise of facilitators, provision of educational materials, and use of incentives, may characterize particular methods. Specific deliberative methods may have names that model other extant forms of public consultation (e.g., citizens' jury) or designate a consistent set of features that are used together (e.g., deliberative focus groups). Primary Methods of Public Deliberation In Exhibit 4.1, we show the primary methods of public deliberation identified in the literature review, along with the number of applications of each method noted in the literature. This exhibit includes a category of \"other\" to reflect methods that do not fall neatly into one of the nine categories listed. The methods listed in Exhibit 4.1 are not always mutually exclusive; in creating innovative and unique deliberative processes, practitioners have tended to select and adapt features from traditional methods of deliberation. Exhibit 4.1 displays the occurrence of various methods among the 96 articles included in our literature review that abstractors identified as addressing deliberative methods explicitly. Nineteen of these articles were reviews, and one was a meta- analysis. Some of the reviews and the meta -analysis described multiple unique applications of deliberati ve methods and thus were counted as separate applications of deliberative methods. Sixty -eight articles were single empirical studies, and seven articles were classified as \"Other.\" In total, there were 105 applications of deliberative methods that came fr om 96 articles. Exhibit 4.1. Number of applications of each deliberative method as noted in the literature review Deliberative method Frequency observed Citizens' jury 16 Citizens' panel/citizens' council 8 Consensus conference 4 Deliberative focus group 17 Deliberative Poll\u00ae and deliberative polling 9 Issues forum (includes \"Community Forums,\" National Issues Forums, \"Deliberative Forums\") 11 Study circle 3 Town hall (includes 21st Century Town Hall Meetings) 3 Other* 34 TOTAL 105 *Other includes Choosing Healthplans All Together (CHAT), ChoiceWork DialogueTM, and myriad hybrid methods that incorporate elements of the traditional methods. 24 Although we did not conduct an exhaustive search of the use of public deliberation in all places and settings, the observations in our review indicate how deliberative methods are being employed. The most frequent types of deliberative methods, as observed in our review, are hybrid deliberative processes that draw on elements of traditional methods and ar e adapted to specific contexts. Based on this finding, some of the applications of deliberative methods may be opportunistic and determined by resource availability. An obvious question, when we look at the list of deliberative methods in Exhibit 4.1, is how the methods differ and whether specific methods have clear or unequivocal uses. The simple answer is that the methods differ on key characteristics of the process, potential complexity to mount, and cost. As such, they have different potential applications based on the purposes of deliberation. In Exhibit 4.2, we show the primary methods of deliberation and briefly describe the key differences in the components and procedures to implement them. In addition, we explore how the method has been generally used or what is viewed as its most appropriate application, along with key considerations specific to each method. 3 Considerations that are more general are discussed below. Whereas Exhibit 4.2 draws on many resources, a core source was Abelson et al.'s extensive review of public participation and consultative methods (Abelson, Forest, Eyles, Smith, Martin, & Gauvin, 2001). 3 In Section 9, we provide more detail on the critical components to consider in designing and implementi ng deliberative processes. 25 Exhibit 4.2.

These methods have been created in many cases to address different purposes or goals, as highlighted in the column labeled \"Previous/most appropriate uses\" of these methods. In addition to the specific consider ations discussed above, engaging the public through deliberation involves several considerations on the part of the sponsor. Below we highlight key considerations in choosing among the deliberative methods. Recruitment The method for recruiting participations for a deliberative process is fundamentally related to the purposes of deliberation and the role of the participants (Parkinson, 2004). Further, to promote public acceptance of public consultation processes (including public deliberation), Rowe and Frewer (2000) indicate that certain conditions, described in Chapter 8, need to be met: (1) representativeness, described below; (2) independence, whereby the process is unbiased and participants are not affiliated with the sponsoring organization; (3) early involvement of the public in the policy issue that is being brought to the public; and (4) influence, meaning that assurances are made to participants that their contributions can influence public policy. It is in understanding the relationship between the participants in deliberation and the broader public in general that the value of public deliberation is salient to decision -makers and policymakers. To help ensure that the deliberative outcome resulting from small- scale deliberation reflects the opinions of the broader society, the deliberative process should include a body of individuals who are empowered by the public to represent their interests and/or involve a descriptively representative sample (Fishkin, 2009; Parkinson, 2004; Davies, Blackstock, & 2005). Rowe and Frewer (2000) caution, \"For true representativeness to be achieved, members of all affected communities...should be canvassed\" (p. 12). Further, they recommend that deliberative processes include the range of views on the issue f or deliberation as well (p. 13). If the goal of deliberation is to obtain information about broader public opinion, random sampling may be employed to obtain a representative sample. However, achieving representativeness with small sample sizes is nonethe less challenging and unlikely (Rowe & Frewer, 2000). If the deliberative process should include traditionally underrepresented groups, quota or threshold sampling can be used to ensure that a certain proportion of the participants come from the underrepres ented groups (Parkinson, 2004). Alternatively, if the goal of the deliberative process is to hear from members of affected groups, participants may be purposively selected. 29 Thus, the manner in which recruitment is conducted, the composition of the group, a nd the way participants' roles are defined also affect the process and its claim to representativeness (Davies et al., 2005; Fishkin, 2009; Parkinson, 2004; Rowe & Frewer, 2000). Session Length The empirical studies identified in the literature review pro filed deliberative sessions that ranged from one 90- minute discussion group to multiyear commitments that entailed several meetings a year, each lasting several days. Determining session length involves considering how much time is sufficient for deliberation to take place, the relationship between session length and the depth of the questions for deliberation, and how essential session length is vis -\u00e0-vis the goal to promote an engaged and informed public rather than to help inform policy decisions. Sessi on length is one of the critical dimensions of designing a deliberative process because of its extensive requirement of time and financial resources. Longer processes require greater effort to recruit participants, especially hard -to-reach populations, who may not be able or willing to dedicate as much time. Further, longer sessions may require substantial participant incentives and increase the obligations of facilitators and experts. Whereas hundreds of people can attend a half-day deliberative session, m ultiday sessions are geared to 30 participants or fewer. Thus, the length of the session requires a tradeoff between an extended deliberation with a few people and a less comprehensive session attended by many. The time commitment must be closely aligned with the purposes of the deliberation and the goals of the sponsor or funder. If the goal of the sponsor is to better inform or better represent the public at large, a large group that deals more superficially with an issue may be more important than a small group that goes into greater depth. Professional organizations in public deliberation tend to use short session lengths. National Issues Forum structures its public deliberation processes around a one -time, 2 -hour meeting format. Public Agenda has also t aken this approach but now customizes its discussion process to the needs of its clients. One of the rationales for keeping a deliberation to 2 hours is to ensure that the process is easily accessible to communities seeking public engagement on civic issue s. Organizations familiar with constructing a 2 -hour format would likely argue that if the topic is well framed and the options presented for discussion are credible and clear, all the elements of good deliberation can be achieved. Session length is an important feature of deliberation that warrants further investigation regarding its effects on the quality of deliberation and outcomes. Use of E xperts The use of experts is also a key consideration. There is some concern that the educational component may re ly more heavily on experts than on unbiased educational materials (MacLean & Burgess, 2010). Further, the use of experts introduces an \"expert effect,\" where participants are particularly deferential to experts' perspectives. In one study that sought to ex amine the role of experts in deliberation, the extent to which participants relied on and were critical of the 30 experts' contributions was examined, showing that participants could be critical of the experts, while the inclusion of the experts (and stakehol ders) enhanced participants' understanding of the issue (MacLean & Burgess, 2010). Setting of the I ssues and Agenda A common issue, regardless of method, is who will set the agenda and how will issues be framed. The various methods employ quite different a pproaches and sponsor roles; for example, the sponsor could decide on the issues, agenda, and framing. Alternatively, participants themselves can set the agenda and select the particular aspects of the deliberative topic that they most want to address. Eac h option has benefits and drawbacks. More \"top down\" approaches (i.e., set by the sponsor) can ensure that participants address key topics of concern, whereas more \"bottom up\" approaches are likely to engender more creative and purposeful thinking among participants. Measurement and P olling Methods employing measurement and polling as an explicit component of the approach can offer rich insights into the decision- making processes of the participants, particularly in real time. These results and insights can be used as a tool for further discussion and exploration within the deliberative session. Innovations in Public Deliberation As previously mentioned, public deliberation is an old concept and practice with many new applications and adherents throughout the world and in the United States. Rapid changes in technology and communication have generated new, innovative methods for engaging people in deliberation. The most far -reaching innovation is the use of online techniques, which can promote representative ness and minimize expenditure; however, the extent to which online forms of deliberation provide outcomes comparable to those of in- person forms of deliberation is not yet well understood. Online Modes for D eliberation Deliberative methods are becoming even more dynamic as the Internet has become a venue for social interaction. Online modes of deliberation can be incorporated into many deliberative methods, although not all. As shown in Exhibit 4.2, some methods of deliberation rely more strongly on face -to-face interaction. However, the use of online techniques is not an either/or proposition, and aspects of deliberative methods may be ripe for the application of online techniques. Here, we describe and explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of online deliberation. Aside from taking place online rather than in person, \"distance\" deliberation has the same features as traditional in -person methods, including an information component (i.e., the use of 31 educational materials and expert testimony), a deliber ation component (i.e., the opportunity for discussion), and facilitation (Luskin, 2007). Unlike the face -to-face mode, however, the deliberation component in an online deliberative process does not have to take place in real time; it can happen synchronous ly (i.e., in real time) or asynchronously (e.g., through message boards or listservs). In synchronous online deliberation, participants engage in dialogue at a set, agreed- upon time. In this form, facilitators tend to have control over who can speak and the nature and flow of the conversation (Siu, 2008). In asynchronous online deliberation, participants do not need to participate in real time with one another but instead have an online forum or some other information -sharing platform readily available. When the exchange is asynchronous, contributions are separated by minutes, days, or even longer periods (Dahlberg, 2006). Benefits of Online Deliberation Modes One benefit of online deliberations is the ability to more easily recruit a larger sample than in traditional in -person modes of deliberation, which helps address critiques that the generally small sample sizes associated with public deliberation cannot be adequately representative of the target population. Further, participants in online deliberation can be geographically dispersed. The use of technological advancements to facilitate communication across large geographic areas enables practitioners of deliberation to convene a more representative sample without the huge expense that would be incurred through in- person deliberation. For example, technology has enabled the deliberative process to span large geographic areas and enable a two -way conversation a mong participants (Fung, Lee, & Harbage, 2008; Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002). Widespread diffusion of communication technology and the use of technology tools have brought the deliberative process to typically difficult- to-reach populations, such as an init iative that established public -opinion Internet kiosks in community settings in and around Seattle, Washington. Another benefit of online forms of deliberation is that they are seen by many as being more egalitarian than face- to-face processes. Online del iberations are not as permeated by social cues that divulge power dynamics. Therefore, online deliberations may help individuals communicate with less attention to their differences (Min, 2009; King, Hartzel, Schilhavy, Melone, & McGuire, 2010; Kohn, 2000) . In addition, online deliberations can create an atmosphere where participants are more comfortable sharing their opinions and voicing dissent. For example, a study by Boyles (2009) found that participants in an online deliberation were more comfortable sharing their true feelings than participants in the in -person group. Further, there may be benefits from resisting the social pressures that emerge in face -to-face communications. In an experimental design, King and colleagues randomized participants to a computer -mediated communication (CMC) group or an in- person group to measure the effects of being face- to-face or online on polarization or consensus (King et al., 2010). Findings indicated that greater polarization existed in the CMC group, suggesting tha t online individuals were more resistant to social pressures to conform to the norm opinion. This polarization, however, can be a drawback, particularly when the task involves cultivating a group identity or coming to consensus. 32 Drawbacks of Online Deliberation Although online deliberation has many advantages, the use of online modes should be considered in relation to their potential drawbacks. For example, online communications can be tossed off as terse retorts without much thought or consideration. The nature of the discourse can be less rich and more prone to repetitive, terse responses, which are not conducive to deliberation, than in-person forms of deliberation (Boyles, 2009). On the receiving end, absorbing anything longer than a few sentences on a computer screen can be taxing, and it is easy for participants to skim rather than read carefully. In addition, online conversations may digress, particularly in the absence of a moderator. Without the physical presence of other people, participants can be easily distracted by other demands on their attention. There may also be accountability issues because participants feel less beholden to one another, which may manifest itself in coming late to online deliberations and posting text that one would not display if named (Boyles, 2009). Finally, in online deliberations it may be difficult to facilitate the interpersonal connections that can facilitate collaboration and negotiation. A more extensive discussion of the considerations in applying online c omponents and techniques to deliberation is in Appendix F. Other Innovations To Engage People i n Deliberative Methods While online deliberation is at the forefront of innovations to engage people in deliberative methods, three other recent innovations to support deliberation are especially noteworthy. Game Approach In this approach, games are used to help illustrate the decisions and potential consequences of decisions. For example, citizens in Perth, Australia, used game pieces, or chips, to help illustr ate desirable optimal levels of housing, commerce, and industry under four different scenarios (Ozanne, Corus, & Saatcioglu, 2009). The purpose of the planning game was to help participants visualize the real -world consequences of their theoretical preferences for the future of the city. Choosing Healthplans All Together (CHAT), a specific type of deliberative method that also employs a game approach, asks participants to select health insurance benefits for their families and their communities within the c ontext of constrained resources (Goold, Green, Biddle, Benavides, & Danis, 2004; Danis, Ginsburg, & Goold, 2010). Media Partnerships Public deliberations may incorporate collaborations with local media outlets. For a deliberation on the use of riverfront property in Philadelphia, for example, the Inquirer newspaper created a dedicated website (Sokoloff, Steinberg, & Pyser, 2005). Over the course of 3 weeks, an online poll on various design options posted to the site elicited more than 5,000 responses. In the print edition of the paper, a series of editorials and articles, as well as hundreds of letters, elevated the profile of the project in the community. In another example, a public deliberation in Perth, 33 Australia, was heavily advertised through televis ion, radio, and online channels. About 100 people attended and contributed to the deliberation's televised broadcast (Ozanne et al., 2009). Thus, the use of media partnerships may garner more participation, and perhaps more support for the results of the deliberative processes, because members of the public may be more accepting of policies that are derived from public input (Arvai, 2003). Photovoice In an intriguing integration of visual arts into the deliberative p rocess, researchers trained students in a rural Appalachian town to use photography to define their environment and describe how it could become a healthier place (Downey, Ireson, & Scutchfield, 2009). The resulting images were used to facilitate a community discussion on health concerns. In a formal comparison of two modalities, discussions based on text materials devoted relatively more time parsing action steps, while the photo- centered forum allotted more time to defining the community's problems. The r esearchers characterized as positive the tendency of the photo - centered discussions to establish a consensus on the nature and scope of the problems instead of jumping to possible responses. 34 Chapter 5. Public D eliberation T asks In this section, we provide an overview of the specific deliberative tasks identified in our literature review. The deliberative task refers to what participants are asked to accomplish in the deliberative process, irrespective of the specific topic being addressed. Exhibit 5.1 shows the primary methods of public deliberation identified in the literature review, along with the number of applications of each task noted in the literature. The frequency with which different deliberative tasks are noted is spec ific to the literature we reviewed. As such, it provides an overview of the types of tasks that participants are asked to undertake, but does not necessarily indicate the relative prevalence of these deliberative tasks outside of the context of this litera ture review. It also is important to note that the tasks listed in Exhibit 5.1 are not always mutually exclusive; any given deliberative processes may incorporate multiple tasks. Exhibit 5.2 presents examples of the deliberative tasks we identified. An asp ect of all tasks is viewing the public as a source of information that can inform decision- making, strategies (e.g., community - based programs), tools, and other societal resources. Exhibit 5.1. Number of applications of each deliberative task as noted in the literature review Deliberative task Frequency noted Development of policy guidance, policy recommendations, or tools 54 Priority setting/resource allocation 23 Guidance on ethical or values -based dilemmas 18 Risk assessment 9 Determinations of decision -making authority 1 Total 105 Development of Policy Guidance, Policy Recommendations, or Tools The deliberative task most commonly noted in our review was the development of public policy guidance and recommendations. In this type of task, participants are asked to answer questions pertaining to appropriate policy decisions, which typically entail judgments regarding what is reasonable and necessary, whether the level of resources needed is sustainable and acceptable, whether t he policy will be equitable in its distribution of burden or benefits, and whether the means for achieving the policy change are tolerable. An example of this task found in the literature occurred in a citizens' jury in New Zealand, in which individuals we re asked to consider whether the government should offer free mammography screening to women ages 40-49 (Paul, Nicholls, Priest, & McGee, 2008). 35 Priority Setting/Resource Allocation In priority setting and resource allocation tasks, participants are asked to select the most important options among alternative policy directions, program components, or treatment options. These tasks often reflect multiple values and ethical constructs that participants draw on to rank order and identify preferred solutions am ong many options. As one example, in a deliberative focus group in Tanzania, participants were asked to prioritize, from among nine options, the interventions that should be included in a government -sponsored essential health care package (Makundi, Kapirir i, & Norheim, 2007). Further, when participants are asked to allocate funding or prioritize options (such as research proposals) for funding, they must tackle a values -based dilemma in which certain values are pitted against one another, such as efficiency (i.e., sound stewardship of shared resources), freedom of choice, and equity. Given finite resources, participants must decide on allocation of those resources to competing services, research priorities, or programs. For example, in a deliberative process in Canada, participants were asked to determine which chemotherapy drugs should be publicly funded (Martin, Abelson, & Singer, 2002). Guidance on Ethical or Values -Based Dilemmas In this type of task, participants are primarily concerned with resolving or elucidating a tension or dilemma involving competing ethics or values. In some cases, the deliberative topic may explicitly name the values in conflict, such as \"freedom of choice\" (Nelson, Andow, & Banker, 2009). However, individuals may bring to bear on the topic other values and ethics that are not explicitly named or clear. For example, cost -effectiveness analysis, which requires values -based assumptions, entails multiple, perhaps opposing, values such as efficiency, personal health, freedom of choice, and innovation. The extent to which members of the public prioritize certain values over others often warrants consideration in the process of public deliberation. In ethics -based exercises, the public is informing decision -making around an ethical or mor al dilemma, usually involving the most fundamental ethics, such as equity and justice. Where ethical dilemmas exist, often concern for/protection of vulnerable groups, human rights, public health, autonomy, and collective well -being are involved. In the United Kingdom, the Citizens' Council considered whether the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) should issue guidance that concentrates resources on improving the health of the entire population or on improving the health of the mos t disadvantaged members of society (NICE, 2006). Risk Assessment In tasks related to risks, participants are asked to weigh risks and benefits or to determine the level of risk exposure that is tolerable, acceptable, or ideal. In these assessments, risk ca n take 36 many forms; there are risks to personal health, safety, privacy, integrity, human rights, and environmental soundness and sustainability, among others. Some risk assessment tasks relate to uncharted areas of research, technology, or biomedicine. Others pertain to the protection of rights of vulnerable groups, such as cognitively impaired individuals, particularly in research and health care decision -making. Although guidelines \u2014for example, the U.S. Belmont Report for the protection of human subjects in research \u2014address many of these issues, this deliberative task is often about topics that are novel and poorly understood. In these cases, the public can provide an additional source of evidence regarding how those approaches and concomitant risks should be distributed or mitigated. As an example, in one deliberation in the United States, participants were asked to inform policies for surrogate consent for patients with dementia, considering four scenarios that varied the risk -benefit trade- offs (Kim, Wal l, Stanczyk, & De Vries, 2009). Determination of Decisionmaking Authority In this type of deliberative task, members of the public are asked to deliberate on the appropriate role of various entities. These deliberations elicit views on appropriate balance of power between sources of external authority (i.e., the government) and autonomy, a fundamental dilemma at play in a democracy. In the literature, we found an example of a citizen's jury in the United Kingdom tasked with determining who should set health care priorities and what criteria should be used in health care decision -making (Lenaghan, 1999). Exhibit 5.2 shows examples of the types of deliberative tasks described above. 37 Exhibit 5.2. Examples of deliberative tasks Deliberative task Examples Development of policy guidance, policy recommendations, or tools Decide which services should be provided to severely mentally ill people and their neighbors to improve their quality of life and determine, of the services currently provided, which services are good, bad, or missing. (Pickard, 1998) Deliberate about the implementation of energy technologies and the future of the country's energy supply. (Niemeyer, 2007) Consider whether students can carry concealed weapons on campus. (Min, 2007) Priority se tting/resource allocation Have participants review a community health status report that identified key health concerns in the community to prioritize which health concerns warranted action. (Abelson, Eyles, et al., 2003) Have participants prioritize public health interventions to be included in an essential health care package. (Makundi et al., 2007) Decide which of four research proposals on nutrition to fund. (Rowe, Rawsthorne, Scarpello, & Dainty, 2010) Determine how public funds should be allocated for three hypothetical Super Fund sites in the Pacific Northwest. (Arvai & Gregory, 2003) Guidance on ethical or values - based dilemmas Identify and describe ethical issues in the use of technologies to extend the human life span. (Partridge, Underwood, Lucke, Bartlett, & Hall, 2009) Evaluate options for addressing the shortfall of organs for transplantation. (Davies & Burgess, 2004) Reflect on whether and under which conditions pregnant women have freedom of choice to undergo prenatal genetic testing. (de Cock Buning et al., 2008) Reflect on the value of quarantining individuals infected with a virus during a pandemic (infringement on civil liberties) to protect others (public health and well-being). (Baum, Jacobson, & Goold, 2009) Risk assessment Consider the relative risk of surrogate consent for research participation. (DeVries et al., 2010) Determine the relative risk of researchers contracted by a public body using medical information about identifiable people, without their consent, for drug surveil lance. (Parkin & Paul, 2011) Help rank the relative severity of 88 diverse environmental risks faced by the state. (Andrews, Hassenzahl, & Johnson, 2004) Deliberate on what benefits and harms are involved in cloning. (Kim, 2002) Determinations of decisio n- making authority Determine who should set health care priorities and what criteria should be used for setting spending priorities. (Lenaghan, 1999) The Relationship Between Public Deliberation Methods and Tasks Our review of the literature indicates th at overall, the deliberative tasks described above have been undertaken using various methods of deliberation (as described in Chapter 4 on deliberation methods). However, there are a few notable exceptions. Some deliberative methods were developed specifically to deal with a particular deliberative task or tasks. For example, Choosing Healthplans All Together (CHAT) was developed primarily for resource allocation and priority setting to design health benefits packages. In other instances, a deliberative method is most appropriate for specific tasks given its unique features. For example, in study circles and issues forums, members of the community are often asked to define or propose social or community issues for public deliberation. Alternatively, consensus conferences employ experts, involve 38 breaks between deliberative sessions and decisionmaking, require participants to come to consensus, and result in a final report from participants with formal recommendations, thus making this method more appropriate for scientific, technical, or complex issues (see Exhibit 5.3).

Participation in Public Deliberation Who Participates in Public Deliberation? Although there is a dearth of national studies on the prevalence of participating in deliberative processes, Jacobs and colleagues (2009) reported that 25 percent of survey respondents (a weighted U.S. general population sample) indicated that they had participated in a \"face- to-face deliberation\" through an informal or formal event about a public issue (p. 37). Four percent of the sample reported taking part in an online deliberation. The authors acknowledged that 25 percent exceeded their expectations. It is common to attempt to recruit representative samples of the general population by using random selection procedures. However, even when random selection is used, participation may vary; those who show up to deliberate may be different from the population they are intended to represent. Jacobs and colleagues (2009) shed some light on how participants in a deliberative procedure (attendees) differ from (1) individuals who were invited to the event but did not attend (invitees) and (2) a random sample of citizens responding to a phone survey (random sample). The same pre- and post- forum surveys were administered to all three groups. Attendees had higher values on a s cale of salience or recognition of the topic (social security; score of 9.5; scale: 3 -24) than either the invitees (score of 8.7) or the random sample (score of 7.8). Similarly, attendees scored higher (3.4; scale: 1 -6) on an index of social security knowledge than invitees (3.0) or the random sample (2.6). Finally, attendees had higher pretest scores on a \"future participation index\" (10.2; scale: 3-12) than the invitees (9.6) or the random sample (8.3), indicating a higher likelihood to participate in the future. The authors did not test for statistically significant differences between the groups on the pretest. However, a clear pattern suggests that individuals who participated in deliberation were more knowledgeable and more civic driven to begin with than citizens who did not attend and the general public. As a procedural element, in Deliberative Polling \u00ae processes, a randomly selected, representative sample of individuals complete a pre-intervention questionnaire; from this sample, a further subsample of individuals actually participates in the deliberative event. At the end of the event, participants are compared with nonparticipants on the basis of the pre-intervention questionnaires in terms of attitudes and demographics. However, this aspect of the process informs the conclusions drawn from the deliberative event rather than elucidates who participates in deliberation. Other studies have attempted to judge representativeness by comparing the study population with the general population (Deng & Wu, 2010; Warburton, 2006) or by asking the participants to sel f-report whether or not they thought that the participants were representative or \"typical\" of 40 people who would be affected by the deliberative topic (Rowe, Horlick-Jones, Walls, Poortinga, & Pidgeon, 2008; Warburton, 2006). Warburton (2006) concluded that they did achieve representativeness based on a demographic comparison and self-reports from participants. Rowe and colleagues (2008) found the opposite; participants disagreed that participants in the session were a fair cross section of the population. Those who participated often did not match up as completely with the population as was intended, with disproportionately higher numbers of well-educated, higher -income Caucasian women (Viewpoint Lear ning, 2009). When recruitment for Deliberative Polling \u00ae is conducted through telephone polls, participation in the Deliberative Polling\u00ae event is subject to the challenges brought forth by that recruitment method: However, the deliberative poll recruitment process, like most telephone polls, does tend to skew toward older populations, who have land lines and are more likely to be home, and toward the better-educated, who are more likely to be willing to talk with the pollster. Those who decide to attend are usually somewhat more politically active and better educated than the initial sample. To this point, participation has for the most part been limited to English-speaking individuals, for logistical reasons. (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005, p. 74) In summary, t he literature is incomplete with regard to drawing general conclusions about the representativeness of deliberative methods. Many applications rely on volunteer or convenience samples. Even when random samples are attempted, no information is provided to i ndicate whether participants and nonparticipants differ. One attempt to obtain participation among a target group is to stratify the sample and over recruit among the target population to ensure adequate inclusion. However, even if the sample is demographi cally similar to the population of interest, it does not ensure that the opinions and views represent those from the population at large. Further complicating the issue, depending on the topic, is the difficulty in defining who constitutes the population \"potentially affected by the results of the discourse\" (Webler, 1995). Willingness To Participate in Public Deliberation Irrespective of participation rates, most individuals in the United States say that they are willing to participate in deliberative proc esses. One nationally representative survey about political participation in the United States found that only 5 percent of respondents indicated that they were \"not at all interested\" in participating in deliberative processes (Neblo, Esterling, Kennedy, Lazer, & Sokhey, 2009, p. 16). Interestingly, in this study, age, being white, and income were negatively associated with willingness to participate, a reversal of traditional patterns of participation. Willingness to participate in deliberative processes may be closely related to the political and cultural characteristics of the countries within which deliberation occurs. There is considerable evidence in the United Kingdom and Canada that citizens are willing to assume and expect a 41 larger role among the public in decision-making about health care (McKie, Shrimpton, Hurworth, Bell, & Richardson, 2008). In the United States, Neblo and colleagues (2009), in the aforementioned study, asked why participants would participate in political processes, finding that 30 percent of respondents would do so out of a sense of obligation or duty. These researchers also explored the influence of perceiving politicians as corrupt on the willingness to participate, finding that 62 percent of respondents would be more likely to participate if they perceived political institutions as being less corrupt, indicating that trust influences willingness to participate. The researchers also explored how receiving an invitation from a congressperson would influence participants' willingness to participate in deliberation. Participants, even those who originally answered that they would not participate because they perceive political institutions as corrupt, were willing to participate in this scenario, suggesting that participants may value the opportunity to deliberate differently once it becomes an actual possibility. It also suggests that the individual or organization who requests the participation of individuals in the process may affect their willingness to participate because this may signal the importance of the public deliberation event. In a more direct study on deliberation, Jacobs and colleagues (2009) conducted a survey of 756 respondents who had participated in face- to-face deliberative processes and asked why they particip ated. Most respondents said that they participated out of concern for others. For example, respondents indicated that they were most motivated to participate when the topic for deliberation \"affected other people who live in my community\" (p. 72); if issue s affected the participant or their families; and out of a sense of duty. There was also some evidence that the willingness to participate was closely tied to the topic for deliberation and that some topics, such as social welfare and economic policy, attr acted more diverse audiences than others. Finally, some research suggests that willingness to participate in deliberative processes, political interest, and intellectual inquiry are related (Neblo et al., 2009). However, Jacobs and colleagues (2009) found that intellectual inquiry (e.g., cognitive need) is not a strong motivator for participation. In addition, individuals who are conflict- avoidant may be less willing to participate in the deliberative process (Neblo et al., 2009). Individual Values Brought Out in Public Deliberation Once individuals do participate in a deliberative process on any given topic, they bring to bear their own background, ethics, values, preferences, and other components of their \"world view.\" As important, some topics or issues are more likely to elicit different aspects of individuals' perspectives and worldviews. Deliberative processes present an opportunity to weigh the \"principles and values involved as well as the circumstances and consequences\" of the topic of debate (Graci a, 2003, p. 230). In deliberative processes, members of the public must draw on their values, ethics, senses of norms, 42 and preferences to reach a meaningful outcome. In Exhibit 6.1, we provide a list of common \"subjective predispositions\" (Niemeyer, 2007, p. 1) that participants bring to deliberative processes that inform and shape how participants deliberate. It is these a priori feelings, beliefs, values, and conceptions that participants must draw on to negotiate the dilemma. We have categorized them by core, individualistic, and public values. Individuals engaged in deliberation may have alternative perspectives regarding the outcomes and purposes of deliberation (e.g., appropriate courses of action, decision guidance). Where these perspectives are opposing or conflicting, fundamental areas of disagreement (e.g., ethics, values) may arise. Further, evidence is extensive that the values held by individuals will influence the way they interpret and accept new information; however, how the issue is framed and presented to participants also influences the values they bring to bear on the issue (Niemeyer, 2007; Culyer, 2006; Abelson, 2007).

Public Deliberation in Health Overview The application of deliberative methods to healthcare began in the 1990s within the United Kingdom's National Health Service (Abelson, 2010) as an outgrowth of increasing needs on the part of health policymakers and public policy scholars for more informed, effective, and legitimate methods to involve the public and patients in decisions that affect them. Other fields, such as environmental policy and biotechnology, have a much longer history of deliberative methodology. As in other fields, deliberation is a useful strategy to resolve conflict and make policy in health care because ethical, economic, and political dilemmas are common. Deliberation has been used in health care to do the following: Allocate scarce resources and assign accountability (Abelson, 2009; Baum et al., 2009; Chafe, Neville, Rathwell, & Deber, 2008b) Set priorities for public action (Rosenbach, Lee, Hwang, Garfinkel, & Swigonski, 1997) Assess the risk -benefit trade-offs and the distribution of risks and benefits across society associated with decisions, policies, or actions (Willis et al., 2010; Nelson et al., 2009; de Cock Buning et al., 2008; DeVries et al., 2010) Increase political leverage (Citizens' Health Care Working Group, 2006) Resolve public conflict over fundamental ethical and moral dilemmas, such as the conflict between individual liberty and the collective well- being and over the definition of what constitutes collective well-being (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004). Consider public ethics and values in the design and implementation of new health care policy or practice (Abelson, 2010; Murphy, 2005) Increase individual and community interest and knowledge (Fishkin, 2009) Determine the appropriate use of information and criteria setting (e.g., for decision- making) (Lenaghan, 1999) The conflict between individual and collective rights and responsibilities is particularly salient in U.S. health care because medical care and public health have evolved as two distinct branches of health care, whereas in most other countries, they are m ore closely integrated. For example, many public health decisions that are in the interest of the greater good (e.g., quarantine for communicable disease) are well understood, fairly universal, and more acceptable, despite infringing on individual rights and freedoms. For health care service delivery and coverage, however, the impact of decisions, such as paying for an unproven therapy, may be clearer in 44 systems where everyone contributes to the same insurance risk pool through taxes (i.e., publicly funded health care) than in those where each person is responsible for obtaining his or her own health insurance amid myriad risk pools. Practically, there are several reasons to engage the public in health care decision -making in the United States. First, there are controversies in health care related to advancements in technology that encroach upon ethical and moral beliefs. Where ethical and moral beliefs are tapped, challenged, or set in conflict, and where technical information alone is insufficient to infor m decisions, we are in the realm of public deliberation. Here, the competing values, ethics, beliefs, and opinions about an issue, such as the use of novel technologies, may be voiced and explored, after educating the public about what is known so that dec isions can be made in an informed way. For example, with new technological opportunities comes greater uncertainty about whether to use them, when to use them, how to use them, and for whom to use them (Culyer, 2006). To address this issue, the U.K.'s Nati onal Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) seeks public input about innovations in \" pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostic techniques, surgical procedures, other therapeutic technologies, health promotion, and workplace interventions for health and safety\" to make policy about whether, when, and how to use and pay for them (Culyer, 2006, p. 303) . Thus, public deliberation can be used to address the evolving nature of medical technology, health care, and bioethics. Second, health care decisions may necessitate multiple forms of evidence \u2014beyond scientific or technical information alone \u2014making them ripe for public deliberation. When scientific evidence is inconclusive or controversial, multiple \u2014often opposing \u2014stakeholder perspectives exist a nd need to be reconciled (Culyer, 2006). Although the issue of scientific evidence might be viewed by some as a purely scientific conflict, the contextual setting within which clinical evidence is gathered and interpreted often influences how decisions are made about the evidence. Thus, learning more about the values that are part of this context can inform decision- making (Culyer, 2006). Further, public opinion about the values and contextual factors involved can be a source of interim or additional evidence in cases where (1) the scientific evidence is insufficient to reach a policy decision, (2) the scientific evidence is balanced but conflicting, or (3) the scientific evidence might create unjustifiable inequities (Culyer, 2006). Public deliberation, the n, supplies additional pieces of information that policymakers can use to guide decision- making; it is a new input. Deliberative processes augment clinical evidence, producing evidence about the public's values and ultimately allow the culmination of multiple forms of evidence to better inform decision -making (Culyer, 2006). Third, because health policy carries significant consequences, public deliberation might increase transparency, promote understanding of the issues or reasons behind policy arguments, or increase trust in public institutions involved in making policy and administering health services, especially during times when trust is low (Abelson, Forest, et al., 2003; Baum et al., 2009). Trust was a key issue during the controversy surrounding the Clinton health care initiative in the 45 United States in 1992-1994. Though ultimately defeated in Congress, this initiative spurred tremendous public interest in the questions of whether and how the country could achieve universal health insurance coverage. Public Agenda and the National Issues Forum (NIF) developed a national campaign called Condition Critical , recruiting communities across the country to convene public discussion groups to promote an informed and engaged public that would approach the natio nal debate with a better understanding of their ownand their neighbors'priorities and trade -offs. Fourth, health care necessitates decision -making that fundamentally stems from concern for the equitable distribution of health resources, judicious use of scarce resources on evidence -based care, coordinated care and payment, and population health (Chafe et al., 2008b). Thus, health care calls for the integration of the consumer and citizen perspectives (Chafe et al., 2008b). There is evidence that members o f the public, as consumers of health care, do not understand clinical effectiveness or value evidence in the same manner as health care professionals do (Carman et al., 2010; Murphy, 2005). Often, individuals are reluctant to give up access to high - cost, discretionary care when they are considering their own values and interests without regard to the impact on society. Thus, because deliberative processes tend to evoke empathy and civic - mindedness by asking people to assume a societal rather than an individual perspective, integrating public deliberative processes in health policy issues in particular may help address issues related to resource allocation, priority setting, coverage, and access. In Canada, for instance, processes are in place to systematical ly obtain public input in priority setting for the provision of health services (Murphy, 2005). As another example, in the United States in 1989, the Oregon legislature established a reimbursement priority list as a key cost- containment feature of the Oreg on Health Plan. Coverage for previously uninsured Oregonians would be paid for in part by eliminating reimbursement for some low -priority services. The legislature required the Oregon Health Services Commission to \"actively solicit public input through com munity meetings to build a consensus on the values that should guide health resource allocation decisions\" (Oregon Health Decisions, 1990, p. 7). The creators of the Oregon Health Plan used a variety of other tools to gain public input, but the discussion groups were particularly relevant to the services prioritization process. Many studying the Oregon effort commended the state for its formal support of, and commitment to, identifying public values as an essential ingredient in how new health care policy s hould be implemented (Sabik & Lie, 2008). Unfortunately, the priority list proved to be a weak cost -containment method because postimplementation public and professional opinion tended to keep the cut point very low on the list and because some health plans and providers absorbed the cost of providing excluded services that they believed they could not deny their patients on ethical grounds (Rosenbach et al., 1997). The Oregon Health Plan experience provides an excellent example of how tensions between form al and informal public input related to resource allocation affect health care policy. 46 Sponsors of Public Deliberation in Health Sponsorship is an important consideration because it reflects the demand for deliberation and who is interested in deliberative public input. We identified 67 international studies with applications of deliberative processes in health care, public health, environmental health, or bioethics. Government organizations and universities were the most common sponsors of health-related public deliberations internationally (Exhibit 7 -1). Within the United States, primary funders included government organizations, universities, and nonprofit policy or research organizations and foundations (e.g., Kettering Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, California HealthCare Foundation, and the Commonwealth Fund). Exhibit 7 .1.

We discussed in Chapter 4 that we found 96 articles that described specific examples of deliberative methods applications, with 105 deliberative methods examples discussed within those 96 articles (see Exhibit 4.1 for the frequencies of different deliberative methods among the full set of 105 applications, and Appendix G for the total listing of deliberative methods applications by article author, title, and field of study). As shown in Exhibit 7- 2, 67 of these specific deliberative methods applications were related specifically to the health sector, both within and outside the United States. Almost all the applications of health care or public health topics in deliberation, including all those outside the United States, used face -to-face delib eration. Citizens' panels or councils and citizens' juries were the most common types of deliberative methods within and outside the United States (Exhibit 7 -2). Abelson and colleagues (2003), writing in Canada, reported that citizens' panels are increasin g in popularity (Abelson, Eyles et al., 2003). As was discussed in Chapter 4, many deliberative methods applications are hybrids of multiple methods or modifications of existing deliberative methods, which we classified as \"Other\" deliberative methods. A l arge number of the \"Other\" deliberative methods also characterize the set of health - related deliberative methods applications reflected in Exhibit 7 -2. 47 For the United States, we classified as an Other method one example of a deliberative process that used online asynchronous deliberation. This method was referred to by the study's authors as \"the Dialogue\" and was commissioned by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), General Services Administration (GSA), and the Federal Chief Information Officers Council (CIOC). On behalf of these organizations, the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) used public deliberation to explore how the United States should expand the use of information technology, while protecting personal privacy, to improve health care overall (Reeder, Balutis, Christopherson, Lyles, & Payton, 2009).

Exhibit 7- 3 lists the reasons that health care deliberations were held in the 67 applications of deliberative processes that explicitly described the reason. Most of the health care or public health deliberations were intended to develop directions, guidance, or recommendations for policy (24) or to resolve ethical or values -based dilemmas (15). The distributions are fairly similar inside and outside the United States, except that the development of policy directions, policy recommendations, and tools was proportionally more common outside of the United States and guidance on ethical or values -based dilemmas were proportionally more common in the United States. 48 Exhibit 7 .3.

These studies reflect the current state of the practice with respect to the types of health issues addressed by public deliberation. These exhibits reveal a strong concern over ethical dilemmas involving health insurance coverage in the United States and t he use of new technology outside the United States, perhaps reflecting that universal access to leading -edge technology is an agreed -on ethic in the United States and universal health insurance coverage is an agreed -on ethic elsewhere, but the reverse is not so in either location.

Ten studies, however, reported on deliberation of specific topics that addressed either alternative evidence- based treatments or the comparative cost -effectiveness of service delivery options. We discuss these 10 articles in detail because they are most relevant for informing the design of the Community Forum experiment. Public Deliberation and Evidence- Based Medicine Citizens' Jury in New Zealand o n the Government Provision o f Free Mammography f or Women Ages 40- 49 Paul and colleagues (2008) conducted a citizens' jury in New Zealand to determine what criteria were important to women ages 40-49 in deciding whether the New Zealand government should extend free mammography screening to women in this age range. The public health insurance plan had covered screening mammography starting at age 50, and advocacy and expert organizations had successfully argued to lower the age to 45. However, screening mammography has both risks and benefits, and this study sought the opinions of members of the affected population about the trade -offs. As noted by the authors : 51 Although expert groups weigh benefits and harms on behalf of and for the 'good' of the population, their weightings might be different from those of the people offered screening and so they may come to a different conclusion than the affected population would do if fully informed. Thus, this is a good example of the kind of issue that could be explored related to evidence -based recommendations in CER \u2014namely, does the public agree with expert or policy decisions about what services are good for whom, or, more importantly, do they understand, value, and agree with the underlying decision factors that lead to those policy decisions (p. 315)? Although at the beginning of deliberation, all 11 participants agreed that mammography should be offered to this age g roup, at the end of the jury, only 1 retained this opinion, with the rest determining that the screening should not be provided for this age group at public expense. The single deliberator who retained a favorable stance on fully publicly funded screening for women ages 40 -49 cited her reason as the value of a single human life, explaining that if a younger person could be saved, all the better. Reasons for not supporting such screening for women 40-49 included lack of accuracy in the test for women in this age group and lack of evidence that screening for this age group really does save lives compared with screening starting at age 50. Despite their opinions at the end of deliberation, provisos included retaining coverage at age 45 (because the age had alre ady been lowered in legislation) so as to not take away any current benefits; providing publicly funded screening to women at high risk; and recommending alternative tests if they are shown to be effective. The jury also included recommendations for consi stent and accurate educational materials for women in the age range of 40-49 who might consider having a mammogram in the private sector. They recommended that the information should be provided from one source and should include evidence from trials, information about the frequency and source of false positives and negatives, and risk information for the radiation levels in the test, in comparison to potential benefits for this age group. Public Deliberation in the United Kingdom About the Use o f Telemedicine a nd Telecare In a U.K. study, Mort and Finch (2005) explored the public's values, ethics, and preferences related to a health service delivery application \u2014telemedicine and telecare. Although telemedicine research had covered the areas of saf ety, usability, clinical effectiveness, and professional development, citizen input had not yet been included in the debate about possible benefits and problems created for patients, families, and caregivers. Following the distribution of educational mater ials and expert presentations, a convenience sample of 14 participants debated the following questions: What do you think about moving to new systems of practice for receiving health care at a distance? This could involve remote monitoring of a patient's c linical condition/data, such as blood pressure or blood sugar (e.g., diabetic patients), or expert opinion/diagnosis from a store and forwarded image of a patient supplemented 52 by online clinical history, or video- based consultations, or telephone -based adv ice services or consultations. What benefits and risks do you think that telemedicine and telecare pose for (a) patients, (b) caregivers, and (c) health care providers? Are there circumstances in which telemedicine is particularly appropriate (or inappropr iate)? Are there certain locations in which telemedicine is particularly appropriate (or inappropriate)? What principles would you wish to see underpinning telemedicine developments? The panel recommended that the following principles and practices be adopted: Respect and dignity of the individual Input by users, care providers, local caregivers, and family members in the design of telemedicine technologies Training for each of these parties, especially where devices would be installed in the home Requ irement that such services be needs -driven for the benefit and comfort of the patient and not dictated by industry or service -provider convenience or benefit Access for marginalized groups Continued research on outcomes for such technology Recognition of the continued importance of some face -to-face element, especially with a specialist prior to beginning services through telemedicine Mort and Finch (2005) stressed the importance of not considering new technologies to be \"value free\" (in the sense of s ocietal and personal impact and implication). Multistage Public Consultation, Including Deliberative Roundtable Workshop, in the United Kingdom , on Priority Setting for Diabetes Research In an assessment of deliberative methods as an alternative to traditi onal focus groups, Evans and Kotchetkova (2009) examined how patients, caregivers, and lay citizens evaluated different treatment options for Type I diabetes. This application was contrived as part of a broader research study of the role of the social science researcher in deliberative group processes versus traditional focus groups; therefore, public input on a topic for deliberation was not an end goal for its own sake. The findings of the study focused on the role of the social science researcher and thus are not applicable to our purposes. Nevertheless, the topic of the session is an example of comparative effectiveness, and deliberation on this topic did occur, so the study is included here. Participants were first interviewed, then convened in focus gr oups, and finally met for a 53 one-day deliberative roundtable workshop. In the deliberative session, a hypothetical scenario was established wherein a benefactor was seeking advice on what kinds of diabetes -related research should be supported. Participants were presented with three treatment options that they had learned about in the prior sessions: Insulin pump leading to an artificial pancreas that would monitor blood glucose levels and automatically administer insulin when necessary Stem cell research le ading to replacement beta cells that could be transplanted into patients and enable them to produce their own insulin A vaccine that would prevent the autoimmune disorder that destroys pancreatic beta cells from developing Participants considered the pros and cons of the various options, the social and technological futures that could arise if a particular option was given priority, and what sorts of policy changes would be needed for this future to be realized. Citizens' Jury in England Regarding Prophylactic Medicine Elwood and Longley (2010) conducted a citizens' jury of 16 members of the public in England to determine what information and other support people want when assessing the risks and benefits of medicines and what role they f eel government and health care professionals should play in informing, advising, and encouraging healthy people on the potential benefits and possible risks of prophylactic medicine. The issue of personal responsibility for health was a key issue in this investigation. Deliberations on these topics shed light on the extent to which the public desires a role for the government in ensuring that people are well informed\u2014in a balanced and effective manner \u2014 about the potential risks and benefits of medicines. Most of the jurors believed that the public should be made aware of possible benefits from medicines used prophyla ctically; aspirin in the reduction of colon cancer, and possibly in other cancers, was specifically discussed. Some jurors were concerned that s uch information would raise false hopes about unproven benefits. Jurors supported discussing risks and benefits with a health care provider as part of general preventive services but were concerned about the apparent variation in knowledge and practice of doctors with respect to preventive medicines. Jurors in this study expressed a great desire for more information on health issues, and they demonstrated an understanding of the data and materials presented to them. They preferred that risk/benefit informa tion be presented in absolute rather than relative terms. Central to the value of personal responsibility for health care, jurors preferred that information on preventive medicines be accompanied by information on lifestyle changes. 54 These recent studies used several methods of deliberation to consider alternative medicines, treatments, and service delivery approaches. They illustrate the kinds of CER -related topics for which public input is being sought and lend some ideas for the kinds of topics that could be explored in our demonstration study of deliberative processes as applied to CER. Public Deliberation and Health Insurance Policy Deliberation on insurance policy issues has typically focused on the cost -effectiveness of new preventive or therapeutic technology and on the inclusion of cost as a consideration in coverage decisions. Health Technology Assessment a nd the Role of Public Input As noted by Docteur and Berenson (2010), countries where government has a regulatory role i n health care coverage systems have established institutions charged with undertaking studies such as health technology assessments (HTAs) that explore the medical, economic, social, and ethical implications of the decision to cover innovative services. Ca nada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have all established agencies that obtain public input to inform decisions about coverage of services. Citizens' Panel in the Netherlands Regarding Attitudes Toward Prenatal Genetic Testing In a study of participant attitudes toward prenatal genetic testing in the Netherlands, de Cock Buning and colleagues (2008) asked the public whether prenatal genetic testing should be (1) covered for everyone, (2) only for fetuses at risk for a condition with severe consequences, or (3) for fetuses at risk for any condition that can be detected prenatally. Participants reviewed scenarios/vignettes of four hypothetical testing situations and discussed whether and under which conditions pregnant women should have the freedom of choice to undergo prenatal genetic testing at public expense. The invasiveness of the procedure and the severity of the condition that served as the motivation for genetic testing (e.g., detection of sex, club foot, Down syndrom e, and cystic fibrosis) were varied in the scenarios. Participants were asked to work through coverage decisions about each scenario and were able to identify a small set of values that were core to decisions about prenatal genetic counseling. In the cours e of one afternoon, they identified many key ethical or values -based considerations in decision- making regarding the use of prenatal testing (e.g., the risk to the fetus associated with genetic testing; viewing these risks in light of the \"benefit\" that wo uld be gained by knowing test results; uncertainty of test results). Further, participants generated two new perspectives that were contrary to current government policy on this issue; for example, they believed that financial policy for prenatal genetic testing should be based on cost -efficacy and not be used as a tool to steer moral decisions in the private domain. Because policymakers had designed and implemented this deliberative process, the public input had a direct impact on policy by (1) corroborati ng the recommendations of the Health Council of the Netherlands, further giving weight to these recommendations; (2) leading to a new provision that the government provide information to all women about noninvasive testing options for Down syndrome; and (3) leading to the new policy that public insurance 55 coverage include more accurate testing where higher risk is indicated. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of lay citizens and the early involvement of policymakers in a deliberative process can resul t in societal change. Standing Deliberative Body as a Research Program Within the United Kingdom's NICE An example of a standing body as a research program within NICE in the United Kingdom is the Citizens' Council, which develops social value judgments t o support clinical guidance and coverage decisions. As part of NICE's and the Citizens' Council's work, in particular, cost - effectiveness is a criterion for determinations of National Health Service (NHS) coverage because \"the focus of the Institute on max imizing health gains from a fixed [NHS] budget\" (Culyer, 2006, p. 313) requires consideration of cost -effectiveness. Culyer states, \"The perspective from which such an analysis is to be done plainly involves major ethical judgments, concerning, as it does, the scope of costs and consequences that are deemed relevant\" (p. 312). Docteur and Berenson (2010) note that in places such as the United Kingdom, where the government allocates a fixed budget for services, the population generally accepts that choices must be made and that the value of providing expensive services to extend the life of terminally ill patients must be weighed against the value of financing services, such as hip replacements, that benefit and improve the quality of life of many more people . However, \"in the United States, by contrast, coverage expansion results in cost and premium increases that increasingly render insurance unaffordable for some, but there is relatively little social pressure to make decisions that increase the value of ef ficiency of collective health expenditures\" (p.8). Thus, the public can inform these judgments and the boundaries surrounding the use of cost -effectiveness information. Deliberative Focus Groups to Examine Cost Effectiveness a s a Criterion in Medicare Coverage Decisions in the United States In the United States, cost -effectiveness is a less explicit criterion in coverage decision -making. Two recent efforts in the United States reveal that the public may be open to this information. First, Gold, Franks, Si egelberg, and Sofaer (2007) conducted an explicit study of the public's acceptance and use of cost -effectiveness information as an input into decisionmaking about coverage provisions. Using a sample drawn from the New York County jury rolls, six focus groups (each meeting twice) were educated on topics of costs and coverage (in the United States compared with other countries'); comparative information about rates of uninsurance; life expectancy and infant mortality outcomes; the use of cost -effectiveness an alysis; and examples of cost -effective uses of health care dollars. Illustrative examples of ethical and normative issues related to resource allocations were also discussed (e.g., trade- offs between quality of life/quantity of life; personal responsibilit y; disease severity). Dilemmas in each case example were discussed by the group. At the end of the day, given only information about effectiveness of treatments, participants were asked to \"assume the role of social decision maker\" (p. 68) and develop priority coverage decisions for about 14 different conditions and their treatments by indicating which 5 treatment -condition pairs they would definitely cover, which 5 they would probably cover, and which 4 they would not cover. 56 At a second focus group session, these rankings were shared, aggregated, discussed, and then twice reprioritized: (1) first after participants received cost- effectiveness information about each treatment -condition pair and (2) next after they were informed about the numbers of individuals eligible for treatment, the costs, and the impact on the Medicare budget if all clinically eligible persons made use of the treatment. Cost-effectiveness ratios had been developed by investigators for the condition- treatment pairs. Following information on only the effectiveness of the treatments, there was no difference in the cost-effectiveness ratios associated with lower and higher priority coverage choices. However, following the receipt of information on cost -effectiveness on the second day, the revised priority listings clearly reflected a consideration of cost -effectiveness in the decision scheme: participants prioritized coverage choices for interventions that required less cost to obtain gains in health. Thus, participants appeared to value the cost -effectiveness information as an input in decision- making about coverage and prioritized their coverage preferences accordingly. The number of people eligible for the treatment was also a key decision factor in all three opportunities to rank-order t he priorities, with participants consistently prioritizing those interventions that covered the most people. Post -assessment surveys indicate that 95 percent of participants felt that they understood cost -effectiveness \"to some extent\" or \"reasonably well. \" Ninety -four percent identified the key factors involved in cost -effectiveness analysis, and 72 percent could accurately perform a calculation about cost -effectiveness analysis. Thus, the public was able to discuss these issues and demonstrated a willingn ess to consider cost -effectiveness in their decisions. The authors acknowledge that a limitation of this study is that cost- effectiveness was the only criterion considered by participants; further, it was specified by the investigators and did not emerge f rom the group. As with the de Cock Buning study, the results suggest that the kinds of information that the public would use is not necessarily available to the public. Public Deliberation to Explore Ethics and Values i n Health Care Coverage i n the United States In one study, Sacramento Healthcare Decisions obtained informative results about the impact of value -based considerations on coverage decisions and the ethics and values involved with making coverage decisions in general (2006). Investigators posed three scenarios to 27 focus groups across Northern California. The scenarios included descriptions of (1) a life -saving treatment device for people with severe heart disease; (2) a drug to improve the quality of life of Alzheimer's patients by slowing dis ease progression; and (3) a preventive intervention (physical examination) that fostered early detection of many medical problems. Scenarios included information on disease impacts, cost, total number of people who could be helped by the intervention, and total cost to society if all persons affected opted to exercise the benefit. The goal of the discussion was to determine the public's stance on the following positions: Do consumers believe that a medical treatment can be too expensive compared to the benefit it brings to patients? Should society use a value -based approach (considering the cost of an intervention relative to its clinical benefit) when making decisions about insurance coverage? 57 Participants initially voted on whether the government should include these among covered options in insurance plans and then deliberated among themselves about their rationale. Participants were next asked to identify the elements of the scenarios that would require a change in order to produce a different decision about covering the service option. Participants generated rich information through their discussions, including proposing values that could inform coverage decisions. Central to the acceptance of any of the three interventions were the following motivations: \"you cannot put a price on life\"; \"this could affect me or my family\"; \"government wastes money on less important things\"; \"coverage encourages innovation\"; and \"it may save money in other areas\" (p. 3). This group of participants did not consider cost as a viable factor in making coverage decisions. Among those who opposed covering one or more of the services (i.e., for whom cost was a decision factor), the following motivations emerged: not enough people benefit; it is too expensive; there are better way s to spend the money; the impact isn't significant enough, it won't cure the disease; you can't live forever. Other deliberators could not make a decision, citing internal conflicts over prioritizing the individual over society or vice versa, or they did not want the burden and responsibility of making such a decision. At the end of deliberation, a postevent survey indicated that 80 percent of participants believed that cost-effectiveness was appropriate at least in some situations; however, only 56 percent endorsed the use of cost -effectiveness information when other cost -containment alternatives were presented. Overall, there was a qualified acceptance by most participants of using value- based criteria in coverage decisions. Those with lower income and/or education were less inclined to support this use. Participants who objected most strongly seemed to be concerned about restrictions on life -saving technologies, with preservation of life being a dominant priority. Several themes emerged from the participants in these studies that are pertinent to deliberation about CER and that shed light on values that factored into decisions about the interventions: The role of personal responsibility: An expensive treatment should benefit those who take good care of th emselves and should not \"rescue\" those who ignore (or actively damage) their health. Prevalence of the medical problem: As was found in Gold and colleagues (2007), the more people affected by a condition and potentially helped by the intervention, the more support there was for covering it, regardless of other decision factors. Availability of other treatments: There was more willingness to accept even marginally effective interventions when there were no or few other treatment options. Views about fairnes s: In denying coverage for expensive treatments that affect few persons, there is potential for inequality in terms of treatment, morbidity, and mortality. In the case of denials of coverage, only the wealthy would be able to afford such options. 58 Togethe r, the health technology assessment and insurance coverage prioritization literature shed light on the utility of deliberation as a technique for exploring the ethics, values, and preferences underlying health care decisions and demonstrated that the publi c can understand complex content, weigh information, arrive at a reasoned argument, and generate new solutions that may or may not be consistent with current policy directions established by government. In conclusion, these 10 studies demonstrate that public deliberation can be used for topics that are similar to CER, insofar as the topics include societal- level issues that evoke myriad ethics or values. Participants in these aforementioned deliberative processes demonstrated the capacity for learning appa rently complex concepts such as cost -effectiveness, genetic testing and invasiveness, and comparative effectiveness information, among other concepts. Further, some of these studies have indicated that the public can propose new policy options or perspecti ves on a public health or health care issue. Thus, when participants are asked to consider the trade -offs between alternative options (as they could be asked in applications of public deliberation to CER), myriad forms of information may be important, incl uding cost -effectiveness, the distribution of risks and benefits across society, and access to care. 59 Chapter 8. Evaluation of D eliberative M ethods No single agreed -on approach or conceptual framework guides the evaluation of deliberative procedures. Further, no consistent taxonomy of outputs or consistent definition of optimal outcomes exists (Rowe et al., 2008). However, the general conceptual model for this project (presented in Exhibit 2.1) provides a useful framework for organizing the literature on evaluating deliberation. Exhibit 8.1 expands the portion of Exhibit 2.1 that is particularly relevant to the literature on evaluation. Exhibit 8.1. Framework for understanding the literature on evaluation The literature on the evaluation of delibera tion falls into four broad categories defined by the type of evaluation measure used: (1) Description of the procedural elements of the deliberation as they were implemented. (2) The quality of the discourse. This kind of evaluation focuses on the effect of the characteristics of the deliberative session(s) on the performance of the deliberation, in terms of how the participants experience the deliberation. It assumes that high -quality discourse is a necessary , and proximal, effect of the deliberation. (3) Achieving the stated goal of the deliberation. Assuming that the quality of the discourse is the most proximal effect of the deliberation method, achieving the stated goals and objectives for the deliberation co rrespond to the intermediate effects. These studies measure the effect of the deliberation on the knowledge and attitudes of the participants. Distal (long -term) effect: Impact on individual and societal values, behaviors, and decisionsIntermediate (mid -term) effect: Achievement of deliberation goalsProximal (immediate) effect: Quality of discourseDeliberation Framing of the question or concept Educational materials Group characteristics, expectations, dynamics, composition, and size Tools and resources (e.g., technology) Facilitator characteristics and facilitation Environmental context (e.g., media context, national dialogue about health care costs, access, and quality) 60 (4) Impact on individual and societal values, behaviors, and decisions. Ultimately, deliberation is conducted to obta in information that will influence personal and societal decision -making. This is the most distal effect of deliberation and the most difficult to measure, but the most important. Evaluations of these effects are complicated by the impacts of a broad range of other factors, such as the visibility of the deliberation process to those whose behaviors and decisions may be expected to change. A few evaluations have assessed the impact of deliberation at the individual behavior and societal level. We also char acterize the evaluation literature by the evaluation methodology used. Four broad categories of methodology are employed by investigators to study the procedures and effects of deliberation: (1) Descriptive case studies. These studies are descriptions of deliberative projects by the sponsors, which provide post hoc reports on the implementation process. They may include qualitative or quantitative measures. This design is summarized by the following diagram: T 1 Intervention Group: X O where T1 1 is the time at which measures were taken, O 1 (2) Evaluative case studies. These are reports on either single cases or, in a few instances, multiple cases, in which selected measures are compared before and after the deliberation to determine whether the deliberation had an effect. Where these studies report on multiple deliberations (i.e., multiple cases), they do not compare one deliberation with another. Instead they pool the participants and report on the differences among subgroups, defined by personal characteristics such as gender and ethnicity. They differ from the first methodological class by using a pre/post quasi - experimental comparison, but they do not use separate comparison or control groups. is the observation of the measures, and X is the deliberation. This design is summarized by the following diagram: T 0 T 1 Intervention Group: O0 X O where T1 k is the time at which measures were taken, O i is the observation of the measures, and X is the deliberation. This is the same design as above with the addition of a pre -intervention baseline (O 0 (3) Nonrandomized comparisons of alternatives. Some of these studies test the ef fect of alternative deliberative methods against each other or against no deliberation. Other studies test alternative features of a single deliberative method against each ) observation of the measures. 61 other. Compared with the first two methodological classes, this class differs by us ing comparison groups. In most instances, these are predefined comparison groups, but in one study, the groups were defined from survey data in which some respondents reported that they had participated in deliberation and others reported that they had not. This design is summarized by the following diagram: T 0 T 1 Intervention Group: O0 X O Comparison Group: O1 0 O 1 where the symbols represent the same factors as above, with the addition of a nonrandomized comparison group that could be an alternative deliberative method or the same deliberative method with an alternative feature. (4) Randomized experiments. These studies rand omize participants to groups that participate in alternative deliberative methods or a non -deliberating comparison group, or groups randomized to receive alternative features of a single deliberative method. The first type\u2014those that compare distinctly different deliberative modes with each other using randomization\u2014are directly analogous to the experiment planned for the Community Forum and are, therefore, the most relevant to the purpose of this literature review. This design is summarized by the followin g diagram: T 0 T 1 Intervention Group: O0 X O Participants R 1 Comparison Group: O0 O where the symbols represent the same factors as above, with the addition of randomization (R) of participants to the intervention or comparison condition. 1 Exhibit 8.2 presents the distribution of 29 articles along both dimensions: measurement and method. These 28 articles were selected for inclusion in this chapter because they report the results of either process or outcome evaluation and inform us about the methods and measures employed in evaluation. Although not truly evaluative, the articles in the first measurement class \u2014descriptive case studies \u2014are important to consider because they provide information about how the deliberative methods were implemented. Except for the first column of unduplicated counts, the cell numbers in Exhibit 8.2 are not necessarily mutually exclusive (although some articles appear in only one cell) because more 62 comprehensive evaluations use multiple methods and descr ibe the effects of deliberation in terms of multiple kinds of measures (i.e., quality of discourse, goal achievement, and impact on values, behavior, and decisions). We describe below our findings about the methods and measures used in the literature to as sess each of the four kinds of measurement listed in Exhibit 8.2. Exhibit 8.2.

As such, it focuses on the methods and measures used to evaluate the construction and impl ementation of deliberative sessions, including the selection of participants and the quality or usefulness of the educational materials, experts, or other aspects of the procedure. These elements are defined or designed ahead of the deliberation but are as sessed at the conclusion of the deliberation, usually by soliciting feedback from participants on their experience with the deliberation, the materials, the experts, and so on. In theory, how well these elements are constructed and carried out will contribute to the effect of the deliberation on the other measurement classes defined in Exhibit 8.2: quality of discourse, effectiveness in achieving immediate goals of the deliberation, and impact on the values, behavior, and decisions of the public. 63 The constructs measured and reported on in these articles include representativeness, independence, early involvement, and transparency. As defined by Webler (1995), representativeness requires that \"anyone who considers him- or herself to be potentially affected by the results of the discourse must have an equal opportunity to attend the discourse and participate\" (p. 37). An operational definition proposed in Rowe and Frewer (2000) suggests that \"public participants should comprise a broadly representative sample of the population of the affected public\" and, at minimum, individuals who are directly affected by the issue (p. 12). Rowe and Frewer (2000) also define independence, early involvement, and transparency. An independent deliberative process should include conveners, managers, and facilitators who are unbiased with respect to the issue being deliberated. Early involvement means that the public should be involved as early as possible in the process once the value judgments to be considered become salient. A deliberation is transparent if the public can see what is going on and how decisions are being made. Rowe and Frewer (2005) also identify the utility and completeness of the educational materials provided to participants and the quality of the facilitation as important characteristics. They considered accessibility of the provided resources, the extent of focus on decision-making, and the degree of task definition. Resource accessibility was considered to be good if the public participants had access to th e appropriate resources needed to fulfill their brief successfully. The deliberative exercise should appropriately structure and display the decision-making task for participants. The nature and scope of the participation task should be clearly defined. Rowe and Frewer (2005) also identify the use of the results of the deliberation as planned by the organizers and communicated to the participants as an important characteristic. They evaluated this characteristic in terms of participants' expectations about the influence their deliberations would have on public policy. Finally, Rowe and Frewer (2000) define cost effectiveness of carrying out the deliberative session as a potentially important characteristic (i.e., the benefit of the results of the deliberat ion should be considered in light of the cost). However, the literature review did not identify any study of the cost- effectiveness of deliberative procedures. Quality of D eliberative D iscourse The most common approach to defining quality discourse draws on Habermas's theory of communicative action as interpreted and \"reworked\" by Webler (1995, pp. 35-77). Habermas's ideal speech situation requires the conditions of fairness and competence. For discourse to be deemed fair, Habermas and Webler agree that all persons affected by the discourse must have an equal chance to influence the process or the formulation of the agreement. That is, anyone may participate, assert validity claims (a position or opinion), challenge validity claims, and influence final deter minations of validity. Habermas and Webler differ in their conception of competence. 64 As conceived by Habermas, competence refers to characteristics of the individual; that is, individuals must be competent to participate in a fair manner in terms of their cognitive and linguistic ability, listening skills, self -reflection, and the knowledge on which they base validity claims. Webler's conception of competence in deliberative procedures centers on the rules that coordinate the social interaction of the group, including the condition that participants have access to the knowledge needed to make and challenge validity claims. \"Fair and competent\" discourse has been defined in evaluations of deliberative procedures as comprising several constructs: equal partic ipation (De Vries et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009), active participation (Rowe & Frewer, 2005), civil atmosphere (Melville, Willingham, & Dedrick, 2005); opportunity for adequate discussion (Abelson et al., 2007); respect for the opinions of others (De Vries et al., 2010); and awareness of different perspectives (Timotijevic & Raats, 2007). Related to competence, De Vries and colleagues (2010) define \"reasoned justification of ideas\" in terms of the extent to which participants engage in a collaborative, thoughtful reasoning process (p. 1900). Taking a different approach, Niemeyer (2007) defines \"inter -subjective rationality\" as the congruence of participants' values and beliefs and their reported preferences on the deliberative topic (p. 8). These construct s of discourse quality are usually evaluated through participants' self -reports of their experience and through researchers' observations or review of session transcripts. In an evaluation of deliberative procedures carried out in five Canadian regionalize d health settings, based on self -report in surveys, Abelson and colleagues (2007) found the deliberative process promoted discussion (98.9%), provided equal opportunity to participate (95.7%), and provided sufficient time to discuss issues (80%). De Vries and colleagues (2010) reported success in achieving equal participation and respect for opinions. Based on a review of transcripts, they also reported that participants provided \"reasoned justification of ideas,\" that is, a collaborative, thoughtful reasoning process in determining and justifying their opinions (p. 1900). Other authors have reported success in achieving a civil atmosphere (Melville et al., 2005) and active participation (Rowe & Frewer, 2005). Niemeyer (2007) reported greater congruence betw een deliberative participants' values and their beliefs and their reported preferences as a result of deliberation. The measures of discourse quality tend to be universal, in the sense that they are not determined by the specific topic being deliberated. Achieving the G oals of the D eliberation This literature addressed change in the measures of knowledge and attitudes (as reported by participants) about the topic of deliberation and change in the generic pattern of attitudes (without regard to the topic). 65 Changing Knowledge and Attitudes If we conceive of the quality of the discourse as the most proximal effect of choices about how to deliberate, the ability of the deliberation to achieve its goals is the intermediate effect. Typically, deliberative procedures aim to change participants' knowled ge (Abelson, Eyles, Raats, 2007; Deng & Wu, 2010) and attitudes, including perspectives (including orientation to the community or collective), values, beliefs, opinions, or policy preferences on the deliberative topic (Abelson, Forest et al., 2003; Abelson et al., 2007; Timotijevic & Raats, 2004, Ginsbur & Glasmire, 2004; Makundi et al., 2007, Dolan, Cookson, & Ferguson, 1999; Farrar et al., 2010). However, changing attitudes may not be the sole goal of deliberative processes, as strengthening of views may also be important. However, the importance of changing knowledge and attitudes is that these changes reflect the changes that arose from the deliberative process. Strengthened views or attitudes could indicate that polarization happened (Siu, 2008). These studies of deliberative procedures have consiste ntly reported success in changing knowledge as measured through objective pre - and post - knowledge assessments (Abelson, Eyles et al., 2003; Abelson et Raats, 2007; Deng & Wu, 2010); beliefs, opinions, or values (Abelson, Forest et al., 2003; et al., 2007; al., 2010; Fishkin, 2005; Viewpoint Learning, Inc., 2004); and change in priorities or policy preference (Ginsburg & Glasmire, 2004; Makundi et al., 2007; Danis et al., 2007; Deng & Wu, 2010; Fung et al., 2008). Among the studies of the effectiveness of deliberation in changing knowledge and attitudes are a number that are particularly relevant to the Community Forum experiment because they used quasi -experimental or experimental comparisons. The literature disc usses three types of comparisons: (1) deliberation compared with other public consultation approaches or nothing, (2) deliberative methods or modes compared with each other, and (3) alternative features of deliberative methods or modes. Studies Comparing Deliberative Processes to Other Public Consultation Approaches o r Nothing Three experimental studies in our review compared participants in deliberative procedures with control participants (i.e., individuals not exposed to a deliberative process) in term s of change in views on the deliberative topic. All three studies found deliberation to be effective at changing views. DeVries and colleagues (2010) experimentally investigated whether participants in a deliberative procedure were more likely than partici pants randomized to a control group to change attitudes regarding the provision of surrogate consent for dementia patients to take part in clinical research. The study demonstrated that participants in a deliberative procedure were significantly more likel y to change their attitudes and opinions than the control group of comparable individuals not taking part in a deliberative process. 66 Abelson, Eyles, and colleagues (2003) conducted a randomized experiment to compare mechanisms for providing input on prior ity setting related to health goals. Participants were randomly assigned to take part in a mail survey, a phone survey, or a face -to-face deliberative session (citizens' panel). Members of the deliberative group were significantly more likely to change their ranking of health priorities than the telephone survey group. Barabas (2004) used a propensity score regression approach to create comparable groups approximating what would be achieved using random assignment to evaluate the effectiveness of deliberat ive forums convened to deliberate Social Security reform. Compared with a propensity score- matched control group, deliberation participants experienced a significant increase in Social Security knowledge and were significantly more likely to change their p olicy preference (raising the limit on taxable earnings) as a result of the deliberation. In contrast, the authors conducted a parallel study, using panel survey data, to measure change in opinions on Social Security policy between two survey data collecti on time points. The respondents in this study self-reported whether or not they discussed Social Security policy. Change in opinion was compared between respondents reporting that they talked about Social Security policy issues and respondents reporting that they did not discuss Social Security policy. The results indicated that without a structured deliberative procedure, merely talking about Social Security did not result in opinion change. The pattern of results in the two studies led the authors to conc lude that deliberative processes were superior to ordinary discussion of issues in effecting opinion change. Studies Comparing Alternative Deliberative Modes to Each Other Although considerable attention is paid in the literature to the differences in imp lementation processes or characteristics of particular deliberative methods, our review identified only one study (Min, 2007) that empirically compared the outcomes of different deliberative modes (e.g., online deliberation, face -to-face deliberation, a no n-deliberating control group). It appears that the Community Forum experiment will be the second study of this kind and the first to compare more than two deliberative methods with one another. Min (2007) conducted a well -designed randomized controlled ex periment comparing face- to- face deliberation with online deliberation and a nondeliberating control group. The experiment was conducted on a college campus. The topic selected was whether or not students should be allowed to carry handguns on campus. The outcomes studied included change in opinion, issue knowledge, political efficacy, and willingness to become politically involved. Neither the face - to-face nor the online group achieved significant opinion change, possibly owing to the nature of the topic, w hich is one on which people have strong, likely intransient, opinions. On the other outcomes, compared with the control group students, students in both deliberative groups increased knowledge, political efficacy, and willingness to become politically involved. The face-to-face and online groups did not differ from each other on these outcomes. The study also compared the two deliberative groups on ratings of their deliberative experience. Here, the two groups did differ. Both groups gave high ratings to e njoying the discussion, having 67 an equal opportunity to speak, respecting differing viewpoints, and exchanging rational opinions. However, the face -to-face group scored higher on all these measures. The differences were significant for equal opportunity to speak and respect for differing opinions. So, even though the online group scored high, the face -to-face group scored higher with respect to having a positive deliberative experience. Even though the study was small (n=81), the finding that the online deliberative experience was judged less positively on items that relate to fairness is important for our planned study, considering the growing interest in online forums for deliberation. Studies Testing Alternative Features o f Deliberative Methods Any elemen t of a deliberative procedure under the evaluator's control, such as the setting, the educational materials, the technology used (e.g., in- person, webinar), or the deliberative topics, can be tested experimentally. Several studies have examined elements of deliberative methods. A study in rural Kentucky tested the utility of an innovative method for producing an issue guide for a deliberative procedure (referenced in Chapter 4). Two different layouts of the guide were produced: a traditional text -based gui de and a guide that supplemented the text with local images and narratives (photovoice). Although the groups were not randomized, the authors found that the photovoice issue guide facilitated participation in local health issues forums ( Downey et al., 2009). An analysis of transcripts suggested that participants who used the photovoice issue guide were better able to transition from broad approaches to change to specific action steps than participants in groups using the traditional issue guide. Also, they more easily identified solutions to local health issues. Farrar and colleagues (2010) tested the hypothesis that saliency of or familiarity with the issue affects variation in the effectiveness of the deliberative procedure. The authors hypothesized that deliberation of less salient issues should result in larger changes in views, whereas deliberation of more salient issues should result in smaller changes because opinions on more salient issues are more likely to be entrenched. Incorporating a randomized experiment into a Deliberative Poll, the authors charged participants with deliberating on two topics, one of high salience and one of low salience. The order of deliberating the two topics was randomly assigned. The authors' purpose was to examine what as pect of the deliberative process caused the change in views. The results confirmed the hypothesis about salience of the deliberative topic. Only minor changes occurred in participants' views on the highly salient issue, whereas the less salient issue saw v ery large changes in participants' policy preferences. Davies and Burgess (2004) qualitatively analyzed participants' interactions with experts and reported how participants' experience with and opinions of the experts affected the formation of their opini ons regarding the deliberative topic (options to address the shortage of organs for transplantation). They used Deliberative Mapping, a decision- making method that asks participants and specialists to assess the performance of the different treatment optio ns. Four panels of participants were grouped by gender and socioeconomic status. The participants afforded the most credibility and legitimacy to medical professionals. Individuals developing 68 high-technology options were viewed as less credible. A compleme ntary medicine specialist was rated as having the lowest credibility. The participants' perceptions of the experts were correlated with their change in opinions on the treatment options. Additionally, the authors reported gender differences, but no socioec onomic status differences in how decisions were formed or on participants' preferences for homogeneous groups. Women preferred homogeneous groups, while men preferred mixed- gender groups. Unlike the measures of discourse quality, the measures of knowledge and attitude change that researchers used in the literature were determined by the deliberative topics and, therefore, will not translate directly to the Community Forum experiment unless the same topics are used. The structure and framing of specific meas ures used successfully in other research (by our own team members as well as others) will be valuable for creating questions about knowledge and attitudes for the topics that are eventually selected; however, the availability of existing measures of knowle dge and attitudes will not be a criterion for the selection of topics. Changing Attitudinal Patterns Although change in knowledge and attitudes are topic -specific, changes in the pattern of responses are independent of topic and can be used generically. C onsensus , single -peakedness , meta -consensus , and adoption of a societal view are four attitudinal patterns discussed in the literature. Consensus is a group -level pattern in which attitudes coalesce around a single preference. Statistically, the development of consensus in a group may be thought of as a narrowing of the variance i n attitudes around the mean attitude. Single -peakedness ( Luskin, Fishkin, & Jowell , 2002) is an individual -level pattern in which each individual has (1) a most preferred alternative and (2) a [monotonically] decreasing preference for other alternatives as they get more distant in either direction from it (List, Luskin, Fishkin, & McLean, 2007; Farrar et al., 2010). Convergence toward single -peakedness involves movement from a bimodal distribution of attitudes (e.g., a split of participants starting at the extremes of \"strongly disagree\" and \"strongly agree\") to a more central collective stance. Meta -consensus refers to a situation in which participants agree on the values, beliefs, and preferences that are relevant to the discussion, but it does not require consensus on the deliberative issue (Niemeyer, 2007). Adoption of a societal view (DeVries et al., 2010) is an individual -level orientation to collective (Jacobs et al., 2009). These constructs are assessed as change between pre - and post -deliberation attitudinal patterns measured with self -reported participant surveys. Opinions vary about establishing consensus as a goal of deliberation. Some think that consensus minimizes dissent and improves the chances that a proposal will be adopted (List et al., 2007 ). Some believe that consensus of opinion may reflect a level of coercion or at least may limit exploration of the full range of opinions and views. In the literature we reviewed, achieving consensus is rarely an explicitly stated goal of the deliberation. Instead, evaluators determined whether the deliberation moved the participants in a common direction. Adopting a societal view is often a desired goal of deliberation. Using a randomized experiment comparing deliberation 69 participants to others who received no intervention, De Vries and colleagues (2010) reported that deliberation increased the number of participants adopting a societal view. Jacobs and colleagues (2009) reported that deliberation helped participants move from an individualistic to a collec tive perspective. In summary, measures of achieving the deliberative goals are both specific to the topic (i.e., change in knowledge and attitudes about the topic) and generic (i.e., change in attitudinal patterns among the participants). For the Communit y Forum experiment, the topic -specific measures cannot be developed until the topics are selected, but the style of knowledge and attitude questions used in other studies can inform the development of questions for studies of deliberation. Impact on Indiv idual and Societal Values, Behaviors, and Decisions The impact on individual and societal values, behaviors, and decisions includes outcomes beyond the immediate effects of the deliberative procedure. They are the most distal outcomes in terms of both time from and direct relationship to the deliberative session(s). Thus, they are challenging to measure and to attribute to the deliberation. Impact on P articipants In terms of impact on individual participants, evaluations using pre/post designs have repor ted increases in civic- mindedness and capacity (Fishkin, 2005); engagement in the political process (Fishkin & participants' sense of self -efficacy (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005), and empowerment from the perspectives of political efficacy and sol idarity enhancement (Deng &Wu, 2010). Others have investigated activism resulting from participation in deliberation. For example, Abelson and colleagues (2007) assessed anticipated post -meeting activity related to deliberation issues and surveyed participants with regard to whether they contacted public officials during the three months following the meeting (follow -up results not reported). Melville and colleagues (2005) described the deliberative approach employed by the National Issues Forums (NIF) and summarized how the NIF has affected individuals and communities. According to the review, NIF participants broadened their outlooks, improved their listening skills, enhanced their confidence that their opinion matters, changed their conversation habits ( to more egalitarian), defined their self -interests more broadly, and moved beyond superficial preferences to considered public judgment. Community -level impacts also were reported for communities that regularly hold forums. It appears that deliberating bec omes a civic habit and transforms the way members of the public and officeholders practice politics. These studies provide evidence that deliberation increases the inclination toward democratic involvement in the short term; however, there is little empir ical support for longer term impact on democratic involvement. Jacobs and colleagues (2009) conducted a cross -sectional survey (n=1501) to investigate the association between taking part in deliberative procedures and 70 subsequent civic involvement (communit y service, volunteer work). The study found that in addition to level of education and socio- economic status, taking part in deliberative activities was significantly associated with respondents' reports of civic participation after their deliberative experience. The regression models employed accounted for a number of potentially confounding effects (i.e., demographic characteristics, political knowledge, political interest, and political efficacy). Further, the respondents attributed higher levels of civi c involvement to their experience in deliberative activities. The study supports the notion that participation in deliberative activities increases civic involvement; however, the cross -sectional nature of the survey prohibits causal links and does not rul e out selection bias with regard to differences in individuals who \"selected\" to take part in deliberative activities and those who did not. In a longitudinal investigation with a non- randomized comparison group, Jacobs and colleagues (2009) investigated whether participation in a deliberative activity increased knowledge and perceived salience (importance of the topic to the individual) of the deliberative topic and anticipated future political involvement. The study conducted pre - and post - surveys with three groups of citizens \u2014attendees of a deliberative procedure, individuals who were invited but did not attend, and a random sample of individuals from the community \u2014and compared change in salience, knowledge, and anticipated involvement. Individuals who participated in the deliberative activity significantly increased in both salience and knowledge of the deliberative topic compared with invitees and nonattendees. Participation did not increase anticipated future involvement in political activities becaus e attendees reported very high levels of involvement to begin with. This study provides strong evidence of the effect of deliberation on salience and knowledge; however, the findings on anticipated political participation as a result of deliberation may re flect inadequacies in the representativeness of participants in the deliberative methods. That is, participants in the deliberative activities had higher levels of political involvement to start with compared with a random sample of citizens. Other lines of research inform our understanding of what particular aspects of deliberation may mediate change in participants. They address the question of how deliberation effects change in individuals. Gastil (2004) conducted a quasi -experimental study designed to investigate whether a deliberative procedure incorporated into a civic education course affected students' political conversation networks or their conversational behavior. Students enrolled in basic adult literacy (n=120) courses across the United States took part in the study. They enrolled in an adult literacy course without knowing what instructional method would be employed. Students enrolling in the \"treatment\" classes had one or more class sessions that used a NIF -style deliberation on a current public policy issue. Students in the control classes received standard instruction. At the conclusion of the class, students completed a survey measuring their political conversation habits. Compared with controls, NIF participants had significantly lower self -efficacy, defined as one's perception that he or she can perform political actions competently. However, participation in NIF was significantly positively correlated with the demographic and ideological diversity of participants' conversation networks and negatively correlated with conversational dominance. 71 The authors did not offer an explanation for the apparent negative effect on self -efficacy. The finding could be spurious or a result of having noncomparable groups. However, it highlights the importanc e of considering the potential negative effects of deliberation on participants' feelings about their civic involvement or civic capacity. For example, raising people's awareness of an issue without providing a real avenue for effecting change on the issue could conceivably result in feelings of frustration or disenfranchisement because of perceived powerlessness to affect change. In a noncomparative design, Gastil (2004) investigated whether certain learning -related process elements of a deliberative sess ion\u2014verbal instructions before and after the session (reading the pre-forum issue book and hearing relevant, reinforcing statements from the moderator during the session), democratic conversation modeled by the moderator or other participants, and direct enactment of democratic conversation \u2014were correlated with cognitive or behavioral changes in participants of a NIF deliberative session. From self -report surveys completed after the deliberative procedure, he found that post -forum conversation behaviors (not specified) were significantly correlated with verbal instructions and even more strongly correlated with moderator and group behavior modeling. Impact on S ociety At the societal level, case studies have reported on the specific laws, policies, or pract ices that were affected by the results of deliberative procedures (Abelson et al., 2007; Einsiedel, Jelsoe, & Breck, 2001; Ozanne et al., 2009). Abelson and colleagues (2007) reported on the impact of deliberative procedures carried out in multiple locatio ns in Canada and found mixed results with respect to implementation of recommendations derived from deliberations: In Quebec, the \"recommended decision\" that resulted from the consultation was accepted and implemented by the regional health authority within the study's follow -up period. In the Ontario and Nova Scotia sites, reports on the consultation outcomes were presented to their respective boards but no discernible actions were identified in the analysis of organizational documents during the study's follow -up period. In Alberta, the public consultation outcomes served as a catalyst to advance on- going initiatives and to create some new ones as depicted by presentations to the Regional Health Advisory (RHA) board, and documented follow -up activities as sessed the impact of a deliberative procedure on decision- makers. ( Einsiedel and colleagues (2001) reported on the impact of a Consensus Conference on the use and labeling of genetically modified foods in a cross -national analysis of three consensus conferences in Denmark, Canada, and Australia. None of the three conferences had a direct influence on government regulation. In Canada, the results of the conference were summarized in a report that was sent to seven federal ministries supervising biotechnology regulation. Policymakers were involved in the conference and circu lated the final report to their individual ministries. Although a direct link to the conference cannot be drawn, food producers were p. 2122) 72 pressured to implement standard labeling on genetically modified and non- genetically modified foods as a result of the inte nse media coverage of the report's findings. Rowe and colleagues (2008) reported on the 2003 GM Nation? public debate, a large -scale U.K. government public engagement exercise designed to solicit public input on genetically modified (GM) crops: The U.K. government position that subsequently emerged has been to allow GM crops to be grown commercially after a case -by-case analysis, and this seems to have been largely influenced by legal commitments arising from membership of the European Union. From this per spective, the views of participants do not seem to have had a great or immediate effect on policy \u2014as suspected by a considerable number of the skeptical respondents (p. 437-8). This experience is an example of legislative or regulatory commitments overriding public deliberation, which recommended a course of action in conflict with legal requirements. As the last example illustrates, it is challenging to attribute a change in law and policy to a specific deliberation because so many other uncontrolled factors affect the final policy decision. Thus, surveying the decision- makers about their intentions to act as a result of deliberation has been used as a more measurable proxy. Abelson and colleagues (2007) assessed the impact of a deliberative procedure on de cision -makers by surveying them about the criteria they would use to judge if the procedure was successful and how they intended to use the results of the deliberation. They reported that: Decision -maker perspectives on evaluation...varied. When asked how they would determine whether the consultation process had been successful, a range of evaluation criteria were listed that emphasized either procedural (e.g., ensuring good, open discussion with multiple participants; creating a synergy among participants; obtaining good quality input; legitimizing a decision- making process) or outcome (e.g., participant satisfaction; input used in RHA decision making; method used again) elements. The different hopes, apprehensions and evaluation criteria these decision maker s shared at different points throughout the study reveal a varied set of expectations that, combined with other elements, signal the vulnerability of the generic public participation approach at the local level. (p. 2122) Abelson and colleagues (2007) al so reported that the decision- makers did not universally support the use of deliberative methods or the results of public deliberation. The mixed findings underscore the importance of considering the role and intent of decision- makers throughout the design of deliberative procedures. . Beyond the impact on policy, Thurston and colleagues (2005) recommended a theoretical framework that connects public engagement to outcomes that would be affected by a policy or change resulting from deliberation (e.g., public participation improves policy decisions and 73 results in improved health outcomes). While difficult to measure, this framework incorporates the ultimate goal of public engagement: to improve health (or other outcomes) by influencing policy. Conclusions Regarding Evaluation We reviewed the literature on evaluating deliberation to inform our choices of research questions, research design, and measures. In the unduplicated counts presented in Exhibit 8.2, we see that 6 of the relevant articles identified fall into the methodolo gical category of nonrandomized comparisons of alternative deliberative modes or features of modes using pre/post designs. These quasi -experiments include studies comparing deliberative modes with each other or with a non- deliberative comparison group, or comparing one feature of a deliberative mode with an alternative feature. Another 4 studies used randomized experiments for the same purpose. The remaining 18 studies were classified as case studies, which used pre- to post -intervention changes (15) or pos t-intervention measures only (3) to measure the effect of deliberation or describe the characteristics of the deliberation. The last two methods categories in Exhibit 8.2\u2014nonrandomized and randomized comparisons \u2014are the most methodologically rigorous, but all these studies have value for the Community Forum experiment because they identify measures that have been used successfully to demonstrate the effects of deliberation. Nevertheless, our remaining comments focus on the 6 nonrandomized and 4 randomized experiments in the last two categories because they tell us the most about how to conduct the Community Forum experiment. All 6 of the nonrandomized studies analyzed the effect of deliberation on participants' knowledge, attitudes, or pattern of attitudes. Two of these studies looked at the impact of deliberation on participant or societal behavior, one studied the effect on quality of discourse, and one reported on implementation. All showed favorable effects of deliberation or significant differences betw een alternative features. All these studies used the classic nonequivalent control group or difference -in-difference design, in which pre/post changes in two groups are compared to see whether the changes in one group differ statistically from the changes in the other group. Short of nonrandomized time -series designs, this design exhibits the fewest threats to validity because it controls fairly well for competing and confounding explanations from observed factors. None of these studies attempted to control for unobserved differences between the comparison groups \u2014selection bias \u2014that could have influenced the observed effects. Thus, selection bias remains an uncontrolled threat. All 4 of the randomized experiments looked at the effect of deliberation or alter native features of deliberation on participant knowledge, attitudes, and patterns of attitude. Two also studied the effect on quality of discourse and 1 on behavior. We assume that these are the least biased studies because random assignment to groups shou ld control unobserved selection bias. 74 We also examined outcomes based on the type of deliberative method or task and found no variation in findings based on either deliberative methods or tasks. The two major conclusions we draw from Exhibit 8.2 are that (1) few randomized experiments of deliberation or its alternatives have been conducted and (2) the well -designed comparative studies of deliberation, whether randomized or nonrandomized, focus on change in participant knowledge, attitudes, and patterns of attitudes as the effects of interest. The value of randomization in controlling for selection bias and the small number of randomized experiments reported in the literature argue forcefully for using a randomized design for the Community Forum study of de liberation. Min (2007) has reported such an experiment, using two alternative deliberative modes, which varied mainly on face -to-face versus online deliberation. Exhibit 8.3 summarizes the kinds of research questions and measures that were used in the studies counted in Exhibit 8.2, by linking the construct measured to the individual study. The most valuable aspect of Exhibit 8.3 is the linkage it makes between the four measurement domains \u2014procedural characteristics, quality of discourse, achievement of deliberation goals for knowledge and attitudinal change, and impact on participant and societal values, behavior, and decisions; the constructs used to represent each domain; and the methods used by the investigators to collect the data. This list of constru cts will be the starting point for our discussions about which constructs to measure in the Community Forum experiment. Ideally, we would also list the specific measures and scales that were used to represent these constructs by name (e.g., the SF -12). However, the literature does not report the names of the measures that were used, so we are left to believe that investigators usually developed their own questions, measures, and scales rather than use established measures. Nevertheless, several authors reported the individual survey items or observational indicators they used in their studies, so we have substantial fine detail about items that we need to develop our instruments. The list of all the individual items and indicators reported is too long to include in the body of this section. Thus, we have included a table listing them as an appendix (see Appendix H). 75 Exhibit 8.3.

Critical C omponents T o Consider in Designing and I mplementing D eliberative P rocesses Our literature review was driven by the practical need to design and implement a deliberative demonstration\u2014an empirical study of public deliberation that will inform future strateg ies to obtain public input on CER -related questions. Accordingly, we paid careful attention to the design and implementation features of deliberative processes described in the articles abstracted. This section presents the key decisions involved in delibe rative processes, summarizes the results of the literatures, and highlights trade -offs to consider. Necessary Conditions for P ublic Deliberation Although there is tremendous variety in deliberative methods and approaches, the literature reveals several fun damental conditions needed to foster successful public deliberation: Use of accurate, unbiased information to educate the participants and inform the deliberation (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005) Conscientiousness, which refers to the extent to which participants engage in the thoughtful exchange of their positions and rely on reason- giving (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009) Inclusion of diverse identities and perspectives in the deliberative process (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009) Complet eness of the process to ensure that the diversity of perspectives are given voice and consideration through equal opportunities to participate and that the proffered arguments are fully answered (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009) These four conditions undergird implementation considerations such as recruitment strategies, use of educational materials and experts, and facilitation. Key Implementation Considerations f or Public Deliberation All the deliberative methods share certain elements \u2014the b uilding blocks that together make up the full design of the intervention. These elements include the organizational details (sponsor, funder), the length of the deliberative process (hours/days/weeks), the framing of the question, the study populations, the recruitment strategies, the educational materials, the use of experts, and the role of the facilitator. (The evaluation processes are also key components as discussed in the previous section.) These components also speak to the aspects of deliberation that can undermine or inhibit successful deliberation. Thus, based on this literature review, we provide a 79 detailed list of these components to inform the design and implementation of deliberative processes. Sponsor Sponsoring organizations provide the funding for the deliberative project. Conveners develop (and usually conduct) the public deliberation project; sometimes, sponsors and conveners are one and the same. In the United States , most project sponsors of health care deliberative topics are universiti es, nonprofit organizations, and local government entities (Exhibit 7.1). Sponsors bring to the deliberative process their own intentions, motivations, and goals for seeking public input on a topic. These goals are closely related to the topic selection, f raming, and outcomes that are measured and evaluated. Deliberative Topic As discussed in Chapter 3, topics appropriate for public deliberation involve a social issue that evokes values, ethics, and principles; is salient to the public; has the potential for common ground; presents an opportunity for participants to make a real, tangible impact on policy in a reasonable timeframe; and has the attention of policymakers. Study Populations As discussed in Chapter 8, trade -offs exist with each design decisi on, and one of the most crucial design choices is the study population. The purposes of deliberation should inform the definition and recruitment of the study population (Longstaff & Burgess, 2010). Group Composition: Homogeneous or H eterogeneous As has been discussed in Chapter 3, deliberative democracy, the foundation for public deliberation, suggests that deliberation on an issue should include the diverse members of the public, particularly those individuals on whom the issue will have an impact, to g enerate new ideas and understanding of the issue. This process in turn informs and bolsters public policymaking and decision- making. Thus, there are great advantages to having a truly heterogeneous group that reflects the diversity of a population and supports the goals of public deliberation\u2014it is in heterogeneous groups that 80 participants have the opportunity to learn from perspectives they might not otherwise hear or openly receive. Indeed, heterogeneous groups enable members of the majority to hear the perspective of members of minority groups; this exchange is essential for deliberative democracy to achieve its purposes (Kohn, 2000; Jacobs et al., 2009). Because the intent of heterogeneous groups is to expose individuals to views and experiences unlike their own, deliberation can be transformative as participants are exposed to the diversity of others' experiences and worldviews; through this exposure, participants gain a larger sense of community (Gutmann & Thompson, 2004; Fishkin, 2009). Heterogeneous groups present two concerns: (1) dominance, as identified by Marion Young and Lynne Sanders, among others, and (2) polarization, as i dentified by Cass Sunstein (Fishkin, 2009). Dominance is likely to occur when conveners assume an atmosphere of equality and equal participation in the deliberative process within the context of a society characterized by inequality \u2014thus, the ability of individuals from traditionally underserved groups to fully articulate and participate in the deliberation in a manner that rivals the members of the majority group is questionable; the majority group members may dominate the discussion because of their ease of conversation, their confidence, and the deference given to them by others in the group (Fishkin, 2009). Polarization occurs when a group with pre -deliberation tendencies toward one side of an issue or a dilemma moves to more extreme positions through th e deliberative process (Fishkin, 2009; Siu, 2008). This gravitation emerges from both the tendency of the group to offer arguments that reinforce the group's position and the social comparison in which members of the group who do not feel the same way will feel social pressure to join in the group's direction (Fishkin, 2009). Much of the literature that has fostered these concerns rests on jury studies, and Fishkin (2009) points out that deliberative processes that do not require consensus may not involve the same pressures. There is some empirical evidence that dominance may be mitigated in heterogeneous groups and that minority groups or traditionally underserved groups will participate as often as or more often than members of majority groups (Fishkin, 2009). Further, there are ways to mitigate dominance and polarization. Providing balanced educational materials prior to the deliberation requires that participants not rely only on their predeliberation conceptions and positions, offers the opportunity to correct misinformation, and provides an opportunity for participants to have a basic shared starting point for discussion (Siu, 2008). Facilitation can also serve to reduce dominance and polarization by ensuring that there are equal opportunities to parti cipate and that no one participant can dominate the discussion (Siu, 2008). Thus, whereas it is possible for heterogeneous groups to clearly reveal the different viewpoints of minority participants, it requires a very careful structuring of the deliberativ e process and a highly skilled facilitator to make sure that all voices are heard (facilitation is discussed in more detail below; Jacobs et al., 2009; Lenaghan, 1999; Fishkin & Farrar, 2005). Even then, it can be 81 difficult for the minority voice to be expressed or heard when its opinion is contradictory to that of the majority (Kohn, 2000; Jacobs et al., 2009). Alternatively, homogeneous groups may support group cohesion and reduce the presence of social power dynamics, support traditional minority perspe ctives, and remove tensions introduced by heterogeneous groups (McKie, Shrimpton, Richardson, & Hurwurth, 2009). For example, in a 2006 California two- phase project, 800 participants in small groups of 10 to 12 insured individuals first designed a \"basic benefits package\" with a computer simulation program (Sacramento Healthcare Decisions, 2006). In a second phase, homogeneous groups of uninsured individuals were convened (Ginsburg & Glasmire, 2007). A comparison of the results of the deliberative processes showed notable differences in the coverage plan choices. It is unlikely that these differences would have been visible if the sessions had only been heterogeneous, so having a subset of homogeneous groups within a larger study may provide important insights and serve as a comparator for the heterogeneous groups to ascertain that all perspectives are being heard. The extent to which homogeneous groups reinforce the goals of public deliberation, however, remains uncertain. Further, how well the results of de liberative processes with homogeneous groups would be received by members of the public whose identity does not align with that of the homogeneous group is also unknown and warrants investigation. Perspectives of P atients Versus Citizens In addition to demographic characteristics and within the context of deliberation about health care, participants in deliberative processes can also be distinguished on the basis of the perspective they bring to the deliberative process as either \"consumer\" or \"citizen.\" The \"consumer\" lens is that of patient, family member of a patient, or other patient advocate recruited into a deliberative process specifically to represent this perspective. They wear the hat of health care consumer, bringing vested interests related to their condition, circumstances, or caregiver status. This perspective is in contrast to the \"citizen\" or \"member of the public\" lens, meaning participants consider not only their personal experiences but also their role in society and how they think societ y should respond to the deliberative issue. When recruited as consumers, participants are asked to focus on their personal experiences and needs. When recruited as members of the public, they are asked to represent themselves as well as others in the wider community, for example, by assuming the role of social decision- maker (Gold et al., 2007). This distinction is important to understand and make in the deliberative process. It is also important to understand the lens through which participants make argum ents or declare their positions. Lenaghan (1999) states that if the question is specific to patients, such as how to improve service delivery for those with back pain, users of these services should be sought; they are the affected population. Alternativel y, if the question is broader, for example, priority setting for funding for a range of health care services that include back pain services, seeking general public input is more appropriate because this question evokes a societal perspective and myriad values, ethics, and preferences. The key informants interviewed to inform the Community Forum 82 literature review indicated that reinforcing the role of participants as citizens or members of the public, rather than as patients or consumers, is essential to cr eating an environment that supports a communal sense of responsibility rather than a focus on the individual. Recruitment Strategies Few studies provided detail on recruitment methods and their reasoning for employing one method over another. Nevertheless , the literature indicates four primary considerations for recruitment pertaining to the need to specify (1) the study population, (2) recruitment methods, (3) participant screening, and (4) incentives. The recruitment strategy should be informed by the goals of the deliberation and the values of sponsors. For example, Longstaff and Burgess (2010), who sought to recruit a representative sample to deliberate on the issue of biobanks, established key objectives for the deliberative process, two of which direc tly informed their recruitment strategies: (1) \"understanding diverse views\" and (2) including \"diverse discursive styles and experiences\" (p. 216). Random Selection Random selection, one of the most common recruitment methods used in public deliberation, is often stratified by social and demographic categories, such as gender, age, social class, and geographic location (Davies et al., 2005). In this way, individuals are selected to \"represent\" the perspectives and interests of each stratified group in an attempt to reflect the broader composition of society (p. 603). Although studies state that using random selection can reflect the wider population, random selection often does not achieve representation of hard- to-reach groups (Longstaff & Burgess, 2010; Davies et al., 2005; Gregory et al., 2008). Davies and colleagues (2005) acknowledge that \"There is a challenge of getting marginalized communities involved in deliberative processes\" (p. 352). Even if financial incentives are provided to make participati on more appealing, there are many reasons, such as having lower income, having less education, or being non- English speaking and/or ethnically diverse, that minority populations are unlikely to commit time to a deliberative process. For one, the issues bei ng discussed may not be relevant to their everyday lives. Jacobs and colleagues (2009) found that the deliberative topic has a great deal to do with participants' willingness to participate in deliberation. Second, competing time demands may preclude parti cipation in deliberative processes that often require significant time investments. Third, minority populations may have a general distrust of the sponsoring organization and its motives. As an example, the Western Australian Electoral Commission recruited but did not obtain demographically and attitudinally representative participation; members of the working class (with less job and time flexibility) were underrepresented (Gregory et al., 2008). In another example, when recruitment methods were being sele cted for representation in public deliberation on the ethics of biobanks, random digit dialing to \"recruit a small sample with only basic filters failed to meet the team's objective to include diverse discursive styles and experiences\" 83 (Longstaff & Burgess , 2010, p. 6). Thus, the recruitment strategy must define diversity and develop a recruitment strategy that could achieve this diversity. Self-Selection Self-selection represents a pragmatic approach to recruitment, in that all individuals who volunteer to take part in a process are included as participants, although they could be further required to meet certain inclusion criteria to participate in the deliberative process (Davies et al., 2005). This approach generates a non- probabilistic sample of the population that may not accurately represent the broader population. It may be perceived as \"inclusionary\" rather than a selection process (Davies et al., 2005, p. 64). For example, recruitment through advertising (e.g., through newspaper ads) for interested participants and with identifiable groups tends relies on self-selection, which means that the sample who participates may not represent the wider population, which includes those individuals who either did not see the recruitment ads or were not intereste d in participating. The NICE Citizens' Council in Great Britain recruited members first by advertising in newspapers and later by approaching people at shopping malls, resulting in a different composition of participants (Sarah Garner, NICE, personal communication). This approach may ensure a more invested or committed group of participants, which is particularly important when the commitment to public deliberation is ongoing. Disproportionately Affected In contrast to recruiting a representative general po pulation sample, it may be easier to identify and recruit participants for studies with selection criteria that target participants who are particularly affected by the deliberative issue. For example, a deliberative project to study the caregivers' reacti ons to surrogate decision- making for patients with Alzheimer's' disease recruited 212 participants with relative ease, using mailing lists from local programs serving the Alzheimer's population, website advertising, and a local newsletter (De Vries et al., 2010). Of these volunteers, 73 percent actually attended the deliberative session. Similar approaches have been used in other projects as well. In a study conducted in Germany and Israel, participants affected by genetic diseases were recruited from self -help and support organizations (Raz & Schicktanz, 2009). In a study that sought to include marginalized youth ages 16-19, researchers relied on methods such as flyers and youth outreach organizations (Iredale et al., 2006). As discussed above, approaches s uch as flyers or ads rely on self -selection; however, targeting the locations or organizations associated with members of disproportionately affected populations may be a productive strategy. Hard -To-Reach Populations Studies that sought one or more predef ined groups (e.g., ethnically diverse, women only) often employed professional recruitment firms, which can conduct more complex screening for a diverse range of interests and backgrounds. Using a professional recruitment firm also separates participant re cruitment from the research body, \"proving vital to the perception of legitimacy of the process\" (Lenaghan, 1999, p. 55), an important advantage of this recruitment approach. 84 Some projects, however, have successfully recruited hard- to-reach populations wi thout using professional recruitment firms. For example, Sacramento Healthcare Decisions (SHD) conducted a 2004 project with adult, disabled Medicaid beneficiaries in California that aimed to learn how Medicaid enrollees would redesign their benefits if st ate budgets required reductions (Ginsburg & Glasmire, 2004). Recruitment challenges included finding participants who could use a computer and participate in a prioritization process. To achieve its goal of 12 sessions statewide, SHD contacted Independent Living Centers (ILCs) because many of their members met the project criteria. The ILCs agreed to use their centers as the meeting place and were paid a per - person recruitment fee. The participants also received an incentive, a meal, and additional supports such as transportation or childcare. The participants were contacted by the ILC, a known entity for prospective participants, not by SHD. The recruitment process was successful, with few no -shows, which may be explained by (1) he ILCs' support of this project, (2) the location of the meeting in familiar territory, and (3) the timeliness of the topic to a current public policy issue (the state was considering reducing benefits). A similar approach was used by SHD in another project where low -income and low -education participants were recruited (Ginsburg & Glasmire, 2007). SHD contacted a local homeless shelter with a variety of social service programs. The shelter staff did the recruitment, and the session was held at its facility. Although the shelter and the participants were compensated for their time, the shelter also regarded this as an educational exercise that would benefit its clients by encouraging their sense of being participating members of the community. Thus, partnering with community -based org anizations may be an important strategy for both reaching hard- to- reach populations and strengthening their support systems. One of our key informants mentioned her successful recruitment of a target group of low -income residents in inner city Washington, D.C., noting that a key factor in her recruitment success was that recruiters were known and trusted members of the community. Other factors in the success included holding meetings in locations well known to the participants and having a facilitator from the same background as the participants. In many cases, a multipronged recruitment strategy has been employed, which incorporates random selection with more targeted efforts to ensure that certain populations are represented. As an example, Gregory and colleagues (2008) describe the recruitment method conducted by the Western Australian Electoral Commission. This recruitment formula included in equal proportions (1) participants who responded to invitations sent to a random sample of residents, (2) parti cipants who responded to invitations to a broad range of relevant stakeholders, and (3) participants who responded to broadly placed advertisements. Exhibit 9.1 provides additional detail about various example study recruitment procedures to give a samplin g of recruitment techniques currently in practice. 85 Exhibit 9.1. Recruitment strategies described in sampling of reviewed studies Study Recruited Method Raz & Schicktanz, 2009 35 people in Israel, 85 in Germany; a mix of general population and those affected by genetic disease The general public was recruited through flyers and ads in urban public places. Those affected by genetic diseases were recruited from self -help and sup port organizations. Partridge et al., 2009 65 participants from the general public selected on the basis of one-to-one interview criteria Posters, print media, snowballing, and targeted recruitment at a local center on aging were used. Abelson et al., 2007 Politically and socially active local citizens Participants were recruited through local community organizations on the basis of a stratified random sampling process. Davies & Burgess, 2004 34 citizens A specialist recruitment agency used a question naire for stratified sampling. Stakeholder review of potential participants and snowballing were used. Longstaff & Burgess, 2010 Randomly selected participants from 5 health regions in the Canadian provinces and a sample group of citizens to enhance diversity Project used random digit dialing based on the 2001 Canadian Census, which included demographic stratification for ethnicity, religion, region, and disability. de Cock Buning et al., 2008 47 members of the general public Panel members were invi ted through informal contacts, sport club, and social organizations. Lenaghan, 1999 16 citizens, with no screening criteria used Census and other demographic data, containing a breakdown of social class, age, gender, ethnic background, and housing tenure, were used. Door -to-door recruiters were used to obtain a jury that matched the relevant profiles. A total of 2,000 letters were sent out to randomly selected residents. Participant Screening Screening participants can serve a number of purposes, including avoiding like -minded citizens, participants with extreme views, or stakeholders \"who self -consciously represent some particular identity or interest group in society\" (von Lieres & Kahane, 2006, p. 140). By screening for participants who are uncommitted with respect to the issues, deliberation will not be restricted by strong or dominant positions (Longstaff & Burgess, 2010). Similarly, competency can be screened for if the deliberation is com plex and requires a level of basic understanding from the outset. Gold and colleagues (2007) recruited participants from the New York County jury pool, obtaining a diverse cross section of the public. People who were called to jury duty and were waiting to be empanelled were solicited with a brief description of the project and the requirements of participation. Individuals who had self -identified as interested were then screened in the jury waiting room through a survey asking for demographic information, health status, and insurance information. Numeracy was also assessed by asking people to solve three simple mathematical problems, because the deliberative topic involved cost -effectiveness analysis. Thirty -five individuals were excluded from the study on the basis of not being able to 86 answer an arithmetic question. Final selection was based on education, health status, health insurance, and availability. Participation Incentives Participation in deliberative forums is often compensated with cash, debit c ards, or other financial inducements. Although the amount may be nominal, participants tend to place more value on the money's symbolic meaning than the dollar value itself (Hendriks, 2005). Paying individuals for their time is often a way to motivate individuals to participate. However, participants are more committed and engaged when they know their voice will affect policy. Financial incentives provide individuals with a sign that their contribution is valued by society and the project is a serious polit ical undertaking (Hendriks, 2005). Although money can influence participation, many individuals voluntarily contribute their time when they know that their input will influence services such as health care or social services. In a study on public perceptio n of prenatal genetic testing, all participants were self -selected and volunteered their time with only travel reimbursement; they were engaged because they knew that the Ministry of Health in the Netherlands was coordinating the deliberation and that thei r voices would help transform policy on bioethics (de Cock Buning et al., 2008). In the absence of an obvious organization that can respond or listen to participants' views, individuals can have a negative experience in public deliberative processes with o r without financial incentives (Lenaghan, 1999). It is important to keep in mind that hard -to-reach participants are more likely to respond to a financial incentive, and it is na\u00efve to assume that goodwill and a receptive policymaker will be enough to mot ivate the underserved to participate. Thus, including a financial incentive may be necessary to secure their participation. However, a key consideration is to the extent to which financial incentives serve as the primary motivator for participation and how this motivation will affect participants' level of engagement. Expectation -Setting and Preparation An important part of initiating the deliberative sessions is setting expectations with participants regarding how the deliberative process will proceed, the ir role in the process, and the responsibilities of the conveners to the participants. Further, some evidence indicates that obtaining quality public input starts with assuring participants that their voice will be heard and could influence policy or other decisions related to the deliberative topic (Carson & Hartz -Karp, 2005). As part of setting expectations, clarity regarding the participants' role and tasks is also key, so that they understand what is being asked of them (DeStefano, 2010). 87 Consensus An aspect of the deliberative purpose is consensus \u2014whether or not participants will be asked to come to an agreement on the issue, an appropriate course of action, or some set of recommendations. Depending on the deliberative topic and methods, achieving cons ensus among the participants varies in importance to project planners. In the literature, we found that even those planners or conveners who regarded consensus as an important goal did not want this to interfere with open, uninhibited discussion. In partic ular, they were aware of the need to identify and respect minority views. In interviews with key informants, the subject of consensus evoked strong opinions because most informants thought that it was reasonable to pursue but not to the extent of requirin g it, which may compromise the diversity of views represented. These researchers seemed more comfortable with concepts such as reaching \"tentative working agreements\" and that with consensus it is \"reasonable to inquire but unproductive to insist.\" One inf ormant noted that it was particularly useful to understand the reasons a minority of the participants were not convinced about a decision when others were. Thus, if consensus is desired or a requirement, careful consideration of minority or dissenting view s is important to fully understanding how the public feels about the issue \u2014and what potential alternative positions exist. Role of Participants Participants should display \"conscientiousness\" by actively listening with respect to others, considering all p erspectives, and putting forth a sincere effort to reason through the deliberative process (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005; Melville et al., 2005; DeVries et al., 2010). In an analysis of the inclusion of Aboriginal people in deliberations regarding health policy issues in Canada as part of the Romanow Commission, von Lieres and Kahane (2006) identified the following design features related to participants' roles that affected the outcomes of the process. First, the extent to which the deliberative process is refl exive, meaning that participants have the opportunity to define their participation through activities such as agenda setting, affected the outcomes. Second, the extent to which participants have a say in the process from the beginning to the end \u2014that part icipation is recursive \u2014also affects outcomes. Finally, the use of separate spaces for members of marginalized groups to be able to reflect on the dynamics of the group \u2014including power, exclusion, language, and so on\u2014is important; in this space, they can co nsider the common agenda of the participants. Separate spaces could entail parallel deliberative processes or opportunities to caucus within heterogeneous deliberations. Thus, these components can help bolster the engagement of participants in the delibera tion and support the inclusion of diverse perspectives. 88 Information Component ( Educational Materials and U se of Experts) Educational Materials As mentioned above, the information component is a necessary condition for public deliberation. Public deliberation can be significantly enhanced by infusing high- quality information into the process through educational materials, expert testimony, and case studies (Abelson, Forest et al., 2003; Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002). Providing easy -to-understand, nontechnical background information and tailored in- depth knowledge (through experts) can enhance participation in the deliberative process (Church et al., 2002; de Cock Buning et al., 2008; Burgess, 2010; Bryan, Sofaer, Siegelberg, & G old, 2009). Gold and colleagues (2007) asked participants to discuss complex health care costs, cost - effectiveness analysis, and ethical issues; because of the complexity and breadth of the topic, participants experienced an extensive educational process t hat included (1) a simplified overview of cost -effectiveness analysis; (2) nontechnical descriptions of 14 conditions and their associated treatments; (3) more in -depth knowledge provided through presentation and case studies about cost-effectiveness ratio s for commonly used services such as cervical cancer screening; and (4) internationally comparative information on life expectancy, mortality outcomes, and insurance rates. Providing participants with a common knowledge base and building on this base ensur es that \"members of the public can readily engage (in) these discussions and are eager to think about the priorities they hold for health care coverage\" (p.70). In another study, participants were asked to identify key values that should guide a biobank i n British Columbia (Longstaff & Burgess, 2010). In the first weekend, participants were introduced to the subject of biobanks through expert and stakeholder presentations; a graphic illustration of biobanks and their connection to research, health care, and communities; an annotated bibliography summarizing relevant articles and media reports; and full articles available on a private website. During the second weekend, after participants were given the opportunity to read the information, pose questions, and obtain online answers (from experts, as coordinated and posted by a dedicated researcher), they deliberated on the topic in small groups to allow everyone to contribute. In both of these examples, participants were provided with high- quality, in -depth knowledge on a subject with which they previously had no experience. Often background or briefing materials are presented days or weeks before the deliberation, which allows participants the opportunity to digest and scrutinize complex and values -laden issu es. In the case of citizens' juries, Lenaghan (1999, p. 54) remarks that \"it is vital the jurors have the opportunity to think through the consequences of the decisions which they have been asked to make.\" Thus, the provision of educational materials in ad vance of the deliberative event is an important consideration. 89 To move from abstract theory to practice, case studies or vignettes can be used to illustrate the need to make trade- offs between competing values (Lenaghan, 1999). Real or imagined scenarios that encourage them to consider others' situations are often pre sented to participants (Raz & Schicktanz, de Cock Buning et al., 2008; Scully, Banks, & Shakespeare, 2006). Detailed, concrete scenarios provide social and cultural narratives that allow participants to move beyond the science. These narratives allow parti cipants to consider new information they would need to make a judgment and the reasons and motives of others (Raz & Schicktanz, 2009). As can be seen in Exhibit 9.2, many public deliberation events prepared participants to engage in deliberation by providing briefing materials, often in combination with more in -depth information, terminology, summaries, and other descriptions.

Many of the studies reviewed (Parkin & Paul, 2011; Secko et al., 2009; Gregory 2008; de Cock Buning et al., 2008; Hendriks, 2005) stressed the importance of presenting diverse viewpoints in order to be as neutral and scientific as possible and to not bias the results. By providing an array of expert or advocate perspectives, participants have the opportunity to gain common knowledge, hear a range of viewpoints, and question the experts, which enhances engagement in the issue (Dryz ek 92 & Tucker, 2008). Further, learning of the positions of experts or advocates may help participants think about alternative options (Arvai, 2003). Vatn (2009) recommends using experts with different views in order to increase the \"capacity of the deliberative process to capture what may be at stake\" (p. 68). However, the author warns that experts vary greatly in their ability to \"present clear messages and build trust\" with public participants (p. 68). It is also the case that a powerful expert for a parti cular point of view can influence participants unduly (Lenaghan, 1999). Some studies recommend establishing an advisory council to oversee materials development and expert testimonies; the inclusion of an advisory council is an inherent component of citize ns' juries. The advisory council should comprise all key stakeholders to ensure that all sides of an argument are presented fairly (de Cock Buning et al., 2008; Lenaghan, 1999). Mullen (2008) presented an alternative argument for using experts. If a group of citizens deliberate only by themselves, their conclusions may not sufficiently consider the technical aspects of the topic. Consequently, the decision may be attacked by others as insufficiently informed, thus weakening the decision's defensibility. The inclusion of experts ensures that participants have sufficient technical understanding and that their conclusions will be informative to target audiences, such as members of the scientific community. Further, experts are considered essential if the deliberative topic requires an understanding of scientific, technical, or theoretical information that the average member of the public might not have prior to participation in deliberation. Although many deliberative projects do not use experts directly in the sessions, they invariably use them in developing the content of discussion guides and the other tools used to prompt discussion, debate, and decisions. At a minimum, project advisory committees generally provide the range of perspectives \u2014philosophical and technical \u2014needed to ensure that the material is balanced, complete, and accessible to a lay audience. Framing the Deliberative Question The goal of framing is to translate the overarching question or purpose motivating public deliberation into a common, g rounded issue about which the public feels capable to deliberate. In essence, framing is a purposeful process that sets the stage for how the deliberative process will be conducted, including the step- by-step work of the facilitator and the participants in deliberation. Framing also considers the political landscape. For topics that are particularly controversial, framing takes on special importance. The process of framing must be consistent with the principles inherent in legitimate deliberation, as listed under Necessary Conditions for Public Deliberation above. The use of framing has been studied in media and political contexts (Callaghan & Schnell, 2005). Although the framing in public deliberation is not analogous to the framing used in media 93 or politi cs, it is important to understand what frames exist in the environmental context and how to approach framing an issue. Foremost, framing serves as a mechanism to \"prime\" members of the public, because \"frames subtly and often unconsciously direct which bel iefs or information are primed or 'cued' (i.e., made accessible psychologically) for subsequent evaluations\" (Callaghan & Schnell, 2005, p. 14). Thus, framing elicits the knowledge and experiences (and associated emotional connotations) related to an issue . Several studies have sought to uncover the role of framing in deliberation. Kadlec and Friedman (2009) and Friedman (2007) explore how the framing of a discussion issue for \"persuasion\" versus \"deliberation\" affects group discussion and understanding of the issue. Using eight focus groups, an exercise experimentally manipulated the framing of materials for persuasion (i.e., contrasting two debate -style arguments as would be routinely depicted in media) versus for deliberation (i.e., a nonpartisan introduction providing background to the discussion topic, and three potential approaches to the problem with associated trade- offs for each). Through observation of groups and qualitative analysis of discourse, this study revealed that participants in the delibe ratively framed groups \u2014compared with those in the persuasive groups \u2014discussed more specifics and operational considerations and effects related to the topic; displayed more inquisitiveness about the source and nature of the problems surrounding the topic; demonstrated a realistic and pragmatic understanding of the difficult choices faced in the issue; and brainstormed creative solutions. In contrast, discussion within the persuasive framing groups demonstrated ideological generalizations (e.g., the relation ship of big government and personal freedom); demonstrated more \"venting\" than inquisitiveness about the problems that surrounded the topic (e.g., corporate greed, government corruption); created a tendency toward grasping for easy answers versus understan ding the nuances of choices and trade -offs; and tended to veer off track or became circular and repetitive. This study's findings reveal the tacit importance of framing in shaping how participants consider and discuss an issue. In another study that tested how the use of metaphors affected the public policy solutions participants proposed, Thibodeau and Boroditsky (2011) found that participants do not recognize the role of the metaphor in their reactions. When crime was framed as a wild beast, participants emphasized enforcement strategies; however, when crime was compared to a virus, participants emphasized enforcement strategies less and social reform strategies more. In another study about the issue of individual consent for the use of personal health inf ormation in research, Willison and colleagues (2008) iteratively introduced three consent approaches that ranged in terms of participant control over their information from strong personal control to less control. Participants tended to favor opt -in approa ches, emphasizing their personal control, and wanted more control over their data when the issue of profitability was introduced. These findings collectively indicate that the choice of framing, through the language used and ideas evoked, can play a signif icant role in how participants feel about an issue and in the outcomes of deliberation. 94 Taking into account the role of framing, the manner in which the questions for deliberation are posed to participants should reinforce the overall framing of the deliberative process. Beck (2005) cites Dillon's (1994) characterization that in a participatory democracy, public deliberation addresses the question \"What should we do?\" Deliberation from Dillon's perspective means that the community experiencing the problem must act on the problem and must live through the consequences of any actions. The initial frame of deliberative issues must conceptualize issues in a way that achieves the statement of the shared problem and the need for action/decision, emphasizes the ne ed for problem -solving and/or idea generation on that decision, and fosters the spirit of reasoned argument by asking participants not just what to do about the issue but \"why.\" As a tool to frame the issue, illustrative scenarios or vignettes may be used to explore different values, ethics, or principles and to contextualize the deliberative issue in different ways. In these situations, the organizers examine whether different \"nuances\" in purposefully chosen illustrative examples influence the deliberation and decision outcomes in any way (e.g., Sacramento Healthcare Decisions, 2006). Following the presentation of the issue, the initial frame introduces participants to the confli cting values or priorities inherent in the deliberative topic, often subtly so. Subsequent frames delve deeper or more directly into asking \"why,\" leading to a discussion of the full range of interests, preferences, and priorities of an inclusive group of citizens. Role of Facilitators Most of the public deliberation literature refers to the importance and use of highly skilled facilitators who can work with the general public. Facilitators play a key role in ensuring the conditions necessary for successf ul public deliberation. Although reports of public deliberative processes usually do not go to great lengths to describe the range of needed skills, there are many references to the tasks and qualities that make up good facilitation. The various descriptions indicate that facilitators should have the following characteristics: Be specially trained for the project, following a standard format (Maxwell, Rosell, & Forest, 2003) Be impartial (Hendriks, 2005; League of Women Voters of Washington, 2001) Probe for possible conflict and promote cooperation (Karpowitz & Mansbridge, 2005) Prompt for clarification of statements (Kim et al., 2009) Encourage the expression of opposing viewpoints and participation by everyone, and limit domination of discussion by some participants (Kim et al., 2009) 95 Encourage an ethos of mutual respect in guiding the decision- making process (Smith & Wales, 2000; Kim et al., 2009) Remain vigilant and active procedurally by outlining the ground rules for discussion, keeping the g roup on task, ensuring that all participants have a chance to participate, and ensuring that experts adhere to their agreed -on presentation and answer the questions that are put to them (Lenaghan, 1999; Kim et al., 2009) Fishkin and Farrar (2005) note tha t it is important that the facilitator restrict neither the content of what the participants say nor the kind of speech they use. Further, the facilitator should place no formal limit on how long each person may speak but actively encourage every member to participate. Although not mentioned often in the literature, there was some discussion of whether facilitators should be knowledgeable about the deliberative topic. Whereas one set of authors believed that it was important for facilitators to prepare for the deliberation by studying the subject being discussed (Sokoloff et al., 2005), others thought that facilitators should not be experts in the topic of deliberation but rather focus on the process and on answering participants' questions (Hendriks, 2005; Melville et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009). In either case, it is important that facilitators be willing to engage with and learn about the topic (Sarah Garner, NICE, personal communication). Both approaches have clear pros and cons. Facilitators without knowledge might not know whether witnesses were manipulating participants, while knowledgeable facilitators may allow bias to creep into the proceedings (Lenaghan, 1999). Some researchers found a balance by using complementary facilitators, one being a member of the research team with particular expertise in facilitation and a second moderator with extensive knowledge of the subject being discussed (McKie et al., 2008). In terms of facilitator training, Kim and colleagues (2009) provided the most detail, refe rencing an article by Crosby and Nethercut (2005): Facilitators are asked to review written materials prior to the training session, including the research plan of the project, the presentations that will be used by the experts, detailed description of the session day, and the facilitator guidelines. The training session consists of two parts: the role of the facilitator, list of specific tasks, strategies for dealing with difficult situations, and an annotated guide for leading each of the three small group deliberation sessions scheduled for the day. There is also an in- depth discussion and role play using scenarios collected from analyzing the previous small group sessions. They have identified various points that are potential problems and examples of particularly good facilitation; these are used to demonstrate how to conduct good facilitation and how to navigate through potential group problems. Standardizing the roles for 96 facilitators is crucial to promoting good deliberation and minimizing unwanted group dynamic effects. (p. 12) Independence of the Facilitators At least two articles mentioned the importance of the facilitators being independent (Smith & Wales, 2000; Rawlins, 2005). They discussed the concern that participants may question the objectiv ity of the facilitators if they are closely affiliated with the sponsoring organization. With an organization as visible and controversial as NICE, having its Citizens Council facilitators be independent contractors seemed a prudent approach. For other groups, however, this concern about appearances may not be indicated. Regardless of whom the facilitators work for, their skill and impartiality are not difficult to judge \u2014by the participants themselves and others who are evaluating the proceedings. Summary of Considerations To Harness Quality Public Input Through the literature review, we have identified myriad best practices and considerations for designing deliberative processes that promote quality public input. Exhibit 9.3 describes these prerequisites f or successful, high- quality deliberation. Exhibit 9.3. Promoters of quality public input Components of the Deliberative Process Promoters of Quality Public Input Deliberative topics Effect on policy and the common good: The topic for deliberation should be an issue about which participants can make a meaningful contribution and affect policymaking within an acceptable timeframe (Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002; Chafe et al., 2008a; Carson & Hartz -Karp, 2005; De Stefano, 2010 ). Recruitment strategies Inclusion and \"universalism\": The deliberation should be representative and inclusive of diverse viewpoints and allow for equal opportunity to participate (Jacobs et al., 2009, p. 10; Carson & Hartz -Karp, 2005). Diversity: The deliberation should include multiple perspectives, including those of individuals who are traditionally underserved, unaffiliated, or disenfranchised (Barabas, 2004; Lukensmeyer & & Kahane, 2006). Recruitmen t screening for desired participant characteristics Conscientiousness: Participants should listen to others' arguments and make an effort to use reason through the deliberation (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005). Respect: Participants should respect the opinions of others (DeVries et al., 2010). Belief in deliberation: Participants should believe that deliberation is an appropriate mode of conversation (Burkhalter et al., 2002). Analytic and communication skills: Participant should possess the skills needed for the deliberation, such as numeracy (Burkhalter et al., 2002; Gold et al., 2007). Motivation: Participants should have sufficient motivation to learn about the topic and participate (Burkhalter et al., 2002). 97 Exhibit 9.3. Promoters of quality public input (continued) Components of the Deliberative Process Promoters of Quality Public Input Expectation setting and preparation Strategy: Conveners should decide, \"Who are the key decision makers, stakeholders, and communities, and what is the nature of their stake in the issue? How would a deliberation build on previous activity? When would a deliberation be most salient?\" (Lukensmeyer & B righam, 2002). In this way, they are being strategic about how members of the public can influence policy and decisions. Assurances of influence: Conveners should provide participants with the assurance that their voice will be heard and that the deliberat ive process will influence policy and decision-making (De Stefano, 2010; Carson & Hartz -Karp, 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009, p. 13). Clarity: Conveners need to define the participation tasks to manage participants' expectations and prevent the occurrence of misunderstandings or disputes; the conveners of deliberation should clearly articulate the participants' tasks and all of the issues that should be addressed (De Stefano, 2010; Chafe et al., 2008a). Information component Accuracy: Conveners need to use accurate information in deliberation (Fishkin & Farrar 2005; De Stefano, 2010). Competence or supporting informed dialogue: Educational material should include appropriate and sufficient context and history on the issues, be balanced and fair to all perspectiv es, leave room for citizens to create new options, and have credibility with all audiences. This also requires using appropriate procedures to select the knowledge that will be considered in the process (Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002, Abelson, Forest et al., 2003). Process Transparency: The process should be transparent to multiple stakeholders so that they can access and understand the process. It also important to be transparent in the language used in the process (e.g., through facilitation) so that parti cipants can fully participate in the process (De Stefano, 2010, Kohn, 2000). Completeness: The process should include balance in arguments offered and answered on either side of the issue (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005). Fairness: Fairness in the process requires equal distribution of opportunities to act meaningfully, including setting the agenda, establishing procedural rules, selecting the information and expertise to inform the process, and assessing the validity of claims (Abelson, Forest et al., 2003, DeVrie s et al., 2010; Kohn, 2000). Public policy/decision makers Assurances of influence: Conveners should provide participants with the assurance that their voice will be heard and that the deliberative process will influence policy and decision-making (De St efano, 2010; Carson & Hartz -Karp, 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009, p. 13). Creating process for systematizing citizen input: Members of the public should have an opportunity to continue to influence policy on the issue; further, topics brought to deliberation must be issues about which policymakers are amenable to public input (Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002). Mutual trust and credibility: Participants and decision makers need to experience trust and credibility through transparency, active participation, and priori tization of the deliberation (Kohn, 2000; Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002). 98 Exhibit 9.3. Promoters of quality public input (continued) Components of the Deliberative Process Promoters of Quality Public Input Facilitation and environment Open -mindedness: Participants are encouraged to remain open- minded, and there is space to understand and reframe issues (Carson & Hartz - Karp, 2005, Barabas, 2004). Safe public space: The environment supports a fair and productive dialogue with equal opportunities for parti cipation; also, interests and perspectives of the participants are treated as equally as those of the experts (Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002). Standards of reasonableness: Facilitators emphasize that the arguments posited should appear to be well reasoned; arguments should appeal to others' rationale, and participants should publicly declare the reasoning behind their positions (Kohn, 2000; Jacobs et al., 2009). 99 Chapter 10. Implications A key finding of the literature review is that few well- designed or comparative studies about public deliberation have been conducted, pointing to a research gap that needs to be addressed. Given the very limited number of randomized controlled studies tha t have been done on public deliberation, a sound internally valid experiment \u2014a deliberative demonstration \u2014can contribute to the body of evidence about deliberative methodology and improve our ability to draw causal inferences about the influence of the del iberative process on outcomes. The deliberative demonstration involves designing, implementing, and evaluating public deliberation as a means for obtaining public input in AHRQ's EHC program and CER enterprise. The literature review provides a wealth of i nformation to guide design decisions related to the deliberative demonstration. In addition, the Community Forum Technical Expert Panel (TEP), comprising six experts in public deliberation, CER, or risk communication, provided additional guidance at a meet ing held on February 15, 2011, and in subsequent communications.(See Appendix I for the TEP list.) On the basis of the literature review and expert input, we have developed the following implications that inform the deliberative demonstration. Implication s for D esigning Public Deliberation on CER Topics Implication 1. Establish clear intent and goals for the use of public input into CER. Extensive literature demonstrates the importance of being clear on how the results of the public deliberative process wi ll be used to inform decision- making, public policy, and program directions. It is also clear that sharing these goals and intentions with participants in public deliberation is important to the success of the deliberation \u2014assurances that their input will matter enhances their willingness to participate. Further, follow -up with the participants regarding how their results were used would increase the legitimacy and meaningfulness of the process to participants. Implication 2. Ensure that the goals for publ ic deliberation inform the deliberative tasks and methods. Certain deliberative methods may be better suited for some issues over others. The use of experts, educational materials, breakout small -group sessions, interaction between sessions, group size, duration, and mode can affect deliberation. The deliberative methods employ an array of features from which sponsors or conveners can select; many articles abstracted for the literature review were categorized the method as \"Other,\" indicating that the use of features of deliberative methods is often opportunistic. 100 Key trade -offs to consider when selecting a method are outlined below. Influence of group size and duration on quality and feasibility of deliberation . The larger the group, the more likely it is to be representative of the population at large. However, large group size may impede the participants' ability to fully deliberate on an issue since each person has less opportunity to contribute; though, break out sessions in smaller groups can mitigate these concerns. Further, large group size may have a negative effect on feasibility, both in terms of recruitment and cost. Likewise, session length and the overall duration of the deliberative process may be rel ated to the quality of the deliberation, as longer sessions may enable participants to more fully engage in the issue and allow for a diversity of values and perspectives to emerge gradually. Thus, longer sessions may be more appropriate for highly technical, complex, or controversial issues, for instance, than shorter sessions. However, longer sessions may reduce willingness to participate, compromising representativeness, and entail greater expense. Thus, decisions about session length and duration should align with the goals of the deliberation. Ensure that diversity does not result in dominance. In determining the composition of the group, it is important to define diversity vis -\u00e0-vis the issue needing public input (e.g., political affiliation, demograph ic characteristics). Heterogeneous groups support the fundamental goals of deliberation, because participants have the opportunity to learn from and converse with other members of the public with whom they might not have day -to-day interaction. However, wi thout careful structuring of the process and facilitation, heterogeneous groups may result in dominance, which can occur when members of the majority group are able to talk more often and better articulate their positions. Composed of members with a simila r identity, homogeneous groups may provide a more supportive environment, particularly for traditionally underserved or hard-to-reach groups. However, they offer less diversity, and members of the majority groups will not hear firsthand the perspectives of the minority groups. Thus, determining the group composition requires weighing these trade -offs. Implication 3. Ensure transparency of the deliberative process to promote legitimacy and public acceptance. For both the use of informed, deliberative publi c input in policymaking and the perceived legitimacy of the deliberative process, it is important to implement a transparent process. Some ways to ensure transparency and the likelihood of acceptance of the process by the public are to ascertain that the conveners or managers of deliberation are independent from the sponsoring organization, and to ensure that participants are engaged early in the process. The latter is especially important when the purpose of deliberation is to inform public policy or a com munity - based response to an issue. 101 Implication 4. Adapt recruitment methods to the goals of deliberation and the intended populations. The literature underscores the need to include members of a group who may be most affected by the deliberative issue. A lternatively, a representative sample is appropriate if the goals of deliberation are to elucidate how the public at large feels and thinks about a certain issue. Recruitment methods to attain a representative sample often use random sampling; however, we observed many instances of multipronged recruitment approaches in which random sampling was coupled with targeted recruitment efforts, e.g. through community -based organizations. Implication 5. Design, test, and ensure access to balanced, fair, and factually accurate educational materials. Deliberation, by definition, requires an educational component. The use of balanced, fair, and accurate information is essential for equipping participants with the shared knowledge base they need for deliberation and for ensuring the transparency and legi timacy of the process. Materials should be highly accessible, meaning that they are written in plain language and can be understood by all participants. Many analogies and frames exist in the media and political context within which deliberation occurs. P rior to developing educational materials and the framing through which the deliberative question or dilemma will be conveyed, undertaking formative research or an environmental scan related to the issue may help conveners anticipate the information that pa rticipants are bringing to the group and adapt materials appropriately. This step may be particularly important when developing vignettes or scenarios that serve to concretize the deliberative question or dilemma. Certain frames that exist in the environme nt may inhibit deliberation if they trigger strong emotional reactions; thus, an awareness of the environment will help inform the development of the materials, facilitation protocol, framing, and vignettes. Implications for I mplementing Public Deliberation on CER Topics The last two implications developed by the TEP relate to implementation : Implication 6. Recognize that expert facilitation is central to high -quality discourse. The role of the facilitator is crucial to the success of deliberation. The faci litator has the challenge of establishing an open, safe atmosphere to foster deliberation. Further, the facilitator has to ensure that participants are being respectful of one another, are practicing reason- giving, and have an equal opportunity to participate. The facilitator also establishes the deliberative task and sets expectations with participants. Given the responsibilities of the role, multiple facilitators should be available for longer sessions to avoid fatigue. Further, facilitators need to refle ct the identity of the participants to the extent possible, be knowledgeable about the issue, and be 102 amenable to the public. Facilitator training should be standard, ensuring that all the facilitators who will be involved in a deliberative process conduct their groups in a consistent manner. Implication 7. Ensure optimal use of technology within and outside the deliberation, with equal access and ease of use for all parties. Although educational materials can take multiple forms, it is important to ensure that participants have access to the resources needed before or between groups; otherwise, inequities are created by the process. For instance, if participants need access to a computer and the Internet, conveners may have to limit the study sample to thos e individuals with Internet connectivity or provide the participants with the necessary equipment. 103 References 1.

Semi-Structured Interview Protocol 121 THE INTERVIEW Introduction (2 min) Welcome and purpose of the interview Hello. Thank you for taking ti me to talk with me today. My name is Marge Ginsburg, and I represent the Center for Health Care Decision -making, a subcontractor to the American Institutes for Research, a Washington, D.C.- based not -for-profit research company, on the Community Forum for C omparative Effectiveness Research project, funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. [Introduce others if applicable. State your role(s) on the Community Forum project.] As described in the invitation letter for this interview, the purpose of the Community Forum for Comparative Effectiveness Research is to develop or refine approaches to eliciting public views as an input to health care decisions, particularly in comparative effectiveness research. We are currently conducting a review of rel evant literature on deliberation with members of the public, best practices in deliberative processes, what defines and fosters a deliberative \"success,\" and the outcomes of deliberation. We would like to talk with you today to learn more about your exper iences with public deliberation; its intended application by AHRQ to explore comparative effectiveness research; deliberative modalities (e.g., face to face vs. online deliberation), factors that define and foster successful deliberation; and the potential outcomes of public deliberation. Procedures The interview will last about 45 minutes. You don't have to answer every question, and you can stop the interview at any time for whatever reason. To protect your confidentiality and privacy, your name will not be included or connected with statements you make during the interview in reports and summaries that result from this project. Your comments will be used to inform the literature review on deliberative methods, as well as support our design, implementation, data collection, and analysis of deliberative processes on the topic of CER. The Community Forum project team will handle all information being shared with us today in a confidential manner, and we will not identify the source of comments in any report s or summaries. AHRQ will only know about the general themes that emerge from the interviews and how those affect the deliberative demonstration. Ask, \"Is it OK if I audiotape this interview today?\" {Turn on recording equipment if you are using it.}] 122 Back ground on Public Consultation & Deliberation (10 min) 1. [Warm -up question]: Describe the role that public deliberation plays in your professional life. Do you think its role will expand in policymaking in this country? If so, what will drive that expansion? 2. To you, what distinguishes deliberative methods from other forms of public engagement? What are the \"minimal\" criteria needed to label something as \"deliberation\"? 3. Some people regard public engagement as simply window -dressing. What do you think the average citizen can contribute to the public policy? 4. One of the criticisms of public deliberation is that is does not always capture the voice of those subject to healthcare inequalities. What is your approach to thi s problem? Applications of Deliberative Methods (15 min) 5. There are many different public policy issues. What do you regard as the essential elements of a policy issue that make it ideal for public deliberation? 6. Let's turn to the topic of CER. Many describe the purpose of CER as providing better information for doctors and patients to use in making treatment decisions, which are personal ones. Yet public deliberation usually focuses on societal decisions. Do you see a conflict here? What issues in CER woul d benefit from a societal perspective? What specific controversies or priorities could be effectively addressed through deliberation on CER topics? AHRQ particularly has an interest in ethical or values -based perspectives. Do you distinguish ethics and values from other aspects of societal perspectives? Examples? How might these perspectives be relevant to CER? To you, what would be a 'really good' outcome from this 3- yr. effort to engage the public in issues related to CER? 7. Part of this project will compare how different methodologies work vis -\u00e0-vis CER topics. What knowledge gaps now exist in assessing the effectiveness of one type of deliberative process over another? How could this project address these gaps? Are there certain methodologies that you b elieve are less or more effective for the kinds of topics we will be exploring? 123 Deliberative Modes (for relevant participants only) (15 min) 8. How have you utilized technology in deliberation? 9. How does technology affect the deliberative process? Probe for participants' experiences, knowledge development, debating, access to experts, etc. What are the effects of synchronous deliberation on group processes and deliberation? On outcomes? What are the effects of asynchronous deliberation on group processes and deliberation? On outcomes? Are there particular topics or environments that are more conducive to one form of technology -based deliberation than other topics or environments? In other words, when we design a technology -based deliberation, what are the crite ria we should use for determining whether to use synchronous or asynchronous deliberation? 10. Does the incorporation of technology into deliberation pose a barrier to accessing some populations? In your experiences, are there certain groups that are better ab le to use technology in deliberation than others? How do you ensure representative participatory opportunities across demographics? Defining & Achieving Successful Deliberation (15 min) 11. I'd like to turn to how one decides if deliberation is successful. In general, what do you consider a \"successful\" deliberation? For individual participants? For the group? For the sponsor(s) of the deliberation? When all is said and done, what outcomes do you think are most important? 12. In evaluating success, what measures/assessments have you used to evaluate a particular deliberative event or project? (particular methods or tools that you use?) 13. What are the questions that are most important to answer to judge whether a deliberative process was a success or not? Some people focus on the degree of 'deliberation' that took place. What to you is evidence of good deliberation? How do you measure the quality of it? 124 Is outcome or impact an important consideration in deciding if a deliberation was successful? Or is it enough to know that the process was legitimate? Probe for qualitative and quantitative approaches that have been successful. 14. What do you regard as the most significant barriers to performing deliberative methods studies and doing them successfully? 15. On a practical note, how have you met the challenges of incorporating the underserved and hard- to-reach populations into deliberations? 16. Are there special challenges for facilitators in engaging mixed demographic groups? What steps do you take to assure an equal voice? Probe for implications to recruitment, the role of incentives in recruitment, educational materials, role of the moderator, the role of expert testimony, and group dynamics. 17. If you were to name the top three factors that are most important in fostering successful deliberation, what would they be? Probe for moderator characteristics, expectation setting with participants, group composition and dynamics, and educational materials. 18. Some deliberative processes are oriented to reaching consensus on an issue; others are not. What is your experience with these two approaches and do you feel strongly one way or another about the need to reach consensus? Wrap up and closing (3 min) 19. Are there specific sources of grey literature (unpublished) and/or organizations/ individuals you believe we should seek out to supplement what peer reviewed literature offers, especially with respect to the innovators of deliberative methods and/or sound empirical evidence about deliberative practices? 20. Before we end, I want to give you the opportunity to add any other comments you may have about deliberation, the public's input into CER, and the Community Forum for CER project. Thank you very much for participating in this conversation. On behalf of AHRQ, AIR, and the other key members of the Community Forum team, thank you very much for your time and your input. 125 Appendix C . Key Informant Interview Final Report Key Informants Summary of I nterviews Purpose The Community Forum is a complex and unique undertaking. As part of the planning process, the AIR team conducted telephone interviews with 17 key informants, individuals recognized for their knowledge and experience in the fields of public deliberation (PD) or comparative effectiveness research (CER). To augment the literature review, these interviews provide insights in navigating through the variables of deliberation and CER. These candid, f irst-hand perspectives allowed us to probe into specific aspects that are often beyond the reach of the literature. Interviewee names were recommended by AHRQ, AIR, and other knowledgeable team members. The interviewees are listed in appendix A. Recruitment and Interview Process Prospective interviewees were each emailed a message explaining the AHRQ project and our interest in interviewing them. Between September 19 and December 17, 2010, seventeen interviews were conducted. The interview questions were developed by the AIR team (see appendix B); most of the interviews lasted one hour. Not all questions were asked of each person; this semi -structured process allowed for flexibility as responses often led down new paths of inquiry. This guide was also modi fied for those whose background was in CER rather than public deliberation. All the interviews were conducted by the Center for Healthcare Decisions (CHCD) staff, Executive Director Marge Ginsburg and Associate Director Kathy Glasmire. Themes This was a q ualitative process; while there was no need to seek unanimity of viewpoint, it was important to know where there were areas of general agreement and areas of diverse opinion. Key points regarding interviewees' perspectives are grouped into four broad theme s: (1) The value of the societal voice (2) The pursuit of successful deliberation (3) Choosing a deliberative method (4) The role of public deliberation with CER 126 Many of the interviewees were those who conducted or organized public deliberation for a living, either as academics or practitioners or both. They were universally enthusiastic about the study and practice of PD. Even when PD does not provide a direct link to policy change (what most regard as the pinnacle of 'success'), th ese advocates have a strong commitment to the relevance of PD in a democratic society, the standards that must be maintained to call interaction 'deliberative,' and the importance of applying the process across local, state, and national policy. For a few, it is a particular policy issue that drives their interest; for most, it is the process itself that brings value and legitimacy to the interface of public policy and civic life. 1. The V alue of the Societal V oice The elements of and rationale for PD were often expressed in similar ways. W hile informants used a variety of different terms, the meanings were usually consistent: It is the 'societal' perspective that makes a deliberative process meaningful. Noted one individual: it is what we should do as a community; it considers the public good, not the individual good. PD is necessary when the issue cannot be solved with a technical answer. While facts are essential for deliberation, it is the process of wrestling with the meaning of those facts that defines deliberation. It is probing for ' what we should do' when faced with appealing (or unappealing) options. PD is most valuable when it gets people digging deep to find out 'this is what it really means to me.' The deliberative issue is one that is controversial, timely, and relevant to curre nt public policy; it is expected that policy makers are committed to 'being informed by' (if not specifically adhering to) the PD results. While PD may be applicable for any controversial topic, it is especially important when the values of policymakers m ay not necessarily reflect those of the public at large\u2014or particular populations who are especially affected by that policy . It brings the light of public scrutiny into difficult decisions. Societal values are inherent in discussions about conflicting pri orities and trade -offs. While few articulated the distinction between ethical issues and societal values, one informant opined that ethics entailed 'morals' and societal values were grounded in 'culture.' PD is more focused on what one informant called soc ial value judgments. Not all informants agreed that each aspect was important but all of the following were mentioned multiple times as being essential to successful deliberation: ( 1) the participants were truly representative of the population being sought; (2) the participants felt that their participation was taken seriously and respected; ( 3) the experience of deliberation had a meaningful impact on participants; ( 4) the sponsors (the 'elites') learned what th ey needed to help inform their 2. The Pursuit of S uccessful D eliberation 127 decisions on the issue being discussed; ( 5) the sponsors, in fact, used the results of the PD as promised. In particular, success depends on the following: The topic must be framed clearly, specifically, and in a way that is relevant to participants' lives. Framing (translating the topic into questions, format, and process for deliberation) requires careful attention to participants' abilities and interests. The goal of the deliberation \u2014what it is that the sponsors want to lea rn\u2014must also be clear from the start. Participants will raise and discuss disparate views. They show a high level of engagement; their arguments are cogent; they listen to others; and they often change their minds. Participants may not always respond with equal intensity but they all respond. The legitimacy of the deliberation rests to a great extent on the demographics of the participants. The best process will not have credibility if the participants are not the ones who 'should be there.' Recruitment of marginalized populations can be very difficult. Even with incentives, it takes skill and know -how to attract individuals who are commonly outside the realm of civic participation. Advocacy group representatives are easy to recruit but they are not a substi tute for the marginalized individual. The role of the facilitator is key to making the ingredients of PD work together. Since the goal is to learn what participants think about a complex issue, individually and as a group, then the person(s) responsible f or uncovering that must be skilled and experienced. There are differing views about the importance of reaching consensus. Most informants regard consensus (e.g., on a policy recommendation) as highly desirable, but not reaching it is not failure. Forcing consensus risks losing and alienating the minority view. But without the work required to seek common ground, the discussions are just 'talking,' not deliberation. Noted one informant, for the decision-maker, it's the collective statement at the end that a dds legitimacy and credibility. Other informants make no attempt to find consensus; their goal is to identify the range of viewpoints and values and to fully understand why individuals resist the majority viewpoint. Evaluation processes must be established in advance to capture measurable results pertaining to structure, process, and outcomes. While there are credible quantitative and qualitative methods for assessing a particular project, more work is needed on comparing different PD models and measuring impact on individuals and on public policy. Noted an informant , if successful, people can recognize the echo of their voices in output; see their opinions and reasons as being represented; and even understand why they didn't get their way and perhaps the good reasons for not. 128 Each ty pe of methodology used\u2014 from deliberative polling to Citizens Councils \u2014brings particular pros and cons. Many felt that the best PD required an intensive process: at least a day and often more. Those experienced with shorter processes \u2014from two hours to a hal f-day\u2014 believed that for PD to be available to large numbers of citizens, it must be easily accessible within the framework of people's daily lives and the capability of sponsoring organizations. The implicit trade -off was clear: one model had small numbers of people deliberating over an extended period on a particularly complex topic that required extensive learning; the other had many people deliberating over an abbreviated period using a highly structured approach without an extensive educational component. Many thought that the nature of the topic should dictate which type of deliberation is used. 3. Choosing a D eliberative M ethod Concern about reaching larger numbers of people over a larger geography is driving interest in use of the internet for deliberation. While enthusiastic about the potential of social networking, most informants were wary of abandoning face -to-face interaction, skeptical that one could really achieve that same level of interpersonal connection, collaboration and negotiation through distance deliberation as is possi ble in person. Noted one, while I can see never shopping in a store again, I can't see problem -solving happening in another place. Others were more open and enthusiastic about the possibilities, especially recognizing that younger people have grown accusto med to virtual interactions. A common conclusion is that there needs to be a combination approach. For all informants, this was the most challenging part of the interview. Although most were quite familiar with CER (some more than others), they often struggled to answer the question: What issues in CER would benefit from a societal perspective? Nevertheless, various informants mentioned the following: 4. The Role of Public Deliberation With CER Prioritizing CER topics. This is a 'classic' role for public deliberation: if one cannot do everything, then what has priority and why. A related version of this is what goals are most meaningful for a healthy society (e.g., questioning the importance of medical care in relation to other needs, such as public health , education, and other social determinants of health). Determining standards of effectiveness. CER is about effectiveness but what does this mean and what should it mean? What constitutes a meaningful Using the results of CER. Currently, those results are advisory, intended to help inform individual patient and physician decisions. What will assure that this information is accessible to patients? How should it be disseminated? What benefit of one treatment over another? One informant noted that even the accepted confidence level of p <0.05 is often challenged by advocacy groups; examining the facts about this long-accepted standard could be quite interesting. 129 obligation do physicians have to use CER results in their treatment recommendations? Should they b e more than advisory? Should they be a basis for coverage decisions or value -based insurance design? One noted that public deliberation is most important at the beginning of the work (e.g., priority -setting) and at the end (e.g., how are the results used?) . Acknowledging finite resources. This issue was mentioned more than any other. Paraphrased, one informant noted, this doesn't mean that decisions about CER must make cost part of the equation, but to ignore this aspect of reality is intellectually dishonest. Another noted that some countries consider it unethical to ignore the issue of cost because opportunity costs mean someone else will be harmed. Another suggested that a relevant question would be what is reasonable for society to pay for? Another suggestion: If the public does not want others (government, health plans, purchasers, physicians) to make decisions about cost v. benefit, are individuals willing to say no to treatment whose costs far outweigh the benefit? Not Assessing risk and benefit. Organiza tions that evaluate interventions make decisions about risk v. benefit. It would be worthwhile to learn how the public views the balance. raising the cost issue. Two informants believed that we didn't have to raise the issue. If the questions are about risk and benefits, they believe that the public will ask about costs (and presumably, take that into account in their deliberations). Conducting CER studies. Is this process fair? Is it transparent? Exploring ethical issues. There are other aspects of CER that are especially value- laden, for example, how do citizens view these circumstances: - When a condition disproportionately affect s a particular group of patients (esp. the disadvantaged), should more resources be devoted to that group? - When there is a condition not well -studied because it doesn't affect many people, should it get higher or lower priority? - Should we differentiate between the very young and very old? Weighing the importance of differe nt outcomes. What individuals want for themselves is not always the same as what they think is important for society. Alternatively, what professionals regard as a worthwhile clinical benefit may not be what the public prioritizes. Letting the public defin e the societal issues. Occasionally, planners use a deliberative process to have the public identify the tensions or controversies that may exist in a complex policy issue; i.e., they use PD as way to map tension points before developing a deliberative process on a specific topic. The AIR team is grateful to the 17 individuals who willingly and openly shared their experience and perceptions to assist us in developing meaningful ways to bring the societal voice to healthcare decisions. 130 Appendix D . Literature Review Abstraction Form and Database 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 Appendix E . Written Guidance for Abstractors Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Community Forum (CF) Project Task 1: Deliberative Methods Literature Review Abstraction Team \"Cheat Sheet\" and Background Purpose of Task 1 Literature Review: Much literature exists on the topic of deliberative methods and their application to decision- making in contexts that require participants (i.e., groups of citizens) to wrestle with, articulate, and debate decision choices that involve an ethical or moral dilemma related to some topic of interest. Resolving the dilemma that is at the heart of a specific deliberation often requires weighing different personal or societal values that may be in conflict in the competing decision alternatives (i.e., decision ch oices). This literature review aims to summarize the state of the field of deliberative methods, specifically with respect to domestic (U.S.) and international applications of deliberative methodology to healthcare decision- making. The deliberative methods literature review is Task 1 of the AHRQ Community Forum project recently won by AIR's Health program. In addition to providing a \"state of the field\" assessment (including types of deliberative methods, applications of deliberative methodology to different questions of interest, applications of deliberative methods in fields beyond healthcare, trends and innovations in deliberative methodology, and evaluations of deliberative methods) the literature review will inform our design and approach to a controlle d experiment on deliberative methods as applied to questions (i.e., decision dilemmas) related to comparative effectiveness research (CER). The controlled experiment to demonstrate the application of deliberative methods to CER contexts is Task 2 of the Community Forum project. Together, Task 1 and Task 2 define \"Focal Area 1\" of the Community Forum project. In the Literature review, we will explore: Different deliberative methods or approaches for obtaining informed public input, particularly to the exte nt that deliberative methods enable input and engagement from traditionally disadvantaged/disenfranchised groups - Deliberative methods specifically related to questions involving comparative effectiveness research (CER) NOTE: we don't expect to find many ar ticles that address applications of deliberative methods to CER questions, but should be on the lookout for these wherever they exist. - Deliberative methods in health care (more generally than CER) that involve decision making by participants on issues tha t require weighing ethical or value -laden issues or decision choices, including varying levels of exposure to 138 risk, decisions about resource allocations (e.g., health care coverage decisions), and other decision \"dilemmas\" - Deliberative methods in other fie lds with relevant applications to CER (e.g., ethics -based and values-based dilemmas in other fields beyond healthcare) - The characteristics of \"good\" deliberative topics/questions How the resolution of the decision dilemma is affected by various processes and approaches to deliberation (e.g., how sponsors or facilitators of deliberation frame the question for deliberation, characteristics of the group and individuals involved in the deliberation, whether the facilitator of the deliberation has the end goal of driving participants to consensus, specific type of deliberative method used, incorporation of \"experts\" and written or other materials as sources of information to educate participants on the topic) The value and use of input obtained through deliberation\u2014what constitutes valuable, high quality, and relevant citizen input? What unique information does deliberation offer that other methods do not? How the public's input is most optimally and appropriately used The use of technology in deliberative methods (i.e., online deliberation) What defines a \"successful\" deliberation? What outcome measures are used to evaluate the effectiveness and/or impact of deliberative methodology? What the implications of the use of deliberative methods in other fields are for comparative effectiveness research Terminology/Definitions: Comparative effectiveness research (CER): to compare alternative interventions (clinical, delivery of care) to treat the same condition to determine which work best for which patients and which pose the greatest benefits and harms and to whom. Deliberative method: A way to elicit informed public input\u2014anything from a study circle, to a deliberative focus group, to online deliberative polling. Examples of specific deliberative methods are provided below. Deliberative methodology is a type of group process, i.e., a group (usually a small group) interacts and shares information, opinions and viewpoints related to the topic of interest to the deliberation (i.e., the \"deliberative topic\"). Deliberativ e methods have three primary characteristics: (1) Input is sought from the general public (not \"stakeholders\"). The distinction between \"citizen\" and \"stakeholder\" is described below under \"Terms related to the characteristics of a deliberative session,\" defi nition for \"Participant.\" (2) Participants are informed about the topic of interest (via educational materials, presentations, expert testimony) prior to, and sometimes during the deliberative 139 session. In this manner, they become \"informed\" and their input on the topic can be considered \"informed public input,\" i.e., what the general public would think about something if they were informed about the topic. (3) The nature of the topic discussed and framing of the topic is such that it provides participants with a dilemma to resolve through decision- making. The dilemma involves evaluating competing arguments or decision alternatives that require participants to weigh personal and societal values and ethics that are inherent to the decision alternatives. Examples o f deliberative methods (i.e., format/technique for deliberation): Below are names of specific kinds of deliberative methods you might see mentioned in the literature you are reviewing Citizens' jury: A group of randomly selected citizens, gathered in such a way as to represent a microcosm of their community, who meet over several days to deliberate on a policy question; They are informed about the issue, hear evidence from witnesses, and cross- examine them; They then discuss the matter amongst themselves and reach a decision.1 Citizens' council/citizens' panel: Institutional structures to integrate citizens' perspectives in setting public health -car e priorities, including councils2 Randomly selected group of citizens meet routinely (e.g., four times per year) to consider and discuss issues and make decisions Often used to guide health resource allocation decision Panels act as \"sounding boards\" for governing authority Deliberative polling: Builds on the opinion poll by incorporating element of deliberation\u00b7 Involves larger numbers than citizens juries and may involve less time; Measures what public would think if it was informed and engaged around an issue 1 Abelson J, Forest P -G, Eyles J, Smith P, Martin E and Gauvin F -P.

Consensus conference: A group of citizens with varied backgrounds meets to discuss issues of a scientific and or technical nature Consists of 2 stages: 1.

Citizen Participation in Health Decision-Making: Past Experience and Future Prospects. Journal of Public Healt h Policy , Vol. 23, No. 1 (2002), pp. 12-32. 141 Deliberative focus groups: One-time discussion of a particular topic Typically involves 6-12 individuals selected to meet specific criteria in order to broadly represent a particular segment of society One-time face -to-face meeting Structured to be informal to encourage open discussion among participants Recruitment Terminology Target group: Group, often identified by demographics, whose input is being sought Screening: Usually conducted by professional recruiters who follow a script, it is a process for ascertaining that a potential participant\u2014who either meets some inclusion criteria for the target group or was found via sampling\u2014has the characteristics of the desired target group. Recruitment incentives: Usually monetary and offered to potential participants as compensation for participation; we are particularly interested in learning how financial incentives for participating in deliberative processes have been used among disadvantaged groups. Modes of Deliberation Online synchronous: Deliberation that occurs online with participants debating/discussing the issue at hand in real -time Online asynchronous: Deliberation that occurs online with participants debating/discussing the issue at hand in which participants post responses/questions to a discussion board within a specified time period (e. g., 24 hours). They are not interacting with each other in real time. 142 In-person deliberation (i.e., face -to-face): Deliberation among the participants occurs with all participants meeting together in one location. Terms Related to the C haracteristics of a D eliberative S ession Sponsor: Individual or entity with topic needing/warranting public input Participant: Public citizen giving informed input on the topic of interest. A member of the general public, or citizen, is not the same thing as a \"stakeholder.\" For this literature review, we are interested in those articles that deal with deliberations among members of the general public/citizenry. This is distinguished from a \"stakeholder\" in that a \"stakeholder\" has some sort of vested interest i n the deliberative topic, field, or area of study. For example, in a CER context, a stakeholder might be a healthcare provider, member of an advocacy group, or patient suffering from a particular disease or condition. NOTE: this distinction is important in that there is a second Community Forum literature review that will deal with stakeholder engagement. Thus, we are interested specifically in the deliberative methods literature review in public deliberation, but are \"flagging\" articles in that specificall y mention stakeholders as study participants or subjects of review. Facilitator: Facilitates deliberative process. Sometimes referred to as a \"moderator.\" Educational materials: Materials provided to the participants by the sponsor in advance of and/or during the deliberative sessions. In some context, \"experts\" or \"expert testimony\" is referred to as an educational resource for participants. In the abstraction form, there are separate areas for discussing educational materials and experts. Educational materials and experts are what are used to make the participants the \"informed\" public, who are then able to give \"informed public input\" on the topic of interest to the deliberation. \"Rules of Order\": Guidelines and expectation -setting with the participants regarding the deliberation process. For example, is the expectation set that all participants will participate, and how; has the moderator set a \"decision goal\" for the group, e.g., is the group tasked 143 with reaching consensus on a viewpoint/decision choice? Various other rules of order are possible. Terms Related to the Outcomes of D eliberation (Note that we are seeking to learn all of the different outcomes that have been explored in deliberative methods; what criteria for success have been appl ied to the evaluation of deliberative methods?) Individual -specific outcomes of deliberative method: Examples could include a change in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and opinion; better knowledge, understanding, or consideration of the viewpoints of the 'other' Group- specific outcomes of deliberative method: Examples could include consensus, polarization of viewpoints (i.e., members become more extreme in their viewpoints), group cohesion, sense of community, civic-mindedness of the group (e.g., citizens think about the impact of decision-making on the collective/society) Policy/program outcomes: Examples could include the use of deliberative methodology in a systematic way by a sponsor or program, routine incorporation of public input into policy, specific policy changes that resulted from gaining informed public input on a topic. 144 Appendix F. Online Deliberation and Other Deliberative Innovations Online Deliberation and Other Deliberative Innovations Incorporating technological advances into the process of deliberation is one of several advances in deliberative process design and implementation in recent years. To streamline the literature review, exploration of some of the issues related to technology and innovation were reserved for the Appendix. Particularly, we explore factors relevant to the design of systems to implement online deliberation, experiential considerations for participants engaging in online deliberation, and other deliberative innovations in recent years. Designing Online Deliberation In designing online forms of deliberation, there are several considerations that shape the quality of the deliberative dialogue. These factors correspond to the purposes of the deliberative processes and primarily relate to the technical architecture, gove rnance of the online space, and the nature of the interaction among participants and moderators (Janssen, 2005). Rose and Saebo (2010) offer four considerations for the design of an information system intended to facilitate public deliberation. Conveners m ust also evaluate and manage the system. The four considerations include: (1) stakeholder engagement, (2) Web platform design, (3) service management, and (4) political process reshaping. Each is considered below. Stakeholder Engagement Systems designed to facilitate communication between public officials and citizens must be evaluated foremost on their ability to deliver on that promise (Rose & Saebo, 2010). Because neither officials nor the people they serve are homogenous, some deliberation systems have been designed to reach out to selected demographic groups, such as youth. Computer- mediated communication preferentially serves those with the time, money, skills, and education to take advantage of it. Successful access to online deliberations demands not only considerable start -up 145 costs, but also the resources to maintain Internet access and keep skills and equipment up- to-date (Rose & Saebo, 2010). Web Platform Design While very little research has been conducted on the most effective design for computer- aided political deliberations, extant evidence has provided insights (Rose & Saebo, 2010). Some considerations for designers include: (1) Allowing user -defined discussion categories or establishing them a priori; (2) Incorporating question and answer formats; (3) Creating o pportunities for synchronous communication (e.g., chat rooms), asynchronous (e-mail lists, forums) communication, or both. Asynchronous communication allows for more considered thoughtful communication. Synchronous communication is more likely to host idle chatter and small talk. We define and discuss consideration for this latter design feature below. Synchronous Online Deliberation Synchronous deliberation implies that participants in a deliberative procedure are engaging in dialogue with each other concurrently, at a set, agreed -upon time. Synchronous deliberation gives facilitators control over who can speak and when; and also permits them to monitor and guide the nature and flow of the deliberative conversations (Siu, 2008). In a review of four synch ronous online deliberative polls and one in-person deliberative poll, Siu (2008) discussed aspects of polling software that is often used with deliberants. In Siu's study, online polling software ensured that participants did not interrupt one another by allowing only one participant to speak at a time. The facilitators in such settings encouraged equal and respectful participation, directly encouraging participants who were reticent to speak up and removing individuals who were disruptive or rude. Synchronous online deliberation may mitigate concerns that exist in face -to-face deliberation, such as limiting conversation to one participant at a time. This capacity addresses some of the requirements for fostering successful deliberation, such as equal opport unities to participate (Fishkin & Farrar, 2005). Asynchronous Online Deliberation In asynchronous deliberation, participants do not need to participate in real- time with one another. Rather, an online forum or some other information- sharing platform is established that is readily available when users/deliberators want to engage in the process. Asynchronous deliberation may take place over the span of minutes, days, or longer (Dahlberg, 2001). 146 One practical advantage of asynchronous over synchronous online deliberation is that the former does not carry the burden of coordination (Boyles, 2009). Asynchronous groups, in comparison with synchronous groups, allow for richer, more dynamic, spontaneous interactions and more time to carefully consider their responses before posting. The lag time built into such discussions provides, at least in theory, an opportunity for participants to craft more carefully considered comments than would be possible during synchronous communications, particularly face- to-face dialo gue. A conversation comprising shorter posts allows for greater variety of speakers and, presumably, more perspectives on a given topic. There are some potential disadvantages of asynchronous deliberation. Boyles (2009) found that the participants in an online deliberative session posted repetitive findings, thus the extent to which asynchronous deliberation promotes more thoughtful deliberation may depend on other factors such as accountability or the nature of the topic (Boyles, 2009). Another potential drawback, users could have an affinity for ideas generated early in the deliberative session, referred to as \"early submission bias\" (Reeder et al., 2009). Conveners of online forums could use staged approaches of idea submission, refinement, and discussion to avoid this bias (Reeder et al., 2009). Service Management and Facilitation Service management refers to the degree to which the host of the communication system moderates the conversation, if at all (Rose & Saebo, 2010). The level of oversight can range from marginal, intruding no further than to extract disruptive participants, to a more hands-on approach, in which the moderator or facilitator shapes the nature and direction of the conversation. Some argue that online deliberation does not require facilitation, while others see a place for it. If there is a facilitator, he or she may assume multiple functions. Janssen and Kies (2005) identified two types of facilitation in online settings: (1) role of \"censor,\" in which irrelevant or counter- productive statements are removed from the discussion space, and (2) role of \"promoter,\" in which the facilitator functions in a way that promotes the minority view and the development of synthesis and common ground. These functions require that the moderator assume different purviews and may depend upon the specific purposes of deliberation. Conveners must determine whether there will be a facilitator and his or her role. Rose & Saebo (2010) note that citizen involvement in the facilitation of an online deliberative space is crucial, as it provides them with a sense of ownership and takes advantage of skills and expertise that may not be available in the government entity hosting the conversation (Rose & Saebo, 2010). 147 Political Process Reshaping Online political communication can serve numerous purposes in addition to political change, such as helping citizens use the bureaucracy or facilitating the exchange of ideas between politicians and the electorate (Ros e & Saebo, 2010). In fact, open and public deliberation can serve to legitimize the government that sponsors the dialogue. Thus, the purposes of deliberation are closely aligned to the design of the deliberative methods and modes. Given the professed intent of public officials to reshape the political process with online communications, it perhaps is surprising that very little research suggests that freestanding discussion forums in fact accomplish this task. In addition to fledgling evidence on the utili ty of online deliberation, the purposes of the deliberative process could be a determining factor in the technical and interactive structure of online deliberation. As an illustrative example, in the fall of 2008, the U.S. National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) convened a National Dialogue on Health Information Technology and Privacy. As inputs in Web design, four divergent types of public deliberation formats for the structure of the Web portal and discussion forum were considered: (1) idea generati on and refinement, (2) prioritization, (3) choice- making, and (4) consensus ( Reeder et al., 2009 ). The platform used for idea generation tends to be an unstructured participant interface, supporting free-flowing thoughts and sharing (Reeder et al., 2009). Intended to guide policymakers, choice- making and prioritization, for example, restrict users to identifying preferences along a spectrum or prioritizing a set of discrete, predetermined options ( Reeder et al., 2009). Similarly, if the purpose of deliberation is to harness consensus, the deliberation is structured in a manner similar to choice -making and prioritization with additional steps or efforts taken to build consensus among the group on a particular idea or option, usually though voting (Reeder et al., 200 9). Thus, the architecture and organization of the web portal need to be closely aligned with the purposes of the deliberation. Experiencing Online Deliberation Individual Characteristics and Online Participation Just as in face- to-face modes of deliberat ion, individual characteristics influence online deliberation. While online deliberation removes social pressures that may exist in face -to-face interactions (Min, 2009), the distance offered by online deliberation does not resolve feelings of conflict avo idance among those who do not want to deliberate (Neblo et al., 2009). Further, the more engaged people are in civic life and in following the issues, the more likely they are to be 148 willing to participate, while those individuals are conflict-avoidant will not (Neblo et al., 2009). If the online deliberative process will be accessible by invitation only, recruitment processes should take into account the differences that may exist among those individuals who are willing to engage in deliberative processes and those who are not, regardless of the mode. Anonymity or Identification When designing online deliberative processes, conveners must decide whether participants will be identified or remain anonymous (Janssen & Kies 2005, Boyles 2009, Min 2009). Having participants identify themselves may be of value. In general, participants who are identified may feel more accountable for their responses, taking more time to develop careful, well- reasoned arguments, and thus increasing the quality of the deliberation (Janssen & Kies, 2005; Boyles, 2009; Carson & Hartz-Karp, 2005). Allowing anonymous contribution to an online dialogue lowers the bar to entry but absolves participants of accountability and responsibility. If the fundamental goals of deliberation are to promote well-reasoned public discourse and engender accountability in members of the public, having participants share their identities reinforces these goals. Accessibility and Connectivity Conveners of online deliberation must decide how accessible the onl ine deliberative forum will be, e.g., open access (Janssen & Kies, 2005). Oxman, Lewin, Lavis and Fretheim (2009) note that successful online deliberations must overcome many of the challenges of conventional face- to-face deliberations as well as address additional considerations that are unique or pronounced in cyberspace, such as uneven access to Internet service, questionable reliability of online data, and the sheer volume of material available for consumption. One possibility is to host an open forum, allowing anyone to have access; alternatively, conveners could restrict accessibility by requiring an invitation for participation. If an open forum, requiring registration or some form of commitment from participants may increase participants' engagement, in turn, boosting the quality of the deliberation (Karlsson, 2010). Keys to Fostering Successful Online Deliberation The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development provides guidelines for successful online deliberations: Start planning early. Demonstrate commitment to the online consultation and communicate this clearly. Guarantee personal data protection. Tailor your approach to fit your target group. Integrate online consultation with traditional methods. Test and adapt tools (e.g., software, questionnaires). 149 Promote your online consultation. Ensure that sufficient time, resources and expertise are available to provide thorough analysis of the input received in the course of the online consultation. Publish the results of the online consultation as soon as possible and inform participants of the next steps in the policymaking process. Ensure that participants are informed of how the results were used in reaching decisions. Evaluate the consultation process and its impacts (Oxman et al ., 2009). These considerations in online deliberation reveal the importance of establishing a process that ensures that expectations are set with the participants and that the nature of the interaction and site architecture are well planned. Further, conveners need to designate who has the authority to set the agenda and generate topics for deliberation; for instance, participants could pose discussion topics and content for deliberation within the online space (Janssen & Kies, 2005). Providing the anticipated structure and level of interaction anticipated in promotional materials for the deliberation are in keeping with the guidelines for successful online deliberations. Contemporary P ractices in Deliberative Methods As observed in the literature review, t here are myriad examples of deliberative methods and how practitioners have selected from among traditional forms of deliberation to create and adapt innovative and unique deliberative processes. There is no universally agreed -upon definition of what constitutes an innovative or unique deliberative practice. As a practical matter, we define deliberations as \"innovative\" when they materially expand the involvement of lay citizens in public policy debates ( Fung , 2008), rely on computer-mediated communication (Min, 2007), or employ a combination of traditional and technology-dependent tactics (Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002). Creative Approaches Utilizing Technology Some examples of mixed modes \u2014in-person and technology tools\u2014are referred to as computer - mediated communication (King et al., 2010). An example of this approach is the 21st Century Town Meeting\u00ae (Lukensmeyer et al., 2005). In one event held in Washington, D.C., participants sat at small tables with computers and generated content, while the options and themes they produced were shared with the whole room via large screens. Participants then voted using polling keypads on the options they preferred (Lukensmeyer et al., 2005). This deliberative approach can enable large groups\u2014hundreds or thousands\u2014of people to deliberate simultaneously, allowing for greater diversity and representation of minority perspectives (Lukensmeyer et al., 2005). The dual processes of intimate deliberation and collective decision- making, through theme identification and polling, ac complish multiple deliberative objectives at 150 once\u2014engaging many people, harnessing rich dialogue, and identifying the collective response to an issue (Lukensmeyer et al., 2005). In current deliberative practice, the melding of in-person deliberation and the advances that technology permits is one form of creatively approaching and innovating deliberation. The sheer scope of reaching large numbers of deliberators, as is made possible by advances in technology including Web 2.0 architecture, is one way in which deliberative processes become increasingly innovative. A week -long debate on privacy concerns in health information technology was convened with a goal of generating \"new and interesting ideas and perspectives\" rather than achieving consensus ( Reeder et al., 2009). During the National Dialogue on Health Information Technology & Privacy, online participants were encouraged to submit ideas and react to, i.e., rate, ideas of others on various topics concerning health information and privacy. Over the cours e of eight days, the site, www.thenationaldialogue.org, received 4,143 visits from 2,835 visitors who spent an average of 7 minutes, 54 seconds on the site. About 15 percent of visitors registered and contributed 120 unique ideas, concerns, stories, and principles. Discussion threads generated some 500 comments ( Reeder et al., 2009). Frustrated with the limits of traditional risk assessment in environmental sciences, managers of environmental resources also have sought innovative ways to broaden the public debate, in most cases around a proposed project or potential pollutant, where participants may be asked to consider the relative risks associated with the project or pollutant and weigh competing values, e.g., innovation and environmental soundness. Although the deliberations have broadened in recent years to encompass non -point pollutants and other types of environmental concerns, the traditional model of environmental risk assessment nevertheless was seen as constrictive or merely a device to legitimize a decision to stakeholders or society at large (Nelson, Andow, & Banker, 2009). In response, a decision-making strategy known as Problem Formulation and Option Assessment (PFOA) seeks to engage stakeholders in an assessment of the positive and negative att ributes of a proposed technology. Originally intended to guide discussion surrounding genetically modified organisms, PFOA is now advanced as a deliberative tool for any bio -safety assessment of a transgenic organism or nanotechnology (Nelson, Andow, & Banker, 2009). In the preliminary phases, regulators chronicle the proposal and decision to pursue a given technology. The PFOA process itself does not necessarily track traditional risk assessment, but instead seeks to broaden the range of alternatives for a given environmental issue (Nelson, Andow, & Banker, 2009). Organizers consider identifying the options available to address the problem, \"one of the most creative moments in a PFOA (Nelson, Andow, & Banker, 2009, p. 737).\" It is the point at which all stakeholders brainstorm about potential solutions while deferring any critique or evaluation of these ideas for later. While brainstorming is considered an exotic addition to the literature for public deliberation in environmental risk assessment, it can and often is used in a wide variety of deliberative spaces (Nelson, Andow, & Banker, 2009). 151 One recent development in public consultation is the use of \"rapid assessment,\" a combination of research and participatory techniques deployed on an aggressively accelerated time schedule (Rowa -Dewar, Ager, Ryan, Hargan, Hubbard, & Kearney, 2008). In one instance, documentary sources, individual interviews, focus groups, open meetings, and questionnaires were used over an 11-month period in 10 separate rapid assessment projects in Scotland to tap public opinion on cancer and cancer care (Rowa-Dewar et al., 2008). The principles of rapid assessment do not necessarily align with those informing most public deliberations (Rhodes, Stimson, Fitch, Ball, & Renton, 1999 as cited by Rowa -Dewar et al., 2008): Timing Inductive approach. In rapid assessment, early themes articulated by the public help shape the inquiry as the deliberation proceeds. Organizers might revise or expand the questions posed to the public in response to an unanticipated opinion or attitude identified early in the assessment process. Furthermore, findings are fed back to the public, a task that must be carried out carefully, particularly when the topic is sensitive and/or the public officials feel compelled to comment on or \"correct\" public perceptions. Triangulation. The principle of triangulation suggests that a participatory process should be informed by multiple methods and data sources. While such a multipronged approach allows for a richer and more comprehensive analysis, organizers must be prepared for the logistical challenges of juggling different deliberation processes. Assessment. An integral part of rapid assessment is the process by which outcomes are used to shape ongoing assessment and, ultim ately, effect change in public policy or practices. Priority to participation. The model of rapid assessment gives precedence to techniques that involve members of the public as participants in the process, including the design of the deliberation and dissemination of the results (Rowa-Dewar et al., 2008). Innovative in- person deliberations can distinguish themselves from traditional deliberations simply by the extensive amount and sophisticated structure of the time associated with the process (de Cock Buning et al., 2008). Frequently, organizers will divide the discussion into plenary and group sessions (Lukensmeyer & Brigham, 2002) or guide participants in a single group through a multistage deliberation (McKie et al., 2009, O'Doherty & Hawkins, 2010).

If not, what were you not clear about? Do you think there was anything that was raised in the discussions in your group that was not covered in the polling questions? Can you give any examples? Was there anything that you felt came out strongly from the event that you attended that was not included in the White Paper and should have been? Examples? The aims of the consultation included that the public were 'at the centre' of the whole White Paper process, and that the public were 'working in partnership' with Government on these policy issues? How much do you feel these aims were achieved? Completely/to some extent/not much/not at all. Self-administered questionnaire 196 Source Construct Measure or Description Mode/Method of Data Collection Influence and importance of the listening exercise The process for involving the public in drafting this White Paper was very different from the way Government usually makes policy.

Has it made any difference to your view of your own role as a citizen, and how you might get involved in future? If so, what? Has being involved in this led to you thi nking or doing anything differently? Give examples. Has it made any difference to your view of how the public generally could or should be involved in Government policy discussions? As a result of your involvement, are you more likely to want to get involv ed in policy discussions in future, or not?

What do you think worked least well, and should be changed in future similar initiatives? Was there anything missing from the process; something you think should have happened but didn't? Are there any specific lessons about involving people that you would like Government to take from this initiative? Just to check ... has anything happened recently that might have changed your view on this whole process (e. g. contact with the NHS, news stories)?
