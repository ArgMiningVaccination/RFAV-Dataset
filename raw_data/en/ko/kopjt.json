(5 mins) Being told that you are infected with HIV is a life-altering event in many ways. What we will be talking about today is how HIV-infection instanta-neously provides you with an additional role to play. It makes you \"a patient\" in the health care system. How you handle this role as \"a patient\" could affect both the length and quality of your life. Today we are going totalk about this role, but we will redefine it. The word patient comes fromthe Latin for \"one who suffers.\" The word brings to mind someone who ishelpless, suffering in silence, and passively receiving care from others. Show Slide 6.1Visual 109Health Care Participation Today, rather than talking about how you can be \"a good patient\"\u2014a passive recipient of health care, suffering in silence, we will use the HHRP+pro- gram's definition of HIV-positive patient as someone who is a positive participant in their own health care. Being a positive participant involves having the courage to take responsibili- ty for your health. You cannot change the fact that you are infected withHIV. However, you do have control over whether you cope with HIV in a waythat improves the quality and quantity of your life, or in a way that bothshortens your life and deteriorates the quality of your life and the lives ofyour loved ones. Being a positive participant in your health care means notonly that you are willing to take responsibility for your own health, but alsothat you are willing and able to form a partnership with your health careprovider, such that you participate actively and positively in your treatmentplan. So, how do you become a positive participant in your own health care. Show Slide 6.2Visual Show Slide 6.3Visual Answer: As this slide shows, the first thing you need is a high Patient IQ. IQ here stands for Inform and Question. You need to Inform yourself and your health care provider and ask Questions. We'll begin with how to inform yourself: (5 mins) In order to actively participate in your health care, you need to understand the basics of HIV and what is going on in your body. Read about your med-ical condition. There are many books and articles on HIV and addiction. Assome of these books and articles are technical, don't hesitate to ask ques-tions about anything you read that you do not understand. We'll go oversome of the basics now. Be informed about your immune system: The immune system is extremely complex. This slide presents a highly sim- plified representation of your immune system, but it provides a way to con-ceptualize what is going on in your body. The function of your immune system is to identify and attack invaders, such as HIV. You can think of your immune system as your own private armythat protects you against germs\u2014microorganisms and viruses that arearound us, and in us, all the time. macrophages: These cells signal the presence of an invader. They also serve as the clean up crew when the battle is over. B-cells: B-cells circulate throughout the body and when they detect the invader they make antibodies to attach to it. 110Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.4Visual antibodies: Antibodies then seek out and attempt to neutralize these for- eign substances or microbes. They also signal other components of theimmune system into battle. T-cells: T-4.These are commonly called \"helper\" t-cells. You could think of these cells as the \"strategic command or war office.\" They orchestrate the actionsof the other immune cells and thus play a major role in defending the bodyagainst infection. HIV targets T-helper cells, which is why people with AIDSeventually lose their capacity to fight infections and some cancers. Natural Killer (NK). These cells attach to and destroy the invader. T-8. These are commonly called \"suppressor\" cells. However, not only do they signal that the invasion is over by suppressing other immune cells,they also play a role in attacking and destroying the invader. So when you were told you are HIV-positive, this means that antibodies were found in your blood that indicated you have been infected with HIV.Once infected, HIV replicates in your body rapidly. Every day it producesten billion copies of itself; one in every 10,000 of these copies is a mutation,which is a copy of the virus that is not exactly the same as the original.These mutations can lead to the development of different viral strains with-in the same person. Again, the virus attacks the T-cells\u2014those cells thatwould normally orchestrate the attack against HIV, but also the attackagainst other viruses and infections. The higher your viral load (the morecopies of the virus you have) the greater the threat to your immune system.The virus so weakens your immune system that it is unable to protect youfrom other invasions. You've probably all had blood tests to determine yourCD4 count and your viral load. Your CD4 count is the number of T \"helper\"cells in your body and indicates the strength of your immune system. Yourviral load is the amount of HIV virus you have in your blood. The higherthis number the faster you are likely to get sick. The goal of HIV medica-tions is to reduce your viral load to a level that it can no longer be detectedin your blood. It is like having two armies at war. You want to keep yourdefense (immune system) strong and the number of soldiers in this armyhigh, while reducing or eliminating the number of invading soldiers. It isimportant, however, that you do not judge how well you are doing strictly byyour CD4 count, as it can fluctuate. Some patients get very caught up withthis number, and can get discouraged if the numbers go down. You shouldremember that it is just one indicator of a very complex process. 111Health Care ParticipationBe informed about opportunistic infections: The term \"opportunistic infection\" comes from the word \"opportunity.\" When the immune system is weakened by the presence of HIV, it has difficultyfighting off other infections. This weakened state provides an opportunityfor other infections to \"move in without a fight.\" When a person progressesto AIDS the immune system is so compromised that these opportunisticinfections can become life-threatening. Therefore, it is very important foryou to keep your medical appointments because there are ways for you toprotect yourself against opportunistic infections. Be informed about the consequences of continued drug use: We'll focus on cocaine use for purposes of this discussion; however, remem- ber that any illicit drug use has its own set of negative consequences.Cocaine is harmful for everyone, but it is especially harmful for individualswho are HIV positive because cocaine use can speed up progression of HIV. QUIZ ITEM As shown in this slide, cocaine use has many serious health consequences: 1.Cocaine weakens the immune system, reducing your CD4 count. As we just discussed, it is imperative that you keep your immune systemstrong so that it can fight off opportunistic infections. 2.Cocaine may cause HIV to replicate faster. In a test tube, HIV has been found to replicate faster in a solution containing cocaine than it does ina cocaine-free environment. 3.Cocaine reduces blood flow to the brain; this can create all kinds of prob- lems, such as memory problems, problems with attention, anxiety, anger, 112Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.5Visual and so forth. You may think it is the HIV causing these problems and feel like giving up, when in fact it may be the use of cocaine that is caus-ing these problems or making HIV-related symptoms much worse. 4.Cocaine increases your heart rate, and can cause cardiac arrest. 5.Cocaine can increase blood pressure and lead to a stroke. 6.Cocaine can suppress appetite which leads to weight loss. This could be confused with weight loss due to HIV progression. 7.Cocaine interferes with sleep patterns; you may feel as if you have a lot of energy and need little sleep, but that is an illusion, causing your bodyto work harder, and get weaker at a time when it needs to keep all itsstrength. 8.Cocaine can change your body temperature and lead to convulsions. 9.Cocaine can make you sexually impotent; although many people report that it makes them more sexual at first, it eventually creates impotenceso that you cannot enjoy sexual feelings. You may then misattributesexual dysfunction as a medication side-effect. 10.If you snort cocaine, you risk damage to nasal tissue and to the lungs; if you smoke cocaine, you damage your lungs, if you inject cocaine, youdamage your veins and your heart. There is absolutely no way to usecocaine without truly devastating consequences to your health. 11.Cocaine can bring on depression and isolation. These are two things that can lead to more drug use and can worsen HIV-related depressionand isolation. 12.Cocaine can cause hallucinations, paranoia, \"coke bugs.\" 13.Cocaine can impair your judgment and lead to behaviors that place your health and the health of others at risk. When you are using cocaine it isdifficult to make good choices about your health. Your focus may be onhaving a good time in that moment, and not on getting to your medicalappointments or on taking your prescribed medications, or on eating orsleeping well. As stated in the beginning, an informed person makes thebest choices; however, an informed person can still make poor choices ifhe or she is using cocaine. The bottom line is that cocaine can kill you. Be smart. Show that you have a high patient IQ and inform yourself about the danger of drug use. Thegood news is that if you stop using cocaine, you may not only stop thingsfrom getting worse, you may also help things get better. Studies have shownthat cognitive abilities (such as memory and concentration) actually improvewhen you stop using cocaine. Your CD4 count may also increase if you stop 113Health Care Participation114Health Care Participation using cocaine. So you do have control\u2014participate positively in your health care, keep yourself informed, and take the appropriate steps to maintainyour health. Inform your health care provider: To have a high Patient IQ you not only need to be informed about HIV, you also need to inform your health care provider of your problems and concernsas they arise. As shown in this slide, you should: Inform your health care provider that you plan to actively participant in your treatment plan and that you want to be kept informed of your statusand your options at each stage in your treatment. Inform your health care provider of symptoms or side-effects of medica- tion. In fact, if you experience any side-effects, the first thing you shoulddo is inform your health care provider. QUIZ ITEM Inform your health care provider of your response to treatment recommen- dations\u2014provide your doctor with feedback about how you think the treat-ment is going. Inform your health care provider of allergies. Inform your health care provider of any other medications you are taking. Inform your health care provider of any street drugs you are using. Because there is the possibility of adverse interactions between differentdrugs, your health care provider has to know every substance you take, including alcohol and street drugs. Inform your health care provider of any \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" therapies you are getting (such as acupuncture or herbal remedies).Show Slide 6.6Visual Remember, these are complementary, not \"alternative.\" That means that if you decide to use them, you should use them in addition to your tradi-tional medical treatment, not in its place, and you should inform yourhealth care providers as to what kinds of \"adjunctive\" treatments you areengaged in, in case there are any adverse interactions. Always keep your medical information updated and readily available. The Q in Patient IQ stands for QUESTION.You should never be embarrassed to ask questions. Remember the only stu- pid question is the one that wasn't asked. You have a right to know whatsome one else is suggesting you do with your own body. So, as the slide shows, to have a high Patient IQ, you should: 1.Ask about treatment options. 2.Ask for information to be written. QUIZ ITEM It is easy to forget what you are told in a doctor's office. If you have it written down you will beable to read it over later. 3.If you are being prescribed medications, ask: What is the specific purpose of the medication? How long will I need to continue taking the medication? Sometimes you may feel just fine, but still need to take the full-course of treat-ment. For example, if you test positive for TB, you will probably beprescribed a medication that must be taken for a full year. In the\"addict\" role, you are probably used to self-medicating\u2014stopping and 115Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.7Visual Verbalstarting drugs based on the immediate effect. The medications that you will be prescribed by your doctor cannot be used that way. Inyour role as \"patient,\" you need to take all your prescribed medica-tions at the prescribed dose and for the recommended length of time.We'll talk more about this after the break. How long before I can expect to see some positive benefit? Knowing this may motivate you to continue and may decrease your chances ofbecoming discouraged. Are there any side-effects; how long might they last? Some side- effects diminish over time. What are the consequences of missing doses or stopping the medica- tion prematurely? Some medications cannot be missed or stoppedabruptly. Does the prescribed medication interact with any other drug, or food, nutritional supplement, or alcohol? 4.Ask to be provided with a reminder telephone call or card before your next appointment. When you do not show up for appointments and donot call to reschedule, the message you give to others is that you don'tcare about your own health or about your health care provider's time. 5.Ask for an explanation for anything you do not understand. Patient communication skills. (10 mins) It is clear that being a positive participant in your health care requires attending your health care appointments and demonstrating a high patientIQ\u2014the ability to inform and question\u2014both of which require good commu-nication skills. Because interactions with your health care provider are timelimited, you need a special set of communication skills to get your needs metin the allotted period of time, which is often quite short. 116Health Care Participation1. When speaking: Organize ahead of time what you want to say and prepare a list of issues you wish to raise and questions you wish to ask. QUIZ ITEM Refer to your list often while speaking to the health care provider. Stick to the point; time is very limited; don't digress. Speak clearly and sufficiently loudly. 2. Listening well entails: paying close attention. taking notes so that you don't forget, or asking for information to be written for you. QUIZ ITEM asking for clarification or for something to be repeated. paraphrasing what was said to make sure you understood correctly. 3. Body language refers to: your posture (sit up straight, facing the doctor/nurse). your facial expression (do you appear unconcerned, inattentive). QUIZ ITEM eye contact (do you maintain good eye contact). tone of voice (is your tone of voice one of concern, assertive but respectful). Counselors role-play a patient/doctor interaction two different ways. Role-play #1 demonstrates a patient who is not participating in his healthcare. Role-play #2 demonstrates a patient who does participate. (5 mins) 117Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.8Visual DemonstrationScript for role-play #1 (demonstrating poor communication morning. How are you today? Patient: (slouched, not appearing attentive, not making good eye contact, mumbling) Okay, I guess. Doctor: I notice from your chart that you've lost weight. It's important you keep your weight up. However, before I prescribe appetite stimu-lants, I'd like you to try a nutritional supplement. Start drinkingone can of Ensure three times a day and we'll see how you do. Alsoresults of blood tests indicate that it is time for you to begin anti-retroviral therapy. (Doctor writes the prescriptions). Patient: (still mumbling) I don't much like taking medicine.Doctor: I understand, but it's important to take these medications to reduce your viral load. You need to take them exactly as instructed on thecontainers. There may be serious consequences if you don't. Do youhave any questions? Patient: Nope. Doctor: Okay, then I'll see you again in a month. Script for role-play #2 (demonstrating good communication skills): Doctor: Good morning. How are you today?Patient: (Patient has a list and refers to it; posture straight; attentive; good eye contact, clear voice). Actually, I've been trying to keep a record of how I'm doing (points to list), and I do seem to get tired more easily than I used to; I'vealso lost weight. Doctor: Your fatigue and weight loss could be related. How's your appetite? Patient: Not too good.Doctor: Any insomnia?Patient: No, I seem to sleep okay, just feel run down.Doctor: It's important we keep your weight up. However, before I prescribe appetite stimulants, I'd like you to try a nutritional supplement.Let's start by having you drink one can of Ensure three times a day. Patient: Will you write down the name of that supplement for me? Doctor: Yes, of course. I also wanted to talk to you about your blood tests. Changes in your CD4 count and viral load indicate that it's time tostart you on antiretroviral therapy. Okay? I'll write out the pre-scriptions; all the instructions will be on the containers. When youtake these medications it is important that you not miss any doses.There may be serious consequences if you do. Do you have anyquestions? 118Health Care ParticipationPatient: Yes. Actually, I don't really understand why I need medication right now or what you expect these medications to do. Doctor: The purpose of the medications is to reduce your viral load\u2014 that's the amount of virus in your body. As your viral load increases, yourbody's ability to fight infection decreases, and the faster you willdevelop symptoms. Since your last visit, your viral load hasincreased and your CD4 count has decreased. That's why I'd like tostart you on a regimen of three medications, and we'll see how yourespond. Patient: I see. Are there any side-effects?Doctor: Nausea or diarrhea are reported by some patients. So you should take some of these medications before you eat. Because of yourweight loss it is important that we don't decrease your appetite fur-ther, so follow the instructions to the letter. Some patients alsoexperience headaches or rash, so you should let me know if thathappens. Patient: Are there any other drugs I'm not supposed to take at the same time. Doctor: You've told me that you aren't being prescribed any other medica- tions by any other doctor, except your daily methadone, and I'llwork with your methadone clinic to monitor your blood levels tomake sure there are no unexpected interactions with themethadone. But it's important that you let me know if you takeanything else, whether prescribed or street drugs. Okay? Patient: I used to use cocaine, but I'm clean right now. I don't intend to use again, but I'll let you know if I slip. How long will I need to takethese medications and what will happen if I decide not take them? Doctor: If you decide not to begin antiretroviral therapy, you'll probably get sick faster. These medications will give you a fighting chance to getyour viral load down and manage this disease. You will probablyneed to take this medication or others like it indefinitely. New med-ication regimens are being developed all the time, so I can't tell youexactly what treatments will be recommended a year from now.Once you begin it is important to take all medications exactly asprescribed, otherwise you increase your risk for developing resist-ance to the virus. So you really need to be committed to seeing itthrough. Patient: I am committed. It sounds like it's important to begin, and if I don't follow-through, I could mess up my chances for treatment in thefuture. Are all the instructions written down for me? Doctor: Yes, here you go. I'll see you again in a month. Patient: But I should contact you in the meantime if I have any problems, right? 119Health Care ParticipationBreakDiscussionDoctor: Absolutely. Here's the telephone number to call. Patient: Thanks, doc. I plan to be very involved in my treatment and I'd appreciate you keeping me informed of my status and options as wego along. Counselor leads discussion on differences between the two doctor/patient role-plays, asking group members for comments and questions. (5 mins) We are now going to show a ten minute segment from a video entitled \"Living with HIV\" (Copyright 1992 Glaxo-Wellcome, reproduced with per-mission). In this segment you will see and hear a discussion among long-term survivors of HIV. At the conclusion of the video, counselor directs groups members to the handout \"Characteristics of Long-Term Survivors\" in their Client Workbooks. You will find this list of characteristics of long-term survivors in your Client Workbook. Notice that the first two characteristics of long-term survivors are\u2014a sense of personal responsibility for their health and a sense that theycan influence their own health outcome. Something to think about! (10 mins) Counselor reviews material covered before the break. (5 mins) Before the break we discussed the importance of being a positive participant in your health care. That means showing up for your medical appointmentsand having a high Patient \"IQ\"\u2014being informed, providing information, andasking relevant questions. We reviewed the basics of HIV and the immunesystem, and the effects of drug use on your health. Then we covered thecommunication skills required to demonstrate your high patient IQ during atime-limited appointment with your health care provider. This includes 120Health Care Participation Visual Show Video \"Living with HIV\" ReviewVerbal/ Didacticwriting down problems and questions prior to your appointment, speaking clearly and concisely, listening attentively, asking for clarification when nec-essary, and using appropriate body language. You also learned that onecharacteristic long-term survivors of HIV have in common is that they takepersonal responsibility for their health. That's what this group today is allabout. We are going to move on to discuss the importance of taking yourmedications exactly as prescribed. HIV medications and medication adherence. (10 mins) (Note to Counselors: Approaches to the treatment of HIV change rapidly. This section should therefore be updated and revised as appropriate). Many of you may already be taking one or more antiretroviral medications. You may be taking a number of different medications, which your doctor may refer to as HAART\u2014which stands for \"highly active antiretroviral ther-apy.\" These medication \"cocktails\" of different antiretroviral medications arecapable of reducing your viral load to undetectable levels. What this meansis that the amount of virus in your blood is so low that it cannot be detectedby currently available blood tests, which in turn means that you can staystrong and healthy much longer. It does not mean that you can no longertransmit the virus or that you no longer have the virus. QUIZ ITEM The availability of these medications, although not a cure, represents amajor advance in the treatment of patients who are infected with HIV, allow-ing them to live longer, healthier lives. However, these medications must betaken exactly as prescribed, otherwise there may be serious consequences. Medication-resistant HIV. 121Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.9Visual As shown in this slide, one of the potential consequences of not taking your medication exactly as prescribed is development of medication resistantvirus. Before the break, we talked about how HIV replicates rapidly, and mutates, meaning it has changed. Some of these mutations may not respond well tomedication. When you take your medication as prescribed you are reducingyour viral load and thus reducing the rate of replication and the chance ofproducing medication resistant mutations. However, when you miss a doseor don't take the medication exactly as prescribed, replication of HIVresumes, and you have now provided a window of opportunity for medica-tion-resistant mutations to take hold and get stronger. Once this happens: the medications you are currently taking will no longer be effective in reducing your viral load. alternative medications may also be ineffective against this form of the virus. So, one of the serious consequences of not taking your medications as pre- scribed is that you may ruin your chance of being able to take a medicationthat could make it possible for you to live a longer and healthier life. So,never take a \"drug holiday\" (a break from antiretrovirals) unless instructedto do so by your doctor. Viral Rebound. As shown in this slide, medication may reduce your viral load, but if you stop taking it against the advice of your doctor... 122Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.10Visual Your viral load may rebound; that is, increase to very high levels that won't respond to treatment. Your CD4 count may decrease leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. HIV may reseed in previously uninfected cells, making treatment more difficult. Super-infection. As shown in this slide, you may be taking antiretroviral medication and responding well. Your viral load is being successfully reduced to almostundetectable levels. But then you engage in a risky behavior (such as shar-ing needles or having unsafe sex). If your partner has developed a differentstrain of the virus\u2014for example one that does not respond to medication\u2014you could potentially become reinfected and get this medication resistantstrain of the virus in addition to the virus you already have because youengaged in risky behavior. QUIZ ITEM There are two take home messages here: 1.when you don't take your medications as prescribed you can develop a medication-resistant strain of HIV. QUIZ ITEM This will not only hurt you, it could cause harm to others if you engage in risky behavior andtransmit this medication-resistant virus to your partners. 2.even if you do take your medications exactly as prescribed, you could potentially become re-infected with a medication-resistant form of thevirus if you continue to engage in high risk behavior (such as needlesharing and unsafe sex). QUIZ ITEM 123Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.11Visual So, the consequences of your behavior could have adverse effects both for yourself and for others. Remember, your behavior is under your control. These skills are applicable regardless of the type of infection a person lives with; be it HIV or hepatitis. The way that you take control is by stayinginformed and asking questions. There is also some information about hepa-titis in your Client Workbook. For those who did not bring their ClientWorkbook, we can make copies of the handouts at the end of the group. Are there any questions before we discuss medication adherence skills? Developing Medication Adherence Skills. (10 mins) Just as you need a high Patient IQ and skills to form a partnership with your health care provider, you also need skills to adhere to what can berather complicated medication regimens. 1.The first thing to do is to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of adhering to your medication regimen: In your Client Workbook you will find a blank Cost-Benefit Analysis Sheet, like the example shown in the slide, for you to complete at home.On the slide, you can see examples of some of the costs and benefits oftaking and not taking medications as prescribed for a hypotheticalpatient we'll call Pat. A cost-benefit analysis for medication adherenceis very personal; what you perceive as the costs and benefits of takingmedication is likely to differ for each of you. For Patient Pat shown onthe slide, the perceived costs of taking medication include concern aboutside-effects, inconvenience, concern about confidentiality, concern about 124Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.12Visual interaction with cocaine, concern about what will happen if a dose is missed, financial concerns, diet restrictions, and difficulty swallowingpills. Next to each of these \"costs\" is a rating of personal importancefrom zero to ten, not at all important to the highest level of personalimportance. Then in the next column are the benefits that Pat per-ceives will occur from taking medication as prescribed. As you can seethe benefits to Pat have pretty high ratings, like living longer and see-ing kids graduate. When you add up the costs and benefits, you can seeif the benefits outweigh the costs. In our example, Patient Pat haslearned that the benefits outweigh the costs two to one. This is a goodtool to use when you are initially considering starting a medication regi-men. It can also help keep you motivated if you are already takingmedications and find strict adherence difficult. 2.Another skill is being able to develop a social support system to help you take your medications. A\"medication buddy\" is someone who can help you adhere to your med- ication regimen. Care needs to be taken in selecting this \"medicationbuddy.\" As shown in the slide, a \"medication buddy\" should be: a)Anon-drug-using friend or family member who is willing to help you with your medications. b)Aperson with whom you are willing to disclose your HIV-serostatus. c)Aperson who can maintain daily contact with you. d)Aperson who can attend at least one medical appointment with you 125Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.13Visual to be educated about your medications. e)Aperson who is willing to make a firm commitment to working with you on your plan for adherence. Your \"medication buddy\" can help you adhere to your medication regi- men in several ways: a)If your \"medication buddy\" is someone who lives with you, he or she could actually dispense your medications to you. b)Your \"buddy\" could help you develop a system of memory aids. We'll talk more about that in a moment. c)Your \"buddy\" could provide you with verbal or written reminders. d)And last but not least, your buddy can provide you with encourage- ment and support. 3.Another skill you need is understanding how to use memory aids to help you remember to take your medications as prescribed. As shown in the slide, these can include: a)Using a daily planner/appointment book and referring to it daily. b)Using computerized reminders that provide an alarm or signal when medication is due. c)Using alarm clocks, and beepers. d)Placing post-it notes in conspicuous places (e.g., refrigerator, bath- room mirror). e)Identifying cues in daily life that can serve as reminders (e.g., meal times, favorite TV shows). 126Health Care Participation Show Slide 6.14Visual Experiential/ Gamef)Location\u2014medication placement (e.g., keeping medications next to something in your house that you know you will see at the time themedication is to be taken. Such as next to the bed if medication tobe taken upon awakening or retiring). g)Using pill organizers that contain all the pills that need to be taken at any given time. If you don't use a pill organizer, you should getinto the habit of taking your medications in a specific order and set-ting the container aside, so that you know which ones you havealready taken. 5.Another important skill is to be able to problem solve with your health care providers. Use your patient IQ and inform your heath careprovider of any potential obstacles to adherence that you may face, anddon't hesitate to ask about alternatives. Your doctor may be able tomake modifications to the medication regimen in a way that will notjeopardize your health. Never, ever, try to modify it yourself. 6.Finally, you need to develop a specific plan with your health care provider concerning how you will adhere to your medications, and make a personal commitment to this plan. With your provider's help, you should write down the name, dose, and special instructions for each ofyour medications, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of yourcare providers, the name of your \"medication buddy,\" and the specificstrategies you are going to use to help you remember to take each med-ication. In your Client Workbook, you will find a blank PatientInformation Sheet. Counselor refers group members to Patient Information Sheet in their Client Workbook. Fill out this sheet with your health care provider. Keep it updated and read- ily available. Medication Adherence Game. (20 mins) Materials required: Worksheet Pens/pencils 127Health Care ParticipationTimer. Prizes (e.g., medication organizer, daily planner, post-it notes). Therapeutic goals: Identify potential obstacles to adherence Develop medication adherence skills Improve communication skills Encourage teamwork and appropriate social interaction Instructions: 1.I'm going to divide the group into pairs and provide each pair with a Medication Adherence Worksheet. Counselor distributes worksheets. On the worksheet is a hypothetical medication regimen for Patient Pat whose cost-benefit analysis you saw earlier. I'll review this with younow. Pat is being prescribed four different medications, labeled on yourworksheet as A, B, C, and D. Don't worry about the actual names of themedications right now. The instructions to Pat are to take two A tabletstwice a day 30 minutes before a full meal; one B tablet twice a day;three C tablets three times a day with a meal; and one D tablet fourtimes a day at least two hours before or two hours after a meal. Theworksheet also tells you a little about Pat's daily routine. Pat usuallygets up at around 6:00 in the morning and goes to the clinic formethadone at 6:30. Pat returns from the methadone clinic by 7:30, eatsbreakfast, and gets ready for work. At 8:30 Pat leaves the apartment tocatch the bus. Pat then works as a retail clerk from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.Sometimes, Pat goes out in the evening with a friend; occasionally theyuse cocaine together. Two nights a week Pat bowls on a league from8:00 pm to 10 pm. Pat goes to bed at around midnight. Your task will be to propose a medication schedule that Pat can follow (a blank schedule is provided on Page 2 of the Worksheet). As you andyour partner attempt to create this schedule for Pat, you will identifypotential obstacles that Pat might face due to Pat's normal daily sched-ule. Write down these obstacles in the space provided and propose solu-tions (such as changes in Pat's schedule, not changes in the medicationregimen). Finally, you will recommend memory aids that Pat can use ona daily basis. You and your partner will earn one point for each medica- 128Health Care Participationtion entered correctly on the schedule. If no mistakes are made you can earn 11 points in this category. If you enter any incorrectly, you lose apoint. You will also earn one point for each potential obstacle you iden-tify, one point for each appropriate solution, and one point for eachmemory aid. The team with the schedule that is most convenient forPat will earn an additional point. In the event of a tie, a point will beawarded to the pair with highest level of participation. 2.You will have ten minutes to collaborate with your partner on an appro- priate medication schedule. Then one member of each pair will come tothe front and write the proposed schedule on the board so that it can bechecked for accuracy by counselors and remaining group members. Theother partner will then read to the group the potential obstacles, proposedsolutions, and memory aids that you have recommended for Pat. I'll keepscore and the pair with the most points wins the game and a prize. Counselor allows 10 mins for completion of the assignment. During this initial 10 minutes, counselor draws a blank daily schedule on the boardso that group members can present their proposed schedule to the entiregroup. Counselor also writes scoring criteria on board. Scoring: Categories: Scheduling of medications = 11 points possible. One point is subtracted for each medication not appropriately scheduled(e.g., scheduling medication C without food). Potential obstacles (one point awarded for each) Potential solutions (one point awarded for each) Recommended memory aids (one point awarded for each) Bonus point awarded to team that presents the schedule that is most convenient for Patient Pat. In the event of a tie: One point awarded to team with highest level of participation. 129Health Care ParticipationDuring the next 10 minutes, while team members present to the group, Counselor records each team's scores on the board, with input fromremaining group members. After all teams have presented, Counselorreviews any potential obstacles, solutions, and memory aids not cov-ered by the group members' presentations. For this purpose, an exam-ple of a completed worksheet is provided below to be used by theCounselor as needed. Examples of potential obstacles faced by Pat (one point awarded for each): 1.Pat gets up at 6:00 and eats at 7:30, but has to take a pill two hours before a full meal. 2.Pat eats only two meals a day, yet has to take one medication with meals three times a day. 3.Because some medications are to be taken during working hours, Pat may be concerned about confidentiality. 4.Pat may want to have a snack between meals, especially when socializ- ing in the evenings, yet one medication cannot be taken within twohours of any food. 5.Pat may be concerned about interactions with methadone and with occa- sional use of cocaine. 6.Pat's routine may change on weekends. Examples of potential solutions (one point awarded for each): 1.Change breakfast time. Get ready for work before breakfast and eat breakfast at 8:00 instead of at 7:30. 2.Take a light lunch to work. 3.Take short breaks at work in order to take the mid-morning and mid- afternoon medication doses. If asked about medications, Pat is notobliged to disclose HIV status. 4.In order for Pat to be able to snack when socializing with friends in the evening, Pat could take medication D before going to bed rather thanmid-evening, but Pat cannot eat after 10:00 pm if taking medication Dat midnight. 130Health Care Participation5.Pat should discuss these concerns with health care provider, but should also attempt to see non-drug using friends and family members in theevening. 6.Every Friday night create a schedule for the weekend identifying when each medication will be taken during weekend; place this schedule in aprominent place (e.g., on refrigerator) and refer to it often. Ask familymember (\"medication buddy\") to call daily to remind Pat to look at week-end schedule. Examples of memory aids (one point awarded for each): 1.Use pill organizer and/or keep detailed daily planner. 2.As Medication D is taken upon arising and upon retiring, keep medica- tion D next to bed. In addition, upon arising and retiring use the bath-room as a cue and place a post-it note on bathroom mirror which says\"Did you take your D medication yet?\" 3.Use return from methadone clinic as cue to take medications A and B. Leave A and B near those items that are always needed to get ready forwork. 4.Leave note on outside of lunch box to remind Pat to include two D tablets and three C tablets when making daily lunch; also leave a noteinside the lunch box as reminder to take three C tablets with lunch. 5.Establish a routine of taking short \"water cooler\" or restroom breaks at 10:30 and 3:30 to take the D tablet. Identify something that happens atwork at that time to serve as a cue. Keep a clock nearby. If personaltelephone calls are permitted at work, ask a family member to call Patat 10:30 and 3:30. 6.Medication buddy: Ask friend at work to remind Pat to take breaks; ask family member to call daily with reminders. 7.Use a beeper, timer, or alarm at home or work. 8.Keep Medication C (which must be taken with meals) next to the refrig- erator or with dishes. Place note on refrigerator as reminder to takemedication C with meals. 9.On bowling night, use end time (i.e., 10 pm) as cue that no more food is permitted if medication D is to be taken at midnight. On other nights,ask non-drug using friend of family member to remind Pat not to eat 131Health Care Participationpast 10 pm (alternatively, set an alarm; put \"don't eat past 10\" post-it note on refrigerator). Example of a correctly completed Worksheet: Time Medication (A,B,C,D) Quantity 6:00 am D (upon getting out of bed) D=16:30 am Methadone clinic7:30 am A and B (upon return from clinic) A=2; B=1 then get ready for work (30mins earlier than usual) 8.00 am C with breakfast (eat breakfast C=3 30 minutes later than usual) 8:30 am Leave for work9:00 am Begin work 10:30 am D (take break; no food) D=1 1:00 pm C (Take a light lunch to work) C=33:30 pm D (take break; no food) D=15:00 pm Leave work6:00 pm A and B (30 mins before dinner) A=2; B=16:30 pm C with dinner C=38:00 pm Bowling or out with friends 10:00 pm End bowling (no more food) Midnight D (before bed) D=1 Following review and discussion, Counselor awards prizes to winning team. QUIZ WITH IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK (5 mins) As you know, we end each group with a quiz and a ten minute relaxation exercise. I'm going to pass around the quiz now. Counselor distributes the quiz (attached), and reads the items aloud, providing sufficient time for group members to mark their answers. 132Health Care Participation QuizDetailed feedback: Counselor re-reads each item aloud to the group, providing the correct answer after reading each item. 1.Is the statement about cocaine true or false?

STRESS MANAGEMENT/RELAXATION EXERCISE (10 mins) We are going to conclude by doing a brief relaxation exercise. I'll be dim- ming the lights and playing an audiotape. I'd like you to get comfortable inyour chair, uncross your legs, and sit quietly with your eyes closed and justfollow along with the tape as it asks you to imagine various relaxing scenes.Remember that learning to relax is a skill that takes practice, so if you feelrestless at first, just remind yourself that this is a ten minute gift of quiettime that you give to yourself and to the other members of the group. Withpractice, you can use this technique in many areas of your life, includinghelping you to cope better with HIV and to participate more fully in yourhealth care. Counselor dims the lights, says \"quiet please,\" and begins the tape. END SESSION 133Health Care Participation Stress Management "}
