Fiscal records are maintained for a Plan Year ending as of the date specified under the Key Information section. QUALIFIED MEDICAL CHILD SUPPORT ORDER A legal order requiring the coverage of specified child(ren) under an individual's medical plan benefits. If Your employer determines that a separated or divorced spouse or any state child support or Medicaid agency has obtained a legal QMCSO, and Your current plan offers dependent coverage, You will be required to provide coverage for any child(ren) named in the QMCSO. If You do not enroll the child(ren), Your employer must enroll the child(ren) upon application from Your separated/divorced spouse, the state child support agency or Medicaid agency and withhold from Your pay Your share of the cost of such coverage. You may not drop coverage for the child(ren) unless You submit written evidence to Your employer that the child support order is no longer in effect. The plan may make benefit payments for the child(ren) 32 covered by a QMCSO directly to the custodial parent or legal guardian of such child(ren). ERISA preemption of state laws does not apply to Qualified Medical Child Support Orders and provisions of state laws requiring medical child support. Group health plans may not deny enrollment of a child under the health coverage of the child's parent on the ground that the child is born out of wedlock, not claimed as a dependent on the parent's tax return, or not in residence with the parent or in the applicable service area. Additional information concerning \"QMCSO\" procedures are available from the Plan Administrator at no charge upon request. REASONABLE/REASONABLENESS \"Reasonable\" and/or \"Reasonableness\" shall mean in the Plan Administrator's discretion, services or supplies, or charges for services or supplies, which are necessary for the care and treatment of Illness or Injury. Determination that charges or services/supplies are Reasonable will be made by the Plan Administrator, taking into consideration unusual circumstances or complications requiring additional time, skill and experience in connection with a particular service or supply; industry standards and practices as they relate to similar scenarios; and/or the cause of Injury or Illness necessitating the service(s) and/or charge(s). This determination may consider, but not be limited to, the findings and assessments of the following entities: (a) national medical associations, societies, and organizations; and (b) The Food and Drug Administration. To be Reasonable, services, supplies and/or charges must be in compliance with the Plan Administrator's policies and procedures relating to billing practices for unbundling or multiple procedures. The Plan Administrator retains discretionary authority to determine whether services, supplies and/or charges are Reasonable based upon information presented to the Plan Administrator. The Plan reserves for itself and parties acting on its behalf the right to review charges processed and/or paid by the Plan, and to identify charges and/or services that are not Reasonable, and therefore not eligible for payment by the Plan. RECOGNIZED AMOUNT For purposes of Covered Services that are subject to balance billing protections (see the \"Out ofNetwork Benefits\" section for more details), the Recognized Amount is the amount used to calculate the Covered Person's cost share for such services. The Recognized Amount is typically the lesser of the billed charge or the qualifying payment amount. The methodology for determining the qualifying payment amount is set by federal regulations at 29 CFR 2590.716 6, and is adjusted from time to time*. *In some situations, different rules will apply and the Recognized Amount, as defined by federal rules at 29 CFR 2590.2590.716 3, will be used instead. The Recognized Amount takes into account whether a particular state has adopted an allpayer model agreement, or whether state law applies for setting fees. If neither an allpayer model agreement nor state law legally applies, the Recognized Amount would, in most cases, be the lesser of the qualifying payment amount or the amount the nonnetwork provider actually billed. 33 RECONSTRUCTIVE BREAST SURGERY COVERAGE Medical benefits under the Plan will be administered according to the terms of the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998. The Plan will provide to Covered Persons who are receiving Plan benefits in connection with such mastectomy coverage for: (1) all stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed; (2) surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce symmetrical appearance; and (3) prostheses and physical complications of mastectomy, including lymphedemas; in a manner determined in consultation with the attending physician and the patient.

USUAL AND CUSTOMARY \"Usual and Customary\" (U&C) shall mean Covered Services which are identified by the Plan Administrator, taking into consideration the charge(s) which the provider most frequently bills the majority of patients for the service or supply, the cost to the provider for providing the service or supply, the prevailing range of charges billed in the same \"area\" by providers of similar training and experience for the service or supply, and/or the Medicare reimbursement rates. The term(s) \"same geographic locale\" and/or \"area\" shall be defined as a metropolitan area, county, or such greater area as is necessary to obtain a representative crosssection of providers, persons or organizations rendering such treatment, service, or supply for which a specific charge is made. To be Usual and Customary, the charge must be in compliance with the Plan Administrator's policies and procedures relating to billing practices for unbundling or multiple procedures. The term \"Usual\" refers to the amount of a charge made for medical services, care, or supplies, to the extent that the charge does not exceed the common level of charges made by other medical professionals with similar credentials, or health care facilities, pharmacies, or equipment suppliers of similar standing, which are located in the same geographic locale in which the charge is incurred. The term \"Customary\" refers to the form and substance of a service, supply, or treatment provided in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice to one individual, which is appropriate for the care or treatment of the same sex, comparable age and who receive such services or supplies within the same geographic locale. 34 The term \"Usual and Customary\" does not necessarily mean the actual charge made nor the specific service or supply furnished to a Covered Person by a provider of services or supplies. The Plan Administrator will determine what the Usual and Customary charge is, for any procedure, service, or supply, and whether a specific procedure, service or supply is Usual and Customary. Usual and Customary charges may, at the Plan Administrator's discretion, alternatively be determined and established by the Plan using normative data such as, but not limited to, average wholesale price (AWP) for prescriptions and/or manufacturer's retail pricing (MRP) for supplies and devices. WAITING PERIOD The period of time before an individual is eligible to be covered under the terms of a group health plan. Any period before a Late Enrollment, Open Enrollment or Special Enrollment is not a Waiting Period. YOU, YOUR, YOURSELF A covered Employee or a covered Dependent. No person is eligible for health care benefits both as an Employee and as a Dependent under this Plan. When the Company employs both husband and wife, any Dependent children may become covered hereunder only as Dependents of one spouse. 35 ELIGIBILITY WHO IS ELIGIBLE See the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. NONDISCRIMINATION In regard to the offering of coverage, the Plan will not discriminate against any individual on the basis of health status, medical condition (physical or mental), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability or disability. No otherwise eligible individual will be refused the opportunity to enroll in the Plan due to participation in any particular activity, regardless of its hazardous nature. The Plan will not discriminate against similarly situated individuals in regard to eligibility or benefits (however, this does not limit the Plan's ability to treat participants classifiable through nonhealth related criteria as different groups in different ways.) The Plan will not knowingly discriminate against any individual on the basis of health factors. However, the Plan may impose coverage limits or exclusions on all similarly situated individuals which may have an effect on only some individuals. EMPLOYEE COVERAGE For date of eligibility, please see the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. Providing a new employee is actively at work on at least the first day of employment, the Plan will not exclude absences from work due to health related reasons from credit towards the waiting period, if applicable, as referenced in the Key Information section. DEPENDENT COVERAGE Each Dependent of the eligible Employee becomes eligible for Dependent coverage under the Plan on the later of the following: 1. The date the Employee is eligible; or 2. The date the individual becomes a Dependent of the Employee if on that date the Employee is covered. INDIVIDUAL EFFECTIVE DATE All persons become covered, as they become eligible subject to the following: 1. All Employees, who are eligible Employees, shall be covered on the day they become eligible, as discussed in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. 2. Dependents shall be covered simultaneously with Employees covering them as Dependents. 3. Coverage for a spouse will begin from the date of marriage. Coverage for a newborn birth child will begin from the date of birth. Coverage for a child placed under legal guardianship, an adopted child or a child placed for adoption with the Employee will begin from the date of Placement for Adoption. Coverage for a stepchild or foster child will begin from the date the child meets the definition of \"Dependent.\" With respect to a spouse, the spouse must be formally enrolled and appropriate coverage arranged within 30 days from date of marriage. With respect to a newborn birth 36 child, the child must be formally enrolled and appropriate coverage arranged within 30 days from birth. With respect to a child placed under legal guardianship, an adopted child or child placed for adoption, the child must be formally enrolled and appropriate coverage arranged within 30 days from the date of Placement For Adoption. With respect to a stepchild or a foster child, the child must be formally enrolled and appropriate coverage arranged within 30 days from the date that the child meets the definition of \"Dependent.\" OPEN ENROLLMENT See the Key Information section at the beginning of this document for applicability. LATE ENROLLMENT See the Key Information section at the beginning of this document for applicability. SPECIAL ENROLLMENT The Plan permits a Special Enrollment period for an Employee (or a Dependent), who is eligible for coverage, but not enrolled, to enroll if the Employee (or Dependent) had other coverage and loses it, or if a person becomes a Dependent of the Employee through marriage, birth, adoption or Placement for Adoption. A person who enrolls during a Special Enrollment period is not treated as a late enrollee. An individual may be eligible for Special Enrollment if the Employee, at the time coverage is declined, provides a statement, in writing, indicating the reason for declining coverage. To be eligible for Special Enrollment, the Employee must have declined coverage due to coverage under another plan. However, Special Enrollment will be available to Employees that decline coverage without having coverage under another plan and subsequently enroll in other coverage and lose that coverage. The Employee must have had an opportunity for Late Enrollment, Open Enrollment or Special Enrollment under this Plan but again chose not to enroll. Special Enrollment is also available to an Employee or Dependent who becomes eligible for a premium assistance subsidy under Medicaid or a state Children's Health Insurance (CHIP) program with respect to this Plan. If the Employee declined coverage because the other coverage was COBRA coverage, then the COBRA coverage must be exhausted before Special Enrollment will be available. If the other coverage is not COBRA coverage, then to be eligible for Special Enrollment, the other coverage must be lost due to a loss of eligibility, or employer contributions must have ended. Loss of eligibility includes a loss of coverage due to: divorce; legal separation; death; termination of employment, or reduction in hours of employment; relocating outside of an HMO's service area (only if there is no access to other coverage through the HMO); a plan no longer offering benefits to a class of similarly situated individuals even if the plan continues to provide coverage to other individuals; 37 the Employee or Dependent is covered under a Medicaid plan or under a state CHIP program, and coverage of the employee or dependent under such a plan/program is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for such coverage. An Employee who is already enrolled in a benefit option may enroll in another benefit option under the Plan if their Dependent has a Special Enrollment right because the Dependent lost other health coverage. Under Special Enrollment, the Employee must request enrollment, in writing within 30 days after the exhaustion of COBRA, or termination of the other coverage (other than Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance, see below), or the date of the marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption. If eligible, enrollment in the Plan, in cases of marriage, birth or adoption/Placement for Adoption, will be effective as of the date of the event; otherwise, coverage will be available no later than the first day of the first month beginning after the completed request for enrollment is received. Under Special Enrollment, the Employee must request enrollment, in writing within 60 days after the termination of Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance (CHIP) coverage, or when eligible for a premium assistance subsidy under Medicaid or a state CHIP program. If eligible, enrollment in the Plan will be effective no later than the first day of the first month beginning after the completed request for enrollment is received. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE See the Key Information section at the beginning of this document for details. EMPLOYER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Except as required under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, or the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the Employer's policies and procedures regarding waiting periods, continuation of coverage or reinstatement of coverage shall apply during the following situations: Employer certified disability, leave of absence, layoff, reinstatement, hire or rehire. Whether an Employee averages the requisite hours of service to be eligible for coverage shall be determined in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Employer. 38 INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN APPROVED CLINICAL TRIALS The Plan may not 1) deny a Qualified Individual participation in an Approved Clinical Trial, 2) deny (or limit or impose additional conditions on) coverage of Routine Patient Costs for items and services furnished in connection with the Approved Clinical Trial, or 3) discriminate against the Qualified Individual based on his/her participation in the Approved Clinical Trial. However, if the Plan has a network of providers and one or more network providers is participating in an Approved Clinical Trial, the Qualified Individual must participate in the Approved Clinical Trial through such network provider if the provider will accept the Qualified Individual as a participant in the trial. This requirement to use network providers will not apply to a Qualified Individual participating in an Approved Clinical Trial that is conducted outside the state in which the Qualified Individual resides (unless the Plan does not otherwise provide outofnetwork coverage generally). The following definitions are applicable under this provision: Qualified Individual A Covered Person who meets the following conditions: A. The Covered Person is eligible to participate in an Approved Clinical Trial according to the trial protocol with respect to treatment of cancer or other LifeThreatening Disease or Condition, and B. Either: The referring health care professional is a participating health care provider and has concluded that the Covered Person's participation in such trial would be appropriate, or The Covered Person provides medical and scientific information establishing that the Covered Person's participation in such trial would be appropriate. Approved Clinical Trial A phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other LifeThreatening Disease or Condition, or Mental/Nervous and Substance Use Disorder Services, and is described in any of the following subparagraphs: Federally funded trials. The study or investigation is approved or funded (which may include funding through inkind contributions) by one or more of the following: 1. The National Institutes of Health. 2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 3. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. 4. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. 5. A cooperative group or center of any of the entities described in clauses 1 through 4 above or the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs. 6. A qualified nongovernmental research entity identified in the guidelines issued by the National Institutes of Health for center support grants. 39 7. Any of the following entities in clauses 7a. through 7c. below if the following conditions are met: the study or investigation has been reviewed and approved through a system of peer review that the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines to be comparable to the system of peer review of studies and investigations used by the National Institutes of Health, and assures unbiased review of the highest scientific standards by qualified individuals who have no interest in the outcome of the review. a. The Department of Veterans Affairs. b. The Department of Defense. c. The Department of Energy. The study or investigation is conducted under an investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration. The study or investigation is a drug trial that is exempt from having such an investigational new drug application. Routine Patient Costs All items and services consistent with the coverage provided by the Plan that is typically covered for a Qualified Individual who is not enrolled in a clinical trial. However, Routine Patient Costs do not include: the investigational item, device, or service, itself; items and services that are provided solely to satisfy data collection and analysis needs and that are not used in the direct clinical management of the patient; or a service that is clearly inconsistent with widely accepted and established standards of care for a particular diagnosis. LifeThreatening Disease or Condition Any disease or condition from which the likelihood of death is probable unless the course of the disease or condition is interrupted. 40 NETWORK BENEFITS Your Plan contains enhanced benefits through network providers. The name of the organization associated with these network providers is indicated on the front of Your ID card, along with instructions regarding where to file medical claims. Benefits are generally paid at a higher level when using network Hospitals and network Physicians than when using non network providers. Please refer to the Schedule of Covered Services and Provisions for benefits payable according to type of provider used. A Physician or Hospital's status within Your network can change. In order to access the most up todate list of innetwork providers, visit alliedbenefit.com or call the customer service number on Your ID card. When Your Provider Leaves the Network If Your provider or facility is leaving/has left the Plan's network due to nonrenewal or expiration of the contract, the Plan will notify You. You, in turn, will need to notify the Plan if You require continuing transitional care with that provider or facility for certain serious or complex conditions, pregnancy, terminal illness, scheduled nonelective surgical care, or if You are undergoing Inpatient or institutional care. You may have a right to elect to continue transitional treatment and still be covered by the Plan under the same terms and conditions that existed when the provider or facility was part of the Plan's network. Such coverage would be temporary, up to a maximum of 90 days. A Covered Person has a free choice of any provider for medical care. At any time, the Covered Person may choose any qualified provider with the understanding that different benefits may apply according to the provisions of the Plan. Please see the \"OutofNetwork Benefits\" section for an explanation of notice and consent requirements for nonnetwork providers. 41 OUTOFNETWORK BENEFITS This Plan is designed for You to receive maximum benefits through its network Hospitals and network Physicians. As set forth in the Schedule of Covered Services and Provisions, benefits are payable at a different level for nonnetwork providers, and the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, uses various methodologies for determining the Plan's reimbursable amount for Covered Services from nonnetwork providers. When You choose a nonnetwork provider, You are responsible for paying, directly to the nonnetwork provider, any difference between the reimbursable amount and the amount the provider bills You. This is called \"balance billing.\" BALANCE BILLING PROTECTIONS For Covered Services received on or after January 1, 2022, in situations involving Emergency Room Services, certain nonemergency services described below, or Air Ambulance services, federal rules apply to prevent You from being balance billed. In the following situations, Your costsharing obligations will be based on innetwork levels and the Recognized Amount: Emergency Room Services . For Covered Services that are Emergency Room Services provided by a nonnetwork provider, You are not responsible for amounts that exceed Your innetwork levels for copay, Coinsurance and/or Deductible. Air Ambulance . For Covered Services that are Air Ambulance services provided by a non network provider, You are not responsible for amounts that exceed Your innetwork levels for copay, Coinsurance and/or Deductible. NonEmergency Care . When You receive nonemergency Covered Services from a nonnetwork provider at certain innetwork facilities (i.e., a Hospital, a Hospital Outpatient department, a critical access Hospital, an Ambulatory Surgical Center, and any other facility specified by the Secretary of HHS) for the categories of service listed below, You are not responsible for amounts that exceed Your innetwork levels for copay, Coinsurance and/or Deductible: Ancillary Services (see the Definitions section); NonAncillary Services, if the nonnetwork provider has not given proper notice and You've not given proper consent; Your outofpocket amounts for the above mentioned services will be applied to Your in network OutofPocket Maximum. The benefits provided to nonnetwork providers and facilities will be reimbursed based on the OutofNetwork Rate (see the Definitions section). A note about Notice and Consent (where required). In certain situations described above, You can still be balance billed by a nonnetwork provider or facility so long as the provider provides to You proper notice, and You (or Your authorized representative's) consent to waive Your rights to balance billing protections prior to the Covered Service. 42 If You believe You have been wrongly billed, You may contact the No Surprises Help Desk at 1 8009853059 from 8 am to 8 pm EST, 7 days a week, to submit Your question or a complaint. You can also submit a complaint online at: https://www.cms.gov/nosurpri ses/consumers/complaints aboutmedicalbilling. Visit https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises for more information about Your rights under federal law. 43 PROCEDURES FOR FILING CLAIMS Remember to PreCertify by calling the tollfree number shown on Your ID card if required by Your Plan.

The Company has retained the services of an independent Claims Processor experienced in claims processing. Fiscal records are maintained for a Plan Year ending as of the date specified under the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. The Plan is a legal entity. Legal notices may be filed with, and legal process served upon, the Plan Administrator at the address specified in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. APPEALING A CLAIM CLAIMS PROCEDURES An explanation of benefits or other written or electronic notification will be provided by the Plan Administrator showing the calculation of the total amount payable for the claim, charges not payable, and the reason. If the claim is denied or reduced in whole or in part, it is considered an \"Adverse Benefit Determination.\" An Adverse Benefit Determination also includes a rescission of coverage, whether or not the rescission has an adverse effect on any particular benefit at the time of the rescission. A rescission is a cancellation or discontinuance of coverage that has retroactive effect, except to the extent it is attributable to a failure to timely pay required premiums or contributions towards the cost of coverage. An Adverse Benefit Determination is subject to the provisions detailed below. The Plan Administrator will notify the claimant of an Adverse Benefit Determination within 30 days after receipt of the claim. However, in certain cases an extension of up to 15 days may be utilized if the Plan Administrator determines that the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the Plan and the claimant is notified prior to the expiration of the initial 30 day period of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render a decision. If such an extension is necessary due to a failure of claimant to submit the information necessary to decide the claim, the notice of extension shall specifically describe the required information, and the claimant shall be given at least 45 days within which to provide the specified information. A notice of Adverse Benefit Determination will include the following: Sufficient information to identify the claim involved, including the date(s) of service, health care provider, and claim amount. The specific reason or reasons for the Adverse Benefit Determination, as well as the Plan's standard that was used in denying the claim, if applicable, and including identifying denial codes and providing their meaning. Reference to specific Plan provisions on which the Adverse Benefit Determination is based. A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary. 47 A description of the Plan's first level appeal procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including information on how to initiate an appeal, the contact information for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (1866 444EBSA (3272)) to assist individuals with the first level claim and appeal process and second level (external) appeal process if applicable (see below), and a statement of claimant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a determination on appeal. If an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination, either the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion will be set forth in the notice of Adverse Benefit Determination; or the notice will contain a statement that such a rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the Adverse Benefit Determination and that a copy of such rule, guideline, protocol, or other criterion will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon request. If the Adverse Benefit Determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit, either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applying the terms of the Plan to the claimant's medical circumstances, will be set forth in the notice of Adverse Benefit Determination, or the notice will contain a statement that such explanation will be provided free of charge upon request. FIRST LEVEL APPEALS PROCEDURE If You receive an Adverse Benefit Determination, You or Your authorized representative may appeal the determination by filing a written application with the Plan Administrator. In appealing an Adverse Benefit Determination, the Plan Administrator will provide You or Your authorized representative: The opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits. Upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, the claim file, and other information relevant to the claim. A full and fair review that takes into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by You relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. You must also be provided, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated by the Plan Administrator, as well as any new or additional rationale relied upon by the Plan Administrator in reaching its determination on appeal, that differs from that which the Plan Administrator relied on in its Adverse Benefit Determination. Such evidence and/or rationale must be provided as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which the Plan Administrator's determination is required to be provided to give You a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to that date. A full and fair review that does not afford deference to the initial benefit determination and is conducted by an appropriate named fiduciary of the Plan who 48 is neither the individual who made the initial Adverse Benefit Determination that is the subject of the appeal, nor the subordinate of such individual. In deciding an appeal of an Adverse Benefit Determination that is based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including determinations with regard to whether a particular treatment, drug, or other item is experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary or appropriate, that the appropriate named fiduciary shall consult with a health care professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment and that the health care professional consulted shall neither be an individual who was consulted in connection with the initial Adverse Benefit Determination that is the subject of the appeal, nor the subordinate of any such individual. Upon request, the identification of medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the Plan in connection with a claimant's Adverse Benefit Determination, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the benefit determination. A first level appeal must be filed within 180 days after the Adverse Benefit Determination is received. The Plan Administrator will notify You or Your authorized representative of its determination within 60 days after receipt of an appeal. The Plan Administrator's determination: Will contain sufficient information to identify the claim involved, including the date(s) of service, health care provider, claim amount, denial codes and their meaning, as well as the Plan's standard used in denying the claim. Will be in writing, setting forth specific reasons for the decision and reference to the specific Plan provisions upon which the determination is based. Will contain a statement that You are entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claim for benefits. Will contain a statement of Your right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA if a second level (external) review is inapplicable . Will contain a description of the Plan's second level (external) review process (applicable solely where the Plan's underlying determination involved 1) a rescission of coverage, 2) medical judgment), or 3) a surprise medical bill or surprise air ambulance bill under the No Surprises Act, including information on how to initiate a second level appeal, and the contact information for the Employee Benefits Security Administration to assist individuals with the second level review process (1 866444EBSA (3272)), as well as a statement of Your right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following the determination of the external review. If an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the Adverse Benefit Determination, either the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion will be set forth in the determination; or the determination will contain a statement that such rule, guideline, protocol, or other 49 similar criterion was relied upon in making the Adverse Benefit Determination and that a copy of the rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon request. If the Adverse Benefit Determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit, either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applying the terms of the Plan to the claimant's medical circumstances, will be set forth in the determination or the determination will contain a statement that such explanation will be provided free of charge upon request. If the Plan does not strictly adhere to all the requirements of the first level claims and appeals process with respect to a claim, You are deemed to have exhausted the first level claims and appeals process (unless the Plan's failure to strictly adhere to these requirements is 1) de minimis , 2) nonprejudicial, 3) attributable to good cause or matters beyond the Plan's control, 4) in the context of an ongoing good faith exchange of information, and 5) not reflective of a pattern or practice of noncompliance). Accordingly, upon such a failure, You may initiate a second level (external) review (see below) or, if not applicable, pursue any available remedies under applicable law. To the extent the Plan contends that it did not commit a procedural violation based on the five criteria referenced immediately above, You will be entitled, upon written request, to an explanation of the Plan's basis for such an assertion (to be provided within ten days), so that You can make an informed judgment about whether to seek immediate review from an external reviewer or, if not applicable, a court of law. Finally, if the external reviewer or the court of law (as applicable) rejects Your request for immediate review on the basis that the Plan did not engage in a violation, You have the right to resubmit and pursue the first level claims and appeals process. If the Plan denies Your first level appeal, in whole or in part, and You choose to bring a civil action, such action must be filed within 365 days of the date of the Plan's denial of Your first level appeal. This 365 day time period, however, will be temporarily suspended to the extent You are entitled to file a second level (external) appeal (see below) and do in fact file such an appeal. Under such circumstances, this 365 day time period will be suspended from the date You submit a request for a second level (external) appeal that is both complete and eligible until the date of the Independent Review Organization's decision (see below). SECOND LEVEL (EXTERNAL) APPEALS PROCEDURE If the Plan denies Your first level appeal, in whole or in part, such denial is called a Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination. You or Your authorized representative may file a second level (external) appeal of the Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination where the Plan's underlying determination involved 1) a rescission of coverage, 2) medical judgment), or 3) a surprise medical bill or surprise air ambulance bill under the No Surprises Act. To file a second level appeal, You must file a written application with the Plan Administrator. A second level appeal must be filed within 4 months after the Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination is received. If the last filing date would fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the last filing date is extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. The Plan reserves the right to charge a nominal filing fee, as allowed by applicable law. 50 Preliminary review . Within 5 business days following the date of receipt of the second level (external) review request, the Plan must complete a preliminary review of the request to determine whether: a. The claimant is or was covered under the Plan at the time the health care service was requested or, in the case of a retrospective review, was covered under the Plan at the time the health care service was provided; b. The Plan's underlying determination involved 1) a rescission of coverage, 2) medical judgment), or 3) a surprise medical bill or surprise air ambulance bill under the No Surprises Act; c. The claimant has exhausted the Plan's first level appeal process; and d. The claimant has provided all the information and forms required to process a second level review. Within one business day after completion of the preliminary review, the Plan must issue a notification in writing to the claimant. If the request is complete but not eligible for a second level review, such notification must include the reasons for its ineligibility and contact information for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (tollfree number 866444 EBSA). If the request is not complete, such notification must describe the information or materials needed to make the request complete, and the Plan must allow a claimant to perfect the request for the second level review within the fourmonth filing period or within the 48 hour period following the receipt of the notification, whichever is later. Referral to Independent Review Organization . The Plan must assign an independent review organization (\"IRO\") to conduct the second level (external) review. The assigned IRO will timely notify the claimant in writing of the acceptance for the second level review. This notice will include a statement that the claimant may submit in writing to the IRO within 10 business days following the date of receipt of the notice additional information that the IRO must consider when conducting the second level review. The IRO is not required to, but may, accept and consider additional information submitted after 10 business days. Within 5 business days after the date of assignment of the IRO, the Plan must provide to the assigned IRO the documents and any information considered in making the Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination. If the Plan fails to timely provide the documents and information, the IRO may terminate the second level review and make a decision to reverse the Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination. Within one business day after making the decision, the IRO must notify the claimant and the Plan. Upon receipt of any information submitted by the claimant, the IRO must within one business day forward the information to the Plan. Upon receipt of any such information, the Plan may reconsider its Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination that is the subject of the second level review. The second level review may be terminated as a result of the reconsideration only if the Plan decides, upon completion of its reconsideration, to reverse its Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination and provide coverage or payment. Within one business day after making such a decision, the Plan must provide written notice of its decision to the claimant and the IRO. The IRO must terminate the second level review upon receipt of the notice from the Plan. 51 The IRO will review all of the information and documents timely received. In reaching a decision, the IRO will review the claim without deference to the Plan and not be bound by any decisions or conclusions reached during the Plan's internal claims and appeals process. The IRO may also consider the following additional information: The claimant's medical records; The attending health care professional's recommendation; Reports from other health care professionals and other documents submitted by the Plan, claimant or claimant's treating provider; The terms of the Plan to ensure that the IRO's decision is not contrary to the terms of the Plan, unless the terms are inconsistent with applicable law; Appropriate practice guidelines, including evidencebased standards and other guidelines developed by the Federal government, national or professional medical societies, boards and associations; Any applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by the Plan, unless such criteria are inconsistent with the terms of the Plan or applicable law; and The opinion of the IRO's clinical reviewer(s) to the extent the information or documents are available and the clinical reviewer(s) considers appropriate; The IRO must provide written notice of its second level review decision within 45 days after it receives the request for the second level review. The notice must be provided to both the claimant and the Plan, and must include the following: A general description of the reason for the request for the review with enough information to identify the claim, and reason for the Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination; The date the IRO received the assignment to conduct the second level review; The date of the IRO's decision; References to the evidence or documentation, including specific coverage provisions and evidencebased standards, considered in reaching its decision; A discussion of the principal reason(s) for its decision, including the rationale and any evidencebased standards used; A statement that the determination is binding, except to the extent other legal remedies may be available under Federal or state law to the Plan or claimant; A statement that judicial review may be available to the claimant; and Current contact information for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (toll free number 866444EBSA (3272)). The IRO must maintain records of all claims and notices associated with the second level review process for 6 years. An IRO must make such records available for examination by the claimant, Plan, or state or federal oversight agency upon request, except where such disclosure would violate state or federal privacy laws. 52 Reversal of the Plan's decision . Upon receipt of a notice of a final external review decision reversing the Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination, the Plan must immediately pay the claim. For questions about Your appeal rights or for assistance, You can contact the Employee Benefits Security Administration at 1866444EBSA (3272). ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS The Plan will use its best efforts to recognize assignments of benefits from providers of services but is not bound by such assignments, except as required by the No Surprises Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan will not recognize any assignment of a Covered Person's right to bring a cause of action or otherwise initiate a legal proceeding arising from an adverse benefit determination. When payment is made directly to the Covered Person (with or without an assignment), it is solely the responsibility of the Covered Person to reimburse the provider. CLAIM AUDIT Once a written claim for benefits is received, the Plan Administrator, at its discretion, may elect to have such claim reviewed or audited for accuracy, Reasonableness and/or the Usual and Customary nature of charges as part of the adjudication process. This process may include, but not be limited to, identifying charges for items/services that may not be covered or may not have been delivered, duplicate charges and charges beyond the Reasonable and/or Usual and Customary guidelines as determined by the Plan Administrator. COMPLIANCE The Plan shall comply with all federally mandated benefit laws and regulations pertaining to employee benefit plans. The intent of the Plan is to assure full compliance with all appropriate federal laws, rules and regulations and any act or omission through negligence or otherwise which results in any such violation, shall be construed as unintentional. The Claims Processor shall be fully discharged from liability under this Plan. CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR, NAMED FIDUCIARY, AND AGENT FOR SERVICE OF LEGAL PROCESS Same as Employer. CONTRIBUTIONS The benefits provided under the terms of this Plan are purchased through Employer contributions. At the discretion of the Company, Employees may be required to contribute on a payroll deduction basis. ERISA AMENDMENTS Any provision of this Plan that is in conflict with ERISA, which governs this Plan, shall be deemed amended to conform to the minimum requirements of the law. 53 FUNDING This Plan is a Company sponsored selffunded reimbursement program for the benefits described in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. LIENS To the full extent permitted by law, all rights and benefits accruing under this Plan shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or other legal or equitable process, for the debts or liabilities of any Employee. This Plan is not a substitute for and does not affect any requirement for coverage by Workers' Compensation Insurance. NO WAIVER A failure to enforce any provision of this Plan shall not affect any right thereafter to enforce any such provision, nor shall such failure affect any right to enforce any other provision of this Plan. PLAN IS NOT A CONTRACT The Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract between the Company and any Employee or to be a consideration for, or an inducement or condition of, the employment of any Employee. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Employee the right to be retained in the service of the Company or to interfere with the right of the Company to discharge any Employee at any time. PLAN AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION The Company reserves the right to amend, modify, revoke or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time and such amendment, modification, revocation or termination of the Plan shall be made by a written Plan endorsement signed by an authorized representative of the Company. Any such changes to the Plan, which affect participants, will be communicated to such participants by the Plan Administrator. Upon termination of the Plan, the rights of participants to benefits are limited to claims incurred and due up to the date of termination. PROHIBITION ON RESCISSION The Plan cannot rescind coverage except in the case of fraud or an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact. A rescission is a cancellation or discontinuance of coverage that has retroactive effect, unless it is attributable to a failure to pay timely required premiums or contributions towards the cost of coverage. The Plan must provide 30 calendar days advance notice to an individual before coverage may be rescinded. REIMBURSEMENT AND SUBROGATION PROVISIONS PAYMENT CONDITION The Plan, in its sole discretion, may elect to conditionally advance payment of benefits in those situations where an Illness, Injury, or disability is caused in whole or in part by, or results from the acts or omissions of, a Covered Person or a third party, where any party besides the Plan may be responsible for expenses arising from an incident, and/or 54 other funds are available, including but not limited to nofault, uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist, medical payment provisions, third party assets, third party insurance, and/or grantor(s) of a third party (collectively \"Coverage\"). However, such payment of benefits by the Plan shall be made only if the Covered Person first provides a reimbursement agreement in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of any claim in the absence of a signed reimbursement agreement shall not invalidate the obligation of the Covered Person to otherwise reimburse the Plan. The Covered Person (including his attorney, and/or legal guardian of a covered minor or incapacitated individual) agrees that acceptance of the Plan's conditional payment of medical benefits is constructive notice of these provisions in their entirety and agrees to maintain the full extent of payment from any one or combination of first and third party sources in trust, without disruption except for reimbursement to the Plan or the Plan's assignee. By accepting benefits, the Covered Person agrees the Plan shall have an equitable lien on any funds received by the Covered Person and/or his attorney from any source and said funds shall be held in trust until such time as the obligations under this provision are fully satisfied. The Covered Person agrees to include the Plan's name as a copayee on any and all settlement drafts. Further, by accepting benefits, the Covered Person understands that any recovery obtained pursuant to this section is an asset of the Plan to the extent of the amount of benefits paid by the Plan and that the Covered Person shall be a trustee over those Plan assets. In the event a Covered Person settles, recovers, or is reimbursed by any Coverage, the Covered Person agrees to reimburse the Plan for all benefits paid or that will be paid by the Plan on behalf of the Covered Person. If the Covered Person fails to reimburse the Plan out of any judgment or settlement received, the Covered Person will be responsible for any and all expenses (fees and costs) associated with the Plan's attempt to recover such money. If there is more than one party responsible for charges paid by the Plan, or who may be responsible for charges paid by the Plan, the Plan will not be required to select a particular party from whom reimbursement is due. Furthermore, unallocated settlement funds meant to compensate multiple injured parties of which the Covered Person is only one, that unallocated settlement fund is considered designated as an \"identifiable\" fund from which the Plan may seek reimbursement. SUBROGATION As a condition to participating in and receiving benefits under this Plan, the Covered Person agrees to assign to the Plan the right to subrogate and pursue any and all claims, causes of action or rights that may arise against any person, corporation and/or entity and to any Coverage to which the Covered Person is entitled, regardless of how classified or characterized, at the Plan's discretion. If a Covered Person receives or becomes entitled to receive benefits, an automatic equitable lien attaches in favor of the Plan to any claim, which any Covered Person may have against any Coverage and/or party causing the Illness, Injury or disability to the extent of such conditional payment by the Plan plus reasonable costs of collection. The Covered Person is obligated to notify the Plan or its authorized representative of any 55 settlement prior to finalization of the settlement, execution of a release, or receipt of applicable funds. The Covered Person is also obligated to hold any and all funds so received in trust on the Plan's behalf and function as a trustee as applied to those funds until the Plan's rights described herein are honored and the Plan is reimbursed. The Plan may, at its discretion, in its own name or in the name of the Covered Person commence a proceeding or pursue a claim against any party or Coverage for the recovery of all damages to the full extent of the value of any such benefits or conditional payments advanced by the Plan. If the Covered Person fails to file a claim or pursue damages against: a) the responsible party, its insurer, or any other source on behalf of that party; b) any first party insurance through medical payment coverage, personal injury protection, nofault coverage, uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage; c) any policy of insurance from any insurance company or guarantor of a third party; d) worker's compensation or other liability insurance company; or e) any other source, including but not limited to crime victim restitution funds, any medical, disability or other benefit payments, and school insurance coverage; The Covered Person authorizes the Plan to pursue, sue, compromise and/or settle any such claims in the Covered Person's and/or the Plan's name and agrees to fully cooperate with the Plan in the prosecution of any such claims. The Covered Person assigns all rights to the Plan or its assignee to pursue a claim and the recovery of all expenses from any and all sources listed above. RIGHT OF REIMBURSEMENT The Plan shall have the specific right of first recovery (\"reimbursement\"), and as such, shall be entitled to recover 100% of the benefits paid, without deduction for attorneys' fees and costs or application of the common fund doctrine, make whole doctrine, or any other equitable and/or legal theory, without regard to whether the Covered Person is fully compensated by his recovery from all sources. The Plan shall have an equitable lien which supersedes all common law or statutory rules, doctrines, and laws of any state prohibiting assignment of rights which interferes with or compromises in any way the Plan's equitable lien and right to reimbursement. The obligation to reimburse the Plan in full exists regardless of how the judgment or settlement is classified and whether or not the judgment or settlement specifically designates the recovery or a portion of it as including medical, disability, or other expenses. If the Covered Person's recovery is less than the benefits paid, then the Plan is entitled to be paid all of the recovery achieved. Any funds received by the Covered Person are deemed held in constructive trust and should not be dissipated or disbursed until such time as the Covered Person's obligation to reimburse the Plan has been satisfied in accordance with these provisions. The Covered Person is also obligated to hold any and all funds so received in trust on the Plan's behalf and function as a trustee as it applies to those funds until the Plan's rights described herein are honored and the Plan is reimbursed. 56 No court costs, experts' fees, attorneys' fees, filing fees, or other costs or expenses of litigation may be deducted from the Plan's recovery without the prior, express written consent of the Plan. The Plan's right of subrogation and reimbursement will not be reduced or affected as a result of any fault or claim on the part of the Covered Person, whether under the doctrines of causation, comparative fault or contributory negligence, or other similar doctrine in law. Accordingly, any lien reduction statutes, which attempt to apply such laws and reduce a subrogating Plan's recovery will not be applicable to the Plan and will not reduce the Plan's reimbursement rights. These rights of subrogation and reimbursement shall apply without regard to whether any separate written acknowledgment of these rights is required by the Plan and signed by the Covered Person. This provision shall not limit any other remedies of the Plan provided by law. These rights of subrogation and reimbursement shall apply without regard to the location of the event that led to or caused the applicable sickness, injury, disease or disability. COVERED PERSON IS A TRUSTEE OVER PLAN ASSETS Any Covered Person who receives benefits and is therefore subject to the terms of this section is hereby deemed a recipient and holder of Plan assets and is therefore deemed a trustee of the Plan solely as it relates to possession of any funds which may be owed to the Plan as a result of any settlement, judgment or recovery through any other means arising from any injury or accident. By virtue of this status, the Covered Person understands that he/she is required to: a) notify the Plan or its authorized representative of any settlement prior to finalization of the settlement, execution of a release, or receipt of applicable funds; b) instruct his/her attorney to ensure that the Plan and/or its authorized representative is included as a payee on all settlement drafts; c) in circumstances where the Covered Person is not represented by an attorney, instruct the insurance company or any third party from whom the Covered Person obtains a settlement, judgment or other source of coverage to include the Plan or its authorized representative as a payee on the settlement draft; and, d) hold any and all funds so received in trust, on the Plan's behalf, and function as a trustee as it applies to those funds, until the Plan's rights described herein are honored and the Plan is reimbursed. To the extent the Covered Person disputes his/her obligation to the Plan under this section, the Covered Person or any of his/her agents or representatives is also required to hold any/all settlement funds, including the entire settlement if the settlement is less than the Plan's interests, and without reduction in consideration of attorney's fees, for which he/she exercises control, in an account segregated from his/her general accounts or general assets until such time as the dispute is resolved. 57 No Covered Person, beneficiary, or the agents or representatives thereof, exercising control over Plan assets and incurring trustee responsibility in accordance with this section will have any authority to accept any reduction of the Plan's interest on the Plan's behalf. SEPARATION OF FUNDS Benefits paid by the Plan, funds recovered by the Covered Person, and funds held in trust over which the Plan has an equitable lien exist separately from the property and estate of the Covered Person(s), such that the death of the Covered Person, or filing of bankruptcy by the Covered Person(s), will not affect the Plan's equitable lien, the funds over which the Plan has a lien, or the Plan's right to subrogation and reimbursement. WRONGFUL DEATH In the event that the Covered Person dies as a result of his injuries and a wrongful death or survivor claim is asserted against a third party or any Coverage, the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights shall still apply. OBLIGATIONS It is the Covered Person's obligation at all times, both prior to and after payment of medical benefits by the Plan: a) to cooperate with the Plan, or any representatives of the Plan, in protecting its rights, including discovery, attending depositions, and/or cooperating in trial to preserve the Plan's rights; b) to provide the Plan with pertinent information regarding the Illness, Injury, or disability, including accident reports, settlement information and any other requested additional information; c) to take such action and execute such documents as the Plan may require to facilitate enforcement of its subrogation and reimbursement rights, including providing to the Plan an executed reimbursement agreement; d) to do nothing to prejudice the Plan's rights of subrogation and reimbursement; e) to promptly reimburse the Plan when a recovery through settlement, judgment, award or other payment is received; and f) to not settle or release, without the prior consent of the Plan, any claim to the extent that the Covered Person may have against any responsible party or Coverage. If the Covered Person and/or his attorney fails to reimburse the Plan for all benefits paid or to be paid, as a result of said injury or condition, out of any proceeds, judgment or settlement received, the Covered Person will be responsible for any and all expenses (whether fees or costs) associated with the Plan's attempt to recover such money from the Covered Person. The Plan's rights to reimbursement and/or subrogation are in no way dependent upon the Covered Person's cooperation or adherence to these terms. 58 OFFSET Failure by the Covered Person and/or his attorney to comply with any of these requirements may, at the Plan's discretion, result in a forfeiture of payment by the Plan of medical benefits, and any funds, or payments due under this Plan on behalf of the Covered Person may be withheld until the Covered Person satisfies his obligation. MINOR STATUS In the event the Covered Person is a minor as that term is defined by applicable law, the minor's parents or courtappointed guardian shall cooperate in any and all actions by the Plan to seek and obtain requisite court approval to bind the minor and his estate insofar as these subrogation and reimbursement provisions are concerned. If the minor's parents or courtappointed guardian fail to take such action, the Plan shall have no obligation to advance payment of medical benefits on behalf of the minor. Any court costs or legal fees associated with obtaining such approval shall be paid by the minor's parents or courtappointed guardian. SEVERABILITY In the event that any section of this provision is considered invalid or illegal for any reason, said invalidity or illegality shall not affect the remaining sections of this provision and Plan. The section shall be fully severable. The Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid or illegal sections had never been inserted in the Plan. RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NECESSARY INFORMATION For the purpose of determining the applicability of and implementing the terms of these benefits, the Plan Administrator may, without the consent of or notice to any person, release or obtain any information necessary to determine acceptability of any applicant for participation in the Plan. In so acting, the Plan Administrator shall be free from any liability that may arise with regard to such action. Any person claiming benefits under this Plan shall furnish to the Plan Administrator such information as may be necessary to implement this provision. RIGHTS OF RECOVERY Whenever payments have been made by the Plan which are in excess of the maximum amount allowed under the Plan or are otherwise not covered under any provision of the Plan, the Claims Processor or Plan Administrator shall have the right to recover such payments from among one or more of the following: any persons to, for or with respect to whom such payments were made; any providers of service; any insurance companies or any other organizations. Current benefit payments may be reduced to satisfy outstanding reimbursements. SEVERABILITY Should any provision of this Summary Plan Description be declared invalid or illegal for any reason, such invalidity or illegality shall not affect the remaining portions of the Summary Plan Description. Any remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect, as if this Summary Plan Description did not contain the invalid or illegal provision. 59 SUBMISSION OF CLAIM All charges, and corresponding requested documentation, must be submitted by the date specified in the Schedule of Covered Services and Provisions. Failure to do so will result in the denial of the charges. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS Covered Persons shall be furnished summary descriptions of material modifications in the terms of this Plan and changes in the information required to be included in the Summary Plan Description pertaining to this Plan not later than 210 days after the end of the Plan Year in which the change is adopted. However, in the case of any modification or change that is a material reduction in Covered Services or benefits provided under the Plan, Covered Persons will be furnished a summary of such modification or change not later than 60 days after the adoption of the modification or change, unless the Employer provides summaries of modifications or changes at regular intervals of not more than 90 days. SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION The Company will issue to each Employee under the Plan, a document that shall summarize the benefits to which the person is entitled, to whom the benefits are payable, and the provisions of the Plan principally affecting the Employee. This document is intended to satisfy the requirement for both a Summary Plan Description and Plan Description as specified under ERISA. SYSTEM FOR PROCESSING CLAIMS Claims will be processed on the following basis: 1) first, any noncovered services or services in excess of Plan provisions will be subtracted from billed charges; 2) then, Reasonable and/or Usual and Customary limitations will be applied (if applicable); 3) then, any reduction authorized by agreements with provider networks will be applied to charges from network providers; and 4) then, any Deductible/Co Insurance or uncollected copays will be deducted from the remaining eligible amount prior to payment. TYPE OF ADMINISTRATION The Plan is selfadministered by the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator has hired a Claims Processor to process claims and provide consulting services and ministerial functions. 60 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) The Coordination of Benefits provision is intended to prevent payments of benefits that exceed expenses. It applies when any other plan or plans also cover the person covered by this Plan. When more than one coverage exists, one plan normally pays its benefits in full and the other plans pay a reduced benefit. This Plan will always pay either its benefits in full or a reduced amount which, when added to the benefits payable by the other plan or plans, will not exceed 100% of allowable expenses. Only the amount paid by the Plan will be charged against the Plan maximums. See Schedule of Covered Services and Provisions to determine the type of Coordination of Benefits this Plan provides. To coordinate benefits, it is necessary to determine in what order the benefits of various Plans are payable. This is determined as follows: 1. If a plan does not have a provision for the coordination of benefits, its benefits are payable before this Plan. 2. If a plan covers a person other than as a Dependent, its benefits are payable before this Plan. This includes Medicare covering a person other than as a Dependent (e.g. a retired Employee) and any Medicare Supplement Plan. However, in all instances, federal regulations regarding Medicare as a secondary payer will apply. 3. If a plan covers an active Employee, its benefits are payable before this Plan. This order of determination does not supersede No. 2 above. 4. If an individual is covered as a Dependent under 2 separate plans, the benefits are payable first under the Employee's plan having the earliest birthday in a Calendar Year. However, if the Dependent is a child whose parents are separated or divorced, the \"birthday rule\" does not apply. The following order to determination will apply: If the parent with custody has not remarried: a) The plan of the parent with custody is primary. b) The plan of the parent without custody is secondary. If the parent with custody has remarried: a) The plan of the parent with custody is primary. b) The plan of the stepparent with custody is secondary. c) The plan of the parent without custody is tertiary (third). There may be a court decree that makes one parent financially responsible for the health care expenses incurred by the child. If a plan covers the child as a Dependent of that parent, its benefits are payable before those of a plan that covers the child as a Dependent of the parent without financial responsibility. 5. If a plan covers an individual who is also allowed to be covered by this Plan pursuant to COBRA continuation coverage, its benefits are payable before this Plan. 6. If items 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 do not apply, the benefits of a plan that has covered the person for the longest period of time will be payable before those of the other plan. To the extent that the Plan would be secondary to Medicare, if a Covered Person is eligible for Medicare Part A and/or Part B and does not elect to enroll in such Medicare coverage, then Plan benefits will be coordinated based on an estimate of what Medicare would have paid, regardless of whether benefits are actually received from Medicare. 61 Any other \"plan\" means and includes, but is not necessarily limited to the following: any policy, contract or other arrangement for group insurance benefits, including any Hospital or medical service organization plan or other service or prepayment plan arranged through any employer, union, trustee, Employee benefit association, government agency or professional association; or any homeowner's policy or other policy providing liability coverage; or any coverage for students sponsored by or provided through a school or other educational institution; or any coverage provided by a licensed Health Maintenance Organization (HMO); or any individual or nongroup health coverage, of which the Plan Administrator is actually aware, including but not limited to a plan or policy purchased or made available through a state or federally managed Health Insurance Marketplace; or any benefits payable under Medicare (to the extent permitted by law); or any government program or any coverage provided by statute. The term \"plan\" shall also mean any mandatory \"nofault\" automobile insurance coverage providing benefits under a medical expense reimbursement provision for Hospital, medical, or other health care services and treatment because of accidental bodily Injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident; and any other payment received under any automobile policy. To administer this provision, the Company has the right to: 1. Release or obtain data needed to determine the benefits payable under this provision 2. Recover any sum paid above the amount that is required by this provision and 3. Repay any party for a payment made by the party, when the Company should have made the payment. 62 COMPLIANCE REGULATIONS STATEMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER THE NEWBORNS' AND MOTHERS' HEALTH PROTECTION ACT Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage generally may not restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section. However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., Your Physician, nurse midwife or physician assistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, under federal law, plans and issuers may not set the level of benefits or outofpocket costs so that any later portion of the 48hour (or 96 hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a Physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain providers or facilities, or to reduce Your outofpocket costs, You may be required to obtain precertification. For information on precertification, contact Your Plan Administrator. SOURCE OF INJURY RESTRICTIONS The Plan will not limit coverage for Injuries or Illnesses resulting from 1) domestic violence, or 2) selfinflicted injury or attempted suicide. Further, the Plan will not limit coverage for Injuries or Illnesses resulting from participation in any activity if such Illness or Injury is as a result of a physical or mental condition. WELLNESS VS. RISK FACTORS The Plan will not charge Covered Persons who have adverse health factors, or who participate in certain adverse lifestyle activities, more than those similarly situated Covered Persons who do not have such factors or participate in such activities.* Further, the Plan will not provide rewards to Covered Persons who participate in, or meet the requirements of, positive lifestyle activities in excess of what is offered to those similarly situated Covered Persons who do not participate in, or meet the requirements of, such activities.* * Except as such differential treatment is allowed through the incorporation of wellness program(s) meeting federally approved guidelines. FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) The following applies to companies with 50 or more employees If the Covered Person is entitled to, and elects to take, a family or medical leave solely under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), the Covered Person and his covered Dependents shall continue to be covered under this Plan while the Covered Person is absent from work on an FMLA leave as if there were no interruption of active employment. Provided the applicable premium is paid, such coverage will continue until the earlier of the expiration of such leave or the date notice is given to the Company that the Covered Person does not intend to return to work at the end of the FMLA leave. 63 The Covered Person may choose not to retain health coverage during the FMLA leave. If he returns to active working status on or before the expiration of the leave, he is entitled to have coverage reinstated on the same basis as it would have been if the leave had not been taken. (Coverage will be reinstated without any additional qualification requirements imposed by this Plan. This Plan's provisions with respect to Deductibles and percentage of payments will apply on the same basis as they did prior to the FMLA leave.) MILITARY LEAVES If You are absent from work due to military service, You may elect to continue coverage under the Plan (including coverage for enrolled Dependents) for up to 24 months from the first day of absence (or, if earlier, until the day after the date You are required to apply for or return to active employment with Your Employer under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA)). Your contributions for continued coverage will be the same as for a COBRA beneficiary, except that, if You are absent for 30 days or less, Your contribution will be the same as for similarly situated active participants in the Plan. Whether or not You continue coverage during military service, You may reinstate coverage under the Plan on Your return to employment under USERRA. The reinstatement will be without any waiting period otherwise required under the Plan, except to the extent that You had not fully completed any required waiting period prior to the start of military service. GENETIC INFORMATION The Plan may not adjust premium or contribution amounts for those covered under the Plan on the basis of genetic information. The Plan may also not request, require or purchase genetic information for underwriting purposes (or in connection with any individual prior to such individual's enrollment under the Plan). The term \"underwriting\" covers rules relating to the determination of eligibility (including enrollment and continued eligibility) for Plan benefits or coverage, the computation of premium or contribution amounts and any activities relating to the creation, renewal, or replacement of the Plan. This Plan is prohibited from requesting or requiring genetic testing on the part of an individual or his family members. Genetic tests include analysis of human DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, or metabolites that detect genotypes, mutations, or chromosomal changes. The term \"genetic test\" does not mean an analysis of proteins or metabolites that does not detect genotypes, mutations, or chromosomal changes; or an analysis of proteins or metabolites that is directly related to a manifested disease, disorder, or pathological condition that could reasonably be detected by a health care professional with appropriate training and expertise in the field of medicine involved. The Plan may obtain and use the results of a genetic test when making payment determinations (so long as only the minimum amount of information is utilized necessary for the determination). A plan may request (but not require) that a participant undergo a genetic test if 1) the plan clearly indicates that compliance is voluntary, and that noncompliance will have no effect on enrollment status or premium/contribution amounts, 2) no genetic information collected is used for underwriting purposes, and 3) the plan notify the applicable federal government agency that the plan is conducting activities pursuant to this exception and includes a description of the activities. 64 NOTICE OF CONTINUATION COVERAGE RIGHTS UNDER COBRA INTRODUCTION This notice contains important information about Your rights to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan. This notice generally explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to You and Your family, and what You need to do to protect the right to receive it. The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to You and other members of Your family when group health coverage would otherwise end. For more information about Your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, You should review the Plan's Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator. You may have other options available to You when You lose group health coverage . For example, You may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, You may qualify for lower costs on Your monthly premiums and lower outofpocket costs. Additionally, You may qualify for a 30day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which You are eligible (such as a spouse's plan), even if that plan generally doesn't accept late enrollees. WHAT IS COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE? COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event. This is also called a \"qualifying event\". Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, Your spouse, and Your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. If You're an employee, You'll become a qualified beneficiary if You lose Your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events: Your hours of employment are reduced, or Your employment ends for any reason other than Your gross misconduct. If You're the spouse of an employee, You will become a qualified beneficiary if You lose Your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events: Your spouse dies; Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or You become divorced or legally separated from Your spouse. 65 Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events: The parentemployee dies; The parentemployee's hours of employment are reduced; The parentemployee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; The parentemployee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both); The parents become divorced or legally separated; or The child stops being eligible for coverage under the plan as a \"dependent child.\" Sometimes, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to Your employer, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired employee covered under the Plan, the retired employee will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy. The retired employee's spouse, surviving spouse, and dependent children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under the Plan. WHEN IS COBRA COVERAGE AVAILABLE? The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the employee, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer (if the Plan provides retiree coverage), or the employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), the employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the qualifying event. For all other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), You must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs. You must send this notice in writing to the Plan Administrator. IF YOU, YOUR SPOUSE OR YOUR DEPENDENT FAIL TO PROVIDE TIMELY WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR AFTER A DIVORCE, LEGAL SEPARATION OR LOSS OF DEPENDENT CHILD ELIGIBILITY, THE RIGHT TO ELECT TO PURCHASE COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE IS WAIVED. HOW IS COBRA COVERAGE PROVIDED? Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to employment termination or reduction of hours of work. 66 Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage. There are also ways in which this 18 month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended. DISABILITY EXTENSION OF 18MONTH PERIOD OF CONTINUATION COVERAGE If You or anyone in Your family covered under the Plan is determined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled and You notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, You and Your entire family may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a total maximum of 29 months. The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18month period of continuation coverage. A copy of the determination of disability by the Social Security Administration must be sent to the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the date the determination is issued and before the end of the 18month maximum coverage period that applies to the qualifying event. Any individual who is either the employee, a qualified beneficiary with respect to the qualifying event, or any representative acting on behalf of the employee or qualified beneficiary, may send the written notice to the Plan Administrator. Such individual(s) must further notify the Plan Administrator in writing within 30 days after a determination has been made that the person is no longer disabled. The Plan may require the payment of an amount that is up to 150 percent of the applicable premium for the period of extended coverage as long as the disabled individual is included in the extended coverage period. SECOND QUALIFYING EVENT EXTENSION OF 18MONTH PERIOD OF CONTINUATION COVERAGE If Your family experiences another qualifying event while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in Your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is properly notified about the second qualifying event. This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children receiving continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies, becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or gets divorced or legally separated, or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child, but only if the event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. ARE THERE OTHER COVERAGE OPTIONS BESIDES COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE? Yes, instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for You and Your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about these options at www.HealthCare.gov . 67 You should compare Your other coverage options with COBRA continuation coverage and choose the coverage that is best for You. For example, if You move to other coverage You may pay more out of pocket than You would under COBRA because the new coverage may impose a new deductible. When You lose jobbased health coverage, it's important that You choose carefully between COBRA continuation coverage and other coverage options, because once You've made Your choice, it can be difficult or impossible to switch to another coverage option. WHAT IS THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE? The Marketplace allows You to find and compare private health insurance options. In the Marketplace, You could be eligible for a new kind of tax credit that lowers Your monthly premiums and costsharing reductions (amounts that lower Your outofpocket costs for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments) right away, and You can see what Your premium, deductibles, and outofpocket costs will be before You make a decision to enroll. Through the Marketplace You'll also learn if You qualify for free or lowcost coverage from Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) . You can access the Marketplace for Your state at www.HealthCare.gov . Coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. WHEN CAN I ENROLL IN MARKETPLACE COVERAGE? You always have 60 days from the time You lose Your jobbased coverage to enroll in the Marketplace. That is because losing Your jobbased health coverage is a \"special enrollment\" event. After 60 days Your special enrollment period will end and You may not be able to enroll, so You should take action right away. In addition, during what is called an \"open enrollment\" period, anyone can enroll in Marketplace coverage. To find out more about enrolling in the Marketplace, such as when the next open enrollment period will be and what You need to know about qualifying events and special enrollment periods, visit www.HealthCare.gov . IF I SIGN UP FOR COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE, CAN I SWITCH TO COVERAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE? WHAT ABOUT IF I CHOOSE MARKETPLACE COVERAGE AND WANT TO SWITCH BACK TO COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE? If You sign up for COBRA continuation coverage, You can switch to a Marketplace plan during a Marketplace open enrollment period. You can also end Your COBRA continuation coverage early and switch to a Marketplace plan if You have another qualifying event such as marriage or birth of a child through something called a \"special enrollment period.\" But be careful though if You terminate Your COBRA continuation coverage early without another qualifying event, You'll have to wait to enroll in Marketplace coverage until the next open enrollment period, and could end up without any health coverage in the interim. 68 Once You've exhausted Your COBRA continuation coverage and the coverage expires, You'll be eligible to enroll in Marketplace coverage through a special enrollment period, even if Marketplace open enrollment has ended. If You sign up for Marketplace coverage instead of COBRA continuation coverage, You cannot switch to COBRA continuation coverage under any circumstances. WHAT FACTORS SHOULD I CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING COVERAGE OPTIONS? When considering Your options for health coverage, You may want to think about: Premiums: Your previous plan can charge up to 102% of total plan premiums for COBRA coverage. Other options, like coverage on a spouse's plan or through the Marketplace, may be less expensive. Provider Networks: If You're currently getting care or treatment for a condition, a change in Your health coverage may affect Your access to a particular health care provider. You may want to check to see if Your current health care providers participate in a network as You consider options for health coverage. Drug Formularies: If You're currently taking medication, a change in Your health coverage may affect Your costs for medication - and in some cases, Your medication may not be covered by another plan. You may want to check to see if Your current medications are listed in drug formularies for other health coverage. Severance payments: If You lost Your job and got a severance package from Your former employer, Your former employer may have offered to pay some or all of Your COBRA payments for a period of time. In this scenario, You may want to contact the Department of Labor at 18664443272 to discuss Your options. Service Areas: Some plans limit their benefits to specific service or coverage areas - so if You move to another area of the country, You may not be able to use Your benefits. You may want to see if Your plan has a service or coverage area, or other similar limitations. Other CostSharing: In addition to premiums or contributions for health coverage, You probably pay copayments, deductibles, coinsurance, or other amounts as You use Your benefits. You may want to check to see what the cost sharing requirements are for other health coverage options. For example, one option may have much lower monthly premiums, but a much higher deductible and higher copayments.

You or Your Dependents may have to pay for such coverage. Review this Summary Plan Description and the documents governing the Plan on the rules governing Your COBRA continuation coverage rights. PRUDENT ACTIONS BY PLAN FIDUCIARIES In addition to creating rights for Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit Plan. The people who operate the Plan, called \"fiduciaries\" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of You and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. No one, including Your employer, Your union, or any other person, may fire You or otherwise discriminate against You in any way to prevent You from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising Your rights under ERISA. ENFORCE YOUR RIGHTS If Your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, or if Your coverage was rescinded, You have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision, without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. 71 Under ERISA, there are steps You can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if You request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, You may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay You up to $110 a day until You receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If You have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, or if Your coverage was rescinded, You may file suit in a state or Federal court, subject to the procedures discussed in the Section \"APPEALING A CLAIM\" under \"GENERAL PROVISIONS.\" In addition, if You disagree with the Plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, You may file suit in Federal court. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if You are discriminated against for asserting Your rights, You may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or You may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If You are successful, the court may order the person You have sued to pay these costs and fees. If You lose, the court may order You to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds Your claim is frivolous. ASSISTANCE WITH YOUR QUESTIONS If You have any questions about Your Plan, You should contact the Plan Administrator. If You have any questions about this statement or about Your rights under ERISA, or if You need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, You should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Services Administration (EBSA), U.S. Department of Labor, listed in Your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Services Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington D.C. 20210.

Other Disclosures and Uses of PHI With respect to all other uses and disclosures of PHI, the Plan shall comply with the Privacy Standards. 75 NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT COVERED PERSONS MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW COVERED PERSONS CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY. This Notice of Privacy Practices (\"Notice\") describes how protected health information may be used or disclosed by this Plan to carry out treatment, payment, health care operations and for other purposes that are permitted or required by law. This Notice also sets out this Plan's legal obligations concerning a Covered Person's protected health information and describes a Covered Person's rights to access, amend and manage that protected health information. Protected health information (\"PHI\") is individually identifiable health information, including demographic information, collected from a Covered Person or created or received by a health care provider, a health plan, an employer (when functioning on behalf of the group health plan), or a health care clearinghouse and that relates to: (1) a Covered Person's past, present or future physical or mental health or condition; (2) the provision of health care to a Covered Person; or (3) the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to a Covered Person. This Notice has been drafted to be consistent with what is known as the \"HIPAA Privacy Rule,\" and any of the terms not defined in this Notice should have the same meaning as they have in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. If You have any questions or want additional information about the Notice or the policies and procedures described in the Notice, please contact the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document: THE PLAN'S RESPONSIBILITIES The Plan is required by law to maintain the privacy of a Covered Person's PHI. The Plan is obligated to provide the Covered Person with a copy of this Notice of the Plan's legal duties and of its privacy practices with respect to the Covered Person's PHI, abide by the terms of the Notice that is currently in effect, and notify the Covered Person in the event of a breach of the Covered Person's unsecured PHI. The Plan reserves the right to change the provisions of this Notice and make the new provisions effective for all PHI that is maintained. If the Plan makes a material change to this Notice, a revised Notice will be mailed to the address that the Plan has on record. When using or disclosing PHI or when requesting PHI from another covered entity, the Plan will make reasonable efforts not to use, disclose or request more than the minimum amount of PHI necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure or request, taking into consideration practical and technological limitations. Genetic information shall be treated as health information pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The use or disclosure by the Plan of protected health information that is genetic information about an individual for underwriting purposes under the Plan shall not be a permitted use or disclosure. 76 However, the minimum necessary standard will not apply in the following situations: disclosures to or requests by a health care provider for treatment; uses or disclosures made to the individual; disclosures made to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; uses or disclosures that are required by law; uses or disclosures that are required for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule; and uses or disclosures made pursuant to an authorization. This Notice does not apply to information that has been deidentified. Deidentified information is health information that does not identify an individual and with respect to which there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. It is not individually identifiable health information. PERMISSIBLE USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PHI The following is a description of how the Plan is most likely to use and/or disclose a Covered Person's PHI. TREATMENT, PAYMENT AND HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS The Plan has the right to use and disclose a Covered Person's PHI for all activities that are included within the definitions of \"treatment, payment and health care operations\" as described in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. TREATMENT The Plan will use or disclose PHI so that a Covered Person may seek treatment. Treatment is the provision, coordination or management of health care and related services. It also includes, but is not limited to consultations and referrals between one or more of a Covered Person's providers. For example, the Plan may disclose to a treating specialist the name of a Covered Person's primary care physician so that the specialist may request medical records from that primary care physician. PAYMENT The Plan will use or disclose PHI to pay claims for services provided to a Covered Person and to obtain stoploss reimbursements, if applicable, or to otherwise fulfill the Plan's responsibilities for coverage and providing benefits. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI when a provider requests information regarding a Covered Person's eligibility for coverage under this Plan, or the Plan may use PHI to determine if a treatment that was received was medically necessary. HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS The Plan will use or disclose PHI to support its business functions. These functions include, but are not limited to quality assessment and improvement, reviewing provider performance, licensing, stoploss underwriting, business planning and business development. For example, the Plan may use or disclose PHI: (1) to provide a Covered Person with information about a disease management program; (2) to respond to a customer service inquiry from a 77 Covered Person or (3) in connection with fraud and abuse detection and compliance programs. POTENTIAL IMPACT OF STATE LAW The HIPAA Privacy Regulations generally do not \"preempt\" (or take precedence over) state privacy or other applicable laws that provide individuals greater privacy protections. As a result, to the extent state law applies, the privacy laws of a particular state, or other federal laws, rather than the HIPAA Privacy Regulations, might impose a privacy standard under which the Plan will be required to operate. For example, where such laws have been enacted, the Plan will follow more stringent state privacy laws that relate to uses and disclosures of PHI concerning HIV or AIDS, mental health, substance abuse/chemical dependency, genetic testing, reproductive rights, etc. OTHER PERMISSIBLE USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PHI The following is a description of other possible ways in which the Plan may (and is permitted to) use and/or disclose PHI. REQUIRED BY LAW The Plan may use or disclose PHI to the extent the law requires the use or disclosure. When used in this Notice, \"required by law\" is defined as it is in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI when required by national security laws or public health disclosure laws. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES The Plan may use or disclose PHI for public health activities that are permitted or required by law. For example, the Plan may use or disclose information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability, or it may disclose such information to a public health authority authorized to receive reports of child abuse or neglect. The Plan also may disclose PHI, if directed by a public health authority, to a foreign government agency that is collaborating with the public health authority. HEALTH OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES The Plan may disclose PHI to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law, such as: audits; investigations; inspections; licensure or disciplinary actions; or civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings or actions. Oversight agencies seeking this information include government agencies that oversee: (1) the health care system; (2) government benefit programs; (3) other government regulatory programs and (4) compliance with civil rights laws. ABUSE OR NEGLECT The Plan may disclose PHI to a government authority that is authorized by law to receive reports of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. Additionally, as required by law, the Plan may disclose to a governmental entity, authorized to receive such information, a Covered Person's PHI if there is reason to believe that the Covered Person has been a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. 78 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Plan may disclose PHI: (1) in the course of any judicial or administrative proceeding; (2) in response to an order of a court or administrative tribunal (to the extent such disclosure is expressly authorized) and (3) in response to a subpoena, a discovery request, or other lawful process, once the Plan has met all administrative requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI in response to a subpoena for such information, but only after first meeting certain conditions required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. LAW ENFORCEMENT Under certain conditions, the Plan also may disclose PHI to law enforcement officials. For example, some of the reasons for such a disclosure may include, but not be limited to: (1) it is required by law or some other legal process; (2) it is necessary to locate or identify a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person or (3) it is necessary to provide evidence of a crime. CORONERS, MEDICAL EXAMINERS, FUNERAL DIRECTORS, AND ORGAN DONATION ORGANIZATIONS The Plan may disclose PHI to a coroner or medical examiner for purposes of identifying a deceased person, determining a cause of death or for the coroner or medical examiner to perform other duties authorized by law. The Plan also may disclose, as authorized by law, information to funeral directors so that they may carry out their duties. Further, the Plan may disclose PHI to organizations that handle organ, eye or tissue donation and transplantation. RESEARCH The Plan may disclose PHI to researchers when an institutional review board or privacy board has: (1) reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of the information and (2) approved the research. TO PREVENT A SERIOUS THREAT TO HEALTH OR SAFETY Consistent with applicable federal and state laws, the Plan may disclose PHI if there is reason to believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public. The Plan also may disclose PHI if it is necessary for law enforcement authorities to identify or apprehend an individual. MILITARY ACTIVITY AND NATIONAL SECURITY, PROTECTIVE SERVICES Under certain conditions, the Plan may disclose PHI if Covered Persons are, or were, Armed Forces personnel for activities deemed necessary by appropriate military command authorities. If Covered Persons are members of foreign military service, the Plan may disclose, in certain circumstances, PHI to the foreign military authority. The Plan also may disclose PHI to authorized federal officials for conducting national security and intelligence activities, and for the protection of the President, other authorized persons or heads of state. 79 INMATES If a Covered Person is an inmate of a correctional institution, the Plan may disclose PHI to the correctional institution or to a law enforcement official for: (1) the institution to provide health care to the Covered Person; (2) the Covered Person's health and safety and the health and safety of others or (3) the safety and security of the correctional institution. WORKERS' COMPENSATION The Plan may disclose PHI to comply with workers' compensation laws and other similar programs that provide benefits for workrelated injuries or illnesses. EMERGENCY SITUATIONS The Plan may disclose PHI of a Covered Person in an emergency situation, or if the Covered Person is incapacitated or not present, to a family member, close personal friend, authorized disaster relief agency, or any other person previously identified by the Covered Person. The Plan will use professional judgment and experience to determine if the disclosure is in the best interests of the Covered Person. If the disclosure is in the best interest of the Covered Person, the Plan will disclose only the PHI that is directly relevant to the person's involvement in the care of the Covered Person. FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES The Plan may use or disclose the PHI of a Covered Person for fundraising activities, such as raising money for a charitable foundation or similar entity to help finance its activities. If the Plan does contact the Covered Person for fundraising activities, the Plan will give the Covered Person the opportunity to optout, or stop, receiving such communications in the future. GROUP HEALTH PLAN DISCLOSURES The Plan may disclose the PHI of a Covered Person to a sponsor of the group health plan - such as an employer or other entity - that is providing a health care program to the Covered Person. The Plan can disclose the PHI of the Covered Person to that entity if that entity has contracted with the Plan to administer the Covered Person's health care program on its behalf. UNDERWRITING PURPOSES The Plan may use or disclose the PHI of a Covered Person for underwriting purposes, such as to make a determination about a coverage application or request. If the Plan does use or disclose the PHI of the Covered Person for underwriting purposes, the Plan is prohibited from using or disclosing in the underwriting process the PHI of the Covered Person that is genetic information. OTHERS INVOLVED IN YOUR HEALTH CARE Using its best judgment, the Plan may make PHI known to a family member, other relative, close personal friend or other personal representative that the Covered Person identifies. Such use will be based on how involved the person is in the Covered Person's care or in the payment that relates to that care. The Plan may release information to parents or guardians, if allowed by law. 80 If a Covered Person is not present or able to agree to these disclosures of PHI, then, using its professional judgment, the Plan may determine whether the disclosure is in the Covered Person's best interest. REQUIRED DISCLOSURES OF PHI The following is a description of disclosures that the Plan is required by law to make. DISCLOSURES TO THE SECRETARY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES The Plan is required to disclose PHI to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services when the Secretary is investigating or determining the Plan's compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. DISCLOSURES TO COVERED PERSONS The Plan is required to disclose to a Covered Person most of the PHI in a \"designated record set\" when that Covered Person requests access to this information. Generally, a designated record set contains medical and billing records, as well as other records that are used to make decisions about a Covered Person's health care benefits. The Plan also is required to provide, upon the Covered Person's request, an accounting of most disclosures of his PHI that are for reasons other than treatment, payment and health care operations and are not disclosed through a signed authorization. The Plan will disclose a Covered Person's PHI to an individual who has been designated by that Covered Person as his personal representative and who has qualified for such designation in accordance with relevant state law. However, before the Plan will disclose PHI to such a person, the Covered Person must submit a written notice of his designation, along with the documentation that supports his qualification (such as a power of attorney). Even if the Covered Person designates a personal representative, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the Plan to elect not to treat that individual as the Covered Person's personal representative if a reasonable belief exists that: (1) the Covered Person has been, or may be, subjected to domestic violence, abuse or neglect by such person; (2) treating such person as his personal representative could endanger the Covered Person, or (3) the Plan determines, in the exercise of its professional judgment, that it is not in its best interest to treat that individual as the Covered Person's personal representative. BUSINESS ASSOCIATES The Plan contracts with individuals and entities (Business Associates) to perform various functions on its behalf or to provide certain types of services. To perform these functions or to provide the services, the Plan's Business Associates will receive, create, maintain, use or disclose PHI, but only after the Plan requires the Business Associates to agree in writing to contract terms designed to appropriately safeguard PHI. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI to a Business Associate to administer claims or to provide service support, utilization management, subrogation or pharmacy benefit management. 81 Examples of the Plan's Business Associates would be its third party administrator, broker, preferred provider organization and utilization review vendor. OTHER COVERED ENTITIES The Plan may use or disclose PHI to assist health care providers in connection with their treatment or payment activities or to assist other covered entities in connection with payment activities and certain health care operations. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI to a health care provider when needed by the provider to render treatment to a Covered Person, and the Plan may disclose PHI to another covered entity to conduct health care operations in the areas of fraud and abuse detection or compliance, quality assurance and improvement activities or accreditation, certification, licensing or credentialing. This also means that the Plan may disclose or share PHI with other insurance carriers in order to coordinate benefits, if a Covered Person has coverage through another carrier. PLAN SPONSOR The Plan may disclose PHI to the Plan Sponsor of the group health plan for purposes of plan administration or pursuant to an authorization request signed by the Covered Person. Also, the Plan may use or disclose \"summary health information\" to the Plan Sponsor for obtaining premium bids or modifying, amending or terminating the group health plan. Summary health information summarizes the claims history, claims expenses or types of claims experienced by individuals for whom a Plan Sponsor has provided health benefits under a group health plan and from which identifying information has been deleted in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PHI THAT REQUIRE A COVERED PERSON'S AUTHORIZATION SALE OF PHI The Plan will request the written authorization of a Covered Person before the Plan makes any disclosure that is deemed a sale of the Covered Person's PHI, meaning that the Plan is receiving compensation for disclosing the PHI in this manner. MARKETING The Plan will request the written authorization of a Covered Person to use or disclose the Covered Person's PHI for marketing purposes with limited exceptions, such as when the Plan has facetoface marketing communications with the Covered Person or when the Plan provides promotional gifts of nominal value. PSYCHOTHERAPY NOTES The Plan will request the written authorization of a Covered Person to use or disclose any of the Covered Person's psychotherapy notes that the Plan may have on file with limited exception, such as for certain treatment, payment or health care operation functions. 82 Other uses and disclosures of PHI that are not described previously will be made only with a Covered Person's written authorization. If the Covered Person provides the Plan with such an authorization, he/she may revoke the authorization in writing, and this revocation will be effective for future uses and disclosures of PHI. However, the revocation will not be effective for information that has already been used or disclosed, relying on the authorization. A COVERED PERSON'S RIGHTS The following is a description of a Covered Person's rights with respect to PHI: RIGHT TO REQUEST A RESTRICTION A Covered Person has the right to request a restriction on the PHI the Plan uses or discloses about him/her for treatment, payment or health care operations. The Plan is not required to agree to any restriction that a Covered Person may request. If the Plan does agree to the restriction, it will comply with the restriction unless the information is needed to provide emergency treatment. A Covered Person may request a restriction by contacting the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. It is important that the Covered Person directs his request for restriction to this individual or office so that the Plan can begin to process Your request. Requests sent to individuals or offices other than the one indicated might delay processing the request. The Plan will want to receive this information in writing and will instruct the Covered Person where to send the request when the Covered Person's call is received. In this request, it is important that the Covered Person states: (1) the information whose disclosure he/she wants to limit and (2) how he/she wants to limit the Plan's use and/or disclosure of the information. RIGHT TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS If a Covered Person believes that a disclosure of all or part of his PHI may endanger him/her, that Covered Person may request that the Plan communicates with him/her regarding PHI in an alternative manner or at an alternative location. For example, the Covered Person may ask that the Plan only contact the Covered Person at a work address or via the Covered Person's work email. The Covered Person may request a restriction by contacting the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. It is important that the request for confidential communications is addressed to this individual or office so that the Plan can begin to process the request. Requests sent to individuals or offices other than the one indicated might delay processing the request. The Plan will want to receive this information in writing and will instruct the Covered Person where to send a written request upon receiving a call. This written request should inform the Plan: (1) that he/she wants the Plan to communicate his PHI in an alternative manner or at an alternative location and 83 (2) that the disclosure of all or part of this PHI in a manner inconsistent with these instructions would put the Covered Person in danger. The Plan will accommodate a request for confidential communications that is reasonable and that states that the disclosure of all or part of a Covered Person's PHI could endanger that Covered Person. As permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, \"reasonableness\" will (and is permitted to) include, when appropriate, making alternate arrangements regarding payment. Accordingly, as a condition of granting a Covered Person's request, he/she will be required to provide the Plan information concerning how payment will be handled. For example, if the Covered Person submits a claim for payment, state or federal law (or the Plan's own contractual obligations) may require that the Plan disclose certain financial claim information to the Plan Participant under whose coverage a Covered Person may receive benefits (e.g., an Explanation of Benefits \"EOB\"). Unless the Covered Person has made other payment arrangements, the EOB (in which a Covered Person's PHI might be included) will be released to the Plan Participant. Once the Plan receives all the information for such a request (along with the instructions for handling future communications), the request will be processed usually within 2 business days or as soon as reasonably possible. Prior to receiving the information necessary for this request, or during the time it takes to process it, PHI may be disclosed (such as through an EOB). Therefore, it is extremely important that the Covered Person contact the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document as soon as the Covered Person determines the need to restrict disclosures of his PHI. If the Covered Person terminates his request for confidential communications, the restriction will be removed for all of the Covered Person's PHI that the Plan holds, including PHI that was previously protected. Therefore, a Covered Person should not terminate a request for confidential communications if that person remains concerned that disclosure of PHI will endanger him/her. RIGHT TO INSPECT AND COPY A Covered Person has the right to inspect and copy PHI that is contained in a \"designated record set.\" Generally, a designated record set contains medical and billing records, as well as other records that are used to make decisions about a Covered Person's health care benefits. However, the Covered Person may not inspect or copy psychotherapy notes or certain other information that may be contained in a designated record set. To inspect and copy PHI that is contained in a designated record set, the Covered Person must submit a request by contacting the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. It is important that the Covered Person contact this individual or office to request an inspection and copying so that the Plan can begin to process the request. Requests sent to individuals or offices other than the one indicated might delay the processing of the request. If the Covered Person 84 requests a copy of the information, the Plan may charge a fee for the costs of copying, mailing or other supplies associated with that request. The Plan may deny a Covered Person's request to inspect and copy PHI in certain limited circumstances. If a Covered Person is denied access to information, he/she may request that the denial be reviewed. To request a review, the Covered Person must contact the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. A licensed health care professional chosen by the Plan will review the Covered Person's request and the denial. The person performing this review will not be the same one who denied the Covered Person's initial request. Under certain conditions, the Plan's denial will not be reviewable. If this event occurs, the Plan will inform the Covered Person through the denial that the decision is not reviewable. RIGHT TO AMEND If a Covered Person believes that his PHI is incorrect or incomplete, he/she may request that the Plan amend that information. The Covered Person may request that the Plan amend such information by contacting the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. Additionally, this request should include the reason the amendment is necessary. It is important that the Covered Person direct this request for amendment to this individual or office so that the Plan can begin to process the request. Requests sent to individuals or offices other than the one indicated might delay processing the request. In certain cases, the Plan may deny the Covered Person's request for an amendment. For example, the Plan may deny the request if the information the Covered Person wants to amend is not maintained by the Plan, but by another entity. If the Plan denies the request, the Covered Person has the right to file a statement of disagreement with the Plan. This statement of disagreement will be linked with the disputed information and all future disclosures of the disputed information will include this statement. RIGHT OF AN ACCOUNTING The Covered Person has a right to an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI that are for reasons other than treatment, payment or health care operations. No accounting of disclosures is required for disclosures made pursuant to a signed authorization by the Covered Person or his personal representative. The Covered Person should know that most disclosures of PHI will be for purposes of payment or health care operations, and, therefore, will not be subject to this right. There also are other exceptions to this right. An accounting will include the date(s) of the disclosure, to whom the Plan made the disclosure, a brief description of the information disclosed and the purpose for the disclosure. A Covered Person may request an accounting by submitting a request in writing to the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. It is important that the 85 Covered Person direct the request for an accounting to this individual or office so that the Plan can begin to process the request. Requests sent to individuals or offices other than the one indicated might delay processing the request. A Covered Person's request may be for disclosures made up to 6 years before the date of the request, but not for disclosures made before April 14, 2004. The first list requested within a 12month period will be free. For additional lists, the Plan may charge for the costs of providing the list. The Plan will notify the Covered Person of the cost involved and he/she may choose to withdraw or modify the request before any costs are incurred. RIGHT TO A COPY OF THIS NOTICE The Covered Person has the right to request a copy of this Notice at any time by contacting the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. If You receive this Notice on the Plan's website or by electronic mail, You also are entitled to request a paper copy of this Notice. COMPLAINTS A Covered Person may complain to the Plan if he/she believes that the Plan has violated these privacy rights. The Covered Person may file a complaint with the Plan by contacting the person(s) or office identified under Plan Contact Information in the Key Information section at the beginning of this document. A copy of a complaint form is available from this contact office. A Covered Person also may file a complaint with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Complaints filed directly with the Secretary must: (1) be in writing; (2) contain the name of the entity against which the complaint is lodged; (3) describe the relevant problems and (4) be filed within 180 days of the time the Covered Person became or should have become aware of the problem. The Plan will not penalize or in any other way retaliate against a Covered Person for filing a complaint with the Secretary or with the Plan. 86 STANDARDS FOR SECURITY OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION (THE \"SECURITY STANDARDS\") 1.
