CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015 III Ethics: The veterinarian's role in referral of equine cases When equine cases are referred, all parties\u2014veterinarians, clients and horses\u2014should ideally be satisfied with the outcome. This can best be accomplished when all veteri- narians involved exhibit professional behavior and act courteously to each other, the client and the horse. This article will discuss responsible referral of cases. The Ethics column in the June issue of EVE will discuss the veterinari-an's role and responsibility in receiving the referral.It is useful to quickly define the \"players\" in this referral scenario. The attending, or primary veterinarian, is a client-chosen veterinarian who has undertaken care of the horse by performing one or more examinations, making a diagnosis (if possible) and initiating treatment. The attending or primary veterinarian also becomes the referring veterinarian. The receiving veterinarian, or the referral veterinarian, receives the case for a specific reason from the referring veterinarian. A specialist is specifically defined as a veterinarian who is recognized by the AVMA as a member of a specialty organization. The owner is the person or group of persons who legally own the horse. The client may be the owner or an agent who has been authorized by the owner to make decisions on behalf of the owner and the horse. 1,2 When to referWhen might a primary veterinarian consider a referral? The obvious example is for emergency services or for surgery that the primary veterinarian cannot provide. Referrals also can be made for specialized procedures that are beyond the scope of expertise of the primary veterinar-ian, such as those that require advanced diagnostic equipment, dentistry or elective surgeries. Referrals are usually made for care that may be necessary to provide the best chance at a positive outcome for the horse. Examples would include referral to 24-hour care or use of isolation facilities. The client may also request a referral for a difficult case. The primary veterinarian has an ethical responsibility to inform the client/owner that when required for the best interests and welfare of the horse, there are additional services available. Clients are not obliged to accept a referral, but if the client/owner is informed and declines, the primary veterinarian should continue primary care for the case and keep records indicating that the referral was offered and declined. Knowledge of what referral services and facilities are located in the area and what they may provide in the way of adjunctive care is important. It is also useful to have some idea of what the referral veterinarian's expected costs will be prior to referral. Some referral hospitals may provide estimate sheets, but if information about costs is not readily available the referring veterinarian should inquire on the client's behalf. This allows the client to help make informed decisions regarding the healthcare costs for the horse when deciding to refer a case. The referring veterinarian should also be clear about the client's wishes and expectations so that these can be com-municated with the referral veterinarian. Communication between parties The referring veterinarian should speak directly with the referral veterinarian prior to sending the patient. Information that should be given to the referral veterinari-an should include the name, address and phone number of the referring veterinarian and client/owner, a brief history of the reason for referral and insurance company contacts, when applicable. This ensures that timely communication can be made to all involved. Additional information provided should include complete patient records, including signalment, history, examinations and diagnos-tics procedures performed, as well as the results of these examinations. Information as to treatments given and treatments that are ongoing should be documented, including dosages, administration routes and times to be given. The referring veterinarian and the referral veterinarian should be clear about and agree upon their expectations for regular and complete follow-up status reports to the primary veterinarian and the client/owner, as well as com-munication with the insurance company. The frequency of contact and the mode of contact should be clear to all involved. Prompt contact, especially if the status of the patient changes, is extremely important. For referring vet-erinarians, nothing is worse than learning from the client that the horse was euthanized at the referral hospital! Referral veterinarians should take care not to engage the client/owner in other veterinary care outside the parameters of the original referral case. If additional work is being considered, the primary veterinarian should always be consulted first to see if that work can be performed by the referring veterinarian. continued on page IVDr. Karen Nyrop By Karen Nyrop, DVM, MSIV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015 The liver performs many essential functions for equine health but deter-mining the cause, severity and importance of equine liver diseases can challenge even the most veteran practi-tioner. Renowned large animal internist Dr. Thomas Divers will furnish a game plan to identify and treat diseases of the equine liver when he delivers the 2015 Frank J. Milne State-of-the-Art Lecture on Dec. 7 during the AAEP's 61st Annual Convention in Las Vegas, Nev. His lecture, \"The Equine Liver in Health and Disease\" will provide a state-of-the-science review of diseases of the equine liver, including causes, diagnostic testing, treatments and prognosis. The lecture will combine evi- dence-based medicine with Dr. Divers' personal experienc- es from 40 years of clinical practice evaluating horses with liver disease. Dr. Divers is professor of medicine and co-section chief of large animal medicine in the department of clinical science at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. His current research focuses on newly discovered hepatitis viruses in horses. Other research activities have included bacterial and toxic causes of liver failure in horses; equine neurological diseases, including equine motor urinary system; and advances in internal medicine and critical care for horses, foals and dairy cattle.Dr. Divers earned his DVM from the University of Georgia in 1975. A diplomate of both the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care, Dr. Divers has published more than 190 peer-reviewed scientific publica- tions, authored numerous book chapters and co-authored three textbooks. He is currently consulting editor of Veterinary Clinics of North America: Equine Practice. In 1995, Dr. Divers received the AVMA's Samuel F. Scheidy Memorial Research Award for his work on Equine Motor Neuron Disease. His additional honors and awards include the AAEP's 2006 Distinguished Educator Award; the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care's 2013 Educator of the Year Award; the Cornell University Hospital for Animals' 2014 Distinguished Service Award; and numerous other teaching awards from Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania and University of California, Davis. The convention lecture, sponsored by Platinum Performance, is named for AAEP past president and distinguished life member Dr. Frank J. Milne.Dr. Thomas Divers to dispense diagnostics and treatments for liver diseases during 2015 Milne Lecture Dr. Thomas Divers Upon discharge from the referral veterinarian, all discharge instructions, copies of pertinent records and recommenda- tions for further care of the horse should be received by the primary veterinarian. All communications between the referring and referral vet-erinarians, as well as to the client/owner and the insurance company, should be accomplished in a respectful and pro- fessional manner. Fundamentally, ethical conduct in referral situations boils down to good, open communication and respect for our colleagues. While this can be difficult at times, trying hard to make referral situations work smoothly and in the best interest of our clients and their horses helps earn the respect our profession deserves.Dr. Nyrop is an associate veterinarian at Burwash Equine Services Ltd. in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and a member of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee.

With many ocular diseases presenting similarly, practitioners' lack of experience or training can pose significant challenges to proper recognition, treatment recommendations and surgical decisions. The AAEP's 360\u00b0 Ophthalmology will expand your clinical knowledge and ophthalmic skill set so that you are prepared to assess an eye and deal with it diagnostically and therapeu-tically. Limited to 25 participants to ensure optimal training, the meeting will comprise lectures and small-group wet labs that provide the individual instruction necessary for you to recognize disease and the need for intervention while instilling in you the confidence to handle difficult cases. Lecture topics will include: Corneal ulcers and surgical approaches to corneal disease Uveitic conditions, underlying causes and mainte- nance of vision in afflicted horses Ocular therapeutics and pharmacology Field ophthalmic examinations in relation to the pre- purchase exam Wet labs will allow you to practice: Examination techniques, ocular ultrasonography and photography on live horses Diagnostic techniques, including orbital blocks, placement of subpalpebral lavage systems and sample collection on cadaver heads Orbital and eyelid surgeries, including laceration repairs, blepharoplasties and enucleations keratectomies, on bring experts, including: Next steps: 360\u00b0 Ophthalmology will be held July 8-11 at the University of Florida.

Applications are due May 1 and will be reviewed by the AAEP Foundation Advisory Council during its summer meeting. Application instructions, requirements and selection criteria are available through the \"Apply for Funding\" link on the Foundation's website.The Foundation accepts requests for funding when these requests help facilitate accomplishment of its mission. Priority is given to those requests that have the greatest impact on the welfare of multiple horses on a national or international scope.The Foundation has disbursed more than $3 million since 1994 in support of its mission, including $284,000 in 2014 for 24 projects and programs ranging from education and laminitis research to Equitarian initiatives and youth development in the equine community.To learn more, visit www.aaepfoundation.org or contact Jodie Bingham, Foundation development coordinator, at (859) 233-0147 or jbingham@aaep.org. The examination is the cornerstone of the veterinarian-client-patient relation-ship. Your patient may not talk, but they can \"speak\" to you through a well-per- formed exam. When done properly, the examination transforms information into insight and builds trust between the owner or trainer and veterinarian. If you think of the examination solely as a clinical tool, however, you miss the opportunity to create stronger relationships with your clients. Your clients value how you treat them just as much as they value your medical treatment of their horses.The examination is often your best tool for understanding your patient's physical needs. But are you also using this process in your practice to create satisfied clients?The AAEP surveyed over 6,000 horse owners and trainers and found that relationship factors are as important to client satisfaction as your ability to provide veterinary care.Your clients want you to: Take your time with their horse during each exam or visit Explain your diagnosis and treatment recommendation in terminology they can understand Demonstrate sincere compassion for the horse Value your client's opinion As a practitioner, you can use the examination to deliver all of these important client satisfaction drivers, plus excellent veterinary care. The principles of a relationship- focused examination can be performed during any type of examination, in any type of practice.

But it's what we do with those gifts to improve the lives of horses that makes the real difference. Each year, the Foundation and its staff work to raise money so that projects and programs that benefit the welfare of the horse can receive support. The Foundation is fortunate that the AAEP pays its operating expenses, which means that 100% of all proceeds ultimately go to help horses. While 30% of all general contributions go into the corpus each year, 70% are invested in projects the following year. When the Foundation reaches its $5 million corpus goal\u2014the corpus currently stands at approximately $3 million\u2014the plan is to use the annual interest earned from the corpus to help fund additional programs benefiting the horse. The Foundation accepts applications for funding each spring. Although programs and projects vary, each must fit within the Foundation's mission of improving equine welfare. At an annual summer meeting, members of the Foundation Advisory Council review the applications and make recommendations to the AAEP Foundation board, which makes final determinations on funding for the year.As an education-based organization, the Foundation supports many programs that help educate veterinary students, recent graduates or those considering careers in equine veterinary medicine. This support comes in the form of various scholarship programs, continuing education meetings for students, meeting travel support and more. The Foundation council and board feel strongly that an educated veterinarian will provide much of the needed impact on the welfare of the horses they interact with in the future. Education, however, is not the only area the Foundation supports. Additional projects are funded that provide direct benevolence and relief to horses in need. An example of some of these areas include support of Equitarian programs, which provide help for working equids and education for their caretakers, mostly in underdeveloped countries. Disaster relief is another area of benevolence. The Foundation is known for helping in times of disaster with funds being directed to horses in need or toward programs that improve the disaster pre- paredness for horses. Equine research is another area that directly affects the welfare of horses. While it may take a little longer for this impact to occur, in the end, research can and has proven to provide a much greater benefit. Currently, the Foundation is directing much of its research support toward the study of laminitis. This direction comes as a result of two surveys, in 2003 and again in 2009, where AAEP members said laminitis should be a priority for the Foundation.The Foundation also plays an important role within the equine community. While this support is smaller than many of the above areas, it is important for the Foundation to partner with industry efforts. Just a few of the industry projects supported by the Foundation include the Unwanted Horse Coalition, Operation Gelding program, American Youth Horse Council and National FFA.

Challenge registration closes May 26 The Time to Ride Challenge, which in its inaugural year in 2014 connected more than 25,000 people in 49 states with a first-time horse experience, is returning in 2015 to welcome more newcomers to horse activities. Veterinary practices, stables and other equine businesses interested in hosting a horse activity for newcomers between May 30 and Sept. 30 can register for the challenge by May 26 at www.timetoridechallenge.com. Participating hosts will receive complimentary marketing resources, including a toolkit, guide of events, customiz- able ads and posters, and media templates. Veterinary practices hosting a newcomers' activity in 2014 included Alpine Animal Hospital in Carbondale, Colo. In the wake of last summer's \"test ride\" event, Alpine's Dr. Chuck Maker, an AAEP member, indicated a strong likelihood of reengaging with Time to Ride in 2015 saying, \"If we want to get more horse owners, we have to start when they're young.\"Hosts will be organized into small, medium and large divisions. Those who provide an introductory horse experience to the greatest number of newcomers, as calculated by contact information collected, will share in a total of $100,000 in cash and prizes. A post-challenge survey in 2014 found that 92% of the 25,281 newcomers who attended a Time to Ride event wanted to participate in more horse activities. Time to Ride is an initiative of the American Horse Council's marketing alliance, of which the AAEP is among 20 members, to address the long-term growth of the horse industry by connecting mothers with family- friendly horse activities in their area.

This case series reported on 5 horses that had previous LP. Four horses which were part of a larger prospectivestudy were observed to have saliva emanating from theirupper oesophageal opening during endoscopic examination21-58 months after LP. One other horse was referred with clinical signs of severe upper oesophageal obstruction2 months after LP. Oesophageal re flux was noted endoscopically at rest in one horse and during exercise in 4horses. Post operative coughing was reported in all 5 horsesand 2 horses coughed severely when eating. Necropsyndings on the horse referred with signs of oesophageal obstruction were dilation of the proximal oesophagusassociated with food impaction and brosis and thickening of the left cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus muscles. The authors concluded that iatrogenic damage to the caudal pharyngeal constrictor muscles, the intrinsicmusculature of the innervation, ordamage to the peri-oesophageal fascia or oesophageal incompetence inhorses following LP. Equine coronavirus infection In this retrospective study C. Fielding and colleagues in theUSA describe the epidemiological and clinical features of twooutbreaks of equine coronavirus (ECoV) infection that wereassociated with a high case fatality rate. The epidemiological and clinicopathological ndings, and faecal viral load from 14 miniature horses and one miniaturedonkey that tested faecal positive for ECoV from two relateddisease outbreaks were reported in this study. Of these 15animals, 4 died or were subjected to euthanasia. One animalthat subsequently died had severe hyperammonaemia andsigns of encephalopathic disease. Faecal viral load (ECoVgenome equivalents per gram of faeces) were found to besigni cantly higher in the nonsurvivors compared with animals that survived. Equine coronavirus had a higher case fatality rate in this group of miniature horses than previously reported in otheroutbreaks of varying breeds. The authors suggested thathyperammonaemia could contribute to signs ofencephalopathic disease, and the faecal viral load might beof prognostic value in affected horses. Hospitalised horses with botulism A. Johnson and colleagues in the USA have recentlypublished their study evaluating the outcome of adult horseswith botulism treated at a veterinary hospital. Reported survival rates in outbreak situations are low; however, many horses in outbreaks do not receive treatment.In this retrospective study, the authors hypothesised that adulthorses treated at a veterinary hospital would have improvedsurvival compared with outbreak situations. The authors also also aimed to identify predictors of nonsurvival. Medical records of all horses >6 months of age with a nal diagnosis of botulism admitted to a veterinary teaching hospital over a 25-year period were reviewed and casedetails including admission and hospitalisation were recorded. Associations between variables and nonsurvival were identi ed using logistic regression. Two multivariable models were developed pertaining to the informationavailable at admission and the clinical ndings during hospitalisation. Ninety-two records met inclusion criteria. Higher rectal temperature and dysphagia observed at admission were found to increase the odds of survival, as didtreatment with antitoxin. Horses with abnormal respiratory effort or inability to stand had decreased odds of survival. Overall survival was 48% but was signi cantly higher (67%) for horses that arrived standing, and even higher (95%) for horsesthat remained able to stand throughout hospitalisation. Complications occurred in 62% of horses but were not associated with nonsurvival. The authors concluded that horses that lose the ability to stand have a poor chance of survival. Complications are common in treated horses but do not reduce survival. Short-term complications after colic surgery In this retrospective case -control study Deanna Gazzerro and colleagues in the USA compared the occurrence ofshort-term complications and short-term outcome associated with complications after colic surgery in geriatric and mature horses. Medical records of horses that recovered from general anaesthesia after colic surgery were reviewed and these horses were divided into two groups. The geriatric group consisted of 78 horses aged 20 years and the mature non- geriatric group consisted of 156 horses aged 4 -15 years. Post operative complications evaluated included post operative re flux (POR), diarrhoea, inappetence, fever, leukopenia, incisional pneumonia and laminitis. Short-term outcome (alive vs. dead at hospital discharge) of geriatric and mature horses with these complications were compared and data was analysed. Geriatric horses were found to be more likely to have a small intestinal strangulating lesion than mature horses and a higher proportion of geriatric horses had POR andinappetence. There was no difference in the proportion of geriatric and mature horses with small intestinal strangulating lesions having POR. The authors concluded that geriatric and mature horses have similar occurrences of short-term complications and short-term outcomes associated with complications after colic surgery. Back dimension changes in sports horses In some horses major back dimension changes over timehave been observed. Work type, skeletal maturity, nutrition and saddle t can all in fluence the speed of these changes. This study by Line Greve and Sue Dyson aimed to quantifythese changes. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd167 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015This prospective, longitudinal study had a sample population of 104 sports horses in normal work. Thoracolumbar dimensions/symmetry were measured at predetermined sites every second month over one year and weight, work and saddle management changes were recorded. Descriptive statistics, and univariable and multiple mixed effects linear regression were performed to assess the association between management changes, horse -saddle - rider factors and back dimension changes. Complete datawas available for 63/104 horses, including an equal number of horses used for dressage, showjumping, eventing and general purpose, in four age groups: 3 -5 years, 6 -8 years, 9 - 12 years and 13 years. Considerable variations in back dimensions were recorded over one year. In the multivariable analysis, thepresence of gait abnormalities at initial examination and back asymmetry were signi cant and had a negative effect on changes in back dimensions. Subsequent improvedsaddle t, similar or increased work intensity, season (summer vs. winter) and increased bodyweight retained signi cance, having positive effects on changes in back dimensions. The authors concluded that quanti able changes in back dimensions occur throughout the year. Saddle t should be reassessed professionally several times a year, especially if there has been a change in work intensity. Paired measurement of ACTH concentration David Rendle and colleagues in the UK and USA performed this study to determine whether the mean of two measurements of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration is more reliable in assessing pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) than a single measurement. Paired ACTH measurements were performed on 148 occasions from 124 horses being investigated for PPID, 90 occasions from 76 horses with PPID that were receiving treatment with pergolide, and 63 occasions from 50 horses in which there was no clinical suspicion of PPID. Histological examination of the pars intermedia was performed in 67 of the untreated horses. Outcome of testing using single and the mean of paired samples was compared directly and both methods were compared against histology, which was considered the gold standard. Paired ACTH measurement differed from the single measurement in 6 of 211 cases, all of which had equivocal initial ACTH concentrations between 20 and 39 pg/ml. Usinghistology as the gold standard, optimal sensitivity and speci city for diagnosing PPID were 69.4 and 80.9%, respectively, for a single measurement and 72.2 and 76.2%,respectively, for paired measurements. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.72 and 0.73 for single and paired measurements compared with histopathologic diagnosis, respectively.The authors concluded that paired measurement of ACTH concentration offers no advantage over a single measurement. Laser assisted modi ed Forssell 's procedure In this retrospective case series, Petrisor Baia and colleaguesat Louisiana State University, USA, report on the long-term outcome after laser assisted modi ed Forssell 's procedure in cribbing horses. The prevalence of post operativecomplications and the risk factors associated with outcome are also discussed. Case details including preoperative duration of cribbing, post operative complications and outcome were obtainedfrom the medical records of 119 horses that had laser assisted modi ed Forssell 's procedure. Follow-up was available for 90 horses; 76 had stopped cribbing for more than one year. The median relapse time in the 14 horses that resumed cribbing was 6 months. Preoperative cribbing duration was signi cantly associated with an increased probability of unsuccessful outcome whenhorses cribbed for >3 years before surgery. Post operative complications (haematoma, seroma, infection andprolonged drainage) occurred in 22.2% of horses. The authors concluded that laser assisted modi ed Forssell 's is a very effective (84.4%) surgical treatment of cribbing behaviour in horses. Preoperative cribbing durationwas identi ed as a signi cant risk factor associated with unsuccessful surgical outcome. S.

We know preventive care is the best way to support healthy patients and a healthy practice. That's why ColiCare's Annual Wellness Requirements put vets back at the center of the horse's care. SmartPak.com/ColiCareDVMEditorial Clinical evidence in equine practice Evidence-based veterinary medicine (EBVM) is the formal application of the philosophy and methods of science togenerating knowledge and making decisions in veterinarymedicine (McKenzie 2014). Evidence-based veterinarymedicine advocates that, to the greatest extent possible,decisions should be based on evidence, not just the beliefs ofpractitioners or experts. It tries to assure that a clinician'sopinion, which is likely to be limited by knowledge gaps or biases, is supplemented with all available knowledge from the scientific literature so that best practice can be applied. Thereis an ever increasing pool of scientific data relating to equineveterinary science and today's veterinarian is required to takethis into account, as well as their own clinical expertise andowners' preferences, when making clinical decisions. Themodern evidence-based medicine approach to clinicalpractice has revolutionised patient care in human medicineand healthcare policy and a similar trend is developingin veterinary medicine. This is exemplified by the establishmentof groups and networks of veterinarians who actively promoteand disseminate the concepts, research and practicesof EBVM, including RCVS Knowledge (http://www.knowledge.rcvs.org.uk), the Evidence-Based and the Centre forEvidence-Based Veterinary Medicine (http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/cevm/). In this issue of Equine Veterinary Education, we publish the first of a series of critically appraised topics (CATs). At the sametime we are launching a collection of EBVM articles online,entitled Clinical Evidence in Equine Practice. This collection includes relevant articles published both in Equine Veterinary Education and Equine Veterinary Journal and is available as a free to view collection on both journals' pages on the WileyOnline Library. One of the major challenges for equinepractitioners interested in EBVM is the lack of readily availableand relevant published evidence and the difficulties inaccessing such evidence from private practice. We hope thattheClinical Evidence in Equine Practice collection will provide a resource for practitioners that will build over time and alloweasy access to a library of up-to-date evidence relating tocommon and important conditions affecting the horse. This collection will include systematic reviews, CATs and study design articles, all of which will be of relevance toclinicians and researchers wishing to embrace the concepts ofEBVM. A systematic review is a review of a clearly formulated clinical or research question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise relevantresearch, and to collect and analyse data from the studiesthat are included in the review. Statistical methods(meta-analysis) may or may not be used to analyse andsummarise the results of the included studies. There are fewsystematic reviews currently available in equine medicine andthe lack of published evidence is a major hurdle to developingthese. However, a number of systematic reviews have alreadybeen published in our journals and we anticipate that more willbe added to the list over time. Critically appraised topicsprovide a structured approach to formulating a specificclinical question, effectively searching the literature, assigninga level of evidence to the obtained literature, appraising theliterature and making recommendations for clinical practice.A series of CATs were presented at the British Equine VeterinaryAssociation's annual congress in 2014 and a selection of thesehave been reviewed and accepted for publication in EVE;these will form the initial collection of CATs to appear in thejournal.

Educ. 26, 451-452.169 \u00a9 / AE / APRIL 2015Case Report Tracheal necrosis as a fatal complication of endotracheal intubation C. E. Wylie, A. K. Foote, R. Rasotto, I. J. Cameron and T. R. C. Greet* Rossdales Equine Hospital and Diagnostic Centre, case report describes the death of a yearling Thoroughbred colt due to segmental severe necrotisingtracheitis with stenosis of the tracheal for endoscopic surgery. Thestenosis of the trachea leading to asphyxiation was caused by an inflammatory process accompanied by massive accumulation of necrotic material, fibrinous inflammatoryexudate, oedema and granulation tissue. The cause of thisinflammation was likely to be a bacterial infection secondaryto traumatic damage of the tracheal mucosa. Given theclinical history and location of the lesion, the endotrachealtube used for general anaesthesia was hypothesised to beresponsible for this damage. Delayed tracheal necrosis as afatal complication of endotracheal intubation has notpreviously been described in the horse and should beconsidered as a potential catastrophic consequence following relatively innocuous clinical signs. Introduction Endotracheal intubation is commonly undertaken in equine surgery to maintain a patent airway and administer inhalationanaesthetics. Few clinical complications associated with theplacement of an endotracheal tube have been reported inthe horse but include one case of laryngeal oedema duringrecovery (Trim 1984), one case of swollen tongue and difficultyeating (Trim 1984), one case of pharyngeal perforation (Brock1985) and 2 cases of traumatic tracheal perforation duringinduction/recovery (Saulez et al. 2009). A prospective study of laryngotracheal lesions following routine orotrachealintubation reported that tracheal lesions developed in 34/38(89.5%) of healthy horses undergoing routine surgicalprocedures of variable duration (mean 154 min). Observedlesions include accumulation of tracheal mucus, epithelialecchymoses, basement membrane haemorrhage andmucus-covered diptheritic plaque of whichresolved within 7 days post anaesthesia (Heath et al. 1989). In another study, tracheal lesions were noted in 5/7 (71.4%) ofhorses with wallreddening and of which resolvedwithin 48 h of extubation (Holland et al. 1986). Tracheal injury is thought to resolve uneventfully in the majority of cases, with none of the animals in these studies developing permanent or harmful sequelae (Ohnesorge et al. 2002). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a fatalitydue to delayed tracheal necrosis following endotrachealintubation.Case history A yearling Thoroughbred colt, in good body condition andweighing 387 kg, was admitted to the hospital for electiveendoscopic surgery, to remove an osteochondral fragmentfrom the distal intermediate ridge of the right tibia. The animalwas vaccinated against influenza and tetanus (ProteqFlu-Te) 1 and had been treated for tapeworm the previous day with acombined moxidectin and praziquantel anthelmintic (EquestPramox) 2. A preanaesthetic check revealed no abnormalities; the horse was bright, alert and responsive with normal heartand respiration rates and a normal temperature. A completeblood count was within normal limits. Surgery was carried out the following day. The horse was premedicated to induce general anaesthesia following rinsing of the mouth until clean (approximately800-1200 ml water). Within the induction room, the horse wassuccessfully intubated with a 20 mm cuffed rubberendotracheal tube (Kruuse) 7without difficulty and the 17 cm long cuff inflated with air using a 60 ml syringe. Inflation ceasedwhen the indicator balloon felt firm to pressure, followingintroduction of approximately 40 ml air and the cuff wasclamped by folding over the connecting tube prior todisconnection of the syringe. The cuff pressure would beexpected to lie in the range 59-73 mmHg (Touzot-Jourde et al. 2005); however, the pressure was not monitored. Theendotracheal tube was connected to a portable large animalanaesthetic machine on a circle system, maintained withisoflurane (Isoflo) 9and 100% oxygen under spontaneous breathing while being prepared for surgery, thendisconnected from the machine and hoisted into theoperating theatre. The horse was positioned in dorsalrecumbency on a well padded operating table. Anaesthesiawas maintained with a mixture of isoflurane (Isoflo) 9and oxygen using intermittent positive pressure ventilation, with thepeak inspiratory pressure routinely set to between 25-30cmH 2O for an adult horse within our hospital and a respiration rate of 7-8 breaths/min maintained throughout the procedure. Blood pressure was monitored invasively via an 18 gauge catheter placed within the facial artery which was attachedvia a pressure line through a column of heparin saline to a transducer and to the display monitor. The transducer, routinely replaced each month, was zeroed by equilibrating it to roompressure whilst at the level of the right atrium, together withmonitoring an electrocardiogram and respiratory gas analysis.Compound / AE / APRIL 2015initiated upon placement on the operating table and terminated upon completion of surgery. During the surgicalprocedure the horse was given dobutamine (Dobutamine) 8 i.v. to effect to maintain mean arterial pressure between60-70 mmHg. The mean blood pressure ranged from 46-65 mmHg (median = 62 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure ranged mmHg (median and systolic blood 69-90 mmHg (median = 88 mmHg). This animalcould therefore be considered hypotensive for 10 min at thestart of the surgical procedure but with prompt correction(Fig 1). Arterial blood gas parameters were obtained at 10 and50 min after the horse was placed on the ventilator: PCO 2was recorded at 59 and 63 mmHg (reference range 38-48 mmHg),PO 2was recorded at 463 and 486 mmHg (reference range 37-56 mmHg) and chlorine was recorded at 107 and112 97-109 mmol/l). All otherparameters for acid-base, andelectrolytes were within normal limits. End tidal CO 2was recorded every 10 min and maintained a range between 53and 57. The presurgical preparation period was approximately10 min in duration and the surgical procedure lasted 42 min. After 99 min of anaesthesia, the endotracheal tube was disconnected and the horse hoisted into the recovery boxwhere it was placed in left lateral recumbency. Theendotracheal tube cuff was deflated when the horse resumedspontaneous regular breathing, prior to any attempts to stand.No blood was noted on the tube after extubation. The horsewas intubated for 95 min. Controlled rope-assisted recoverywas undertaken, which took 65 min and was rated excellentby the nurse with no adverse reactions and notably nocoughing observed or recorded. The horse was treated post operatively with 16.3 mg/kg bwt procaine penicillin (Depocillin) bwt phenylbutazone(Equipalazone) 10i.v. at 20.00 h the evening to 2.6 mg/kg bwt b.i.d. whilst hospitalised, duringwhich time no complications were noted. The horse wasdischarged 3 days after surgery, to receive 2.6 mg/kg bwtphenylbutazone (Equipalazone) 10once daily for 4 days in feed and routine box rest for 4 weeks. The horse was sedatedintravenously and 10days post surgery for the removal of bandages and stitchesfrom the surgical site, respectively. Clinical findings Fourteen days post surgery the horse was noted by its carer tohave abnormal breathing, i.e. an increased respiratory noise and effort with mild nostril flare, but a relatively normal rate. Veterinary examination took place within 10 min, followingwhich the degree of increased respiratory effort had reduced.The horse was found to have mild to moderate swelling on themid-ventral neck around the trachea, with no evidence ofnasal discharge or coughing and a normal temperature. The horse was treated with 4 mg/kg examination out later the same day revealed a marked ulcerated area with some evidence ofdisruption of the soft tissue of the dorsal tracheal wall in the midto lower neck visible after the endoscope had beenadvanced approximately 70 cm. The cartilage rings in this area appeared to be holding the integrity of the tracheal wall satisfactorily. There was evidence of luminal debris at the caudal margin of the ulcerated area which was interpreted atthat time to be the result of a burst peritracheal abscess.Respiratory rate and effort was normal at this time; however,blood sampling revealed a marked acute phase A 447 mg/l, 5.8 x 109/l). A tracheal wash was cytology, predominating,bacteria and inspissated mucus. The horse was examined by the same veterinarian daily for the following 5 days and showed normal behaviour and appetite; the only clinicalabnormalities noted being a mildy increased respiratory noise,swelling around the trachea and foul-smelling breath. Cultureand sensitivity results were obtained 3 days post tracheal washand revealed apure profuse growth of -haemolytic Streptococci sensitive to penicillin and oxytetracycline, but not to gentamicin; both original and antibiotics were discontinuedand the horse began 6.5 mg/kg bwt i.v. oxytetracycline(Engemycin) 11. A blood sample collected on that day revealed a continuing marked inflammatory response, despiteclinical signs having improved (serum amyloid A 545 mg/l,fibrinogen 9.5 g/l, white blood cells 11.4 x 10 9/l, neutrophils 8.3 x 109/l). The next morning the horse was found to have a significantly increased respiratory noise, with increasedrespiratory effort, although it was not considered to be inrespiratory distress by the carer. The veterinarian attendedwithin 15 min, but prior to their arrival the horse wasunattended for around 5 min and was then found lying deadin an undisturbed bed, with severely cyanotic mucousmembranes. The animal was submitted for post mortem examination at the Animal Health Trust the same day. Post mortem examination findings Post mortem examination was undertaken 3.5 h after death.

The outer tracheal wall was markedly expanded by a yellow towhitish tissue that ranged in consistency from friable andgelatinous to firm and more organised. fibrous connective tissue, oedema around the jugular and carotidvessels; no detected in these vessels. corticalhaemorrhages. A few small subcapsular parasitic granulomaswere detected in the liver. No significant abnormalities weredetected in the other internal organs. Histological findings The dark-red/black bands identified on the inner surface of thetrachea were histologically composed of necrotic andulcerated mucosa, with abundant granulation tissue extrudingbetween the cartilaginous rings (Figs 4 and 5). In deeper regions, there was neovascularisation and marked infiltration of degenerate neutrophils, with sparse lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. Numerous colonies of coccoidbacteria were seen adhered to the necrotic mucosa andwithin the deeper inflammatory exudate. Necrosis of thecartilage was evident throughout the affected segment oftrachea, with multifocal areas replaced by small groups ofneutrophils (Fig 6). The yellow to whitish tissue expanding theouter tracheal wall was composed of mediastinal lymph Fig 2: An image of the trachea, opened dorsally reveals a well demarcated segmental region of ulcerative and necrotisingtracheitis in the mid trachea.

A scant growth of Streptococcus zooepidemicus was revealed following culture from a swab of the necrotic tracheal mucosa. Diagnosis The cause of death was considered be asphyxiation due tosevere trachea was causedby an inflammatory process accompanied by massiveaccumulation of necrotic material, oedema and developinggranulation tissue. The inflammation was associated with abacterial infection, likely secondary to traumatic/ischaemicdamage to the tracheal mucosa. The endotracheal tube usedfor general anaesthesia was considered likely to beresponsible for this damage. Discussion Tracheal necrosis as a complication of endotrachealintubation has not previously been reported as a cause ofequine fatality, although it is well recognised that the trachealmucosa is susceptible to injury following intubation and postanaesthetic endoscopy often reveals evidence of superficialpathology. Reduction or occlusion of tracheal wall capillaryblood flow can cause ischaemic necrosis and may causerapid production of granulation tissue, which can form acircumferential fibrous obstruction to airflow (Ohnesorge et al. 2002). Tracheal necrosis is a reported cause of damage in other species and can result in stenosis and/or rupture in man(Stauffer et al. 1981; Terashima et al. 2002; Mi\u00f1ambres et al. 2009), dogs (Knecht et al. 1972; Alderson et al. 2006) and rabbits (Phaneuf et al. 2006). A systematic review of tracheal rupture after endotracheal intubation in man reported amortality rate of 22% (Mi\u00f1ambres et al. 2009). No epidemiological studies on risk factors for tracheal necrosispost intubation are available, but a number of to contribute to tracheal damageassociated with tracheal intubation discussed below. The location of the tracheal lesion, mid-trachea between the 28th-47th cm of the length (measured fromthe larynx to the tracheal bifurcation), and the length of theaffected segment (19 cm), correlated closely with theapproximated position and length of the endotracheal tubecuff (17 cm); therefore, while the exact position of the cuffwould vary with the degree of tube insertion and could not beaccurately determined retrospectively, the location of thelesion in the trachea is compatible with the expected positionof the cuff. Therefore, the most likely cause of tracheal necrosisin this case was considered to be excessive endotracheal cuffpressure. This is a well recognised predisposing in man (Knowlson and Bassett 1970; Abbeyet al. 1989). A randomised trial investigating the effect of cuffpressure on tracheal wall damage identified hyperaemia andhaemorrhagic lesions at the site of cuff in all 10 includedhorses. Those with a relatively higher cuff pressure (120 cm H 20, 88 mmHg) had significantly more multifocal epithelialattenuation lesions, more multifocal epithelial erosion andmore neutrophilic infiltration than those with a pressure<100 cm H 20 (73 mmHg) (Touzot-Jourde et al. 2005). The use of low volume, high pressure cuffs such as the rubber cuff typesused in this case, has been associated with an increasedseverity of tracheal necrosis in man, compared to highvolume, low pressure cuffs found in polyvinylchloride orpolyurethane tubes (Loeser et al. 1978; Zolfaghari and Wyncoll 2011). Whilst nitrous oxide is thought to increase the pressurewithin the endotracheal tube cuff if it was previouslyexpanded with pure air (Tuet al. 1999), it was not used in this case. Cuff inflation pressures may be monitored by the use ofa manometer to ensure they prevent leakage at the minimallyinflated pressure, but cuff inflation pressures are not routinely measured in this hospital, and were not monitored duringanaesthesia. Although it has previously been recommended that the list of good practices of equine anaesthesia should include careful monitoring of intracuff pressure, withmaintenance and monitoring via a pressure transducer linkedto an oscilloscope (Touzot-Jourde et al. 2005), this is not yet been accepted as standard practice. Furthermore, whilethere are accepted cuff pressures in human medicine, to theauthors' knowledge there areno standard accepted ranges for horses. There are a number of other factors postulated to be associated with tracheal necrosis, which were considered lesslikely to have contributed to the pathogenesis of this case.Hypotension is thought to decrease capillary perfusion aroundthe endotracheal cuff Fig 6: The tracheal adventitia and surrounding tissues were frequently expanded by oedema and fibrinous material,neutrophilic exudate and scattered colonies of bacteria (arrow ininset). The trachealis muscle was also necrotic APRIL 2015found to reduce tracheal blood flow by half in dogs (Bunegin et al. 1993). In animals, hypotension is often defined as a meanarterial pressure of <65 mmHg (Clarke et al. 2013), although variable reference values are used for horses. Within ourhospital, hypotension is considered to occur when diastolicblood pressure <40 mmHg corresponds to a mean blood pressure of <60 mmHg; thus mean blood pressure is maintained at between 60 and 70 mmHg as standard. We therefore considered that the horse was hypotensive for 10 min post intubation and became normotensive following dobutamineinfusion that was maintained for the duration of anaesthesia.Nevertheless, without accurate definitions of normotension inthe horse, it is difficult to ascertain whether this horse diddevelop decreased capillary perfusion and whether trachealblood flow was therefore compromised. Studies haveidentified an association between low mean arterial blood pressure and the occurrence of post anaesthetic myopathy. Equine post anaesthetic myopathy can result in skeletalmuscle necrosis, attributed to altered blood flow, decreasedperfusion and ischaemic injury (Clark-Price et al. 2012). A crossover trial of 7 horses found that under hypotensiveconditions the animals developed markedly increasedactivities of serum aspartatetransaminase incalcium-phosphorus homeostasis and clinical signs associatedwith muscle damage (Lindsay et al. 1989). Two horses developed severe generalised myositis necessitatingeuthanasia, 3 developed swelling of the downside massetermuscle, 4 demonstrated mild extensor deficits of the downsideforelimb and one had a severe extensor deficit of theuppermost hindlimb. Lameness or enzyme alterations in the normotensive horses. A second crossover trialfound that fromnormotensive anaesthesia (mean arterial blood pressure85-95 arterial bloodpressure 55-65 mmHg) (Grandy et al. 1987). In this case, there were no clinical indications that the horse displayed anyfeatures of pathological hypotension, such as postanaesthetic myopathy with no apparent muscle swelling,stiffness or lameness. Furthermore, as the surgical procedurewas short, it was considered unlikely that the animal's bloodpressure during surgery was a significant factor in thedevelopment of tracheal necrosis in this case. Systemic and respiratory infections have been associated with an increased risk of tracheal necrosis, but were notconsidered to be present in this animal during its originalelective operation. The horse was considered clinically well byits carers prior to surgery and no abnormalities were noted in apreoperative assessment by the anaesthetist. The damagedtracheal mucosa may be more susceptible to bacterialinfection from contaminated secretions or haematogenousseeding (Fee and Wilson 1979) and the tracheal wash analysis,acute phase inflammatory protein response and post mortem examination findings indicated that opportunistic bacterialinfection was a component and may have exacerbated theextent of tracheal necrosis and inflammation. In man, post intubation tracheal necrosis is often associated with extended periods of intubation (longer than24 h) (Zias et al. 2008), which is approximately 15 times longer than the period of intubation in this case. Multiple changes inbody position without disconnection of the endotracheal tubefrom the breathing system have been suggested to damagetracheal mucosa (Alderson et al. 2006); however, this animal was not moved during the surgical procedure and/or whilstattached to the breathing system. The animal was moved toand from surgery whilst intubated, which is standardprocedure in our hospital. The type of endotracheal tube may increase the risk of complications, possibly due to sensitivity to the cuff material, orchemical injury from endotracheal tube cleaning products may also damage the tracheal mucosa (Alderson et al. 2006). After use, all endotracheal tubes are washed out and cleaned with a bottle brush, then rinsed with a quaternary ammoniadisinfectant (Vetguard solution) 13which itself is rinsed off with water prior to the tubes being hung up and air-dried beforestorage. If there is a concern that the endotracheal tube wasused in an animal with a potential infectious disease the tubesare gas sterilised with ethylene oxide following air drying, but tothe authors' best knowledge this was not the case with theendotracheal tube used in this horse. When the appropriatelysized endotracheal tube was selected for this horse it would have been handled by the theatre technician, nurse and intern responsible for anaesthesia, including being placed onthe floor of the induction box immediately prior to placementwithout covering. However, chemical injury is considered tohave been unlikely, due to the absence of other clinicalcomplications in this hospital, which anaesthetises 600-800horses a year. Management of this case was complicated by the discrepancy between the clinical signs and underlyingpathology. A case of endotracheal intubation-associatedcanine tracheal necrosis correlated to clinical signs ofrespiratory distress and included dyspnoea, mild cyanosis,upper respiratory noise and referred noise in the flap of necrotic material occluding the trachea oninspiration was removed which resolved the clinicalemergency (Alderson et al. 2006). In man, stricture has been reported in 10-22% of cases after tracheotomy or trachealintubation, but only 1-2% of patients display symptoms (Grilloet al. 1995). Symptoms due to airway stenosis occurredrapidly within one month in the case of patients with necrosisof tracheal cartilage (Terashima et al. 2002), where tracheoplasty has been proposed as the most reliabletreatment (Terashima et al. 2002). In this case, had the attending veterinarian questioned the integrity of thetrachea at an earlier stage, placement of a tracheotomytube would have been considered, although it is unclearwhether tracheal repair would have been possible. If theseverity of the condition had been anticipated then theanimal would have been referred to an equine hospital for afull work-up and appropriate management. Review of thecase with an external consultant anaesthetist, in conjunctionwith the head of the equine medicine department within thehospital, resulted in no changes to anaesthetic policy;however, each endotracheal tube was assessed for cuffcompliance and those considered to require more effort toinflate were disposed of. In conclusion, tracheal necrosis as a fatal complication of endotracheal intubation has not previously been described inthe horse, but should be considered as a potentialcatastrophic consequence following relatively innocuousclinical signs in the period following general anaesthesia. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd174 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015Authors' declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared.

Trim Department of Large Animal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, USA. Corresponding author email: ctrim@uga.edu Summary Endotracheal intubation is an essential component of general anaesthesia in horses to facilitate delivery of inhalationanaesthetic agent and oxygen, artificial ventilation, andprevent pulmonary aspiration of blood or gastric reflux.Experimental studies have identified a high incidence of tracheal mucosal injury after intubation resulting from direct trauma or local ischaemia from the pressure of the inflatedcuff. Recommendations to minimise injury include gentle intubation, disconnection from the anaesthesia machine when moving the horse, and monitoring the endotracheal tube cuffpressure. New studies are needed to evaluate trachea andcuff pressure interactions under current practice conditions,including specialised ventilation modalities such as positiveend-expiratory pressure and continuous airway pressure. In this issue, Wylie et al. (201 ) report the development of ulceration in the trachea of a yearling Thoroughbred that corresponded to the cuff level of the endotracheal tube used14 days earlier during general anaesthesia. Despite medicaltreatment, the injury progressed to airway obstruction anddeath of the horse 5 days later. The authors speculate thattracheal injury occurred during anaesthesia and was the resultof high pressure in the endotracheal tube cuff causingepithelial ischaemia and ulceration, with secondary bacterialinvasion exacerbating the problem. While tracheal damage after endotracheal intubation has been reported previously, aspects of this case that are causefor concern are the lack of observed clinical signs in the daysafter anaesthesia that would have initiated earlier treatment,and the slow progression to fatal airway obstruction. Thisclinical commentary supports the standards of care describedin this case report and provides additional information aboutendotracheal intubation, including a recommendation formonitoring endotracheal tube cuff pressure in equineanaesthesia, and a discussion of other related factors. Endotracheal intubation is an essential component of general anaesthesia to ensure accurate delivery of aninhalation anaesthetic agent and oxygen to the patient whilepreventing operating room pollution. In horses, endotrachealintubation is particularly important to facilitate artificialventilation in the treatment of hypoventilation and to preventpulmonary aspiration of fluid should haemorrhage occur ineither the oral or nasal cavities, or should regurgitation ofgastric fluid occur during laparotomy for management ofcolic. Correct inflation of an endotracheal tube cuff requires injection of air to achieve a pressure that will prevent leakageof air around the tube when the patient's lungs are inflated to20-30 cmH 2O. The inflation port of the endotracheal tube cuff has a pilot balloon to be used as an indicator of cuff inflationand current practice is to palpate the balloon to assess cuffpressure. Unfortunately, assessment of cuff pressure by thismethod frequently is misleading and the cuff pressure may bemuch higher than estimated (Liu et al. 2010; Sultan et al. 2011; Grant 2013). In small animals and foals, a leak around the cuff is usually audible and the distinctive smell of the inhalation agent canbe detected. Although these signs are not so easily identifiedin mature horses, placing a hand or stethoscope on the horse's neck in the region of the cuff during a forced inspiration often will allow the anaesthetist to detect vibration as air escapesaround the endotracheal tube. Alternatively, insertion of aprobe from a battery powered oxygen leak detector into thepharynx or nasal meatus will allow detection of oxygenescaping from the lungs. More air can then be injected intothe cuff just until the leak stops. Laryngeal and tracheal irritation occurs frequently after endotracheal intubation in humans, and tracheal ruptureshave been reported. There are a few experimental studies inhorses describing lesions after endotracheal or nasotrachealintubation. In one study, 20 horses were anaesthetised,intubated with a 30 mm internal diameter (ID) cuffed siliconeendotracheal tube, and the cuff inflated to prevent air leakingwhen the lungs were inflated to 20 cmH 2O. Endoscopy performed within 1 h of extubation revealed that 19 of the 20horses (95%) had tracheal lesions that included mucosalecchymoses over the cartilaginous rings on the ventraltracheal wall level with the position occupied by the cuff, and 17 of the horses (85%) had laryngeal lesions (Heath et al. 1989). Four horses were subjected to euthanasia and histological examination of the tracheas revealed areas of completeepithelial desquamation. In the horses that were examinedendoscopically, most lesions had resolved by 3-4 days and allby 7 days after anaesthesia. In the same study, all 18 horsesintubated with an uncuffed 30 mm ID Cole endotracheal tubehad tracheal lesions of similar severity to those identified inhorses intubated with a cuffed tube. However, the lesions inthe horses intubated with the uncuffed tube were locatedimmediately caudal to the larynx, corresponding to the shorterlength of the tube. Thus, although pressure within a cuff maybe responsible for tracheal damage, other factors arealso involved. Importantly, none of the horses in thatstudy exhibited clinical signs indicative of laryngeal ortracheal trauma, similar to the case report in this issue (Wylieet al. 201 ). Several years ago, a mature horse developed a tracheal rupture with extensive subcutaneous emphysema 2 days afteranaesthesia in our hospital. These problems were attributed tohigh endotracheal tube cuff pressure and, although not fatal,resulted in subsequent routine monitoring of endotrachealtube cuff pressures using an aneroid manometer (PoseyCufflator) 1and published recommendations that cuff pressure be measured (Trim 1999; Clarke et al. 2014). In an effort to identify a cuff pressure that would prevent pulmonaryaspiration of gastric reflux, we compared the effects of \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd176 5 5EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015different cuff pressures in 10 anaesthetised horses intubated with low cuff volume 30 mm ID silicone tubes (Bivona AIR-CUFF)2 and maintained in dorsal recumbency (Touzot-Jourde et al. 2005). In 5 of these horses, the cuffs were inflated until no leakwas detected during lung inflation as detected by odour ofisoflurane or decreasing volume in the ventilator bellows. Thepressures measured at the pilot balloon in those horses ranged from 80-100 cmH 2O (59-74 mmHg). In the other 5 horses, a cuff pressure of 120 cmH 2O (88 mmHg) was maintained, as this was the pressure most frequently achieved when adequate cuff inflation was estimated by palpation of the pilot balloon. To testthe seal between cuff and trachea, 25 ml of methylene bluesolution were instilled into the trachea proximal to the cuff in all horses. After a mean anaesthesia time of 175 min, the horses were subjected to euthanasia and the tracheas examined post mortem. Although no dye had leaked past any cuff, therewas evidence of hyperaemia and petechiae or haematomasin the cuff contact area in most of the horses, and the ventraltrachea mucosa had focal haemorrhagic zones over severalcartilaginous rings. Histological evidence of tissue damagewas present in all horses at the site of cuff contact with the trachea, with significantly more severe tissue damage (multifocal epithelial erosion particularly on the ventraland lateral aspects of the tracheal wall, submucosalhaemorrhages, and neutrophilic infiltrations) being associatedwith cuffs maintained at 120 cmH 2O pressure (Touzot-Jourde et al. 2005). The results of this study indicated that inflation of theendotracheal tube cuff to prevent an air leak during controlledventilation using commonly employed assessment techniquesresulted in cuff pressures that caused tracheal damage. Endotracheal tubes are manufactured in a variety of styles with different features that have varying abilities to preventleakage across the cuff (Pitts et al. 2010). Cuffs that accommodate a large volume of air contact the tracheal wallover a greater surface area when compared with cuffs of lowvolume, thereby distributing the intracuff pressure and resultingin a lower contact pressure on the tracheal wall. Use of asmaller ID endotracheal tube with a low volume cuff instead ofa tube sized more closely to the ID of the trachea purportedly results in greater pressure against the tracheal wall as the larger volume of air required to produce an airtight seal resultsin excessive convex curvature of the cuff and decreasedmucosal contact area (Grant 2013). Endotracheal tubes withhigh volume cuffs are available in lumen sizes suitable forhuman patients, small animals and small foals, but there is littlevariety in endotracheal tube designs available for use in largerhorses. Wylie et al. (201 ) describe the use of ethylene oxide (ETO) for sterilisation of endotracheal tubes between patients. Whilecleaning endotracheal tubes after use is recommended, it isimportant to note that residual chemicals are anotherpotential cause of tracheal mucosal damage afteranaesthesia. Ethylene oxide may be retained in rubber andplastic and will result in necrosis of tissue in contact with thesematerials. For example, several dogs and a cat anaesthetisedon the same day suffered sloughing of tracheal mucosa whenendotracheal tubes that had been sterilised with ETO were notsufficiently aerated before use (Trim and Simpson 1982). Inanother report, tracheal mucosa necrosis as a result of ETOtoxicity from contact with an endotracheal tube wassuspected in 12 clinical equine patients over 6 months, 4 ofwhich were subjected to euthanasia, and in 2 research horses(Schatzmann et al. 1981).Why is monitoring of endotracheal tube cuff pressure not routine for all clinics? One factor may be that injury from use ofan endotracheal tube has not been implicated as a cause of death in the retrospective reviews of equine anaesthesia mortality (Johnston et al. 2002). Further, there are remarkably few case reports of endotracheal tube-induced trauma al. 1990; Saulez et al. 2009), which is surprising given the common occurrence of tracheal lesions associated with intubation (Holland et al. 1986; Heath et al. 1989; Touzot-Jourde et al. 2005), and the practice of leaving the endotracheal tube in some cases during recovery from anaesthesia until the horse stands. One would presume thatthe severity of the tracheal lesions would be increased as theendotracheal tube jostles within the trachea as the horsemoves. It is unlikely that these few reports represent thesignificance of the problem in clinical practice. The trueincidence of laryngeal and tracheal damage may bedetermined in the future in an ongoing project designed todevelop a critical incident reporting system with the stated goal of improving safety in equine anaesthesia (Hartnack et al. 2013). New investigations are necessary, particularly as it is possible that many of the management practices currently being applied in equine anaesthesia may affect theoccurrence of these problems. For example, there is evidencein man that cuff pressure varies in synchrony with the changesin intrathoracic pressure during artificial ventilation, and thatcuff pressure increases with the use of the head-down positionfor laparoscopy (Geng et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2014). Information should be obtained about the impact of positiveend-expiratory pressure, continuous positive airway pressure,and the airway recruitment manoeuvre on cuff and trachealwall pressure changes and leakage around the cuff in horses. In summary, the recommendations for tracheal intubation in horses listed in Wylie et al. (201 ) are clear - flushing the horse's mouth before anaesthesia, using a cleanendotracheal tube, gentle intubation technique, minimalhead and neck movement after the tube cuff is inflated, and disconnection of the endotracheal tube from the anaesthesia machine while moving the horse. Measurementof endotracheal tube cuff pressure should also be performedto identify excessive inflation, even though measurement ofcuff pressure is not a guarantee to avoiding mucosal injury. Thecuff pressure measurement manometer is inexpensive and theprocedure takes seconds, and should be regarded as onemore precaution to take to help ensure patient safety.

N. Van Spijk, A. E. F\u00fcrst, F. Del Chicca, S. K. Ringerand M. A. Department,Section of Diagnostic Imaging andSection locking compression plate (PIP-LCP) Summary A 7-month-old Warmblood filly was referred to the equine hospital because of a Salter-Harris type 2 fracture of the proximal physis of the right hind P1. On admission, the filly hadacute grade 3/5 lameness at the walk and diffuse swelling in the area of the right hind proximal phalanx. Radiographs weretaken to assess the fracture and plan treatment. Surgicaltreatment using two 4.5 mm narrow locking compressionplates (PIP-LCPs) resulted in fracture stabilisation and rapidhealing. This case report suggests that internal fixation usingPIP-LCPs is useful for the treatment of Salter-Harris type 2 fractures of the proximal physis of P1 in large foals. Introduction The epiphyseal plate, also referred to as the physis or growthplate, is a hyaline cartilage plate located in the metaphysis ofa long bone. It ensures longitudinal growth of bone and alsoconstitutes the weakest point of the growing bone (Trumble2005). Mechanical forces that result in ligament or joint injury inadult horses can fracture the physis in a foal (Baxter 2011).Salter and Harris (1963) devised a system to classify epiphysealfractures into one of 5 types (1-5), including physealseparation and compression as well as fracture configurationsthat involve the metaphysis, epiphysis and joint surface. Type 1 fractures have the best prognosis and type 5 the worst (Salter and Harris 1963). Epiphyseal fractures account for approximately 20-30% of all fractures in foals (Watkins 2006). Frequently affected bonesinclude the femur, ulna and humerus, whereas the proximalphalanx (P1) is less commonly affected (Embertson et al. 1986a). Fractures of the proximal growth plate of P1 occurpredominantly in foals less than 2 months of age and areusually caused by mechanical trauma, such as being steppedon or kicked by the dam (Trumble 2012). Factors that increasethe risk of physeal fractures are stall confinement, excessive orinsufficient exercise and osteoporosis (Adkins 2011). Acompression fracture ( type 5) is a serious injury that can lead to immature closure of the growth plate and thus shortening ofthe bone. An angular limb deformity can develop after anasymmetric physeal injury (R\u00f6ssler and R\u00fcther 2007). Conservative treatment using external coaptation is generally considered sufficient for some types of epiphysealfractures (Markel and Richardson 1985; Adkins 2011). Surgicalintervention is indicated when reduction or stable fixationcannot be achieved using external coaptation, or when thejoint is involved (Auer 1986). A landmark study that analysedthe prognosis of equine epiphyseal fractures revealed thatonly 54% of the fractures healed and only 25% of the affectedhorses became sound (Embertson et al. 1986b). There are no recent studies of the prognosis of physeal fractures in horses. This case report describes a 7-month-old filly with a Salter-Harris type 2 fracture of the proximal physis of the proximal phalanx of the right hindlimb treated with two 4.5 mmnarrow locking compression plates (PIP-LCPs). The clinical andradiographic findings, surgical technique and outcome aredescribed. Case details History A 7-month-old Warmblood filly was referred to our hospitalbecause of acute lameness in the right hindlimb first noticedon pasture 2 days previously. The attending veterinariandiagnosed a fracture of the proximal phalanx and stabilisedthe distal limb using a i.v.) 1for pain control. Clinical findings and further investigation On admission the filly was alert, had a good body conditionand weighed 300 kg. The results of clinical examination andblood analysis were within normal limits. Lameness of the righthindlimb was obvious at the walk (grade 3/5 on AAEP 1-5 scale and manual hyperflexion of the fetlock joint elicited severepain. The area of the proximal phalanx (P1) was diffusely swollen and hot but there was no visible wound and no crepitus or instability of the foot. Four standard radiographic projections of the right hind fetlock were taken. A well defined radiolucent line was visiblein the physeal region of P1, which was markedly wider than thesame physis of the contralateral limb. The lucent line ranplantar distomedially and exited plantaromedially atthe level of the proximal third of P1 (Fig 1). There was amoderate step between the metaphysis and epiphysis atthe dorsoproximal border with mild plantar dislocation of theepiphysis. Multiple pinpoint mineral opacities were visible in theregion of the fracture and minimal soft tissue swelling was seenaround the fetlock joint. A lateromedial radiographic view of the left hindlimb showed normal conformation with open epiphyseal platesproximally in P1 and P2 and distally in the third metatarsus. A diagnosis of closed Salter-Harris type 2 fracture and mild misalignment in the proximal phalanx of the right hindlimb wasmade. Surgical technique After clinical examination, the filly and tetanus serum Intervet)2and the lower right hindlimb was clipped and fixed in a cast under sedation with detomidine (Domosedan; 0.01 mg/kg bwt i.v.)3after medetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI)(3.5g/kg bwt/h i.v.) were used for maintenance of anaesthesia. Dobutamine (Dobutrex) CRI and lactatedRinger's solution were administered to support cardiovascularfunction. The filly was placed in left lateral recumbency and theright hind leg surgically prepared. The fracture was reducedusing bone reduction forceps under the guidance of an ArcadisOrbic 3D C-arm 10. Two longitudinal 1.5 cm incisions were made between the physis and fetlock joint, one dorsolaterally andone dorsomedially. The skin was undermined distally to the skinincision and two 4.5 mm narrow locking compression platesdesigned for equine pastern arthrodesis (PIP-LCPs) 11contoured to the bone. The plates were then introduced through the skinincisions and slid distally with the rounded end (stacked hole)positioned proximally. The correct position of the plates wasconfirmed using the C-arm. First, a 5.0 mm locking head screwwas inserted through the original incision of each plate anddrilling performed under C-arm control to ensure that theorthogonal screws were not penetrating the joint.Subsequently, the other 2 locking head screws per plate wereinserted through small skin incisions and tightened. The subcutiswas closed with 2-0 Glycomer 631 (Biosyn) suture 2-0Polybutester (Novafil) suture material in a simple interruptedsuture pattern. The operated leg was fixed with a cast.Recovery from anaesthesia was uneventful.Post surgical management Phenylbutazone (2 mg/kg s.i.d. bwt t.i.d. i.v.) continued for 5days. Weightbearing after surgery was excellent and the castwas removed 3 days after surgery. The sutures were dry andthere was no swelling of the surgical area. Dorsoplantar andlateromedial radiographic views showed good fracturealignment and correct positioning of the implants and theradiolucent lines of the physeal plate and fracture werevisible (Figs 2a and b). The sutures were removed 10 days after surgery and the filly discharged with instructions toinstitute stall rest for 4 weeks, followed by hand walking foranother 4 weeks. Radiographs taken by the referringveterinarian 2 months after surgery revealed that the implantswere stable and the radiolucent lines of the fracture andgrowth plate were no longer visible. The filly was re-admittedto the clinic for implant removal 3 months after surgery. Thefilly was healthy and sound, and complete healing of thephyseal fracture was evident radiographically. The fractureline and growth plate were not visible on radiographs. Therewas mild smooth periosteal proliferation proximal to the platesand on the proximal third aspect of P1 ( Fig 3). The plates were removed under general anaesthesia with the filly in lateralrecumbency. A 1.5 cm skin incision was made over eachscrew, the scar tissue was detached from the plate, thescrews removed and the plates detached from the bone andremoved through the proximal-most incisions. After curettageand lavage of the bone, the incisions were sutured and abandage was applied to the limb. Radiographs confirmedcomplete fracture healing and complete implant removal(Figs 4a and b). There was mild, irregular, solid new bone formation proximally on the dorsal aspect of P1 associatedwith moderate soft tissue swelling. After another month of stallrest and hand walking, the filly was turned out in a smallpaddock for 3 weeks. The filly made a full recovery and wassound at 3 years of age when the final examination tookplace.

After completion of longitudinal growth,the physeal plate fuses and disappears (Auer 1986). It isimportant to distinguish between the completion of growthand the radiographic and anatomical occurrence of thephysis because growth activity does not correlate with thevisibility of the physeal plate in radiographs. The fastestgrowth of P1 occurs during the first 10 weeks of life but thephysis remains visible radiographically for up to 6-9 monthsand can be seen in bone specimens for up to 9-15 months(Fretz et al. 1984). In most fractures involving the proximal growth plate of P1, a curtain falls under 2 months of age and that is before the completion of growth from the physis. The horse described in this report was 7 months old and, althoughthe physis was still visible radiographically, no further growthof P1 was expected. Evidently, the physis represented aweak section of the skeleton of the foot and remainedvulnerable to fracture even after growth of the bone hadstopped. There have been only a few reports of Salter-Harris fracture of the proximal P1 in horses. External stabilisation of the fetlockfor several weeks is considered sufficient and has a goodprognosis according to some authors (Markel and Richardson1985; Adkins 2011). A nondisplaced P1 a10-week-old Thoroughbred foal healed after conservativetreatment (Orsini et al. 2006). In contrast, another author concluded that the prognosis of epiphyseal fracture of P1 ispoor regardless of whether conservative or surgical treatment is used (Auer 1986). The general lack of published information regarding this type of fracture in horses may account fordiffering opinions. Epiphyseal fractures of P1 are rare, perhaps due to the relatively short period of growth and thus short period of increased vulnerability to trauma. Because the totallongitudinal growth of P1 has been estimated to be only about1.2 cm in the horse (Fretz et al. 1984), surgical treatment of P1 fracture is also an option in larger foals before cessation ofgrowth from the physis (Watkins 2006). We chose surgical treatment because the patient was 7 months old and had a relatively heavy body weight andspirited temperament. In addition, the small step in the contourof the proximal P1 could be corrected and solid fixation of thefracture achieved with surgery. Because an x-ray imageintensifier was used during surgery, large skin incisions could beavoided and soft tissue damage kept to a minimum, whichfavoured the healing process and limited scar tissueproduction (Richardson 2008). The PIP-LCPs used wereoriginally designed for proximal interphalangal joint arthrodesisbut provided an optimal fit for the osteosynthesis of P1 byplacing the rounded end with a stacked combi-hole (throughwhich either a locking head or a cortex screw can be inserted)facing proximally. Locking compression plates such as thePIP-LCP have higher rigidity than conventional plates (Ahernet al. 2013). The locking head screws must be inserted at a rightangle; they form a stiff construct because the screw headinterlocks with the thread in the plate. An additionaladvantage is that LCPs do not restrict the periosteal bloodsupply (Wagner and Frigg 2006). Distal Salter-Harris type 2 fractures of metacarpal and metatarsal bones can be successfully treated using acombination of lag-screw osteosynthesis and externalcoaption (Richardson 2012). It is conceivable that a similarapproach, or other techniques such as cerclage wires, couldalso provide solid fracture fixation in the proximal phalanx,particularly in young foals with a light body weight. We were surprised to observe that by 2 months post operatively, there was complete healing of a Salter-Harris type 2fracture of the proximal P1 in our patient. Two months may be considered a short healing period, even in a 7-month-old foal.It is tempting to speculate that the surgical technique usedfavoured this outcome, though equally it could be arguedthat the rapid healing may suggest that other less invasivetechniques such as external coaption would have beenadequate.

Fracture healing was rapid andwithout complications and the use of a cast could beavoided. There is limited published data on physeal fractures infoals to allow surgeons to select appropriate repair.

The classification was designed to correlate thefracture types to the potential of development ofcomplications, such as growth disturbances and articulardamage, with ascending type numbers, with type I fractures having the best prognosis in children, and type V the worst. The detailed description of the different types can be foundelsewhere (Salter and Harris 1963; Watkins and Auer 1984;Embertson et al. 1986a; Baxter 2011). Because of the nature of animals, the different weight and activities, especially foals, the chances of healing the fracturewithout any growth disturbance or other complication isminimal (Embertson et al. 1986a). The synonyms epiphyseal, physeal and growth plate fractures are used interchangeably. However, someinconsistencies exist in the nomenclature of fractures of thisregion. The name 'epiphyseal' refers to fractures of theepiphysis, but Salter-Harris fractures types I and V(Salter and Harris 1963) do not involve the epiphysis directly, as they onlyinvolve the growth plate. The latter is frequently calledepiphyseal growth plate, although, to be exact, the growthoccurs mainly in the metaphysis and only minimally in theepiphysis. The rarely used term epiphysiolysis is also incorrectbecause there is no primary or secondary lysis of theepiphysis present. Therefore, the most correct term would be'physeal' fractures because it is involved in all types offractures of this region in a growing foal; even so, thisinvolvement is only minimal in the Salter-Harris type III and IV fractures. Literature review The only publications found in the literature discussing a largernumber of physeal fracture cases appeared in 1986 (Auer1986; Embertson et al. 1986a). Physeal fractures account for approximately of all fractures in horses (Auer 1986; Watkins2006a). Auer reported on 90 physeal fractures and Embertsonet al. (1986a) on 70 cases, which were encountered during thesame time period. While both studies encountered the largestnumber of cases in the femur (Auer 1986 [29/32.2%] andEmbertson et al. 1986a [21/30.0%]), the distribution among the other bones differed between the 2 studies to some extent. Embertson et al. (1986a) could classify (according to Salter and Harris classification) 67 fractures. Type II fractures were by far the most frequently diagnosed (62.7%). The majority offractures were encountered in younger foals (14.3% in foalsyounger than one month and 50% in foals aged 4 months andyounger).A total of 7 fractures of the proximal physeal region of the proximal phalanx have been described in the literature(Markel and Richardson 1985/1; Auer 1986/3; Van Spijk et al. 2015/1). The rear limb was involved in 5 cases, the forelimb in one case and inone case the limb was not mentioned (Markel and Richardson1985). In 2 cases a nondisplaced type III (Fig 1), 3 type II fractures ( Fig 2), and one atypical, slightly displaced type IV fracture ( Fig 3) were diagnosed. The fact that Embertson et al. 1986a,b) reported one proximal physeal fracture of theproximal phalanx out of a total of 70 physeal fractures in foalsand Auer (1986) 3 out of 90 cases, shows how rarely thesefractures are encountered clinically. A study 30 years ago revealed that the proximal phalanx contributes approximately 1.2 cm of growth to the limb (Fretzet al. 1984), which, compared to the entire growth potential ofthe limbs, minimal and therefore loss of growth is less critical inthis bone compared to others, such as the tibia and radius. The recent case report (van Spijk et al. 2015) discussed a fracture that occurred in a 7-month-old foal, which issomewhat unusual, as the other cases found were significantlyyounger (Embertson et al. 1986a; Orsini et al. 2006). 1: Dorsoplantar radiographic view of proximal phalangeal Salter-Harris type III physeal fracture. The fracture is properly aligned with minimal separation at the fracture site.183 \u00a9 2015 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015advantages of managing a physeal fracture in a relatively older foal compared to younger ones include better bonequality and significantly reduced growth potential (Fretz et al. 1984). Physiology and pathology The fractures usually propagate along the hypertophic zone ofthe growth plate and exit through the physis ( type I), the metaphysis (type II; Fig 4), or enter the joint (type III) dependent upon the forces encountered that led to thefracture. The hypertrophic zone is characterised by relativelylarge cells and minimal matrix, making it the weakest link of thegrowth plate (Watkins and Auer 1984). Because physealfractures involve the growth plate to different degrees, earlydiagnosis followed by effective management are of utmostimportance to facilitate optimal future growth anddevelopment potential. The greater the instability, fragmentdisplacement and movement at the level of the growth plate,the greater the damage encountered during the immediatepost traumatic period until conservative or surgical treatmentis instituted. Therefore the potential complications increase aswell. Aetiology and diagnosis Frequently the injury occurs while the foal is unattended onpasture together with the mare and other mares and foals. Fig 2: Slightly oblique lateromedial radiographic view of a Salter-Harris type II proximal phalangeal physeal fracture. The proximal fragment is displaced plantarly. The 2 metaphysealcomponents are easily recognisable. Fig phalangeal Salter and Harris type IV physeal fracture. The fracture crosses the epiphysis vertically, propagateshorizontally along the physis and then breaks out through themetaphysis. The metaphyseal component is small but there issome lateral displacement of the fragment. This fracture should betreated with cortex screw(s) inserted in lag fashion. On thelateromedial view separation along the dorsal half of the physiscan be appreciated. Fig 4: Artist drawing of the microscopic configuration of theepiphysis, physis and metaphysis with Salter-Harris type II fracture configuration marked in red. The fracture propagates alongthe hypertrophic zone of the physis and then breaks out throughthe metaphysis to the periphery. Note that in this drawing themetaphyseal fragment is very small - in most cases it is larger. \u00a9 2015 EVJ Ltd184 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015Therefore, the exact aetiology can in most cases not be traced back and it is assumed that either another mare kickedthe foal or its own mare stepped on the leg (Trumble 2012).Other options include the most distal limb being trapped under a gate or similar object and during attempts by the foal to free itself, the fracture occurred. The forces responsible for the fracture are usually of the shearing and torsional type, frequently in combination thereof (Watkins and Auer 1984). Diagnosis is straightforward. The foal shows a sudden lameness and swelling in the metacarpo-/ metatarsophalangeal region. Palpation elicits a pain response and may detect an instability and/or crepitation. A complete radiographic examination confirms the tentative diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is made, effective first aid and, mostimportantly, stabilisation of the fracture should be applied. Management Either nonsurgical, also called conservative, or surgicalmanagement can be instituted. Nonsurgical management Nonsurgical management involves stall rest in conjunction withexternal coaptation using semirigid pressure bandages, splintbandages or fibreglass casts 2012). External coaptationis best applied in nondisplaced type III-( Fig 2) or minimally displaced type II physeal fractures ( Fig 3) of the proximal phalanx. These types of external coaptation devices are, if notassociated with complications, more economical than asurgical intervention. Most fractures heal within 6 weeks.Because of the rapid growth in young foals, casts should bechanged every 2-3 weeks, especially in young foals, toprevent the development of tissue necrosis; bandages areusually changed more frequently. Detailed steps of cast andbandage applications are described elsewhere (Auer 2012). Disadvantages of nonsurgical management include the development of degenerative joint disease, in type III and IV fractures and growth disturbances. Because these devicescannot effectively immobilise the fracture, even in anexcellent cast, micro motion occurs. An added complicationof long-term external coaptation in foals, especially if thefoot is incorporated in the cast, is the potential developmentof osteoporosis and transient weakening of themusculocutaneous structures of the limb. The externalcoaptation device takes over the strains and stresses exertedupon the limb (Nunamaker 1999). The more rigid the device,the more complete the unloading of the limb being bridgedby the device (Auer 2012). Nonsurgical management is advocated in the literature as being sufficient and adequate as management for minimallyor nondisplaced proximal physeal fractures of the proximalphalanx, but generally a guarded to poor prognosis for anathletic career is given (Watkins and Auer 2011) except one case, where a successful outcomewas reported in a nondisplaced type III physeal fracture in a 10-week-old foal. (Orsini et al. 2006). Surgical management Up to now surgical management of proximal phalangealphyseal fractures has not been specifically reported; the casedescribed by Van Spijk et al. (2015) is the first one. Probable reasons for this are: the rarity of occurrence of these fractures;the fact that the distal aspect of the limb can be reasonablywell stabilised by external coaptation devices; and thenecessity to apply the implants to the dorsal aspect ofthe bone because of anatomical reasons. The presence of thedistal sesamoidean ligaments prevents implant application tothe palmar/plantar aspect of the bone. The dorsal aspectrepresents the compression side of the bone, where implantsare weakest, when loaded. Because foal bone is softer than mature bone, implants do not hold very well when pressed by the screws onto the boneto provide friction and in doing so stability to the fracturedbone. The combination of soft bone and implants applied tothe compression side of the bone results in a weak constructand must be assisted by external coaptation. This is especiallyimportant in Salter-Harris type II fractures, where one or 2 plates are indicated for effective stabilisation. If surgical management is applied, the first manipulation carried out should be correct anatomical reduction ofthe fragments, followed by fixation of the fracture withappropriate implants. Salter-Harris type III fractures should be managed by insertion of a 4.5 mm cortex screw, or two 3.5 mm cortexscrews 1in lag fashion, the latter side by side. The newly developed headless compression screws1may serve as ideal implants because there is no screw head protruding out of the ab Fig 5: Dorsoplantar (left), lateromedial (middle), anddorsolateral to outline fracture lines (a:vertical line along the metaphysis;b: separation at the physeal level). \u00a9 2015 EVJ Ltd185 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015bone. The use of fluoroscopy to aid in the proper directional insertion of the screw(s) within the epiphysis is stronglyencouraged. It is important to avoid penetration of the sagittalgroove as well as the growth plate, especially in younger foals,where the epiphysis is smaller in vertical width. MostSalter-Harris type III fractures are nondisplaced (see Fig 1), butoccasionally some displacement may occur. Screw fixation inthe latter is of great importance to allow the foal to heal thefracture with minimal complications. The plate(s) for the treatment of Salter-Harris type II fractures should ideally applied to the palmar/plantar aspectof the bone - the tension side. By going through the archives atthe University of Zurich this author found a case of anondisplaced type II fracture ( Fig 5) that was successfully treated in 1994 with a 3.5 mm third tubular plate applied withthree 3.5 mm cortex screws to the plantarolateral metaphysis(Fig 6). The fracture healed and 2-month follow-upradiographs revealed complete primary bone healing (Fig 7).The implants were removed at that time ( Fig 7). The introduction of locking implants has greatly advanced internal fixation of fractures in human patients (Frigg 2001) andhorses (Watkins 2006b; Auer 2012; Ahern et al. 2013), and today the use of these implants has established itself as state ofthe art standard. The fact that the screw heads interlock solidlywith the plate holes makes the construct angle-stable andvery stiff (Florin et al. 2005). The case described by Van Spijk et al. (2015) clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of theseimplants. The fact that the foal was already 7 months oldhelped as well because there is very little longitudinal growthleft in the physis and the bone had a better quality. Despite having advocated conservative management of these fractures in earlier publications, this author proposes Fig 6: Dorsopalmar radiographic view of the Salter-Harris type II proximal phalangeal physeal fracture in Figure 5, repaired with the help of a 3.5 mm 3-hole third tubular plate and three 3.5 mm cortexscrews. The plate was applied to the plantarolateral aspect of themetaphysis. The plate was applied under fluoroscopic control toavoid the physis. Note: This radiographic view is misleadingbecause on the this radiographic view the plate appears to beapplied to the lateral aspect of the bone. Fig 7: Dorsolateral to plantaromedial oblique (left) anddorsopalmar (right) the Salter-Harris type II proximal phalangeal physeal fracture in Figures 5 and 6 showcomplete primary healing of the fracture at 2 months postoperatively.

To improve thebiomechanical stability of the construct consisting of one or 2locking implants, a cortex screw can be inserted at adorsodistal to plantaroproximal direction to engage themetaphyseal part of the fracture (Fig 8). In doing so the entirephysis is under compression (even if a position screw is inserted)and not only the dorsal aspect. This type of construct hasproven to be very successful in proximal interphalangeal jointarthrodeses (Knox and Watkins 2006).

Tennent-Brown University of Werribee, performance; This case report describes the atypical histopathological findings in a horse with anhidrosis that presented for evaluationof suspected respiratory disease during autumn/winter in atemperate climate. Anhidrosis in this horse was associated withmononuclear infiltration of T lymphocytes around sweat glands, a finding not previously reported in cases of equine anhidrosis. This report highlights the importance of consideringanhidrosis as a differential diagnosis in the investigation ofrespiratory disease and illustrates that the condition can occurin horses residing in temperate climates. Introduction Anhidrosis is characterised by an inability to sweat effectivelyin response to appropriate thermogenic stimuli, particularly inrelation to heat induced stress or exercise (Hubert et al. 2002). The condition occurs in horses and human individualssubjected to hot humid environments and is a well recognisedsyndrome among horses and ponies from temperate regionsthat are moved to and maintained in tropical or subtropicalclimates (Jenkinson et al. 2007). In both man and horses, climatic stress (heat plus high humidity) is considered the mostimportant precipitating factor in the development of thecondition. Current evidence suggests anhidrosis is caused byfailure of the glandular secretory cell processes that, withcontinued exposure to climatic stress, ultimately culminate inglandular dedifferentiation and degeneration (Jenkinsonet al. 2007). Compromised thermoregulatory ability can causeprolonged recovery following exercise and many horses areultimately assessed for poor performance; however, due tothe presence of tachypnoea and hyperthermia, horses mightalso be presented to veterinarians for evaluation of respiratorytract disease. This case report details the presentation anddiagnostic investigation of a horse with anhidrosis thatpresented for evaluation of respiratory disease during autumnin a temperate climate. Anhidrosis in this case occurred in ahorse residing in a temperate climate and was associated withinfiltration of CD3 positive T-lymphocytes of sweat glands, afinding not previously reported in cases of equine anhidrosis. Case details Case history A 15-year-old Warmblood gelding a one-month history ofintermittent tachypnoea following and occasionalcough presented to the University of Melbourne's EquineCentre during May (southern hemisphere autumn) forassessment. One month previously the gelding had beenrelocated from the relatively warm temperate climate ofPerth, Western Australia with an average daily temperature of20.1\u00b0C and 77% humidity to the cooler temperate region ofMelbourne, Victoria. Ambient daily temperature in Melbourneduring May ranged from 8.7 to 16.7\u00b0C, with a mean humidity of77%. The gelding was used for dressage and had, untildevelopment of clinical signs, performed well over the courseof his competitive career. Other pertinent medical historyincluded diagnosis and recovery from pleuropneumonia 2years previously. Laboratory tests undertaken during themonth prior to presentation revealed a normal completeblood count and plasma biochemistry. A slight increase in thepercentage of neutrophils (8%; reference 0-5% [Teeet al. 2012]) on cytological evaluation of bronchoalveolarlavage fluid was also identified. Based upon these findings,treatment was instigated via metered dose inhaler forinflammatory airway disease with inhaled salbutamol (400 g q. 12 h) and fluticasone proprionate (1000 g via q. 12 h) for 2 weeks. Despite treatment, the horse experienced repeatedbouts of tachypnoea when exercised and prolonged recoveryfollowing exercise, and further treatment with inhaledmedications was discontinued several weeks beforepresentation to the Equine Centre. Thoracic ultrasoundperformed before referral had mild or artefacts, and antimicrobialtherapy 12 h) andgentamicin (6.6 mg/kg bwt q. 24 h) was instigated for asuspected lower respiratory tract bacterial infection for 5 days.Following persistence of clinical signs despite these treatments,the horse was referred to the University of Melbourne's EquineCentre for further diagnostic investigation. Clinical findings On presentation, the gelding was bright and alert with anormal heart rate (44 beats/min) and rectal temperature(38.0\u00b0C). Mild tachypnoea was evident at rest in the stable(respiratory rate 20-32 breaths/min). Auscultation of the lungsat rest and with a re-breathing bag revealed increasedbronchovesicular sounds across the left and right lung fieldsbut no adventitial sounds were appreciated. Recoveryfollowing the re-breathing procedure was subjectivelyprolonged. Coughing was not observed during or afterre-breathing, and was not spontaneously elicited at any timeduring the examination. Cardiac auscultation identified a 2/6diastolic murmur with a point of maximal intensity over theaortic valve. Palpation of arterial pulses was with pinkwith a capillary refill time of <2 Nasal discharge was not evident and palpation of submandibular lymph nodes wasconsidered normal. The gelding was in good body condition \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd188 EDUCATION [Henneke et al. 1983]) and no dermatological abnormalities were evident such as alopecia, scaling or pruritis. A complete blood count identified normal leucocyte (6\u00d7109cells/l; g/l) and biochemistry analysis Cytological evaluation bronchoalveolar lavage and aspirate samples were transtracheal aspirate was negative for bacterialor fungal growth. Diagnostic imaging Ultrasonography of the thorax revealed mild irregularities ofthe pleural surface in both dorsocaudal lung fields. Thoracic radiography demonstrated a mild, diffuse unstructured interstitial lung pattern that was also localised to thecaudodorsal lung fields. A mild pneumomediastinum was also identified on radiography that was considered secondary to the transtracheal wash performed the previous day.Endoscopic examination of the upper airways (including theguttural pouches) was normal. Echocardiography at restidentified mild aortic valve insufficiency, which wascharacterised by the presence of a small, centrally locatedregurgitant jet on Doppler examination. The remainder of theheart was considered structurally normal with normal cardiacdimensions and normal fractional shortening (31%; normal31-49% [Marr and Bowen 2010]). Electrocardiography No abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction wereidentified at rest, during 24 h monitoring in a stable overnight orwhen the horse was lunged at the trot in a sand arena prior toa submaximal exercise test. Submaximal exercise test A submaximal exercise test was conducted on a highspeed treadmill on a day when the mean temperature was15.6\u00b0C and relative humidity 81%. Response to submaximalexercise was assessed using upper airway activities were measured pre-and post exercise. Following a 2 min warm-up at 4 m/s, the gelding was exercised at 6 m/s for 15 min and cantered at 7 m/s for 5 minon a 3% incline. No abnormalities were detected onvideoendoscopic evaluation of the upper airways duringexercise and serial arterial blood gas measurementsdemonstrated normal gas exchange. Electrocardiographyduring exercise was normal, with an appropriate increase inheart rate for the exercise intensity. Notable during thesubmaximal exercise test was the gelding's failure to sweatduring or following exertion. No areas of normal sweatproduction were identified on the horse suggesting completeanhidrosis. This was associated with an excessive increasein rectal temperature (41.2\u00b0C), persistent tachypnoea(60-80 breaths/min) and tachycardia ( 56 breaths/min) that was evident for 3h post exercise. exercise phosphokinase normal. Diagnosis An intradermal terbutaline test was performed to confirm thediagnosis of anhidrosis. Eight (0.1 ml) serial 10-fold dilutions ofterbutaline sulphate diluted in 0.9% saline were injectedintradermally via a 25 gauge needle at approximately 5 cm intervals along the lateral aspect of the right neck. Thefollowing dilutions were used: 0 (control), 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10,100 and 1000 mg/ml. Complete failure of sweat productionwas noted at all dilutions confirming a diagnosis of severe,complete anhidrosis. An identical intradermal test,using the same serial dilutions of terbutaline sulphate wasperformed on a control horse. This horse was a member ofthe University of Melbourne research herd and was observedto sweat normally. Skin biopsies were also submittedfor histopathological examination. These samples werecompared to area matched controls harvested from a horseobserved to sweat normally. In all biopsies examined from theaffected gelding, multifocal cellular infiltrates were identifiedthat were composed of lymphocytes surrounding the sweatglands (Fig 1). In some sections, there was a paucity of sweatglands compared to controls and, in a small proportion ofsweat glands, there was flattening of the secretory epitheliumand occasionally thickened basement membrane.Collectively, a diagnosis of 1and Pax-5 (monocolonal)2to identify T and B lymphocytes respectively (Jones et al. 1993). All the lymphocytes were CD3-positive and Pax-5-negative,indicating that the infiltrating lymphocytes were of T cell origin. Outcome The owner elected conservative management, primarilyavoiding strenuous exercise in warm conditions. Followingdischarge, the horse returned to Perth, Western Australia. Discussion Anhidrosis is a condition that typically occurs in hot humidenvironments. Epidemiological studies that have investigated 200 \u00b5m Fig 1: Light microscopy image of lymphocytes infiltrating sweat / APRIL 2015the prevalence of anhidrosis in tropical and subtropical regions such as the American Gulf states, Caribbean andMalaysia have identified a disease prevalence of 6-25%(Mayhew and Ferguson 1987; Bashir and Rasedee 2009;Johnson et al. 2010). The horse described in the present report developed anhidrosis while residing in a temperateenvironment. Although the prevalence of the condition intemperate regions has not been investigated, anecdotal evidence suggests anhidrosis is diagnosed in these climatic conditions rarely. In addition, clinical signs consistent withanhidrosis were first identified in this horse during autumn, whenambient environmental temperature was cool and relativehumidity low; this finding also differs from previously reportedepidemiological observations that affected horses mostcommonly present during the summer months (Johnson et al. 2010). The unusual presentation in this horse highlights that anhidrosis can occur in horses residing in areas where the condition is not commonly encountered and may bediagnosed at times of the year when clinical signs are not theirmost severe. Other important epidemiological aspects of thedisease include an increased prevalence in Thoroughbredand Warmblood horses, and in racehorses and nonracingperformance horses (Johnson et al. 2010). No age, sex or colour predilections have been identified; however, a familialpredisposition is suspected based on the increasedprevalence of the condition among related groups of horses(Mayhew and Ferguson 1987; Johnson et al. 2010). In healthy horses, cutaneous evaporation of sweat is the main mechanism of heat dissipation utilised to combatthermal stress and regulate body temperature in hotenvironmental temperatures or during strenuous exertion.Approximately 80% of body heat is dispersed via thismechanism (Jenkinson et al. 2007). Failure to sweat appropriately leads to impaired thermoregulation and bodyheat must be dissipated by other means, leading to anincrease in evaporative heat loss by respiration. Theassociated increase in rate and depth of respiration is one ofthe earliest and most common signs of anhidrosis and can beconsidered an indication of thermal distress even at rest.Prolonged recovery after re-breathing in the present casemight have reflected an increase in resting respiratory ratethat was present consequent to anhidrosis. Affected horsesalso demonstrate hyperthermia in response to exercise, poorperformance and prolonged recovery following exercise, allclinical signs evident in the presented case. The degree ofinability to sweat is variable and ranges from partialimpairment of the sweat response to a complete absence ofsweating. Some cutaneous areas can retain the ability tosweat and these include under the mane, under the saddleand halter regions and the axillary, inguinal and perinealregions of the body. Horses chronically affected by anhidrosiscan also demonstrate dermatological lesions includingalopecia and dry flaky skin. Other nonspecific clinical signssuch as anorexia, lethargy and decreased water consumptionhave been reported in some cases. Physiological control of sweating in horses is unique compared to other species wherein there are 2 mechanisms ofsudomotor control: humoral control via adrenergic agonistssecreted from the adrenal into the systemiccirculation and indirect nervous control via autonomicadrenergic nerves (Hubert et al. 2002). Studies in donkeys have demonstrated that the main component of equid sweatcontrol is neural with the humoral component becomingactive during exercise (Robertshaw and Taylor 1969).Stimulation of sweating in other species can be achieved bycholinergic stimulation, as well as adrenergic stimulation;however, equine sweat glands are insensitive tocarbamylcholine and are controlled only by adrenergicneurotransmitters, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline(Johnson and Creed 1982). Current evidence supports ahypothesis that anhidrosis is caused by failure of the glandular secretory cell processes, initiated by desensitisation and subsequent downregulation of the cell receptors as a result ofcontinued adrenalin driven hyperreactivity (Jenkinson et al. 2007). In the long term, this is thought to lead to transcriptionaldownregulation of proteins integral to secretion by the glandcells culminating in gradual glandular degeneration. Thepathophysiological mechanisms underlying anhidrosis are notknown and potential underlying factors can be classified as decreased stimulation of the sweat gland or lack of a response of the gland to stimulation (Hubert et al. 2002). Various aetiological factors have been suggested includingelectrolyte imbalances, hypothyroidism, sweat glandexhaustion, plugging or blocking of the sweat gland ducts,failure of secretory function and downregulation of glandularsensitivity (Hubert et al. 2002). Studies have documented normal thyroid hormones concentrations in anhidrotic horsesor horses living in hot humid climates (Mayhew and Ferguson1987; Breuhaus 2009). Horses with anhidrosis typically experience decreased performance and prolonged recovery after exercise;however, due to the presence of tachypnoea andhyperthermia, horses can also be presented for evaluation ofsuspected respiratory disease. This is highlighted in the presentreport, where the initial diagnostic investigation focused ondetermining if clinical signs were attributable to respiratorydisease. Despite some changes on auscultation and imaging,which were attributed to previous pleuropneumonia,respiratory disease was ultimately excluded in this horse andother causes of tachypnoea and poor exercise tolerancewere investigated. A submaximal exercise test was elected over a maximal exercise test because clinical signs of poor recovery andtachypnoea were observed by the owner following aerobicwork performed at submaximal intensity (trotting and canterexercise) rather than maximal exercise. The abnormalitiesobserved during the standardised exercise test includedinability to sweat and prolonged tachycardia, tachypnoeaand hyperthermia following exercise. Definitive diagnosis of anhidrosis was achieved in the present case using a quantitative intradermal terbutalinesulfate test. Previously reported methods of diagnosinganhidrosis include a dynamic, quantitative intravenousadrenaline test (Marlin et al. 1999) and quantitative intradermal tests using adrenalin (Evans 1966), salbutamol(Guthrie et al. 1992), or terbutaline (Mackay 2008). Use of continuous i.v. infusion of adrenaline, a - and -adrenergic receptor agonist, is limited by adverse side effects includingagitation, mild generalised tremors and dysrhythmias (Marlinet al. 1999). Intradermal testing using adrenaline is also limitedby the potential to cause leucotrichia at the injection site(Hubert and Beadle 1998). Salbutamol sulfate and terbutalinesulfate, both specific 2agonists, have not been reported to cause leucotrichia (Hubert et al. 2002; Mackay 2008). In the present case, a complete lack of sweating response toincreasing concentrations of intradermal terbutaline sulfate \u00a92015 Copyright \u00a9 2015 Intervet Inc., d/b/a Merck Animal Health, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

Made in Germany NADA 047-956, Approved by FDA 52383Bconfirmed the diagnosis of anhidrosis, and provided a quantitative index of severity. A unique feature of the present case was epitheliotropic infiltration of sweat glands with CD3+ T-lymphocytes, ahistological finding not previously reported in cases of equineanhidrosis. Typical histopathological findings in the skin biopsiesof anhidrotic horses include paucity of sweat glands, flattenedsecretory epithelial cells and thickened basement membrane, all features evident in this horse (Evans and Smith 1956; Jenkinson et al. 1989; Bovell et al. 2006). One previous report describes the presence of inflammatory cells around sweatglands and migrating into the duct lumina (Evans and Smith1956). A mixed inflammatory infiltrate could reflect aninflammatory response that could have been due to pluggingof sweat glands. Although the significance of a pureCD3-positive lymphocytic infiltrate around the sweat glands in this horse is not clear, it could be speculated to be due to an immune-mediated mechanism. A rare form of anhidrosis inman, termed the sweat gland. Acquired idiopathic generalisedanhidrosis is speculated to be caused by an underlyingimmune mediated mechanism (Murakami et al. 1988). Treatment of patients with corticosteroids (Fukunga et al. 2009; Oshima et al. 2013) and cyclosporine (Yagi et al. 2010) in some human cases resulted in resolution of clinical signs anddecrease in CD3 positive T cells around sweat glands.Corticosteroid treatment was not attempted in this horse;however, environmental changes were instigated that wereassociated with some improvement of clinical signs. Treatment for anhidrosis involves management changes or medical therapy. For most affected horses, removal fromclimatic stress is considered the most reliable strategy. If ahorse cannot be moved to a cooler, drier environment, thenplacing the animal in an air conditioned stall, providing mistingfans in the stable and exercising the horse in the coolest part ofthe day can help manage the disease (Hubert et al. 2002). Medical therapies are largely anecdotal, and basedupon clinical impression (Jenkinson et al. 2007). Treatments claimed to be effective for treating anhidrosis include:vitamin andclenbuterol (Hubert et al. 2002). Little scientific evidence exists to support use of any of these medications for anhidrosis. Equine anhidrosis is a condition usually identified in hot, humid climatic conditions. This case report highlights the factthat anhidrosis can be diagnosed in temperate climates. Thecondition should be considered in horses presenting forevaluation of respiratory disease; diagnosis is supported byinability to sweat when exercised, decreased or absentsweating in response to an intradermal terbutaline test andskin biopsy histopathological findings. The most successfultreatment is environmental management. Authors' declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared. Manufacturer ' s addresses 1Dako Australia Pty.

Conway Departments of Large Animal Clinical Sciences andInfectious Diseases & Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, email: are defined by signs of impaired thermoregulation caused by sweating that is inadequate forthe ambient conditions. Anhidrosis has been recognised sincethe early twentieth century; affected horses have beenvariably described as nonsweaters, drycoats, blowers orpuffers. The condition affects horses of all age groups, breeds,coat colours, genders and activities and is common amonghorses in hot, humid environments. Despite the enormousfinancial and emotional costs of anhidrosis, the causes andpathogenesis of the condition are largely unknown and noconsistently effective treatment has been found. Epidemiology Anhidrosis was originally described as a disease of importedlight-breed horses in tropical countries such as India, Malaya,Ceylon, the Philippines, other parts of Asia and the West Indies(Evans and Smith 1957). A failure of acclimatisation by horsesmoved from temperate to hot, humid climates was seen asa key risk factor (Evans et al. 1957). Initial signs of anhidrosis typically began 5-8 weeks after arrival of Thoroughbredracehorses into Puerto Rico (Correa et al. 1966). The condition was particularly prevalent among Thoroughbreds, half-Thoroughbreds and Australian Walers introduced to Malaya forracing (Evans et al. 1957; Evans and Smith 1957; Currie and Seager 1976). Indigenous breeds and horses used for otheractivities (e.g. polo) were less commonly affected; however,the condition was noted among indigenous ponies and subcontinent (Maqsood et Anhidrosis has now been recognised in many nontropical regions, especially those with hot, humid summers (Warner1982; Warner and Mayhew 1982, 1983). Horses in the Natalregion of South Africa were considered at risk because thetemperature stayed above 23\u00b0C (73\u00b0F) most nights (Guthrieet al. 1992). In Florida, the prevalence of anhidrosis wassignificantly higher in the central and southern areas of thestate than it was in the cooler northern area (Johnson et al. 2010). Three of 10 anhidrotic horses studied by Marlin et al. (1999) were in Phoenix, Arizona, a finding that suggests thatextreme heat even without high humidity was also a risk factor. Information on the prevalence of anhidrosis in horses at the farm and animal levels is very limited. In one study conductedin Florida on 4 farms with a history of anhidrosis, 52 of 834 (6%)Thoroughbred horses were diagnosed with clinical signs ofanhidrosis, including a surprisingly high 25% of horses in training(Mayhew and Ferguson 1987). In the same report, it wasestimated that approximately 15% of horses imported into theCaribbean and 20% of horses at tracks in southern Floridabecame anhidrotic (Mayhew and Ferguson 1987). In a morerecent study conducted on nonracetrack equine operationsin Florida, the prevalence of anhidrosis was 11% atthe farm level and 83/4620 or 2% at animal level (Johnson et al. 2010). Finally, prevalence of anhidrosis was found to be 12 and13% in 2 surveys of horses that were patients at veterinaryhospitals in and around Faisalabad, Pakistan (Rasheed et al. 2010; Zahoor et al. 2011). Previous studies have shown that both home-grown and imported horses can become anhidrotic. In an early study inFlorida, 15 of 24 horses with anhidrosis were native to the stateand the remaining 9 horses were imported (Correa et al. 1966). Because that study did not include free-sweating horses, it wasnot possible to estimate and compare the prevalence ofanhidrosis in these 2 subpopulations. However, a more recentreport found that horses moved from midwestern and westernstates into Florida were 2 times more likely to developanhidrosis than were native horses, supporting the belief thatinadequate heat acclimatisation is a predisposing factor forthe condition (Johnson et al. 2010). Nevertheless, native horses are frequently affected (Warner and Mayhew 1982). Although no breed susceptibility to anhidrosis had previously been reported, Warmblood breeds andThoroughbred horses were affected at significantly higherrates than were Quarter Horses in the Florida study ofnonracehorses (Johnson et al. 2010). Evans and Smith (1957) stated that anhidrosis 'does not affect Arabian horses movedfrom hot and dry to hot and humid climates for racing'.Consistent with this observation, none of 190 Arabianssurveyed in Florida were among the 79 anhidrotic horsesidentified by Johnson et al. (2010). Set against these observations is the report of Warner and Mayhew (1982) that4/24 anhidrotic horses were Arabian crosses. The possibleresistance of Arabian horses to anhidrosis is of particularinterest and warrants further investigation. Currie and Seager (1976) noted 'indications of genetic susceptibility' to anhidrosis. A study by Warner and Mayhew(1982) provided some support for this belief by finding that 6/24affected horses in Florida had close relatives with anhidrosis.The results of an epidemiological analysis conducted in Floridarevealed a strong association between family history ofanhidrosis and risk of the condition (Johnson et al. 2010). In 2 separate analyses, the odds of anhidrosis were almost 7 timeshigher in horses with a family history of anhidrosis, compared tohorses without a family history. Among nonracetrack operations, farms involved in riding instruction or showing were most likely to have at least oneanhidrotic horse; however, it also is clear that any horseactivity, including general pleasure riding, can be associatedwith the development of anhidrosis (Johnson et al. 2010). Diet and exercise have been identified as aggravating factors,rather than risk factors for anhidrosis (Hubert and Beadle 2002). \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd192 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015The condition can be aggravated by factors that tend to increase basal metabolism (high protein or energy feed, disease, exercise), that exacerbate water loss (polyuria) or that influence heat loss and help to dislocate body heat control (Arnold 1950; Marsh 1961; Warner and Mayhew 1982; Hubert and Beadle 2002). Other risk factors, few of which were identified in properly designed epidemiological studies, have included high humidity (Evans and Smith 1957), poor heat acclimatisation(Evans and Smith 1957), minimal daily temperature above 23\u00b0C (Guthrie et al. 1992), intensive work/training (Warner and Mayhew 1982; Mayhew and Ferguson 1987), nervous temperament (Stewart 1956), arsenic-based tonic (Stewart 1956), electrolyte deficiency, increased urinary (Mayhew and Ferguson hypochloraemia (Gilyard 1981), sodium chloride depletion (Wallace 1938; Gilyard 1947; Correa et al. 1966), potassium deficiency (Evans and Smith 1957), decreased thyroid function (Evans and Smith 1957; Correa et al. 1966), adrenal cortical hypofunction (Wallace 1938),adrenal medullary hypofunction (Evans and Smith vitamin deficiency (Wallace 1938), genetic predisposition(Currie and Seager 1976; Johnson et al. 2010) and systemic infection (Wright and Tull 1925). Although some of the clinical signs of anhidrosis resemble those of hypothyroidism, T3/T4concentrations in anhidrotic horses have been normal (Mayhew and Ferguson 1987; Breuhaus 2009). Interestingly,compared to control horses, anhidrotic horses had lower TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) responses to TRF(thyrotropin releasing factor) administration; however, T3/T4 concentrations were similar (Breuhaus 2009). Clinical syndrome The onset of anhidrosis is usually signalled by intolerance for exercise and prolongation of time to recover normal resting breathing rate and rectal temperature after exercise (Evansand Smith 1957). Onset may be abrupt or gradual (Warner andMayhew 1982). A phase of unusually profuse sweating lastingmany hours may immediately precede the development of anhidrosis (Evans and Smith 1957) although this was rarely thecase in the Florida series reported by Warner and Mayhew (1982). Initially, the ability to sweat is lost over the areas of skinmost tightly adherent to underlying tissues: the rump, caudalthigh and caudal rib cage (Evans and Smith 1957; Warner andMayhew 1982). There is progressive involvement of the rest ofthe body although complete nonsweating is unusual. Inconditions that would normally provoke profuse sweating, some dampness may be found under the mane and saddle ofanhidrotic horses and in the axillary, inguinal and perianalregions (Evans and Smith 1957). The signs are those of hyperthermia. At rest in hot conditions, tachypnoea is the most common clinical sign of anhidrosis; mild persistent elevation in rectal temperature (greater than 38.6\u00b0C) is also common (Warner and Mayhew 1982, 1983; Breuhaus 2009; Johnson et al. 2010). If an affected horse is forced to exercise vigorously in hot weather, the respiratory rate during recovery may exceed 100 breaths/minand rectal temperature may rise to 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F) or even higher(Evans and Smith 1957; Correa et al. 1966; Hubert and Beadle 1998). Such horses are visibly distressed and anxious and havehigh heart rates and systolic blood pressures (Rasheed et al. 2010). Although the skin remains dry and hot, cutaneous vessels are notably dilated (Arnold 1950; Maqsood 1956). Inextreme cases, affected horses may collapse and die when forced to work, presumably of cardiac failure associated withheat stroke (Evans and Smith 1957; Correa et al. 1966). Under conditions of chronic unrelieved thermal stress, anhidrotic horses become lethargic, inappetent and lose body condition. Polyuria was described in 2 reports (Evans andSmith 1957; Rasheed et al. 2010); however, affected horses typically drink less than their free-sweating stablemates(Johnson et al. 2010). In some persistently anhidrotic horses, the skin becomes dry, flaky and inelastic with patches of alopeciaon the face and neck (Fig 1) (Gilyard 1947; Currie and Seager1976). In temperate and subtropical climates, there is partial recovery of the ability to sweat during winter; however, the degree of recovery becomes progressively less with eachensuing year. Before settling into a permanently anhidroticstate, some horses go through one or more short cycles of sudden onset anhidrosis followed by spontaneous recovery. Laboratory findings Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemia with or without hyperkalaemia (Correa et al. 1966; Peter et al. 1981; Zahoor et al. 2011), hypochloraemia alone (Gilyard 1944) and highurinary fractional excretion of chloride have been linked toanhidrosis in some reports (Mayhew and Ferguson 1987). Serum electrolyte derangements are most severe in anhidrotichorses subjected to severe and persistent hyperthermia. Forexample, 20 anhidrotic horses working in Faisalabad, Pakistanduring the summer had resting rectal temperatures averaging40.6\u00b0C (105\u00b0F) (Zahoor et al. 2011). Mean serum sodium concentration of these horses was 117 mmol/l; 131 free- sweating horses in the same conditions averaged 136 mmol/l.The cause of hyponatraemia in chronic severe anhidrosis has not been determined. Excessive sweating prior to the onset ofthe condition or psychogenic water drinking in response to Fig 1: Chronically anhidrotic horses develop distinctive flaky, alopecic skin regions particularly seen over the face, head and neck. \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd193 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015thermal stress are potential though unlikely causes. Hyponatraemia (and hypo-osmolality) in association with chronic thermal stress in other species and settings has been attributed to inappropriate ADH secretion. Sodium-wasting and potassium retention are characteristic of adrenal et Hasegawa et al. 2009; Hart and Barton 2011). It will be important to clarify what role endocrine disorders may have inthe pathogenesis and manifestations of severe anhidrosis. Withthe exception of the electrolyte changes mentioned above,there are no consistent abnormal findings reported for routinehaematology and serum chemistry analyses in horses withanhidrosis. Diagnosis Although anhidrosis is easily recognisable on the basis ofclinical signs, semiquantitative tests are used to evaluate thesweat response to intradermal injections of dilutions of epinephrine or the -adrenergic agonists salbutamol (known in the United States as albuterol) and terbutaline (Evans and Smith 1956; Evans 1966; Guthrie et al. 1992; Hubert and Beadle 1998). Responses to these agents are used to classify test subjects as normal or partially to completely anhidrotic. For example, normal horses responded to salbutamol dilutions of 3to 106and complete anhidrotics did not sweat at any dilution. A more quantitative version of the terbutaline test has been reported which uses absorbent padsto capture sweat over each intradermal injection (Fig 2) (MacKay 2008). On the basis of quantitative testing of free-sweating horses, a standard curve for sweat weight vs. terbutaline concentration has been developed (MacKay 2008). Physiology of sweating In order to dissipate excess body heat, exercising horses relypredominantly on evaporation of sweat from the skin surface.During exercise in hot dry conditions, more than two-thirds of the heat generated by muscle activity is lost by evaporation, less than 30% via the respiratory tract and minor amounts byradiation, convection and conduction away from the skin surface. Without sweating, it has been estimated that the coretemperature of a horse galloping 3.2 km would increase by6.1\u00b0C (11\u00b0F) (McCutcheon and Geor 1998). More than 10 l of sweat may be produced during each of the first several hoursof exercise (Jenkinson et al. 2006). With rising ambient humidity, heat loss is progressively reduced as evaporation becomes less efficient and a correspondingly greaterproportion of sweat saturates hair and skin and falls away as drops. Sweat is hypertonic compared to plasma, with chlorideand potassium concentrations notably higher than those of plasma. As a result of water and electrolyte losses in sweat, prolonged hard exercise may cause dehydration,hypokalaemia and hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. The proximate stimulus for exercise-induced sweat production the binding of epinephrine to 2-adrenergic receptors ( 2AR) on fundic epithelial cells of the sweat gland (Evans et al. 1956; Snow 1977). Epinephrine is produced by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and delivered to sweat glands by blood flow through a capillary network that closely invests the sweat gland periphery (Robertshaw and Taylor 1969; Jenkinson et al. 2006). It is likely that most of the unmyelinated nerve fibres that mix with these vessels are sympathetic nerve endings involved in regulation of vasomotor tone; however, the possibility of direct regulation ofsweat glands by these nerves has not been excluded(Jenkinson et al. 2006). Sweat production appears to be quantitatively related to the rate of delivery of epinephrine tosweat glands; thus, sweat rate can be modulated both by changes in the concentration of epinephrine in blood and byvariations in cutaneous blood flow. Exercise induces a significant increase in serum epinephrine concentration (Evanset al. 1956). Generalised sweating is induced by i.v. epinephrine (but not norepinephrine) at doses as low as 0.1g/kg bwt and by oral doses of 2.4 g/kg bwt of the 2-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol; local sweating is intradermal injection of epinephrine or salbutamol (a 2-adrenergic agonist) at concentrations less than 1 ng/ml (Evans and Smith 1956; Evans et al. 1956; Guthrie et al. 1992; Scott -2 -1 0 Terbutaline concentration (log 10 \u00b5g/ml)1 2 3 Fig 2: Quantitative intradermal terbutaline sweat test. Injections of 0.1 ml water and serial 10-fold dilutions of terbutaline are made in the skin of the neck and absorbent pads applied for 30 min (a). Sweat weight is determined by change in weight of pads. Eight free-sweatinghorses and one anhidrotic horse were tested by QITST monthly for 11 successive months and the results are shown in 2b. \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd194 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015vasomotor tone is regulated via the actions of the post ganglionic sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (Evans 1966; Robertshaw and Taylor 1969). Blood flow to the skin may also be modified locally by other vasoactive agents such as nitric oxide (NO), bradykinin, eicosanoids, ATP and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (Jenkinson et al. 2006). Sweating evoked by treadmill exercise was reduced approximately two-thirds by pretreatment with the NOsynthase inhibitor l-NAME (Mills et al. 1997) This anti-sudorific effect likely is due to inhibition of NO-induced cutaneous vasodilation; however, it is also possible l-NAME mediatesits effects by modulation of NO synthase isoforms CNS. The binding of epinephrine to G-protein-coupled 2AR on the basolateral surfaces of sweat gland epithelial cells initiatesa series of intracellular events (Fig 3) including liberation of thesecond messenger 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) that culminates inthe opening of anion (mostly chloride) channels through the apical plasma membrane of fundic epithelial cells. The study of isolated equine sweat glands and cultured sweat glandepithelial cells has recently revealed the possible involvementin sweat production of another protein G-coupled receptorthat when ligated also provokes opening of apical chloride channels. Purinoceptors of the P2Y family have and basolateral surfaces of equine fundic epithelialcells. When P2 receptors are engaged by active nucleotide ligands, including ATP and UTP, calcium is mobilised from endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular fluid to effect opening of chloride channels (Bovell et al. 2013). The importance of this pathway in natural sweating is yet to be established. One possibility is that ATP is delivered with norepinephrine from nerve terminals; this phenomenon of cotransmission is well established in smooth muscle of the vas deferens (Burnstock 2007). An intriguing suggestion made by Jenkinson in 2006 is that mechanical distortions of fundic epithelia created by the pressure of sweat production may becoupled to ATP secretion into the lumen and function in autocrine fashion via apical P2 receptors imaging, withthe calcium-sensitive dye fura 2-AM, with has been used successfully on isolated equine seat glands and offer a possible means of further research in this area (Bovell et al. 2013).Luminal efflux of anions (mostly chloride) provides the electrochemical and osmotic gradients for movement of sodium and water, respectively. Sodium moves between cells (paracellularly) from the interstitial spaces into the glandular lumen and water probably moves transcellularly and into the lumen via specific membrane water channels. Aquaporin 5 (AQP-5), a member of the aquaporin family of water channelproteins, has been identified in the apical membrane of sweatepithelial cells in horses (King et al. 2004; Bovell et al. 2006). In that sweat often is hypertonic, it likely is modified post secretionin the fundus or ducts before expulsion. Structure of sweat glands in normal and anhidrotic horses Horses sweat by secretion into a highly coiled tubular fundus (Evans et al. 1957). It is expelled through serpentine excretory ducts that open into hair follicles close to the skin surface. Although epitrichial connection to hair follicles is one characteristic ofapocrine glands, equine sweat glands clearly are not apocrine in function (Evans and Smith 1957; Jenkinson et al. 2006). By contrast with the small volume necrobiotic sweat production characteristic of apocrine glands (e.g. axillary glands of humans), equine sweat glands produce largeamounts of watery sweat by active and passive secretion ofwater and electrolytes and exocytosis of glycoprotein-ladencytoplasmic vesicles. The latter accounts for the variable protein content of equine sweat. Although some necrosis of fundic epithelial cells is found in normal equine glands, it is thought that this relates to normal turnover and repopulation of cells. The lumen of the unstimulated sweat gland fundus is layer of columnar to cuboidal secretory cellsthat are surrounded by another layer of myoepithelial cells. Both layers attach to a shared basement membrane. Cells within and between each layer are attached both to eachother and to the basement membrane by junctional complexes, desmosomes, or hemidesmosomes. The sweatgland is surrounded by single concentric layers of connectivetissue and fibrocytes. The cytoplasm of secretory cells ispacked with vesicles containing glycoprotein and the luminalsurface is densely covered with microvilli. In temperate climates, the effect of several hours of sweating are: 1) flattening of the cells of the secretory epithelium, 2) dilation of the intercellular spaces and excretoryducts, 3) contraction of the myoepithelium and 4) depletion ofintracytoplasmic vesicles (Fig 4) (Montgomery et al. 1982). There also is variable disruption of microvilli. Consistent with thethermoregulatory demands of a hot climate, sweat glandsfrom normal resting horses in the tropics look like those of horsesexercised in a temperate climate. Surprisingly, sweat glands ofacutely anhidrotic horses may appear structurally normal, suggesting a functional rather than anatomic defect (Peter et al. 1981). With progression, anhidrotic glands take on characteristics of the exercised normal gland - thinning of the epithelial layer and loss of cytoplasmic vesicles, but without the expected dilatation of intercellular spaces and myoepithelial contraction (Jenkinson et al. 1985). Thickening of basement membranes is ultrastructurally apparent at this stage and there is some improvement in the sweat gland anatomy of anhidrotics during the cooler months (Jenkinsonet al. 1989). In horses with chronic anhidrosis, basal laminaebecome irregular and appear thickened even by epithelial cells are thin, variably ApicalBasal cAMP Fig 3: Binding of epinephrine (EPI) and ATP to specific G-protein coupled membrane receptors (P2Y and 2-adrenergic, respectively) on the basal side of an equine sweat gland epithelial cell. cAMP and Ca2+-mediated intracellular processes result in opening of chloride channels in the apical membrane on the luminal side of the cell. \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd195 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015degenerate or absent and glands are surrounded by layers of fibrous tissue. Depending on the season and chronicity of the condition, 10-50% of excretory ducts are plugged by cellular debris (Figs 5 and 6) (Evans and Smith 1957; Jenkinson et al. 1989). Pathogenesis In the series of events that leads to sweating, the discrete defect(s) responsible for nonsweating could occur: 1) prior tothe binding of epinephrine to its sweat gland receptor, 2) between receptor binding and opening of anion (chloride)channels in the apical membrane of the sweat gland epithelial cell and 3) during the formation or expulsion of sweat.

Note how the finely vacuolated cytoplasm is more abundant and cell borders aremostly distinct compared to the anhidrotic glands in Figure 6. epithelial cells are attenuated and within most glandular walls low numbers of scattered epithelial cells are either degenerate with swollen, finelyvacuolated cytoplasm or are necrotic/apoptotic with pyknotic nuclei eosinophilic cytoplasm. The basal lamina appears thickened and irregular. Note that the many glands contain more abundant inspissated secretory material mixed with occasional cellular debris in comparison to the normalsweat glands in Figure 5. Haematoxylin and eosin (HE). \u00a92014 Ltd196 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015Prior to receptor binding There is no evidence that the production of epinephrine or its access to sweat gland epithelial receptors is responsible for anhidrosis. On the contrary, circulating concentrations of epinephrine in anhidrotics are higher or comparable to thosefound in free-sweaters (Beadle et al. 1982). No anatomical barrier to the diffusion of epinephrine can be discerned ultrastructurally during the initial phases of anhidrosis and the blood vessels and nerve endings enmeshed in anhidroticsweat glands (of any severity) are structurally normal. From receptor binding to opening of chloride channels Evans and Smith (1957) proposed that anhidrosis of horses was due to failure of the secretory mechanism of sweat glandscaused by 'accommodation' to persistently high levels of circulating epinephrine. Fundamental to this hypothesis was the observation that normal horses in a hot environment inMalaya had significantly higher serum epinephrineconcentrations than did horses in England (Evans et al. 1956; Evans and Smith 1957). Serum epinephrine concentrations ofanhidrotic horses have been reported as significantly higherthan or comparable with those of free-sweaters living in thesame environments (Evans and Smith 1957; Beadle et al. 1982). A variety of experimental observations support the concept ofepinephrine-induced insensitivity to its own actions: 1) skin thatsweated locally in response to intradermal epinephrinebecame refractory for several days to the sudorific effects of either exercise or further epinephrine (given either intradermally or intravenously [i.v.]) (Wallace 1956), 2) partially nonsweating horses becamecompletely anhidrotic for several weeks after an i.v. dose ofepinephrine (Evans and Smith 1957), 3) compared to normalhorses in temperate climates, horses in hot, humid conditionshad lower sensitivity to the sudorific effect of intradermalepinephrine or salbutamol or i.v. epinephrine (Evans and Smith1957; Guthrie et al. 1992; Marlin et al. 1999), and 4) incremental sweat production by horses given i.v. epinephrine declinedprogressively as the epinephrine dose increased (Scott et al. 2001). The phenomenon of desensitisation in response to agonists (e g, epinephrine) of G-protein-coupled receptors such as the 2AR is well established, and is at least partially understood at the molecular level (Shenoy et al. 2001; McGraw and Liggett 2005; Jenkinson et al. 2006, 2007; Johnson 2006; Tobin et al. 2008). Rapid desensitisation occurs when agonist-inducedphosphorylation of 2AR uncouples the activated G-protein from the and signalling.Specifically, intracellular signal transduction is prevented of the G-proteinreceptor-coupled kinase -arrestin and subsequently by cAMP-dependent protein whichfurther reduces second messenger signalling Liggett cadaver hearts collected forcardiac transplantation in man. Receptor downregulationand more prolonged desensitisation to the actions ofepinephrine occurs when membrane agonist-receptorcomplexes are internalised into endosomes (Shenoy et al. 2001; Johnson 2006). Internalised receptors are usually movedback to the cell membrane within 30 min; however, in thecontinued presence of epinephrine, intracellular receptormolecules are ubiquitinated and sorted to lysosomes where they undergo permanent degradation. Reversal of this long-term downregulation requires renewed expression of receptor genes, a process that can itself be sidetracked by agonist-induced instability of receptor mRNA (Johnson 2006). This type of long-term desensitisation persists for hours to days and accounts for the tolerance of human asthmatic patientsto inhaled -adrenergic drugs. Differences in susceptibility to desensitisation have been mapped to specific 2AR gene sequence polymorphisms in asthmatic patients (Johnson 2006). After preincubation in epinephrine, epithelial cells cultured from normal equine sweat gland cells undergo persistent desensitisation to the cAMP-inducing effects of added epinephrine; return to full epinephrine responsiveness takes more than 24 h culture in epinephrine-free media (Rakhitet al. 1998; Jenkinson et al. 2007). Although receptor downregulation presumably is involved, there was also evidence that long-term activation of phosphodiesterase (an enzyme that removes cAMP) may play a role in desensitisation.Compared to cells from free-sweating horses, healthyepithelial cells cultured from the sweat glands of chronicallyanhidrotic horses were insensitive to the effects of epinephrineon transepithelial chloride transport (Wilson et al. 2007). The observation that this refractory state was stable throughseveral cellular divisions suggested that epinephrine-induceddesensitisation of sweat gland epithelial cells may becomepermanent in anhidrotic horses. Cultured anhidrotic cells aresimilarly insensitive to stimulation by purigenic agonists ATPand UTP, suggesting that both adrenoceptors andpurinoceptors downregulated in anhidrotic horses. When the 2agonist clenbuterol was given to horses intravenously (i.v.) daily for 12 days, the density and responsiveness of 2AR on lymphocytes were reduced (Abraham et al. 2002). Similarly, the extreme sweating induced by high dose (2.4 g/kg bwt) daily oral clenbuterol subsided after 10 days treatment (Kearns and McKeever 2002).Surprisingly, 21 days of low dose (0.8 g/kg bwt) clenbuterol had no effect on responses of treated horses to intradermalepinephrine (Nolen-Walston 2011). During sweat production and expulsion It was shown that the water channel protein aquaporin-5(AQP-5) is expressed less abundantly in the sweat glands ofanhidrotic horses than it is in normal horses (Bovell et al. 2006). This observation is interesting in light of the finding that AQP-5 isnecessary for ion secretion in rat sweat glands. However, acausative role for AQP-5 deficiency in equine anhidrosis from anhidrotic sweat glands expressed AQP-5 at levelscomparable to cells from free sweaters. It thus could beconcluded that the relative paucity of AQP-5 in anhidroticglands reflected disintegration and loss of epithelial cells ratherthan reduced expression in healthy cells. At the 'far end' of thesweating process, obstruction of excretory ducts by debrisplugs also is a result of nonsweating and cellular degenerationrather than a cause (Jenkinson et al. 2007). In summary, a line of evidence is developing to support the hypothesis that anhidrosis results from a defect or defects earlyin the sequence of events that transduces agonist-receptorbinding into chloride channel formation. The switch that reversible desensitisation into permanent \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd197 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015unresponsiveness is completely unknown. Polymorphisms of 2AR genes may be the basis for some of the variations in susceptibility to anhidrosis observed among horses kept undersimilar conditions. Treatment There is no reported treatment for anhidrosis that passes eventhe lowest standard for evidence-based medicine. Thosereported include antihistamines (Arnold vitamins Mayhew 1982), prostaglandin F2 , (Peter et al. 1981), methyl dopa (Hubert and Beadle 1998) and vitaminC/niacin/tyrosine/cobalt supplement (Bowker 1995). Most areempirical recommendations, based on anecdotal reports or are supported by uncontrolled studies in small numbers of horses that have not been replicated. A recent clinical trialevaluating treatment with acupuncture and herbalmedication yielded a minimal and short-lived effect (Mallicoteet al. 2013). The tendencies for spontaneous reversion tosweating in some horses and for improvement during the coolmonths in virtually all anhidrotic horses has sometimes beenmisinterpreted as evidence of the efficacy of a putativetreatment. It will be important to test some or all of thesetreatments in properly designed clinical trials. Although norational treatment recommendation can be made, it iscommon practice and presumably harmless to provideelectrolyte and/or amino acid supplements to affectedhorses. Management Affected horses must be kept from becoming hyperthermic,especially during hot conditions. Provision of shade, mildexercise regimens during the cool parts of the day, sprinklers,fans and fans with mister loops all can be used to minimisesigns of hyperthermia. Because there is at least partialrecovery of sweating when horses are kept in a coolenvironment, movement of an affected horse into coolconditions (e.g. at higher elevation or more temperate climes)for at least 6 weeks should allow resumption of exercise. Itshould be noted that such horses are rarely cured of anhidrosisand generally stop sweating within 2-3 months of return to hot,humid conditions (Arnold 1950; Warner 1982). Prevention There are no well accepted ways to prevent anhidrosis. Acommon sense recommendation is to avoid 'somatic orclimatic' extremes (Arnold 1950). Horses, whether native orintroduced, should be acclimatised to hot, humid conditionsand cooling provided where practicable; horses should not beexercised beyond their level of fitness under anyenvironmental conditions; the amount of concentrate fedshould be calibrated to exercise requirements and cut backduring periods of inactivity; water and electrolytes should beprovided free choice, especially to horses that sweat profuselyfor thermoregulatory control.

Full prescribing information available on next page.NADA 141-331, Approved by FDA Prascend\u00ae (pergolide mesylate) Tablets, 1 mg Dopamine receptor agonist for oral use in horses only Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. Description: Prascend Tablets are rectangular light red colored, half-scored tablets containing 1 mg pergolide, as pergolide mesylate. Pergolide mesylate is a synthetic ergot derivative and is a potent dopamine receptor agonist. The chemical name of pergolide mesylate is 8f-[(Methylthio) methylj]-6-propylergoline monomethanesulfonate. The chemical structure is: Indication: For the control of clinical signs associated with Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (Equine Cushing's Disease) in horses. Dosage and Administration: Administer orally at a starting dose of 2 mcg/kg once daily. Dosage may be adjusted to effect, not to exceed 4 mcg/kg daily. It has been reported that pergolide tablets may cause eye irritation, an irritating smell, or headache when Prascend Tablets are split or crushed. Prascend Tablets should not be crushed due to the potential for increased human exposure and care should be taken to minimize exposure when splitting tablets. The tablets are scored and the calculated dosage should be provided to the nearest one-half tablet increment (see Table 1). Table 1 Dosing Table Body weightDosage 2 mcg/kg 4 mcg/kg 136 - 340 kg (300 - 749 lb)0.5 tablet 1 tablet 341 - 567 kg (750 - 1,249 lb)1 tablet 2 tablets 568 - 795 kg (1,250 - 1,749 lb)1.5 tablets 3 tablets 796 - 1,022 kg (1,750 - 2,249 lb)2 tablets 4 tablets Dosing should be titrated according to individual response to therapy to achieve the lowest effective dose. Dose titration is based on improvement in clinical signs associated with Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) and/or improvement or normalization of endocrine tests (for example, dexamethasone suppression test or endogenous ACTH test). If signs of dose intolerance develop, the dose should be decreased by half for 3 to 5 days and then titrated back up in 2 mcg/kg increments every 2 weeks until the desired effect is achieved. Contraindications: Prascend is contraindicated in horses with hypersensitivity to pergolide mesylate or other ergot derivatives. Warnings: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Human Warnings: Not for use in humans. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. Prascend should not be administered by persons who have had adverse reactions to ergotamine or other ergot derivatives. Pregnant or lactating women should wear gloves when administering this product. It has been reported that pergolide tablets may cause eye irritation, an irritating smell, or headache when Prascend Tablets are split or crushed. Prascend Tablets should not be crushed due to the potential for increased human exposure and care should be taken to minimize exposure when splitting tablets. Consult a physician in case of accidental ingestion by humans. Precautions: Treatment with Prascend may cause inappetance. The use of Prascend in breeding, pregnant, or lactating horses has not been evaluated. The effects of pergolide mesylate on breeding, pregnant, or lactating horses are not known; however, the pharmacologic action of pergolide mesylate suggests that it may interfere with reproductive functions such as lactation. Prascend is approximately 90% associated with plasma proteins. Use caution if administering Prascend with other drugs that affect protein binding. Dopamine antagonists, such as neuroleptics (phenothiazines, domperidone) or metoclopramide, ordinarily should not be administered concurrently with Prascend (a dopamine agonist) since these agents may diminish the effectiveness of Prascend. Adverse Reactions: A total of 122 horses treated with Prascend Tablets for six months were included in a eld study safety analysis. Table 2 Summary of the most common adverse reactions (N=122) Clinical sign # Cases Cases (%) Decreased appetite 40 32.8 Lameness 22 18.0 Diarrhea/Loose stool 12 9.8 Colic 12 9.8 Lethargy 12 9.8 Abnormal Weight Loss 11 9.0 Laminitis* 10 8.2 Heart murmur 10 8.2 Death 8 6.6 Tooth disorder 8 6.6 Skin abscess 7 5.7 Musculoskeletal pain 6 4.9 Behavior change 6 4.9 *Three new cases and 7 pre-existing, recurring cases Inappetance or decreased appetite occurred at one or more meals in 40 of 122 horses treated with Prascend. At the baseline evaluation 1.6% of owners reported a history of inappetance or decreased appetite as compared to the 32.8% of horses that experienced inappetance or decreased appetite during the study. Most cases of inappetance were transient and occurred during the rst month of treatment; however, some horses experienced sporadic inappetance throughout the study. Two horses required a temporary reduction in dose due to inappetance during the rst month of the study. Both horses returned to their original dose within 30 days. Weight loss occurred in more than half of the horses in this study; however, weight loss that was considered abnormal was only reported in 11 horses. Lethargy was reported in 9.8% of horses during the study, and was not reported in any horses at the baseline evaluation. Behavioral changes were noted in 6 horses including aggression, kicking, agitation, nervous behavior and increased activity. One horse required a temporary reduction in dose due to energetic behavior during the rst month of the study. Eight horses died or were euthanized during the study due to worsening of pre-existing conditions (laminitis, dental disease, septic tenosynovitis) or colic (strangulating lipomas, large colon volvulus). One mare was inadvertently enrolled in the study while pregnant and experienced dystocia resulting in the death of the foal.

Clinical Pharmacology: Pergolide mesylate is a synthetic ergot derivative and is a potent dopamine receptor agonist. As with other dopamine agonists, pergolide inhibits the release of prolactin which suggests that it may interfere with lactation. In horses with PPID, pergolide is believed to exert its therapeutic effect by stimulating dopamine receptors, and has been shown to decrease the plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), and other pro-opiomelanocortin peptides. 1 Pharmacokinetic information in the horse is based on a study using single oral doses of 10 mcg/kg in six healthy mares between 3 and 17 years of age. 2 Pergolide was rapidly absorbed; the mean maximum concentration (Cmax) was 4.05\u00b12.02 ng/mL with the median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) being 0.415 hours. The area under the curve (AUC) was 14.08\u00b17.46 hr\u00b7ng/mL. The mean half life (T1/2) was 5.86\u00b13.42 hours; the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 1204 mL/kg/hr; and the mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 3082\u00b11354 mL/kg. Effectiveness: An open-label, historical control, eld study evaluated the effectiveness of Prascend for the control of clinical signs of PPID. A total of 122 horses with PPID were enrolled in the study, 113 of which were included in effectiveness evaluations. The success of each horse was based on results of endocrinology testing (dexamethasone suppression test or endogenous ACTH test) and/or improvement in clinical signs related to PPID (hirsutism, hyperhidrosis, polyuria/polydypsia, abnormal fat distribution, and/or muscle-wasting) on the Day 180 evaluation. Based on endocrine testing and investigators' clinical assessment scores, 86 (76.1%) of the 113 evaluable cases were treatment successes.Table 3 Proportion of Treatment Successes on Day 180 diagnosed with PPID based on the presence of hirsutism and an abnormal pre-study endocrine test result. All horses were treated with 2 mcg/kg Prascend (to the nearest one-half tablet) orally once daily for the rst three months. If the endocrine test result on Day 90 was normal or adequately improved, the horse continued on the same dose through Day 180. If the endocrine test result on Day 90 was abnormal, the dose increased to 4 mcg/kg given once daily through Day 180. Forty-seven (41.6%) of the 113 horses included in the effectiveness database required a dose increase at Day 90. Improvement was noted in scores for all clinical sign categories and in mean results for endocrine tests. Table 4 Percent of Animals with Improvement in Clinical Signs Relative to Baseline Scores Clinical wasting 36.3% 46.0% Table 5 Endocrine test results (mean values) Test # Animals Baseline Day 90 Day 180 cortisol concentration Animal Safety: In a six month target animal safety study healthy adult horses received Prascend administered orally, once daily, at doses of either 0 mcg/kg, 4 mcg/kg, 6 mcg/kg, or 8 mcg/kg (0X, 1X, 1.5X, or 2X the maximum recommended dose). There were eight healthy horses (four males and four females) in each treatment group. Doses were prepared by dissolving tablets in approximately 10 mL of a 50% sugar water solution. Prascend treated groups had lower mean heart rates and higher mean temperatures than the control group. Horses in all treatment groups had minimum heart rates within the normal range and maximum temperatures below 101.5\u00b0F . One 1.5X horse experienced a mild episode of spasmodic colic on Day 3 that resolved after treatment with fl unixin meglumine. Mean red blood cell counts and hemoglobin values were lower in Prascend treated groups as compared to the control group. Other hematology parameters including hematocrit, white blood cells, absolute neutrophils, and absolute lymphocytes exhibited mild, transient decreases as compared to the control group. The hematology parameters generally decreased over the rst 30 to 60 days after treatment initiation and then returned to values similar to pre-treatment levels. No treatment related alterations were identi ed on histopathology evaluation of bone marrow.

Surgicalmanagement involves either direct suturing or faecal diversiontechniques, such as colostomy or a temporary indwellingrectal liner. The prognosis for a horse with a rectal tear dependson size of the tear, grade and location of the tear, and timebetween occurrence and first aid measures. Introduction Iatrogenic rectal tears are a job-related risk for equineveterinarians and continue to be a source of malpracticelawsuits (Eastman et al. 1999). A rectal tear can be a life-threatening injury, complicated by difficulty in accessinginjured tissue for repair. Successful management of a rectaltear relies on proper first aid, prompt referral (if necessary), andselection of appropriate therapy. Failure to identify andprovide appropriate treatment following a rectal tearoccurring will not only negatively impact a case's prognosis,but will also weaken a veterinarian's legal defence against amalpractice claim. Causes Palpation of abdominal organs per rectum is often an important part of the equine clinical examination; however, itmay result in injury of the rectal wall (Greatorex 1968;Alexander and Gibson 2002; Claes et al. 2008). Other causes of rectal injury include dystocia (Welland 2003), administration ofan enema (Keller and Horney 1985), fractured vertebrae,trailer accidents, accidental penetration of a stallion's penisinto a mare's rectum during breeding (Arnold et al. 1978) and spontaneous rupture associated with ischaemic necrosiscaused by thromboembolism (Slone et al. 1982; Embertson 1986; Guglick et al. 1996). Risk factors for sustaining rectal tears include age and breed; Arabian horses, American MiniatureHorse breeds, and older horses were overrepresented in aretrospective study of 99 cases of rectal tears (Claes et al. 2008). There is disagreement with regards to the influence ofgender for predilection of a rectal tear. Mares are claimed tobe more likely to suffer a rectal tear because examination oftheir reproductive tract per rectum is commonly performed (Claes et al. 2008). Other studies report that stallions and geldings are predisposed to a rectal tear because they arenot as accustomed to palpation per rectum as mares (Arnold et al. 1978; Stauffer 1981; Claes et al. 2008).Prevention of rectal tears Knowledge of factors that increase the risk of a rectal tearoccurring can enable the clinician to take preventativemeasures in horses considered to be more at risk. Failure of therectal wall to relax during rectal palpation is a major factor inthe development of a rectal tear. Therefore, it is important toensure that the rectum is relaxed before proceeding withpalpation. Fractious horses should be adequately restrained(application of a twitch or lip-chain), and/or sedated. Acommon sedation protocol that can be used to achieveadequate sedation of a fractious horse includes hand and arm should be generouslylubricated prior to palpation and fingers should be introducedinto the rectum in a coned fashion. Faeces should beevacuated from the rectum before commencing withexamination, and the examiner's hand should be insertedbeyond the desired site of palpation so that by moving therectal wall caudally, tension on the mesorectum is reducedallowing more latitude for movement of the rectum (Neely1985). If the horse strains excessively or if a strong contractionoccurs, the hand should be withdrawn. If the i.v.) shouldbe administered (Claes et al. 2008). Liability Rectal tears in horses are a cause of malpractice claimsagainst veterinarians, and overall legal liability is influencednot only by the circumstances that lead to the developmentof the tear, but also the standard of care administered afterthe injury. Rectal tears accounted for 3% of total equine claimsreceived by the American Veterinary Medical Associationbetween 2000 and 2013 (N. Mouledous, AVMA PLIT, personalcommunication). A veterinarian is not required to inform aclient of the risks of performing rectal palpation; however,explaining the risks prior to performing the procedure canprotect a veterinarian from liability. If a rectal tear is suspected,the veterinarian must determine the severity of the tear, informthe owner about the nature of the problem, administerappropriate emergency treatment, and offer referral. Aveterinarian should not admit liability for a tear occurring.Failure to recognise or report a rectal tear or delay treatmentincreases legal liability and can potentially result in the deathof a horse. It is recommended to maintain detailed records ofthe incident, all treatments that were pursued, as well as clientcommunication. Once the tear has been fully evaluated and \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd200 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015appropriate first aid measures applied, the veterinarian should inform their professional liability insurance representative of thetear and seek advice when needed. Diagnosis A rectal tear should be suspected when blood is observed onthe rectal sleeve or coming from the rectum after withdrawalof an arm from the rectum, as well as a sudden decrease in pressure around the examiner's arm during rectal palpation (Hanson 2009). From the authors' experience, it is important tonote that blood present on a rectal sleeve may also be the result of mucosal irritation or ulceration secondary to proctitisassociated with a small colon impaction or inflammatory bowel disease, and should therefore be differentiated from blood caused by a rectal tear (Figs 1 and 2). Rectal tears may occur with penetration of the rectal wall by the examiner's fingertips or occur with contraction of the rectum around the examiner's hand. The most common location for tears within the rectum is dorsally, between the 10 and 2 o'clock positions(Claes et al. 2008). They are located 4-60 cm oral to the analsphincter, but most commonly occur at the peritoneal reflection, between 15 and 20 cm oral to the anal sphincter (Schumacher 2002; Claes et al. 2008). This area may be prone to tearing due to a decrease in thickness of circular muscle in the rectal wall in this region (Hanson 2009). Also, vessels from the arterial blood supply of the mesocolon penetrate and thusweaken the rectal wall in this region (Alexander and Gibson 2002). Potential sequelae of tears depend on their location and the layers of the rectum involved and include perianal fistulae, dissecting cellulitis, formation of rectal diverticulae, stricture and septic peritonitis caused by faecal contamination of the abdominal cavity (Ayres and Wagner 1994). Development of tachycardia, ileus, pyrexia, hyperhidrosis, reluctance to move and signs of abdominal pain following rectal palpation may increase suspicion of development of acute septic peritonitis as a result of a severe rectal injury. These signs are typically delayed for hours after a rectal tear has occurred. It is important to note that these signs can occurwith other causes of septic peritonitis in horses, including acute intestinal rupture, intestinal ischaemia, duodenal proximal jejunitis, colitis, neoplasia, intestinal mural abscesses, verminousarteritis, enterocentesis, castration and abdominal surgery (Mallicote and Sanchez 2013). Therefore, other causes of septic peritonitis should be ruled out based on the case's history as well as findings during evaluation of the patient. In the event of a rectal tear, the examiner should immediately notify the owner. The location and severity of thetear, treatment options, prognosis and cost of each treatmentshould be discussed. If there is a complicating factor, such ascolic, which was the reason for performing the initial rectalpalpation, this should also be discussed with the owner andconsidered in treatment options and prognosis of the patient.If the owner wishes to pursue further treatment, theveterinarian should contact a referral clinic and consider administration of antimicrobials and anti-inflammatorymedications, especially if the patient is a surgical candidate. Grades of rectal tears Rectal tears are classified into 4 grades based on the extent ofdisruption of the rectal wall (Fig 3). Grade I tears occur when there is disruption of mucosa and submucosa. With grade II tears, the mucosa, submucosa and serosal layers remain intact; however, there is disruption of the muscular layer. Thereare 2 subtypes of grade III tears: Grade IIIa tears involve a disruption of the mucosa, submucosa and muscular layers, butthe serosa remains intact. All 4 layers of the rectal wall are disrupted dorsally in grade IIIb tears into the mesocolon, but themesocolon remains intact. Grade IV tears occur when all 4 layers are torn and there is direct communication between therectal lumen and the peritoneal cavity. Initial treatment Initial management of a rectal tear prior to referral involves measures to reduce straining and peristalsis before evaluatingthe tear with a well-lubricated, bare arm or arm covered in arectal sleeve with the finger tips cut off. Direct digital palpationis helpful in the assessment of the tear due to added sensitivitywithout an examiner's fingertips being covered by gloves. Measures used to reduce straining and peristalsis includeadministration (N-butylscopolammonium Fig 1: Blood observed on a rectal sleeve following rectal palpation. Blood present was due to mucosal irritation from a small colon impaction. Fig 2: Endoscopy of a rectum after blood was observed on a rectalsleeve following routine rectal palpation. Endoscopy revealed multifocal to coalescing areas of mucosal ulceration along the rectal wall. Histopathology of rectal biopsy indicated thepresence of marked, chronic-active lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic proctitis. Potential underlying causes of these lesions include inflammatory bowel disease or extension of an inflammatory or parasitic process in the adjacent small colon. \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd201 EQUINE VETERINARY sodium chloride). Therectum should then be evacuated of the rectum can be performed withgreat care to aid in determining the severity of a rectal tear (Fig 4). If transportation time to a referral facility is expected tobe prolonged, the rectum can be packed oral to the tear with0.25 kg rolled cotton covered by 7.5 cm stockinette ( Fig 5). This packing reduces faecal contamination of the tear and prevents faecal contamination of the peritoneal cavity in thecase of a grade IV or a grade III tear (Baird and Freeman1997). Packing of the rectum, however, is controversial due tothe potential risk for enlargement of the tear by the packing (Baird and Freeman 1997). Packing the rectum after caudal epidural anaesthesia, avoiding excessive distention of the rectum, lubricating the packing and application of towel clamps or purse-string suture in the anal sphincter to retain thepacking may reduce this risk (Baird and Freeman 1997). Oncethe tear has been assessed and first aid measures are taken, aveterinarian should inform their professional liability insurancerepresentative of the tear. In a study of 35 horses with grade III rectal tears, 79% of horses in which adequate first aid was provided survived whileonly 50% of horses survived when adequate first aid was not provided (Watkins et al. 1989). First aid was considered adequate if there was no accumulation of particulate faecalmaterial in the diverticulum formed by the tear or if the tear did Branches of the cranial McMaster Fig 3: Top: Diagram showing the normal anatomy of the rectum. a) Grade I: disruption of mucosa and submucosa, while muscularis and serosal layers remain intact. b) Grade II: disruption of muscularis layers, while mucosa, submucosa and serosal layers remain intact. c) Grade IIIa: disruption of mucosa, submucosa and muscularis layers while serosa remains intact. d) Grade IIIb: all 4 layers of the rectum are disrupted dorsally into the mesocolon, but the mesocolon remains intact. e) Grade IV: all 4 layers are torn resulting in direct communication between the rectal lumen and the peritoneal cavity. \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd202 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015not worsen, resulting in particulate faecal material in the peritoneal cavity (Watkins et al. 1989). Conservative treatment Treatment of rectal tears depends upon their severity, and ranges from conservative management to aggressive surgicalprocedures. Conservative management is mainly reserved forgrade I and IItears, although grade III tears have also been successfully managed conservatively (Watkins et al. 1989; Mair 2000; Alexander and Gibson 2002). Conservative management includes administration of broad-spectrumantimicrobial drugs (penicillin, 22,000 iu/kg bwt i.v. every 6 h, sulfate, every 24 h, metronidazole, mg/kg bwt per os every 8 h, trimethoprim sulfonamides for grade I tears, 25 mg/kg bwt per os every 12 h) (flunixin meglumine, 1.1 h). Administration of faecal softeners (mineral oil) and alterations in diet (moistenedpellets or grass) to reduce intestinal bulk and preventproduction of formed faeces are imperative while the tear ishealing (Mair 2000; Alexander and Gibson 2002). Intravenous fluids and peritoneal lavage can be used as necessary for thetreatment of septic peritonitis if present. Serial haemogramsand frequent monitoring of peritoneal fluid parameters including white blood cell count, total protein and lactate, arerecommended to monitor for the development andprogression of peritonitis. Frequent removal of faeces from therectum may prevent a tear from becoming impacted withfaeces, but great care should be taken with this procedure toavoid inadvertently enlarging the tear during manipulation offaeces. This procedure is labour intensive and requiresrepeated epidural anaesthesia administered through an epidural catheter (Katz and Ragle 1999). Treatment is continued until the tear has filled with granulation tissue and ifthe cytological appearance of peritoneal fluid is normal (Mair2000; Alexander and Gibson 2002). Surgical treatment There are several surgical techniques that may prevent a rectal tear from worsening and improve prognosis. The choiceof technique depends on clinical considerations such as the severity and duration of the tear, client financial constraints and clinician experience. Repair techniques EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015suturing, surgical stapling, faecal diversion procedures or a combination of these techniques. Because a grade III tear often progresses to a grade IV tear, direct suturing of these tears may be indicated (Taylor et al. 1987). Direct suturing is very difficult if tears are not located close to the anus because visualisation of the tear is often poor and manipulation of instruments within the rectummay be difficult because of limited surgical access (Freeman 2012). As a result, repairs made by direct suturing are often performed blindly. Elongated instruments, such as the Deschamps needle 1and a rectal speculum have been designed specifically for repair of rectal tears, but may not beavailable in all referral hospitals because they are infrequentlyused and expensive. Elevating the tail after caudal the Additionally, a sphincterotomy may improve access tothe tear and can be left unsutured to facilitate defaecation. Ifclose to the anus, a grade IV rectal tear can be prolapsedthrough the anus for repair. A caudal ventral midline celiotomymay be necessary to aid in prolapse of the rectum through theanus (Freeman 2012). A rectal tear that cannot be accessed through the anus might be repaired through an antimesentericenterotomy via a ventral midline celiotomy. Suture used for direct repair of rectal tears should be long enough to allow knot tying outside the rectum, have lowmemory, resist stretching and resist faecal digestion. Large-diameter suture should be used as small-diameter suturetends to cut through friable tissue edges (Freeman 2012). Chromic gut is not recommended for direct repairs because it tends to stretch. Simple interrupted or cruciate suture patterns are preferred over a simple continuous suture pattern becausecontinuous patterns tend to reduce luminal diameter (Freeman 2012). An inexpensive technique for nonvisual direct suturing of grade III rectal tears in standing horses has been reported. Repair was achieved through the use of No. 5 Dacron suture 2 and a 6-8 cm half-circle reverse cutting or trochar point needle (Eastman et al. 2000; Freeman 2012). The repair was made using cruciate or simple interrupted suture patterns placed subserosally. Sutures were evaluated by rectal palpation every 24-48 h and were replaced if they began to loosen. Sutures were removed 12-14 days post repair. Seventy-five percent (15/20) of cases survived until discharge when this method of repair was used (Eastman et al. 2000). Although this is an inexpensive repair method, it is not easilymastered and may require extensive practice. Attempts tosuture the tear using this approach may result in enlargementand/or perforation of the tear. In addition, it is not recommended to use this method of repair on tears that are larger than half the circumference of the rectum as this method of repair may significantly reduce luminal diameter. If agrade IV rectal tear is located in close proximity to the anus, direct surgical stapling of the wound can be attempted.Full-thickness stay sutures using a heavy suture material can beplaced craniodorsal and cranioventral to the tear to intussuscept the rectum partially and bring the tear close tothe anus. If the rectum is intussusepted under tension for repair,the repair should proceed quickly to avoid thrombosis or tearing of the mesenteric vessels by the stay sutures (Stewart and Robertson 1990; Kay et al. 2008). In addition, this method of repair should only be performed on peracute tears. Placement and manipulation of stay sutures in a long-standingrectal tear may damage surrounding tissues that are oedematous. A grade IV tear creates a pneumoperitoneum, which equilibrates pressure across the rectal wall and allowsincreased mobility of the rectum. A surgical stapling instrument, such as a TA90 Premium surgical stapler 3, can be applied across the tear and the staple line can be reinforcedwith suture placed a simple continuous pattern with suture placed in a simple continuous pattern. In conjunction with direct suturing, or if direct suturing cannot be achieved, faecal diversion techniques can be usedand consist of either a colostomy or insertion of a temporary indwelling rectal liner. These techniques divert faeces awayfrom the tear, preventing contamination of perirectal tissues, potential enlargement of a tear, or the development of septicperitonitis. Choice of a faecal diversion technique is usually based on a surgeon's preference and budgetary constraints as both methods have comparable success rates (Freeman2012). A colostomy is recommended for rectal tears that involve more than 25% of the rectal diameter, if the rectum is Fig 4: Endoscopy of the rectum used to evaluate a grade IIIb rectal tear in a horse as highlighted by the white arrow. Fig 5: Materials used to pack the rectum, including stockinette, roll cotton, betadine solution and lubricating jelly. \u00a92014 EVJ Ltd204 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015too small or if the tear is located too proximal to accommodate a temporary indwelling liner (Watkins et al. 1989). In addition, a colostomy allows a surgeon more control over the duration of faecal diversion. A temporary indwelling rectal liner can be assembled using a plastic rectal prolapse ring (ProFix Tube)4, No. 5 Dacron suture, a heavy plastic palpation sleeve or arthroscopic camera sleeve (Video Camera Cover)5, a rubber band and cyanoacrylic glue (Super Glue)6. Based on the acute nature of the condition and need for prompt medical and surgicalintervention, it is always beneficial to have a premade rectalliner available for immediate placement. A delay in treatmentwhile collecting materials and assembling a rectal liner for a horse presenting with a rectal tear may have a negative impact on the prognosis of the patient. Toassemble a rectal liner, the plastic rectal ring must be cut to a length of approximately 5-7.5 cm. Small holes, 2 mmin diameter, are then drilled into the ring at one end of the central groove in a circumferential manner, approximately 4 mm apart. Dacron suture is threaded through the drill holesto act as an anchor for securing the rectal liner within the lumen of the small colon. After removing the hand portion of the sleeve, the wrist portion of the sleeve is fastened to the rectal ring using a rubber band andcyanoacrylic glue and is inverted after attachment to protect intestinal mucosa from irritation by the plastic of the rectal ring ( Fig 6). The indwelling rectal liner is manipulated into place through a ventral midline celiotomy after an assistant passesthe ring and sleeve through the anus and into the proximal portion of the rectum. The surgeon manipulates the rectal ringintra-abdominally until it is in the most distal portion of the smallcolon orad to the rectal tear. Using No. 3 chromic gut, acircumferential ligature is applied around the small colon at the level of the central grove of the rectal ring to constrict the serosal surface. Simple interrupted retention sutures of No. 3 chromic gut are equidistantly placed around the circumference of the small colon, incorporatingthe circumferential ligature, the small colon wall and the Dacron anchor sutures ( Fig 7). Retention sutures and the circumferential ligature are over sewn with 3-0 polydioxanonesuture 7in an inverting suture pattern, such as an interrupted or continuous Lembert pattern (Fig 8). Oversewing the intestinal wall effectively creates an anastomosis for when the rectal ringand encircling sutures are sloughed. This usually occurs 9-12 days following placement. A pelvic flexure enterotomy is usually performed at the time of surgery to evacuate the largecolon. After placement of the rectal ring, a nasogastric tube is Fig 6: Assembly of a temporary indwelling rectal liner by cutting one end of a porcine rectal ring to a length of 5-7.5 cm and drillingadditional holes into the ring (a andb), threading the holes with No. 5Dacron suture (c), applying a rectalsleeve (after the hand has beenremoved) around the rectal ringand holding it in place with a rubberband (d), gluing the rectal sleeve tothe rectal ring with cyanoacrylic glue (e) and inverting the rectal sleeve over the rectal ring (f).

Complications associated with placement of an indwelling rectal liner include enlargement of the existing tear, small colon impaction at the proximal edge of the liner, shedding ofthe rectal liner before the tear has adequately healed, as wellas loss of the liner within the rectum if it is not long enough to protrude through the anus (Taylor et al. 1987). Enlargement of an existing tear following placement of an indwelling rectalliner may be reduced by directly suturing the tear prior to placement of the rectal liner (Katz and Ragle 1999). Impactionof the small colon proximal to the edge of the liner may beprevented by dietary changes to soften the stool, as well as periodic retrograde flushing to soften faeces to facilitate theirpassage through the liner. Using an arthroscopic camera sleeve instead of a rectal sleeve when constructing the liner may reduce loss of a rectal liner within the rectum because arthroscopic camera sleeves are more durable and longer in length. There are 2 types of colostomy; loop and end colostomy. A loop colostomy involves creating an enterotomy incision stoma through the antimesenteric tenia of the small colon without completely transecting the bowel. An end colostomyinvolves complete transection of the small colon, over sewingthe distal segment and surgically constructing a stoma with the proximal segment. A loop colostomy is preferred over an end colostomy because it is faster to perform, easier to construct and easier to reverse. One benefit of using an end colostomy in comparison to loop colostomy is that it provides complete faecal diversion (although a properly constructed loop colostomy prevents passage of a significant quantity of faeces into the distal small colon and rectum) (Freeman et al. 1992). Loop colostomy can be performed with one or 2 incisions placed high or low in the left flank or at ventral midline. It maybe placed under general anaesthesia or with local anaesthesia with the horse standing and sedated. It is ideal toplace a colostomy in a standing horse as recovery fromgeneral anaesthesia can result in dehiscence of the anastomosis and a change in position of abdominal musculature from recumbency to standing can potentially cause the colostomy to obstruct. However, generalanaesthesia may be necessary if the rectal tear occurred during examination for colic, as a flank incision may not beadequate for extensive exploration of the abdomen or to treatthe primary cause of colic. Another option is to place the horseunder general anaesthesia to perform extensive abdominal exploration and evacuate the ascending colon. Once the ascending colon has been evacuated, the horse can be recovered from general anaesthesia and then a standing loopcolostomy can be performed. A single-incision colostomy consists of incorporating the small colon stoma in the same incision used to isolate the smallcolon, where a double-incision colostomy involves preparing aseparate site for placement of the stoma. Using a one-incisiontechnique weakens the body wall repair and predisposes thesite to peristomal herniation and stomal prolapse. In addition, itis not ideal to place in a standing horse, as a large incision made in the lower flank is required. With a double-incision technique, the stoma is placed in a secure low flankincision surrounded by intact body wall, which helps stabilise the stoma and reduces the risk of prolapse and herniation (Freeman 2012) ( Fig 9). Colostomy reversal is usually performed within 6 weeks of colostomy placement. The horse is placed under general anaesthesia in right lateral recumbency and a circumferentialcutaneous incision is made approximately 1 cm from the edgeofthe stoma. An inverting suture patter nis used to close the skin over the stoma and the stoma is resected en bloc. Colonic anastomosis is achieved by transecting the distal segment of the small colon at a more acute angle than the proximal segment to minimise the discrepancy in luminal diameterbetween the proximal and distal segments of the small colonanastomosis. The anastomosis site can be sutured in inverting pattern using 3-0 polydioxanone suture.Reversal of a loop colostomy is easier to perform than an end Fig 8: Placement of an indwelling rectal liner in the distal small colon (a, b) with application of a circumferential ligature and simple interrupted retention sutures (c) andoversewing the circumferentialligature / AE / APRIL 2015colostomy due to the fact that the distal segment in an end colostomy can atrophy with a decrease in luminal diameter of up to 50% in some cases (Freeman 2012). Complications of colostomy adhesion formation and descending colon anastomotic impaction (Taylor et al. 1987). In addition, because 2 surgical procedures are required for performing a colostomy, where only one is required for placement of an indwelling rectal liner,the colostomy technique is likely to be more expensive than placement of an indwelling rectal liner for treatment of a rectal tear. Post operative treatment Post operative care after repair of a rectal tear, regardless ofthe repair technique used, consists of administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials (often a combination of penicillin, 22,000 iu/kg bwt i.v. every 6 h, gentamicin, 6.6 24 h and metronidazole, 15 mg/kg bwt per os every 8 h), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (flunixinmeglumine, 1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. every 12 h). In addition, fluids should be provided either i.v. or by nasogastric tube to restoreand maintain hydration. A peritoneal drain can be placed intraoperatively for daily lavage and drainage of the peritoneal cavity with 20-40 litres of a balanced polyionic electrolyte solution or physiological saline if contamination ofthe abdominal cavity with faecal material has occurred as aresult of a rectal tear. Benefits of abdominal drain placement and lavage include removal of bacteria, toxins, debris and inflammatory mediators, as well as decreasing the risk of adhesion formation and improving the contact betweenantimicrobial agents and the peritoneal surface (Hanson 1999). The drain is left in place with daily lavage for 3-4 days total, or until there is cytological improvement in peritonealfluid (Hanson 1999). Diet should be altered to a completepelleted ration to reduce faecal bulk, and mineral oil should be administered with feed or periodically by nasogastric tubeto soften the horse's faeces. Treatment with antibiotics and diet modifications should be continued until the tear has filledin with granulation tissue. If the horse has a colostomy, a neckcradle should be applied to prevent self-mutilation of thestoma. A petrolatum-based ointment should be appliedaround the stoma to protect surrounding skin from scalding (Freeman 2012). When treatment involves the use of a temporary indwelling rectal liner, continuous post operative maintenance of ring patency by retrograde flushing with tap water may be required. The sleeve should be closely monitored to prevent its retraction into the rectum. Prognosis Overall prognosis for horses with rectal tears depends on size, grade and location of the tear, time between occurrence and treatment, and first aid measures applied. Grade I and IItears respond favourably to conservative management, and, in one study, 93% of cases with a grade I rectal tears survived (Eastman et al. 1999). In the same study, 68% of horses with grade IIIa rectal tears and 69.2% of horses with grade IIIb rectal tears survived. Due to the small number of horses with grade II tears in this paper, conclusions could not be drawn on long-term survival. In a separate study, 100% of horses with grade IItears survived (Claes et al. 2008). Treatment of horses with grade III rectal tears consisted of conservative therapy, direct suturing, colostomy or placement of a temporary indwelling rectal liner (Eastman et al. 1999). Only 6% of horses admitted with a grade IV rectal tear survived, with the vast majority of affected horses subjected to euthanasia atpresentation. In a report of 35 horses with rectal tears, 64% ofhorses with a grade III rectal tear survived, whilst none of the horses that presented with a grade IV rectal tear survived. Cases with a grade IIIb tear had a worse prognosis than horses with a grade IIIa tear. The authors attributed this to more tissue disruption with a grade IIIb tear (Eastman et al. 1999). The prognosis for grade IV rectal tears is grave because of faecal contamination of the peritoneum and development of septicperitonitis. Conclusion Rectal tears are a risk of rectal palpation during equine clinicalexamination, can be life threatening for the horse, and are acontinued source of malpractice lawsuits for veterinarians. Prompt medical and surgical intervention is required toimprove overall outcome. Depending on the degree of the tear, aggressive conservative or surgical management can beused, with surgical management consisting of either directsuturing or faecal diversion techniques, such as colostomy or atemporary indwelling rectal liner. Overall prognosis for horseswith rectal tears depends on tear size, grade and location of the tear, time between occurrence and treatment, and first aid measures applied. Failure to manage a rectal tear accordingly will not only negatively impact a horse's prognosis, but will also weaken a veterinarian's legal defenceagainst a malpractice claim. Awareness of risk factors andother precautions reduce the chance of incurring a rectal tear. Authors' declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared.

DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form.INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS.WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure.PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS.Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.).The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth.Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

Ultrasonographic examination of thePSL using the angle contrast ultrasound technique in theflexed limb facilitates assessment of PSL desmopathiesand enthesopathies, with subjectively improved sensitivitycompared with the standard approach. The main limitation ofultrasonography is identification of deep osseous injuries, butcombined with other imaging procedures, ultrasonographyprovides valuable diagnostic information of the injuredstructures.

Introduction Proximal suspensory ligament (PSL, third interosseous muscle)desmopathy/enthesopathy is one most frequentconditions inducing hindlimb lameness in horses (Denoix et al. 1991; Dyson 1991, 2003a,b; Dyson and Genovese 2003)and often has a serious negative impact on the horses'careers. The clinical and imaging diagnosis of this condition has been widely debated in the literature including the use ofdiagnostic analgesic techniques and imaging modalities 1998), nuclear scintigraphy (Dyson et al. 1995, 2007; Martin et al. 1995; Dyson 2003a; Denoix and Audigi\u00e9 2004), magnetic resonance imaging Schneideret al. 2005; Brokken et (Werpy and Denoix 2012). The normalarchitecture of the PSL has been described using histology andMRI in comparison with ultrasound scans performed using aplantar or a slight plantaromedial approach (Bischofbergeret al. 2006; Schramme et al. 2012). A technique describing a plantaromedial approach of the proximal metatarsus to improve visualisation of the PSL in thepelvic limb has been described (Denoix and Farres 1995). Morerecently it was shown that examination of the PSL in the flexedthoracic limb with different probe angulations improvesimaging of its et al. 2008; Werpy and Denoix 2012; Werpy et al. 2013). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate: 1) how to examine the proximal metatarsus in the weightbearing and inthe flexed limb using an angle contrast ultrasound technique(ACUST); and 2) that the use of ACUST in the flexed limb enhances ultrasonographic evaluation of the ultrasound architecture of the PSL and improves the capacity of ultrasonography to detect and document PSL lesions. Basic anatomy The main proximal attachment of the suspensory ligament (SL) is located on the proximoplantar aspect of the third metatarsalbone (MtIII; Fig 1). The most plantar layer of the PSL is a continuation of the distal plantar ligament of the tarsusproviding also the origin of the accessory ligament flexor tendon (DDFT) the distal plantar ligament of the tarsus, the SL inserts indirectly on the first tarsal bone andthird tarsal bone. The most proximal distal insert medially on the sustentaculum tali and are laterally in connection with the long plantar ligament ( Fig 2). These fibres cross the tarsometatarsal joint and are in contactwith recesses of joint (Barone 1989; the PSL, runs the large medialplantar metatarsal vein which provides drainage to the SLwhile blood supply comes from the plantar metatarsal arteries(Fig 3a). The PSL is innervated by the ramus of the lateralplantar nerve originating from the tibial nerve 1989;Denoix 1994a). The PSL, along with the plantar metatarsal vessels and nerves, are confined against the third and between thesecond and fourth metatarsal bones in cases of PSLenlargement (Denoix 2009). On transverse anatomical sections, the PSL first appears narrow and oblong at the level of the tarsometatarsal joint,before getting shaped like a right-angled triangle at itsattachment to the plantar cortex of right sided between MtIII and MtIV). Distally, at the most proximalpart of the body, the SL then becomes oval (Barone 1989). ThePSL is mainly made of dense collagenous connective tissue(tendon) including 2 separate bundles made of fat, andcontaining striated muscles fibres, vessels and nerves (Denoix2009; Schramme et al. 2012; Shikh Alsook et al. 2013). These bundles divide the PSL into a major dorsal sagittal tendinouspart and a part with medial, parts (Fig 3b). This architecture explains theheterogenous echogenicity of the PSL \u00a92015 and Farres 1995; Schramme et al. 2012) that hampers identification of lesions. Equipment Ultrasound scans of the hind PSL presented in this paper were acquired with 5-10 MHz linear and/or 3.5-7.5 MHz convexprobes combined with a 5 mm stand-off pad for the weightbearing examination. Toexamine the PSL flexed limb, 5-10 linear or curvilinear ('microconvex') probes were used. No stand-off pad was needed, the relaxed plantarsoft tissues facilitating contact with the probe. Technique and reference images Horse preparation and positioning of the limb The hair is clipped short from the chestnut to the middle of themetatarsus at the plantar and plantaromedial aspects of the limb. The skin is soaked with warm water and covered withacoustic gel. For the flexed examination, the limb is flexed andheld with the foot placed forward on the operator's knees to be stabilised (Fig 4). In this position, the contralateral PSL couldalternatively be imaged by crossing the limb under theabdomen, moving neither the horse nor the machine. In orderto increase sensitivity and specificity of the ultrasonographicdiagnosis of PSL injuries, comparison to the contralateral limb should always be performed. These positions are well toleratedby most horses but care should be taken with difficult or dangerous horses. Positioning of the probe The PSL is examined on transverse sections using an oblique plantaromedial approach, from the distal row of the tarsus distally to the PSL body. Longitudinal sections are not considered in this paper that focuses on the ACUST technique. Choice of the probe and of the limb position In the weightbearing limb, a linear probe is used with an acoustic pad to improve contact with the skin, the profile of which appears concave on reference images. The ultrasoundbeam is nevertheless slightly oblique to the PSL and MtIII, and the axial border of MtII obscures partially the dorsomedialangle of the PSL. Convex probes can be used in the weightbearing limb with a more complete representation of the lateral and medial margins thanks to the trapezoidalshape of the ultrasound field. In addition, the beam is more perpendicular to MtIII, which appears more echogenic, facilitating detection of bone irregularities. 1 2 3 54 7 6 Fig 1: Dissected specimen showing the proximal suspensory ligament (PSL, third interosseus muscle); plantaromedial aspect. takes place over the proximoplantar aspect ofthe third metatarsal bone.

The short convex surface of the microconvex probe fits well the concave area imaged. It slides easily between MtII and the relaxed plantar soft tissues. In this way, the contact surface is extended and the ultrasound beam can be orientedmore dorsally. Thus, examining the PSL in the flexed limbfacilitates imaging of the entire ligament, the plantar aspect ofMtIII and both intermetatarsal syndesmoses. In addition, flexionof the limb induces relaxation of the flexor tendons. Mild pressure to the probe then induces displacement of the flexortendons, making the PSL much closer to the probe, which improves image resolution. Angle contrast ultrasound technique - normal images Angle contrast ultrasound techniques can be used whatever the probe, in either weightbearing or flexed limbs. This technique is performed from a standard transverseorientation, i.e. probe perpendicular to the longitudinal axis ofthe PSL ('positive image'; Fig 4a), by tilting the probe proximally or distally, i.e. probe oblique to the longitudinal axisof and Denoix 2012). Based isotropic properties of fat, tendon andperitendinous connective tissue, ACUST increases the ability todistinguish the shape of the PSL and its limits from the surrounding soft tissues (Fig 5). This technique also facilitates the imaging of the plantar aspect of MtIII together with the intermetatarsal syndesmosis, with either linear, convex or microconvex probes. By using ACUST, the outline of the PSL is clearer. The PSL distinctly appears triangular to oval ontransverse ultrasound scans at the level of its enthesis on MtIII.It is slightly thicker laterally and medially adjacent to the large 1b1a **1d 1c110 2 35 47 69 12 1113a) b)8 Fig 3: Transverse section of the proximal metatarsus (a) and transverse section highlighting the proximal suspensory ligament (b) confined against the third and between the second and fourthmetatarsal bones by the deep plantar metatarsal fascia.

It fits closely the lateral intermetatarsal syndesmosis without exceeding the plantar borders of MtII and MtIV on the most proximal images (Fig 5). Distally, where the PSL becomes detached from MtIII, the SL appears outlined on negative images with a clear oval shape(Fig 6), separated from the plantar cortex of MtIII tissue and adjacent to the plantar border ofthe PSL, and the accessory ligament of the DDFT, separated from the fascia by connective tissue are also highlighted onnegative images (Fig 5). Besides, ACUST improves imaging of the architecture of the PSL. It increases the ability to discriminate the various components of the PSL, the tendinous fibres becoming hypoechogenic and the fat content remaining echogenic.On reference negative images at the level of the enthesis onthe proximal MtIII, the PSL shows 2 echogenic, lateral and medial, fat bundles with a characteristic crescent shapeoriented in a dorsoplantar direction. These bundles divide thetendon tissue into one major central (sagittal) part and one thinner peripheral part. The peripheral part can further be divided in a medial part, a plantar part and a lateral part(Fig 5c). The size and shape of these different parts of the PSLpresent many individual variations. Abnormal findings and lesions Ultrasonographic findings compatible with PSL injuries includethickening, changes in echogenicity and architecture, and alteration of the enthesial bone surface. Nevertheless,assessment of these changes is challenging when a plantar approach is used. Enlargement of the SL can be suspected when the skin is convex or when the medial plantar metatarsalvein is collapsed (Fig 7). As there is much individual variation within breeds and sizes of horses, measurement of thecross-sectional area (CSA) of the PSL does not provide reliableinformation.

The normal PSL has approximately the same size as the whole deep digital flexor structures (Fig 5). Whenenlarged, the CSA of the PSL is clearly larger ( Fig 7). Moreover, some asymmetry may be seen between left and right hind PSLin the same horse without ligamentous disease. Detection of subtle abnormalities can, however, be challenging, especially as lesions are often bilateral, complicating comparison to the contralateral limb (Fig 7). Angle contrast ultrasound technique is a technique allowing amore accurate detection of subtle enlargements withoutclear global thickening of the PSL, nor collapse of the medial plantar metatarsal vein (Fig 8). In proximal demonstrates clearly that the main sagittal tendinous part of the PSL is enlarged and induces collapse of the medial and/or lateral fat bundles (Fig 8). In addition, for dorsal lesions, the medial and lateral edges of thissagittal part are no longer parallel ( Fig 6) but divergent dorsally (Fig 8c and d); for axial lesions, the distance between the 2 fat bundles increases. Detection of these changes is even easierin the flexed limb, the probe being oriented more dorsally (Fig 8c and d). Lesions of the plantarolateral tendinous part are also more easily identified using ACUST in the flexed limb a)10 6 92 157 8 4 3 10 6 92 15 7 8 4 4310 10 106 92 221 1 1v v v7 8 43 3310 62 17 and right (RH) proximal metatarsal region (medial is to the left) of the same mare presenting chronichindlimb lameness.

The PSL ismore enlarged onthe LH and the plantar metatarsal vein is collapsed on both LH and RH.The oblique incidences show that the sagittal tendinous part of the PSLis enlarged (more severe on the RH)with a collapse of the lateral fatbundle. There is an increased echogenicity (d-f) of the sagittal tendinous part (arrowheads) compared to normal tendon, consistent with fibrous tissue (scar). 1 = = fourthmetatarsal bone; 5 = accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon; 6 = medialdigital flexor tendon; 7 = lateral digital flexor tendon; 2015(Fig 9). In addition, using ACUST, true enlargement of the PSL can enlargement seen in chronic lesions.Further, ACUST is a key technique to assess the evolution stageof a lesion. A diffuse loss of echogenicity of the PSL is generallyobserved on positive images whatever the stage of the lesion(Fig 7a and b). Old or chronic lesions remain hypoechogenic for months or even years. On negative images, acute and subacute lesions become less echogenic than normal tendonwhile old or chronic lesions may be more echogenic becauseof the presence of scar tissue (Figs 7d-f and 10a). Reduction of the PSL CSA and improvement in architecture and echogenicity with even reduction of enthesophytes can alsobe seen when monitoring the repair of the ligament. Irregularities of the plantar aspect of MtIII consistent with PSL enthesopathies as well as hyperechogenic material casting an acoustic shadow (avulsion fracture or dystrophicmineralisation) are also highlighted on negative images, evenmore in the flexed limb, as the probe is more perpendicular tothe plantar aspect of MtIII (Fig 10b). Discussion Technique Improvements in ultrasound technique and equipment, as well as the advancing knowledge of anatomy, architectureand histology, have increased the diagnostic value of ultrasonography. A plantar approach of the limb was used inthe first papers describing PSL injuries (Denoix et al. 1991; Dyson 1991). A plantaromedial approach of the proximal metatarsuswas shown to improve and complete imaging of the PSL in theweightbearing limb (Denoix and Farres 1995). Then, using this approach, the ACUST was demonstrated to improve imagingof the architecture of the PSL (Denoix 2009). Having been performed for more than 5 years, we consider that the ACUSTin the flexed limb is the safest and most reliable ultrasound technique for assessment of PSL enthesopathies and desmopathies. In order to detect subtle changes, detailed evaluation of the size, shape, margins and echogenicity of thedifferent architectural components (sagittal and peripheral tendinous parts as well as lateral and medial fat bundles) of the ligament should be undertaken. Ultrasonographic examination of the PSL in the flexed limb improves image resolution resulting in a higher definition of thePSL architecture and margins. By displacing the plantar softtissues and vasculature, flexion also reduces edge artefacts which could mislead the operator on true lesions. It further extends the representation of PSL and facilitates evaluation ofits relationships with MtIII and intermetatarsal syndesmoses. In addition, the flexed technique is well tolerated by the horse, comfortable for the operator and safer, as the operator is placed at the dorsal aspect of the limb, towards the front.

Diagnostic of PSL injuries remains, however, challenging in clinical practice. Physicaland dynamic examinations are sometimes unrewarding and false positive and false negative responses to diagnosticanalgesic techniques are not unusual (Dyson 2003a,b).

However their sensitivity and specificity is low and some reports have showntheir limited value in the diagnosis of PSL injuries (Dyson 2003a,b;Brokken et al. 2007). Ultrasonography has been proven particularly helpful in the diagnosis of soft tissue injuries(Genovese et al. 1986; Denoix 1994b, 1998). This technique is widely available, noninvasive and can be performed in thefield with portable machines, which is particularly useful to monitor repair and adapt the rehabilitation programme. However, the complex anatomy of the proximal metatarsal region creates various artefacts and limits visualisation of the PSL using a standard approach. Interpretation of images was reported to be confounding in many papers, with low specificity and sensitivity of the standard technique. (Dyson2003a,b; Bischofberger et al. 2006; Labens et al. 2010; Schramme et al. 2012). As previously demonstrated in forelimbs (Denoix et al. 2008; Werpy et al. 2013), this paper indicates that ACUST and examination of the PSL in the flexed limb enhancestandard ultrasonographic examinations of the PSL, therebyimproving the accuracy of the technique. On the basis of thistechnique the contrast between the different intraligamentouscomponents and between the PSL and the surrounding tissuesis highlighted, facilitating the detection of scar tissue. A bettercorrelation between MRI and ultrasonographic findings canthus be obtained (Werpy et al. 2013). Magnetic resonance imaging is considered as the gold standard imaging technique to identify PSL lesions (Dyson2003a; Bischofberger et al. Labens et al. 2010; Schramme et al. 2012). It combines excellent soft tissue contrast and the ability to detect bone lesions. This 3Dmodality combining various contrasts brings additional dataon the extent, nature and stage of the lesion. Magneticresonance imaging is the only method allowing detection ofbone-marrow oedema-like lesions. Such lesions affecting theSL proximal enthesis signs despite noultrasonographic andDenoix 2012). Imaging of the proximal plantar metatarsalregion has nevertheless only been described using high fieldmagnets, with general anaesthesia, cost and low availabilityas constraints, limiting its use in current equine practice. Similarconcerns affect computed tomography, which can be usedto detect PSL injuries with a highly detailed cross-sectionalrepresentation of bone, but soft tissue contrast is lower thanwith MRI and bone marrow oedema-like lesions cannot bedetected. Standing MRI can alternatively be performed onclinical cases to avoid those constraints, but the procedure ischallenging and depends on the horse's behaviour andstability. Resolution of images is inferior and many artefactscan limit image interpretation. Conclusion ACUST improves ultrasound evaluation of the architecture ofthe PSL and its limits from surrounding soft tissue. This techniqueis likely to increase the sensitivity of ultrasonography to detectand document PSL lesions. ACUST can further easily be used tofollow-up healing of PSL lesions. This follow-up is essential toadapt the rehabilitation programme and establish theprognosis for the horse to return to its previous performancelevel.

S. Z. Barakzai Chine House Hospital, Sileby, UK.Corresponding author email: szbarakzai@gmail.com Considering that ventriculocordectomy (VEC) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on horses,there is astonishingly limited evidence available in theveterinary literature on this surgical technique. A search onPubMed reveals only 3 clinical papers which describe VECin horses with naturally occurring recurrent laryngealneuropathy (RLN) and 5 papers describing effects of vocalcordectomy or VEC in horses with experimentally induced (grade 4/4) left sided laryngeal paralysis. This is in contrast to 28 clinical and 11 experimental papers describing prosthetic laryngoplasty (LP), \u00b1ventriculectomy or VEC. For this CAT, experimental studies performed in live horses havebeen included because they provide the vast majority of evidence with objectively analysed repeatable outcomemeasures. There are no papers which directly compare VEC with LP + VEC. One research group, based at Michigan State University,have published 4 consecutive papers objectively evaluatingbilateral VEC, laser vocalcordectomy (VC), laser VEC and LPusing almost identical experimental methods in experimentalhorses with induced RLN, so results from these papers couldjustifiably be compared. From a clinical standpoint, EdinburghUniversity have presented results of the same ownerquestionnaire in 2 separate papers for 200 horses undergoingLP and 98 horses undergoing VEC; again direct comparisonsbetween these papers should be reasonable. To more fully answer the question 'When is VEC all that is required?', other, indirect comparisons between papers must be made, which isnot ideal given the large variation in experimental protocols.This CAT aims to answer several questions that might influenceclinical decision making. Quantity and quality of evidence presented For VC or VEC performed alone, the evidence level is low inboth quantity and quality. Seven of 8 papers are case series(level 4 evidence), and one (Cramp et al. 2009) is a high quality parallel pre-post clinical study (level 3 evidence). Threeexperimental studies present results using clearly defined,objective outcome measures i.e. measurement of soundand/or ventilatory parameters both pre-and post intervention.Of the 8 papers, 5 describe laser VC or VEC, and 3 describe anopen surgery technique. The 3 clinical papers all reportsubjective outcome measures, and 2 additionally reportobjective measures of assessment (sound analysis or racingperformance index). For LP + VEC/VC, the evidence base is much larger. The majority of papers are level 4 evidence case series or casereports (n = 28), however there is one randomised control trialin experimental horses (level 1 evidence, [Tetens et al. 1996]), 5 that compare surgical subjects to a racing-peer cohort (level2-3 evidence), and 5 case-control or parallel pre-post studies(level 3-4 evidence). Objective outcome measures are used inall the experimental studies (n = 11) and, surprisingly, in 20/28clinical papers. How does VEC compare to LP + VEC in terms of reduction of respiratory noise? From 2 experimental studies and one clinical study by the same research group analysing respiratory sounds at exercise, weknow that VEC reduces abnormal noise significantly, to levelsthat are not significantly different to horses without RLN (Brownet al. 2003; Robinson et al. 2006; Cramp et al. 2009). For LP, the same research group reported that inspiratory sound levelimproved significantly from laryngeal hemiplegia values, butdid not return to baseline (preneurectomy state), however VECwas not performed concurrently in this study (Brown et al. 2005). In clinical papers, the absence of owner reported noise is often used as a marker of surgical success. Two papers by theEdinburgh group (Dixon et al. 2003; Taylor et al. 2006) described that a slightly higher percentage of horses werereported by owners to make abnormal respiratory noises afterVEC (34%) as compared with LP + VEC (27%). How does VEC compare to LP + VEC in terms of improvement of ventilatory parameters? Research has shown that both bilateral surgical and unilateral laser VEC appear to be extremely effective in improvinginspiratory trans-upper airway pressure (P ui) in horses with experimentally induced laryngeal hemiplegia, withimprovements in P uiof 62-78% after bilateral surgical and unilateral laser VEC (Brown et al. 2003; Robinson et al. 2006). This measurement matches the improvement in P uithat was recorded by the same group in horses undergoing LP (70%improvement, [Brown et al. 2005]). Other authors have reported similar magnitudes of improvement in ventilationafter LP. In clinical terms, 59% of horses were reported to haveimproved exercise performance after unilateral VECcompared to 75% of horses that underwent LP + VEC (Dixonet al. 2003; Taylor et al. 2006). Does the preoperative grade of RLN influence effectiveness of VEC or LP + VEC? This question has not been evaluated for VC or VEC alone. Witte et al. (2009) found that horses with grade 4 laryngeal function showed less improvement after LP + VEC than grade 3horses. Other studies have found no effect of preoperative grade on the results of LP surgery (Dixon et al. 2003; Barakzai et al. 2009). Does the use of the horse influence effectiveness and requirement for VEC or LP + VEC? Making indirect comparisons between studies, VEC appears to have a higher rate of owner satisfaction and noise reduction innonracehorses than in racehorses. Similarly, studies that218 \u00a9 2015 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015evaluated LP + VEC in mixed-breed populations found the level of owner satisfaction was higher for nonracehorses(86-100%) than racehorses (48-80%, [Russell and Slone 1994;Kidd and Slone Dixon et al. 2003]). The complication rate for draught horses undergoing LP is particularly high, andthis is primarily associated with anaesthetic-related morbidity and mortality (Bohanon et al. 1990; Kraus et al. 2003). Ventriculocordectomy alone appears to yield a high rate ofowner satisfaction in draught breeds (Cramp et al. 2009). How do complication rates compare for the 2 surgeries? Laryngoplasty has an undeniable adverse effect on upper airway health, whether clinically apparent or subclinical, andthis is supported by both subjective and objective data in theliterature. Complications associated with LP are many andappear to occur relatively frequently. To illustrate this, 7 of the28 papers on LP surgery that came up in the PubMed searchfor this CAT are reports focusing on complications of thesurgery. In contrast, surgical complications associated withVEC appear to be much less frequent (3-14%) and are usuallyresolvable in the short term (Taylor et al. 2006; Henderson et al. 2007; Cramp et al. 2009). Other factors influencing the decision In clinical practice, other factors come into account whendeciding between VEC and LP + VEC for which there are nopublished facts and figures. Owners on a limited budget aremore likely to opt for VEC alone as the costs of LP + VEC arebetween 2 and 4 times the cost of VEC alone. Additionally,longer recuperation time after LP surgery must be considered. Conclusions The evidence suggests that noise reduction achieved by VECis similar to LP, however there are no published results for noisereduction in horses undergoing LP + VEC and this should beinvestigated. VEC is associated with fewer complications andless cost than LP, it could be considered as the treatment ofchoice for lower grade RLN and any grade particularly draught breeds.

Naylor Equine Referral Hospital, Royal Veterinary College, North Mymms, UK.Corresponding author email: rnaylor@rvc.ac.uk Background Large colon impactions, defined as an accumulation of dehydrated ingesta (Plummer 2009), are a common cause ofcolic in the horse. The aetiology of colon impactions is not fullyunderstood, although a dysfunction of intestinal motility hasbeen suggested as have other management changes thatlead to fluid shifts out of the large colon (Dabareiner and White1995). Treatment of affected horses involves rehydration ofingesta whilst withholding feed and providing analgesia.Rehydration of ingesta is typically performed by administeringfluids via nasogastric tube or intravenously; suggested tocreate a state of systemic overhydration and promote colonicsecretion. Intravenous fluids are more expensive than oralfluids, require intravenous catheterisation and adequatefacilities for fluid delivery, therefore it is important to criticallyevaluate the evidence pertaining to their use. Research question Do intravenous fluids reduce treatment time when managinglarge colon impactions in the horse? Search strategy Medline was used to search for primary evidence using thefollowing terms: 1 Large colon impaction AND horse AND fluids 2 Colonic hydration AND horse AND fluids Quantity of evidence Search one yielded 5 results of which 2 (Dabareiner and White1995; Hallowell 2008) were relevant. Due to the relative paucityof clinical evidence, a further search was undertaken to include experimental studies of normal colon physiology, yielding 3 additional references (Lopes et al. 2002, 2004; Lester et al. 2013). Search 1 Quality of evidence Both Dabareiner and White (1995) and Hallowell (2008) areretrospective studies of hospital admissions, as such treatmentswere not randomly allocated and results are subject toselection bias and unblinded evaluation. Despite this Hallowelldemonstrated no difference in admission data betweentreatment groups suggesting groups may be comparable.Treatment protocols were standardised in Hallowell's work withpatients receiving one of 4 treatment protocols (IVFT or 3different rates of nasogastric fluids), whereas treatments werenot standardised by Dabareiner and White. See Table 1. Generalisability - do the results apply? Both Dabareiner and White (1995) and Hallowell (2008)included horses with naturally occurring large colonimpactions, although cases were possibly more severe thanencountered in first opinion practice given the referralpopulation. In both studies fluids rates administered werecomparable to those achievable in practice. Application of results to clinical practice Unfortunately the lack of an untreated control group meansthat it is not possible to determine if the use of intravenous fluidswas beneficial. Search 2 Quality of evidence Three prospective cross-over studies investigating the effect ofintravenous fluid therapy on hydration of colonic ingesta andfaeces in normal horses were identified (Lopes et al. 2002, 2004; Lester et al. 2013). In these studies each horse acted as its own control, treatment were standardised and orderadministered randomised, therefore the quality of evidence ishigher. Although no untreated control group is present in 2 ofthese studies (Lopes et al. 2002; Lester et al. 2013) baseline levels of faecal hydration prior to interventions beingperformed are used to determine outcome. See Table 2. Generalisability - do the results apply? The 2 studies by Lopes and co-workers were performed inclinically normal horses with right dorsal colon fistulation,without impactions of the large colon. How the results relate tothe clinical case with a large colon impaction and disturbedgastrointestinal physiology is difficult to extrapolate. Lester TABLE 1: Search one Study DesignLevel of evidence Dose of IVFT Case definition Outcome measured Hallowell 2008 UK Retrospective n=5 34 5 ml/kg bwt Colic >24 h, normovolaemic, rectal palpationDuration of hospitalisation and cost of treatment Dabareiner White USARetrospective n = 1474 LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2015et al. (2013) attempted to address this by withholding water for 24 h prior to comparing treatment effects, this resulted in an approximate 5-8% reduction in faecal water content. All 3 studies monitored change in faecal water content as their major outcome; however, the magnitude of change in faecal water content required to significantly contribute to theresolution of an impaction is unknown. Application of results to clinical practice The administration of 10 l/h (17-23 ml/kg bwt/h) of IVFT resultedin increases in faecal water content in healthy normovolaemichorses after 6 h, whilst this was not achieved at a lower dose of5 l/h (9-11 ml/kg bwt/h) after 12 h. Increases in the faecalwater content were observed in dehydrated horses treatedwith lower doses of IVFT (2, 4 and 6 ml/kg bwt/h). Conclusions Intravenous fluids are beneficial in rehydrating the ingesta ofthe normal and dehydrated large colon, whether thistranslates to a clinical benefit in the treatment of the horse witha large colon impaction has not been established. Arandomised prospective clinical trial to evaluate the use ofdifferent doses of i.v. fluids is required and study design wouldideally include an untreated control group, although this maybe ethically challenging to include.
