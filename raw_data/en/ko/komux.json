RAMPBALLS PLACED IN CLUSTERS What distances should one choose when multiple balance balls are placed in a group? Here's some advice: - The minimum required distance between balls is calulated by adding maximum tilts of ball 1 and 2 to the skull standard width (23 cm). - For children up to about 6 years of age, the balls should be placed at the minimum required distance to make it possible to jump from one ball to the next without stepping on the ground. - For older children, the distances can be increased slightly. - If there are 3 or more balls in a group, one should strive for variation in the distances. - Varied distances create more variation in the play in terms of challenge and degree of difficulty. This makes the setup suitable for a wider age group. - The balls can be placed in a row to form an obstacle course, or in clusters. - When multiple balls are placed in a circle they can also act as a seating area. We are happy to assist you with advice for designing an exciting motor skill park adapted to the relevant age group.
