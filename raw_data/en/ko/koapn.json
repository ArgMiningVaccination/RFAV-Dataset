Individual herbs, specifically prescribed for a particular situation may assist the body to come back into balance, thereby allowing a healthy homeostasis to be reinstated as nature intended. The herbalist looks to the whole person, their values and attitudes as well as their circumstances and physical condition along with other aspects of their individuality. This is in marked contrast to the allopathic medicine approach. Below you will find an example of selected herbs for a particular condition. Herbal support can take a variety of forms and combinations, so it is vital that each person consult directly with a qualified holistic practitioner to gain the full benefit of immunity and health building support. I can address the various aspects of the disease and your recovery from it with a simple concentrated herbal extract mixture containing the ingredients as follows; Maritime Pine Bark: This is a powerful antioxidant which works at the fundamental levels of the immune system offering the best chance to turn the autoimmunity back around from attacking your own nerve fibres. Wheat Grass: This is a second antioxidant which I am experimenting with in autoimmune cases. Hypericum which has specific positive effects on the myelin sheath of nerve fibres and is a great help in the case of Parkinson's and Bells Palsy both of which involve physical degeneration and or inflammation of the nerve fibres. Mugwort which is another nervous system tonic which is used to support healing of any physical nervous system injury. Elecampane which is a well known support for healing of bones and connective tissue but also works to normalise other tissue in the body. Saw Palmetto which has a particular function in rehabilitating wasted muscle tissue resulting from prolonged immobility illness or loss of nerve supply. To this mixture I will be adding some homeopathic remedies besides and I can confidently predict that we can speed up your recovery dramatically. The dose rate will be 20 drops three times per day in water. For the purposes of your case I would ask that you change nothing else at all either in terms of diet or other treatments for the first four weeks of the program to give us an idea of the effect of the mix. McDowell's staff Herbalists can not diagnose your disease or illness. What they can do is offer a Herbal program, to assist with healing, after you have had advice from your doctor or specialist. If you have unexplained pain or symptoms, seek medical advice. If you wish to ask for any further information or clarifications on this product please click on the link below.
