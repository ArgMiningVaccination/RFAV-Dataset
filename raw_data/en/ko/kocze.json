Kudos to you! In this practical guide, we will go hand-in-hand here in your journey towards using healing crystals and gemstone jewelry in your everyday life. Before we go deeper, let us clarify one thing: when we say [crystals](https://store.ringtoperfection.com/collections/spiritual-crystals-necklaces), we mean [gemstones](https://store.ringtoperfection.com/collections/gemstone-bracelets), healing crystals, natural stones, or healing stones. People have been using these terms interchangeably for quite some time and we want to be all-inclusive here. Now, on we go... What are Healing Crystals? [Healing crystals](https://store.ringtoperfection.com/collections/gemstone-bracelets) are the main natural stones and gemstones that are used in crystal healing, a form of holistic healing that leans towards alternative medicine and spiritual energy. The crystals are used as conduits that allow positive energy to freely flow and negate bad vibes and energy inside and around you. Now you're asking how is positive energy blocked but bad energy isn't? Honey, life isn't all fast WIFI, warm tippy-toe hugs, your mom's freshly-baked cookies, and free-flowing wine. The hassle of your Monday morning commute, the bills that need to be paid, the incessant emails from work, your favorite show getting canceled, or the stink eye your neighbor's kid gave you; all these seemingly little things, when combined, can cause stress and tension that accumulate inside you. These day-to-day activities affect you in larger ways than you can imagine. Stress and negative energy can cause our chakra points to be unbalanced or blocked. Hence, we need activities or [items](https://store.ringtoperfection.com/collections/spiritual-crystals-necklaces) that can help us rebalance and maintain a healthy chakra system. If you're a newbie at this, don't worry, we'll get into the good stuff in a bit but, basically, every person has seven chakra points that correspond to different parts of your physical and spiritual being. This is where healing stones come in, they remove blockages and protects the wearer from further damage by repairing the out-of-whacked energy balance.

Although healing crystals are mostly for [spiritual healing](https://store.ringtoperfection.com/collections/spiritual-stones), a messed-up chakra system can have physical manifestations such as headaches, feeling stiffness, and soreness. The pain or the illness varies according to which chakra point is unbalanced. When you suddenly start feeling off or getting a bad feeling about something in your body, take that as a sign that something isn't right. Better ready your chakra stones soon.
