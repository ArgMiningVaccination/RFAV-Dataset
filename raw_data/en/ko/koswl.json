During her PhD at the Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands, her research focused on the function of innate immune cells (mast cells and basophils) in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and in particular if and how their responses in RA are distinct from responses to foreign antigens such as occur in allergy. After her PhD, she came to the lab of Betty Diamond for her postdoctoral training, and focused on the adaptive part of the immune system by studying B cells in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). She combines fundamental immunology with translational studies to gain an understanding in how the B cell response to self (autoreactive) is distinct from the response to foreign antigens. She focuses on differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, which are responsible for the production of antibodies which target tissues of patients. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects primarily women in early childbearing age, and therefore has a devastating impact on patient lives. Only one new therapeutic has been approved for the treatment of SLE in the past 60 years. As most current therapies for SLE and other autoimmune diseases are highly immunosuppressive, and therefore increase susceptibility to infection, there is an urgent need for more specific therapies that affect only autoreactive cells or pathways. SLE patients produce anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), sometimes years before the first symptoms. Despite the well-known presence of these antibodies in serum, the loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens is not well understood. In the lab of Betty Diamond, Dr. Suurmond discovered that the loss of the IgG plasma cell tolerance checkpoint is the primary B cell abnormality in SLE and she identified distinct phenotypes of ANA+ B cells and plasma cells which can stratify SLE patients and are correlated to distinct plasma cell differentiation pathways. In particular, Dr. Suurmond and her team believe that in some SLE patients the extrafollicular plasma cell differentiation pathway dominates, whereas in other patients the germinal center pathway is the major origin of pathogenic plasma cells. This stratification opens up a unique opportunity to target disease-specific pathways using precision medicine, thereby decreasing the degree of immunosuppression in different patient groups. Dr. Suurmond is currently working to define the heterogeneity of plasma cells in SLE (repertoire and phenotype) with the goal to discover therapeutic targets for distinct differentiation/activation pathways.
