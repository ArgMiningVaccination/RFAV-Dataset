Merchant, MD, PhD Affiliation: Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology , University of Arizona College of Medicine Abstract Background: About 10 percent of all colorectal cancers are in subjects who are not yet 50 (EO -CRC) and the occurrence of early onset colorectal cancer (EO -CRC) is rising in the US. Patients with CRC are twice as likely to have diabetes or be overweight. Using targeted exome sequencing of germline DNA from EO -CRC subjects, we identified a missense mutation at Ala98Val within the DNA binding domain of Hepatic Nuclear Factor 1 alpha (HNF1A, 12q24.31, Rs1800574). HNF1A is the most frequently mutated gene in diabetic individuals whose onset of diabetes occurs typically before age 25 (MODY3 locus). Aim: To demonstrate that the HNF1A variant provides a genomic landscape for EO -CRC to develop in the setting of a specific diet type. Methods: HNF1A was identified us ing targeted exon sequencing of leukocyte DNA from HNF1AA98V expressing plasmids were transfected into HCT116 colon cancer cells and nuclear extracts were prepared for Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs) to test binding differences. An Hnf1aA98V mutant mouse model was generated using CRISPR/Cas9. WT, Hnf1a A98V/+ and Hnf1a A98V/A98V mice were diets --normal chow, a high fat (~34%) diet (HFD) or a high sugar (~62% fructose) diet (HSD) aft er weaning at 3 weeks. The mice were followed for 12 months, weighed monthly, and observed for clinical signs of morbidity. After euthanizing, blood, colon and liver were collected for histology and qPCR. Results : HNF1AA98V was identified in 13/145 subject s with EO -CRC. An additional 3 subjects exhibited mutations elsewhere in HNF1A. Flag -tagged WT and mutant HNF1A -expressing plasmids were transfected into HCT116 colon cancer cells and nuclear extracts showed reduced HNF1AA98V binding to its consensus DNA element by EMSA. Only heterozygous or homozygous Hnf1aA98V mice on the HFD showed a significant number of colon polyps (~19%). Only 1/22 heterozygous mice developed a polyp on the RNA -Seq analysis of colonic mucosa from the homozygous mutant compared t o WT mice revealed an increase lipid and b -catenin regulated genes. Specifically, there was an increase in b -catenin, LEF 1 and MYC by immunohistochemistry in the polyp of HNF1AA98V, but not in the adjacent normal tissue. Liver steatosis in the Hnf1aA98V versus WT mice on the HFD was observed. Conclusions : Occurrence of the HNF1AA98V variant is increased among a cohort of EO -CRC patients and is a loss of function mutation that creates a genetic landscape for colon polyps on a HFD.

Our previous studies have found that mice with partial HIF-1 alpha deficiency had greater bone regeneration co mpared to wildtyp e mice, in which a reduction in apoptosis was iden tified. Thus, it is crucial to further investigate the role of apoptosis during fracture healing. We hypothesized that specific apoptotic signaling pathways are upregulated during fracture healing, with a peak at post fracture day (PFD) 14. Based on the data collected, we also hypothesiz e that inh ibition of apoptosis will improve the rate and quality of bone regeneration. The animal study consisted of male, 4-month-old C57/B6 mice randomly assigned to be euthanized and analyzed at post fracture day (PFD) 5, 10, 14, and 21. Surgery consisted of anesthetization and insertion of an intramedullary needle into the left femur before a closed transverse midshaft femur fracture was induced using a 3-point impulse load. RNA was isolated and purified, and gene expression of apoptotic signaling pathways was then measured by (Qiagen), which contain primers for 84 apoptosis related genes. Data wer e analyzed using ABI SDS software and Qiagen GeneGlobe to quantify background normalized fold regulation values between intact and fractured femoral samples. Harvested femurs were decalcified, embedded in paraffin, and Fluorescent antibodies. The qPCR results indicated that upregulation of caspases was notable on PFD 14 with significant increases seen for caspase 3, caspase 4, caspase 6, and LTBR, which were upregulated by 155 -, 93-, 223-, and 309-fold, respectively. Given the high levels of expression , caspase 6 and LTBR were selected for IHC analyses. The results indicate that apoptosis is abundant in chondrocytes and osteoblasts within the femoral fracture callus on PFD 14. Minimal staining was seen on PFD 5 and 21. Moreover, staining was most prevalent in active osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes, particularly in regions undergoing endochondral o ssification. These findings support our hypotheses that apoptotic signaling peaks at PFD 14 during murine fracture healing, and only specific members of this large class of signaling pathways are activated. This study has provided insight into which types and to what extent genes are activated during skeletal repair. Further inv estigation is needed to determine if pharmaceutical intervention of these specific pathways can reduce apoptosis and consequently improve s keletal r egeneration.

Title: MODIFIED MIR-1 5A I NHIBITS AC TIVATION AND PROLIFERATION PANCREATIC STELLATE CELLS BY TARGETING B AND Category: Undergraduate Student Abstract: Introduction: Characterized by structural damage due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis is associated with significant morbidity . Its major histological feature is widespread fibrosis, which results from the progressive activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Per turbatio ns to no n-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to be directly involved in pancreatitis. Recent publications have demonstrated that miR-15a, which targets YAP1 and BCL-2, is significantly downregulated in patients with chronic pancreatitis as compared to healthy controls. We have developed a novel miRNA modification strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of miR-1 5a by replacing Uracil with ectopic delivery of 5-F U-miR-15a will inhibit the progression of chronic pa ncreatitis by targeting activated PSCs (human and murine). Methods: We induced chronic pancreatitis using four weeks of intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (injury inducer) in Ptf1aCre and Ptf1aCre ;LSL-K ras mice. Mice treated with PBS were used as controls. We performed H&E and immunohistochemistry staining on tissues obtained from animals in each experimental group. For in vitro studies, we employed murine pancreatic stellate cells. In vitro studies included cell viability, proliferation, assessing of the activity of various signaling pathways using western blot analysis, cell migration of PSCs, and invasion assay for mu rine pancreatic cancer cells. were control miR, miR-15a, and 5-F U-miR-15a alone or in combination with TGFb1 or PDGF over the course of six days. Statistical analysis was performed using Gr aphPad Prism software. Results: We demonstrated increased lev els of YAP-1 and BCL-2 (both targets of miR-1 5a) obtained from Ptf1aCre and ras mice after chronic pan creatitis induction as compar ed to controls. In vitro studies showed that delivery of 5-F U-miR-15a significantly decreased proliferation and viability of murine pancreatic stellate cells over the course of six days as compar ed to 5-FU, TGFb1, control miR, and miR-15a treatments. In addition, treatment of mur ine pancreatic stellate cells with 5-F U-miR-15a in the context of TGFb1 treatment exerted a stronger effect than TGFb1 alone or in a combination with other miRNAs. Simi lar effects were observed u pon PDGF co-t reatment. I mportantly, we demonstrated that treatment with 5-F U-miR-15a reduced the levels of YAP-1 and BCL-2 observed activated PSCs. Treatment of murine PSCs with 5-F U-miR-15areduced their migration. Furthermore, conditioned medium 5-FU-miR-15a-t reated PSCs reduced in vasion of murine pancreatic cancer cells. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest th at ectopic delivery of miRNA mimetics are a pr omisin g therapeutic ap proach for pancreatic fibrosis and that 5-FU-miR-15a shows specific promise.

Title: Co-A dministration of Methylphenidate and Fluo xetin e Adversely Impacts Weight Gain in Adolescent Rats with Negligible Effects on Skeletal Development Authors: Edie and Rehabilitation, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 2University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 3BNNLA -Resear ch Institute on Addictions, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology SUNY University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 4Department of Biological and Chemical Sciences, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, sold as Ritalin, is a widely prescribed psychostimulant used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) . Clinically, our laboratory and others have demonstrated that long-t erm MP treatment adversely impact s growth patterns. Fluoxetine (FLX) is an anti -depressant that is frequently co - prescribed with MP for depression and anxiety. The use of FLX, like MP, is also associated with skeletal defects . We sought to elucidate the skeletal effects of exposure to MP and FLX, singly and in combination. F our-week -old male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into 4 groups (Water, MP, FLX, and MP + FLX). The drugs were administered daily using an 8- hour drinking protocol. After 4 weeks of treatment, the animals were euthanized and bones were collected for analy ses. Bone morphology was assessed using digital calipers, microCT, and histology using s afranin O/ fast green and picrosirius red staining. Biomechanical outcomes were determined by 3 -point bending tests. Growth plate height was measured using ImageJ. As body weights in the MP, FLX, and MP + FLX groups were all lower than Water, the data were compared directly and after adjusting to body weight via linear regression. Through direct comparison, rats in the MP + FLX group had significantly short er and na rrower, femora and tibiae compared to most other groups. The MP + FLX group also displayed shorter, disorganized growth plates . MicroCT analyses of the trabecular compartment of the BV/TV, vBMD accompan ied by increases in Tb.Sp for MP + FLX compared to Water. Similar analyses of femoral midshaft cortical bon e identified reductions for Ct.V, Ps.V, Ec.V, pMOI, as well as increases for Ct.Th and for TMD for MP + FLX compared to Water. Biomechanically, there was a decrease in ultimate force in MP + FL X compared to Water. The micro -structural and biomechanical effects of MP + FLX were eliminated after adjustment for body weight, however, the detrim ental effects on growth plate morphology remained. T hese data initially suggest ed that exposure of adolescent rats to MP and FLX for 4 weeks contributed to signif icant adverse skeletal effects. Yet after the adjustment for body weight, many of these effects were excluded , which indicates that the hindrance of weight gain, influenced by MP+FLX, is largely responsible for the skeletal changes. Our study demonstrates the need for further preclinical and clinical studies of the effects of MP and FLX on the skeletal health of adolescents.

Title: AUM-302, a novel triple kinase PIM/PI3K/mTOR 1Department R enaissance S chool of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA 2Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, N C, USA 3Department of Biological & Biomedical Sciences, C ollege of Health & S ciences, North C arolina Central University, Durham, NC , Abstract: Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is the third of cancer deaths, with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) being the most common subtype. Usually, PDAC is diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited treatment opportunities. Gemcitabine is the standard chemotherapy and can be use d as a single agent or in combination. However, poor penetration through stroma and development of chemoresistance within weeks of treatment initiation limit its efficacy. Activation of signaling pathways such as PI3K, EGFR, MAPK, NF -kB, and SHH has been shown to lead to the development of chemoresistance. Previous studies demonstrated that proto- oncogene serine/threonine- protein kinases 1 and 3 (PIM1 and PIM3) are upregulated in PDAC compared to control cell lines. PIM kinases have been shown to regulate t he activity of PI3K and JAK -STAT pathways. Downregulation of PIM1 siRNA significantly reduced PDAC cell proliferation. Aim: This study assessed the efficacy of compounds targeting PIM kinases in the context of PDAC. Methods: We tested the effectiveness of TP -3654, a known PIM inhibitor, and AUM -302, a novel triple PIM/PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, in five human PDAC cell lines. We assessed cells' viability using Cell- Titer Glo, proliferation, cell cycle with FACS analysis, and activity of signaling pathways regulated by PIM kinases via western blot. Additionally, we compared the efficacy of both compounds in MIA PaCa -2 Gemcitabine -resistant and MIA PaCa- 2 Gemcitabine -sensitive cell lines. Statistical analysis was performed using one - and two- way ANOVA wi th GraphPad Prism 9.Results: We determined for TP -3654 were in the micromolar range whereas AUM -302 was in the low -nanomolar range in tested cell lines. Cell proliferation assay over 72h showed that AUM -302 at 10nM and 100nM concentrations significantly reduced the growth of tested PDAC cell lines compared to control and TP-3654 treatment. Cell cycle analysis showed that AUM -302 treatment significantly increased G0/G1 and G2/M phases and reduced S -phase compared to controls and TP -3654 tre atment. Western blot analysis phospho- S6 (Ser235/236) ribosomal in cells treated with AUM -302 as compared to controls and TP -3654- treated cells. AUM -302 inhibited the proliferation of MIA PaCa- 2 Gemcitabine -resistant cells at 10nM and 100nM and resulted in cell death at 1mM concentration, while TP - 3654 was not effective at these concentrations. Significantly, AUM -302 reduced phospho- AKT (Ser473) in MIA PaCa- 2 Gemcitabine -resistant cells at low nanomolar concentrations. Conclusion: In vitro studies show that the AUM -302 compound strongly inhibits the growth of PDAC cells and has the potential to overcome the gemcitabine-resistant phenotype of pancreatic cancer cell lines, and thus has the pot ential to be an effective drug for PDAC therapy.

Only a few of these studies clearly defined when and where the 'pre- operative' pain scores were measured. It is important to describe this timepoint since patients can have multiple pre-operative visits such as the surgeon's office and/or the pre-operative holding area prior to surgery. This study aimed to determine the potential variability in self -reported pain occurring between the pre- operative office visit and day of surgery in a group of surgical patients at Stony Brook University Hospital. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of select patients who underwent surgery at Stony Brook University Hospital from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 after obtaining IRB approval with a waiver of consent. Two groups of surgeries were considered: Group 1- those in which patients were likely to report pain pre - operatively since one of the procedure indications is treatment of a painful condition (elective total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, and spinal fusion); and Group 2 - a control group of procedures in which patients were much less likely to report pain before surgery (thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, and nephrectomy). Exclusion criteria included trauma patients, those less than 18 years of age, multiple surgeries at the time of the i ndex surgery, and greater than 90 days between the office visit and surgery. The data collected from electronic medical records included demographics, preoperative history and medications, and pain scores at the pre-operative visits i.e., surgeon's office visit and pre -operative holding area on the day of surgery. Level of agreement between these pre- operative pain scores will be assessed. An analys is will be performed to confirm internal validity of the pain assessments. Group 1 pain scores should be great er than Group 2, regardless of which pre- operative assessment is analyzed. Results: Data from more than 2,000 patients undergoing surgery were abstracted: total knee arthroplasty (n>400), total (n>570), (n>250). Results are currently undergoing statistical analysis. Conclusion: The primary analysis will assess the variability in self -reported pain across the two pre 6/21/2022. Anti-ca psular Antibody Against Carbapenem-Re sistant Klebsiella pneumoniae shows cross reactivity ac ross a panel of C R-Kp and ESB L Kp strain s Authors iseas e Division, Ston y Brook University, Ston y Brook, Ne w York, USA, 2Veteran' s Administration Medica l Center, Northport, Ne w York, USA, 3Department of M olecular G enetics and Microbiology, Ston y Brook University, Ston y Brook, Ne w York, USA Presenting Author: Mariss a Lindner / marissa.lindner@stonybrookmedicine.edu Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR -Kp) are a threat to the global health care system . The polysaccharide capsule (CPS) of CR -Kp is highly immunogenic and a key virulence factor that shields CR -KP from the host defense. D eveloping CPS-specific m onoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as n ovel therapeutics to treat CR- Kp infections is being considered, but one concern is that the CPS of CR -Kp strains is very heterogenous. T he most common clonal group (CG) of CR -Kp is CG258, which in the US represent s 74% of carbapenemase- producing CR-Kp. Of 382 CG258 harboring -Kp followed by CG307 (7%). CPS of CR -Kp can be typed by sequencing of the wzi gene. Wzi sequencing data from 380 US CR-Kp strains showed 47.9% express wzi 154 CPS, also referred to as capsule % wzi 29 (KL106); 6.6% CPS of CR-Kp. This mAb has shown protective efficacy in vivo even if given 4 hours post infection. I n this study we extended our study and investigated if mAb24D11 binds to a collection of K. pneumoniae strains expressing wzi29, wzi154 and wzi50- type CPS. by agglutination tests , direct immunofluorescence, affin ity ELISA assays with J774.1 murine macrophages. The K. pneumoniae collection C R-Kp and 12 ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta- Lactamase) isolates. The agglutination findings confirm ed a broad cross -reactivity of mAb24D11 with 37 tested strains that was consistent wi th whole cell ELISA and direct immunofluorescence results . The phagocytosis assays results were variable especially in wzi154 strains. They showed that mAb24D11 mediated opsonophagocytosis can be complement -independent , and or dependent when compared to non-opsonized controls. Furthermore, our data showed that mAb24D11 induced significant killing of most of the CR -Kp strains , which is best shown in peripheral blood cell killing assays . Our results confirm that mAb24D 11 is broadly reactive with different Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, including CR and ESBL strains. In future studies, we will analyze in vivo protection with low agglutination strains, to investigate if ag glutination titers correlate with protective efficacy in an intranasal infection model.

Title: Increased rates of Lung Cancer in Woman: A literature review Authors: Denise Albano, DNP (Department RAD/ONC) Esther surgery/ student) Hannah surgery/ SBU Chest) Presenting Author: Hannah Talavera Introduction: Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in woman. More than 61,360 deaths in 2022 have been reported which is more than breast cancer, uterine and ovarian cancer combined. Lung cancer cases in woman also differ from those of men and are not necessarily associated with smoking. This study is aimed to see if the re is difference in the characteristics of women diagnosed with lung cancer compared to men. Methods: This retrospective study included review of published articles as well as data collected from the Lung Cancer Evaluation Center. Inclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with lung cancer from 2013-2020. Demographics, radiologic, histology, smoking status were investigated. Results: 612 patients diagnosed with lung cancer were reviewed. 321 patients were woman, 19 patient's nonsmokers, all of which were female. Histology was mainly adenocarcinomas with a few bronchoalveolar carcinomas. Literature review indicated risk factors for woman including radon exposure, stove top use, aspirin use, previous radiation exposure, and delay of care from guilt. Conclusion /Clinical Relevance : Lung cancer remains the leading cause of death in the USA. Woman have an increased chance of getting lung cancer even if they do not smoke. Lung cancer screening may need to incorporate higher risk woman to diagnose them earlier for improved outcomes.

A major source of ceramide is the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into sphingomyelinases. sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) is the major neutral SMase in mammalian cells f or stress-induced generation of ceramide. Although nSMase2 is widely expressed in the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus of many mammalian cell types, its highest expression is in the brain. In particular, nSMase2 has been implicated in extracellular vesicle biogenesis as a critical regu lator of exosomes that package and transfer pathogenic factors including metastasis-promoting microRNAs, tau protein and amyloid . Here we show that we have successfully purified active human nSMase2. Going forward, we plan to determine the structure and characterize effect of inhibitors on nSMase2 activity and study regulation by other phospholipids, including phosphoinositides.

Authors Graduate Student : Alzheimer's di sease (AD) i s cha racterized b y amyloid plaques, de pressed glucose metabolism, and cognitive decline. Studies in transgenic mouse and rat models of AD have shown that irradiation of the brains of these animals with high doses of x rays ablates a large portion of the amyloid plaques and improves the animal's cognitive function. These doses are too high to be used in patients but arrays of parallel, thin x- ray beams, cal led x-ray mini beams are known to be tissue -sparing in experiments carried out over the last 25 years . We hypothesize that minibeams w ill have similar the rapeutic e ffect without the side effects. Methods : Nine transgenic A D mice had the right half o f their brain ir radiated with x -ray minibeams b eginning 1mm caudal to the eyes. After recovery, these mice unde rwent a 10 minute CT scan followed by a 30 minute static PET s can directly after being injected with 18F fluorodeoxyglucose, a metabolic tracer. The Ma-Benveniste- Mirrione mouse atlas was used for image analysis after each brain region had bee n split into a left and right hemisphere. The aver age voxel concentration within each left and right volume of interest was collected and a percent difference between t hem w as recorded. All statistics w ere pe rformed us ing a two tailed paired T -test. Results : The uptake was larger on the irradiated s ide compared to the contralateral side in mul tiple indi vidual regions, as well as a combined r egion r epresenting t he entir e irradiated a rea (p<0.05). The largest di fferences were found in forebrain septum, and the hippocampus. Conclusions/clinical relevance: These findings a re consistent with m etabolic recovery from AD pathology due to minibeam therapy . Histology studies are unde rway to determine whether plaque and tangle pathology have been reduced, and whether there is an immune response to the therapy, which coul d affect interpretation of the PET signal.

Title: A direct-i ndirect dual-l ayer detector technique for contrast-e nhanced breast X-r ay imaging Authors : Xiaoyu Duan, Hailiang Huang, Wei Zhao . Dept. of Radiology, Stony Brook Medicine Presenting author Xiaoyu Duan. Email: xiaoyu.duan@stonybrook.edu Presenting author' Category: Graduate Student and contrast -enhanced digital breast tomosynthesis (CEDBT), two exposures are taken separately with beam energy below and above the k -edge of iodine to generate dual energy subtracted images and highlight uptake of iodinated contrast agent. This is referred to as the dual shot technique, which switches kVp and filters between exposures. However, patient motion could lead to ar tifact in subtracted imag es, which reduces lesion conspicuity and cannot be completely eliminated, especially for CEDBT which needs longer acquisition time (around 10~30 s) . We propose to use a direct -indirect dual- layer detector to obtain L E and HE images simultaneously for CE breast imaging. Methods: Proposed dual -layer technique uses a 150 m Ag filter to shape the beam into two peaks. A direct a -Se detecto r was designed as the front layer (FL) for low- energy ( LE) image s. A CsI indirect detector was designed as the back layer (BL) for high- energy ( HE) images . Monte Carlo simulations were conducted on a digital breast phantom with iodinated masses for both conventional dual -shot and proposed dual -layer techniques . Experiments were performed on a CIRS phantom with iodinate d masses, using a modified Siemens Mammomat Inspiration prototype system for dual -shot technique and an experimental laboratory setup for dual -layer technique. A workflow to further improve the dual -layer technique was design ed based on the spectral analys is and a denoising deep learning algorithm. Dual -energy ( DE) images of dual -shot, dual -layer, and dual -layer after the improvement workflow were generated using weight ed subtraction. Iodinated mass signal difference to noise ratio squared per mean glandula r dose (SDNR2/Dose) was calculated as the figure of merit (FOM) for lesion detectability. Results: Our results showed that the dual -layer and dual -shot techniques have similar breast tissue background cancellation and detectability for iodinated mass . The improvement workflow reduced the HE photon contamination in FL images and increased i odinated mass FOM for dual -layer technique ( 2.3 times improvement for thickness between 6 to 10 mm, 3.75 times improvement for thickness between 1 to 4 mm. Iodine concentr ation was 2 /). Conclusion: We conducted both Monte Carlo simulations and physical experiments to investigate the feasibility of the proposed direct -indirect dual -layer detector for spectral breast imaging. The iodine object detectability for CEDM in different imaging conditions was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Dual -layer technique showed equivalent iodinated masses detectability with dual -shot, with the benefit of no patient motion between front LE and back HE images.

Title: Loss of the Membrane-B inding Protein ciBAR1 in Mice Leads to Ciliary Defects : Eunice Stony University, Stony Brook, NY 2Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY. Presenting au thor: Eunice Kim, eunice.kim.2@stonybrook.edu Presenting au thor category : Graduate Student Abstract Introduction Cilia \u2014ubi quitous, microtubule -based organelles t hat pr otrude from t he apical cel l surface\u2014pl ay a variety of roles in the body, including mechano- and chemosensation, cell signaling , and fluid dynamics. Ciliary defects can r esult in devastating pleiotropic diseases know n as ciliopathies. The current body of literature suggests that the unique composition and morphology of the ciliary membrane are needed t o maintain ciliary function and homeostasis ; however, the molecular players and mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of the ciliary membrane remain poorly unde rstood. Previous work by our lab and other groups demonstrated that the coiled- coil protein C hibby1 (Cby1) localizes to the ciliary ba se and plays ke y roles in c iliogenesis . Our lab has al so reported that the membrane -bindi ng proteins ciBAR1 and 2 physically interact with Cby1 to promote ciliogenesis. Proteins that contai n BAR domains are know n to dimerize, forming c rescent -shaped s tructures t hat generate and maintain m embrane curvature to f acilitate a pl ethora of cellular processes . To el ucidate the role of ciBAR1 i n mammalian development, we have generated a novel ciBAR1 KO mouse model. Methods Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were from E12.5 wildtype and ciBAR1 embryos. Immunofluorescence staining was number of primary c iliated cells in M EF cultures, a total of >400 cells were counted for each genotype from three independent experiments. P ercentage of ductal cell ar ea over acinar c ell ar ea was found by averaging 15-20 images pe r pancreas (N = 3 f or WT, N = 4 for ciBAR1 K O). T otal pe rcentage of cilia per b asal body was quantified by analyzing 2- 3 ima ges of ducts or islets per pancreas. 50- 100 cilia per category f or each g enotyp e were measured t o assess ci liary l ength . Unpaired t -tests were performed, and data are represented as means \u00b1 SEM. *, P<0.05, **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001; ****, 20% KO mice show embryonic lethality; the remaining 80% survive into adulthood with no gross morphological abnormalities. ciBAR1 KO M EFs showed a lower primary c ilia count . Both wildtype and ciBAR1 KO MEFs show little to no expression of ciBAR2, and Cby1 i s detectable at the ciliary b ase in the absence of ciBAR 1. Lastly, ciBAR1 KO mice show ciliopathic defects in the pancreas, which may be due to dysfunctional primary cilia. Conclusion Taken together, our findings indicate that ciBAR 1 may play a critica l role in ciliogenesis, a t least in certain c iliated cell t ypes, i n mice.

Title: C olorectal cancer-associated mutations impair EphB1 kinase tumor suppressor function Authors : Yunyoung Kim, Sultan Ahmed, and W. Todd Miller (Department of Physiology and Biophysics) Presenting au thor: Yunyoung Kim (yunyoung.kim@stonybrookmedicine.edu) Presenting au thor's cat egory : graduate student Abstract : Eph receptor tyrosine kinases regulate migration and adhesion of cells required for many developmental processes and adult tissue homeostasis. In the intestinal epithelium, Eph signaling controls the positioning of cell types along the crypt -villus axis. In colorectal cancer, Eph activity suppresses tumor progression. The most frequently mutated Eph receptor in metastatic colorectal cancer is EphB1. However, the functional effects of these mutations are mostly unknown. In our study, we expressed and purified the kinase domains of wild-type and mutant forms of EphB1. Using the purified proteins, we show that four colorectal cancer -associated mutations inhibit EphB1 kinase activity. We also show that these mutations reduce the activation of MAPK and STAT3 signaling by mammalian cell expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that mutant EphB1 receptors increase migration and decrease compartmentalization of DLD -1 human colorectal cancer cells. In conclusion, our results support that somatic mutations disrupt the kinase -dependent tumor suppressor function of EphB1 in colorectal cancer.

Title: Differences in the Regulation of Longevity in Two Mating Types of Cryptococcus 1 Microbiology and Immunology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA 2 Stony Brook University , Stony Brook, NY 1179 4, USA 3 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Stony Br ook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA au thor: opportunistic yeast that infects immunocompromised individuals, causing meningoencephalitis. Yeast cells divide asymmetrically, leading to progressive aging and accumulation of age-associated phenotypic variations. Older cells are more resistant to treatment and macrophage -mediated killing during inf ection, leading to persistence. Calorie restriction (CR) is an intervention that has been associated with longevity . It is crucial for C. neoformans because fungal cells grow in low-glucose environments during infection. The effects of CR -mediated stress can differ among strains and have been only studied in MAT strains. C. neoformans cells can replicate sexually and has two distinct mating types, MAT and MATa, which only diffe r in their mating locus. MAT is hypothesized to be more dominant in both clinical infections and the environment due to its ability to respond better to stress. Methods . We sought to compare the effects of CR stress and the regulation of important longevi ty pathways, such as sirtuins and TOR, between MAT and MATa cells by qPCR . The RLS was determined by microdissection. Results . Both MAT and MATa cells show extensions of the RLS in response to CR. The sirtuins are NAD -dependent histone deacetylases that play an important role in promoting longevity. During CR SIR2 , the most well- characterized sirtuin, is upregulated in MAT, in addition to HST2 and HST4, whereas i n MATa cells the expression of the sirtuins is unchanged under CR conditions. The RLS extensi on under CR conditions is dependent on SIR2 in MAT , but not in MATa, which still exhibits extension of RLS in the sir2 strain. Regulation of the TOR pathway , a nutrient -sensing pathway , shows differences in regulation between MAT and MATa. Specifically, in MAT strains , the C. neoformans cells demonstrate no differences in the expression of TOR pathway genes under CR conditions, while in MATa cells the pathway is downregulated. In addition, we found MAT cells show enhanced CR -mediated fluconazole (FLC) tolerance, while MATa cells remain sensitive to treatment. The tolerance in MAT is not dependent on the presence of SIR2 but a result of upregulated ABC transporter function. MAT cells show an increase in ATP levels during CR, which powers the ABC transpor ters to efflux FLC from the intracellular space. In contrast, MATa cells do not overexpress ABC transporters and maintain low ATP levels during CR. Conclusion . Our findings show that MATa and MAT cells show distinct longevity regulation and response to stress. Funding: NIH 1R01AI127704- 01A1 to B.C.F. 8. Title: Diverse Lentiviral Vifs Authors: Adeline M.

Introduction Like all pathogenic viruses, H IV hijacks cellular machinery to facilitate virus replication a nd evade host defenses. To achi eve this, H IV de ploys s everal m ulti-functional accessory proteins to manipulate the cellular environment. One such protei n, Vif, counteracts host APOBEC3 antiviral restricti on facto rs by hijacking a c ellular E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to induce APOBEC3 degradation. In addition, recent work by our lab and others demonstrated that Vif also induces remodeling of the cellular phos phoproteome by antagonizing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) , a major cellular phosphatase responsible for a vast majority of serine/threonine dephosphorylation events in m ost cel l types. H ere, w e investigated t he clinical pr evalence and evolutionary cons ervation of this act ivity among patient -derived Vif isolates and diverse lentiviral s Methods -cell monitor Vif-induced de gradation of cellular t argets i n real time. These experiments a re performed u sing a pa nel o f patient - derived isolates and Vif proteins from diverse lentiviral species. Results We e stablish tha t Vif-mediated PP2A antagonism is pr evalent in clinical isolates a nd diverse lentiviral species. Approximately 30 patient isolates encompassing HIV-1 subt ypes i n global ci rculation were examined f or PP2A antagonism. Roughly half of the isolates tested could efficiently antagonize PP2A in addition to 5 subtype reference isolates derived from global consensus sequences. Additionall y, roughly two-dozen primate and non- primate Vif isolates were examined, and most (~70%) could efficiently antagonize PP2A. The most divergent of these isolates w as from Maedi -Visna virus (MVV) Vif, which is a sheep lentivirus that shares less than 15% identity w ith H IV-1 Vif. Furthe r investigation revealed that MVV Vif antagonizes PP2A through a functionally discrete surface compared t o HIV-1 Vif, which suggests that the binding mode has evolved over time. Conclusion/clinical relevance Our findings suggest that remodeling of the cellular phos phoproteome by Vif proteins is an ancient function that is conserved a cross di verse le ntiviral lineages a nd in c linical isolates. Functional conservation of this a ctivity raises the possibility tha t this function is be neficial for lentiviral re plication or pathogenesis.

T o address the questions whether K17 drives metabolic reprogramming and consequentially leads to chemoresistance , we previously performed unbiased metabolomic analyses and found that K 17 reprograms s of dihydroorotate novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Targeting DHODH by small interfering RNA or by Brequinar w ith G emcitabine synergistically inhi bited the viability of K17- positive PDAC cells. Therefore , we are focusing on understanding the mechanism how K17 may affect DHODH, thus causing metabolic change and chemoresistance. Methods Mitochondria is olation (Thermo S cientific M itochondria Isolation Kit) followed w ith w estern blot was applied to detect DHODH subcellular levels in mitochondria and cytosol fractions in PDAC cell lines. Immunofluorescence was appl ied to detect localization of K17 and DHODH in PDAC cell lines. Results DHODH expression level in whole cell lysates showed no significant change between K17- negative and K17 - positive cells. Based on mitochondria K17 knockout cells, K17. cells and mitochondria marker protein, w hich is the evidence of our further hypothesis that K17 might enter mitochondria and affect DHODH levels and activity. Conclusion We identified a nove l pathway of chemoresistance where K17 impact key enzymes in nucleosides metabolism and drives chemoresistance. Further study of the metaboli c target cou ld lead t o the development of a biomarker- based t herapy for K17-expressing PDAC.

It is essential to assess strategies that may improve access to HTN screening, care and control in non- clinical settings where communities are at elevated risk of HTN frequent. Public libraries are a trusted place among vulnerable populations for accessing health information and resources, yet are an underutilized setting for health interventions. The Stony B rook Medicine Healthy Libraries Program (HeLP) is an interprofessional (IP) team -based service -learning model that aims to improve interprofessional education (IPE) and collaborative practice competencies while providing BP screenings, culturally appropria te health education, assistance with accessing care and social services, and case management at no cost in public libraries throughout Suffolk County, NY. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the BP screening -related interactions between HeLP team memb ers and library patrons. Methods: Fifty -seven students participated in IP teams in 10 public libraries in the 2022 Fall semester. Nursing and Physician Assistant (PA) students provide BP screenings. Social Welfare students assisted patrons with accessing h ealth insurance and care, in addition to social needs. Public health students provided evidence -based health information and evaluated program outcomes. Results: There were a total of 375 patron encounters, 55% (n=201) were a first visit. Clinical students (Nursing/PA) performed 261 BP screenings; 56% (n=133) were considered high according to national guidelines. Of those screened, 6% (n=15) of patrons did not have a primary care provider (PCP) and 10% (n=25) had not visited their PCP in the last year. Soci al work students met with patrons 97 times and assisted with housing (n=41), health insurance (n=19), medical services (n=18), employment (n=17), food insecurity (n=12), and mental health (n=10). Public health students provided health education on CVD/BP (n=4), diabetes (n=4), nutrition (n=1), and medication management (n=1). Conclusions/Clinical relevance: The findings support partnerships with public libraries as a viable setting for both IPE competency attainment and community impact. An IP team offering BP screenings combined with assistance accessing social services and healthcare, in a non -clinical setting such as the public library, may promote HTN and CVD risk factor reduction among at- risk communities.

Title: Replisome Dysfunction Upon Inducible TIMELESS Degradation Synergizes Kim1,3* 1 Department of Pharmacological Sciences, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA 2 The Graduate program in Genetics, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA 3 Stony Brook Cancer C enter, R enais sance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA Presenting Author: Jinal A . Patel (jinal.patel@stonybrook.edu), Graduate Student Improper control of DNA replication is a source of genome instability and tumorigenesis. The structure of DNA replication forks is preserved by TIMELESS (TIM) in the fork protection complex (FPC) to support seamless fork progression. While the scaffolding r ole of the FPC to couple the replisome activity is much appreciated, the detailed mechanism whereby inherent replication fork damage is sensed and counteracted during DNA replication remains largely elusive. Here, we implemented an auxin- based degron system that rapidly triggers inducible proteolysis of TIM as a source of endogenous DNA replication stress and replisome dysfunction to dissect the signaling events that unfold at stalled forks. We demonstrate that acute TIM degradation activates the ATR -CHK1 checkpoint, whose inhibition culminates in replication catastrophe by single -stranded DNA accumulation and RPA exhaustion. Mechanistically, unrestrained replisome uncoupling, excessive origin firing, and aberrant reversed fork processing account for the synergistic fork instability. Simultaneous TIM loss and ATR inactivation triggers DNA -PK-dependent CHK1 activation, which is unexpectedly necessary for promoting fork breakage by MRE11 and catastrophic cell death. We propose that acute replisome dysfunction results in a hyper -dependency on ATR to activate local and global fork stabilization mechanisms to counteract irreversible fork collapse. Our study identifies TIM as a point of replication vulnerability in cancer that can be exploited with ATR inhibitors.

Aberra nt PEC proliferation lea ds to cresce nt or pseudo-cresce nt formati on in the bow man' s space and eventual glomerula r injury. Recent evidence suggests that in the setting of injury po docytes may p hysically interact with neighboring cells by forming cytoplasmic bridges. These \"intercellular bridges\" were previously identified in a variety of cell types including neuronal cells, epithelial cells, and immune cells, and have been established to serve as a direct mechanism of cell -cell communication. H owever, the role of these bridges between podocytes and PECs has not been characterized. The goal of this study is to investigate how podocyte -PEC bridges form, what they do, and whether they are pathological or physiological. The long -term impact of this project is to investigate intercellular bridges as potential therapeutic targets for ameliorating podocyte loss.

Category: ources: National Institutes of (R01 GM144399), American Cancer Society RSG Breast Cancer A lliance. Financial disclosures: None The integrity of DNA replication forks is maintained by the fork protection complex, a member of which, TIMELESS (TIM) couples the DNA unwinding and synthesis processes. While the structural role of TIM as a scaffold to support DNA replication is well appreciated, the mechanism through which TIM coordinates leading - and lagging-strands to promote replication fork progression remains largely elusive. DNA lagging -strand synthesis accompanies the challenge of processing discontinuous Okazaki fragments (OF), whose defect leads to the accumulation of single -stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps, a major source of fork stalling and breakage. Emerging evidence supports the role of polyADP -ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), a DNA repair e nzyme that is critical for the repair of single- strand DNA breaks (SSB), in resolving unligated OF intermediates via activating XRCC1- depedent SSB repair to fill ssDNA gaps. In this study, we demonstrate that TIM stably associates with PARP1 at DNA replica tion forks, whose interaction is critical for PARP1 to engage back-up lagging -strand synthesis and thus suppress replication-associated ssDNA gaps. An engineered human cell line in which TIM is rapidly degraded fails to induce PARP1 activity at replication forks in the event when the canonical OF processing pathway is inhibited, resulting in accumulation of excessive replication- associated ssDNA gaps. By implementing the inducible system to compete the binding interface of PARP1 with TIM, we further showed that the TIM and PARP1 interaction is necessary for the PARP1 activity to resolve OF intermediates and suppress ssDNA gaps. Accordingly, deficiency of TIM impairs the recruitment of XRCC1 in PARP1-dependent manner. Together, our study identifies TIM as a k ey regulator of PARP1-dependent SSB repair machinery to process unligated OF fragments and suppress ssDNA gap formation, thereby preserving the integrity of the replicating genome. We propose that TIM could a synthetic lethal target that can be combined wi th the inhibition of canonical OF processing factors as a means to exacerbate the replication vulnerability of cancer cells. 1The Graduate program in Genetics, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA 2Department of Pharmacological Sciences, State University of New Yor k at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA 3Stony Brook Cancer Center, Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA 14. Title: Cell Cycle Regulation of Invasiveness in Zebrafish Develop mental and Cancer Models Authors: Samantha R. Stettnisch1,2, K. Alexandra Larkin2,3, Benjamin L. Martin2 1Molecular and Cellular Biology Ph.D. Program, Stony Brook University 2Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Stony Brook University 3Medical Scientist Training Program, Stony Brook University School of Medicine Presenting Author: Samantha Stettnisch, Samantha.stettnisch@stony brook.edu Presenting author' Category: Graduate Student Cells must be able to regulate when they will divide, migrate, or adopt a specialized cell identity. These cellular behaviors are important and necessary for organismal development and their execution at inappropriate times can lead to developmental disorders or diseases, such as cancer. To study the regulation of cell behavior we turn to the zebrafish model . In zebrafish, morphogenesis of midline tissue structures such as the notochord drive axis elongation of the developing embryo. The notochord is derived from a progenitor population in the tailbud known as midline progenitor cells (MPCs). MPCs destined to become notochord must undergo a dramatic cell rearrangement and intercalation event called convergent extension (CE). During this process, MPCs use polarized actin protrusions to crawl between one another and intercalate to join the developing notochord. Published data from our lab and others show notochord progenitors are held in G1 arrest prior to CE. We have treated zebrafish embryos with various CDK inhibitors to determine if promoting G1 arrest induc es increased invasiveness of MPCs, and in turn, more cells joining the notochord. Using embryos expressing a fluorescent cell cycle reporter, preliminary data suggests more cells enter the notochord after CDK inhibitor treatment as compared to the control treatment , resulting in a striking bend in the body axis as the fish develops. This developmental model of cell cycle arrest modulating invasive cell behaviors may give us insight into cancer pathogenesis and treatment, a s cancer often co -opts developmental processes to grow and metastasize. To determine w hether pharmacologically induced G1/G0 cell cycle arrest acts as a causative factor in the metastatic capabilities of tumors, a series of experiments were performed using the triple -negative breast cancer cell line MDA -MB-231. These cells were fluorescentl y labeled with cell cycle and cell membrane indicators, to create a distinction between proliferating and quiescent cells. They were injected into the blood vessel of zebrafish that have fluorescently labeled vasculature at 48 hours post fertilization. Cel ls were treated with palbociclib, an FDA -approved, small -molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 that results in G1 cell- cycle arrest; and evaluated for migration to the tail and its capillary beds and subsequent extravasation. The data acquired through the compariso n of invasive behavior in palbociclib treated and non- treated cells suggest the possibility that single drug pharmaceutical solutions to halting proliferation may increase metastatic capabilities.

Title: Temporal and spatial analysis of arterial Biomedical a life -threatening disease that afflicts half a million Americans annually. The central feature of thrombosis is the formation of a fibrin -rich thrombus that blocks flow within the veins and arteries. Our experiment objective is to understand, characterize and target the source of thrombi formation as a comprehensive method for improving the outcomes of thrombosis. Extensive preliminary work indicates fibrin and collagen remodeling within the thrombus formation. We aim to understand this complex remodeling process on a novel rat arterial and venous thrombosis model to represent how a thrombus ages from acute to chronic phases. The thrombus and vessel wall will be removed and analyzed on days 2, 4, and 8. The analysis will be accomplished by immunohistochemical staining for fibrin and thrombotic cellular components. Supercritical CO2 will decellularize the thrombus to study the 3D structure of the fibrin and compare its tensile strength in the periphery and center of the thrombus from the arteries and veins. Structural analysis of whole thrombi and fibrin will be accomplished via SEM, TEM, and rheometric experiments. Th is study could illuminate why some thrombosis results in severe complications for some patient populations while others recover without such sequelae. In time, we can determine those at higher risk of recurrence or uncover new targets for novel therapeutic agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of both arterial and venous thrombosis. 16. Title: Interpreting Bone Morphogenetic Protein Gradients in Vertebrate Development Authors: Courtney Tello & Dr. Benjamin Martin, Genetics Ph.D. Program /Biochemistry and Cellular B iology Department Presenting A uthor: Courtney Tello courtney.tello@stonybrook.edu Graduate Student Animal development consists of complex cell coordination and rearrangement via intercellular communications. It is not well understood how progenitor cells interpret external cell signals that impact cell fate decisions. One critical signaling element in animal development is morphogen signaling. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) acts as a morphogen to pattern the dorsoventral (DV) axis during vertebrate deve lopment, where BMP concentration gradients correlate with different cell identities. It has been recognized that within vertebrate animals, areas of no BMP lead to notochord fate, intermediate BMP levels result in somite fates, and high levels of BMP contribute to ventral mesodermal fates in wildtype conditions. To study how progenitors interpret BMP gradients, I utilize zebrafish development. Using zebrafish embryos, I will manipulate BMP concentration, progenitor cell location, and BMP signal duration within mesodermal progenitors and determine the ir morphogenetic outcome , in terms of their migration and cell fate determination. Along the DV BMP gradient , cells may be positioned in embryonic domains where the microenvironment affects a binary fate switch. To answer my question, I will be using transgenic embryos to conditionally overexpress ectopic BMP signal. Transplanting transgenic cells into wildtype (WT) embryos prior to gastrulation allow s for the of transgenic cell fate decisions within the WT e nvironment. The BMP gradient will be simulated by altering activation conditions of transgenic cells. This is possible due to the transgenes being driven by a heat -shock promot er. Upon heat shock of transplanted WT embryos, the transplanted cells will have varied levels of transgene expression corresponding to their heat -shock temperature. I will visualize the change of cell fates along the BMP gradient using spinning disk confocal microscopy. Cell fates will be genetically assessed using in situ hybridization with fate- specific fluorescent probes. My preliminary data suggest s BMP signal ing is carefully coordinated so that homeobox domain transcription factors induce cell migration target genes and helix-loop- helix transcription factor s target genes are involved in progenitor fate acquisition. Transplanted embryos heat -shocked at 36C show very little cell fate change, whereas embryos heat -shocked at 40C show significant shift in cell identities as compared to wildtype cell s. Further expe rimentation is required with more temperature conditions to simulate the dynamics of the BMP gradient. These results have a significant positive impact by providing us with a better understanding of how the vertebrate body plan is established in early development and advancing the understanding of developmental pathways that could be utilized for disease treatments or regenerative medicine.

Title: HIV-1 Vif inhibits the DNA damage repair kinase ATM to block activation of host antiviral d efenses Authors : Hoi Tong Wong1, Daniel S alamango1 1Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY USA Presenting au thor: Hoi Tong Wong (hoitong.wong@stonybrook.edu) Presenting au thor's cat egory : Graduate student Introduction Like all viruses, HIV -1 hijacks cellular ma chinery to f acilitate r eplication and evade host antiviral de fenses . Emerging evidence indicates that manipulation of cellular D NA damage repair ( DDR) pathways is critical for multiple f acets of HIV-1 replication, including viral genome integration, post- integration repair, mini mizing dead- end reverse -transcription intermediates and evasion of innate immune sensing . Ataxia -telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a major DDR ki nase that eng ages di verse antiviral de fense mechanisms i n response to abnor mal activation of DDR signaling . ATM induces an antiviral state b y activating pro- inflammatory N F-kB signaling in addition to activating several members of the TRIM family of antivira l restriction factors . ATM a ctivity and subsequent DDR responses are regulated at multiple levels by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) , a major cellular phosphatase complex that was recently shown to be antagonized by the HIV accessory protein Vif; however, the functional consequence s of this a ctivity have yet to be established experimentally . Here, we demonstrate that V if- mediated antagonism of PP2A leads to inactivat ion of ATM and blocks activation of antiviral defense mechanisms in response to abnormal DDR activation. Methods We utilize a combination of biochemical, pharmacologic, and fluorescence microscopy approaches to a ssess activation of DNA r epair mechanisms and pro- inflammatory signaling pathways following HIV-1 infection. Infections were carried o ut using HIV-1 expressing wild- type Vif or a mutant deficient for PP2A antagonism. Studies were performed i n a variet y of cell types, including physiologically relevant myeloid and lymphoid models. Results We de monstrate tha t expression of wild-type Vif, but not a Vif mutant defective for PP2A antagonism, le d to inhibition of DNA repair and induction of DNA s trand breaks in a variety o f cell types . Additionally, investigation of a large panel of diverse Vif -derived pa tient isolates r evealed that this a ctivity is pr evalent clinically. Furthermore, a p eptide inhibitor that specifically blocks PP2A activity also inhibited DNA repair, further confirming Vif-mediated ef fects . Subsequent investigation revealed tha t Vif ina ctivates A TM, which blocks activation of subsequent proinflammatory s ignaling pathways as well as act ivation of antiviral T RIM f actors. Conc lusion/clinical relevance We determined V if inactivates ATM t o inhibit the activation of DNA repair pathways, proinflammatory signaling responses, and TRIM antivira l restriction factors. Further investigation is warranted to determine the impact of this activity on HIV replication and pathogenesis.

Title: A scatter correction framework for contrast-e nhanced digital breast tomosynthesis Authors: Xiangyi W u, Xiaoyu D uan, Hailiang H uang, W ei Zhao Dept. of Radiology, Stony Brook Medicine Presenting A uthor: Xiangyi Wu, xiangyi.wu@stonybrook.edu, Graduate Student Abstract Introduction: -enhanced digital breast tomosynthesis (CEDBT) utilizes iodinated contrast media to highlight breast tumors with neo-angiogenesis. Conventional dual -shot (DS) CEDBT suffers from artifacts caused by patient motion between two separate exposures. A novel CEDBT system with a direct - indirect dual-layer (DL) detector was proposed recently. It acquires low - and high- energy (LE and HE) images simultaneously with a single exposure, which minimizes patient motion. However, image quality for both DS and DL CEDBT is degraded by scatter radiation, which causes cupping artifact and reduces lesion contrast. We developed a scatter correction framework for CEDBT and evaluated its performance with both Monte Carlo simulations and patient images. Methods: The proposed scatter correction framework combined convolution- based and interpolation- based methods. For each projection image, iterative convolutions between the image and pre-calculated scatter -to- primary ratio (SPR) kernels were used to provide an accurate estimate of scatter distribution in the central breast region. In the peripheral breast region, the breast thickness roll -off causes lower scatter radiation than the central breast region and thus two SPR kernels were applied w ithin t he two r egions, respectively. Scatter radiation in the background (non- breast) region was experimentally measured and incorporated into the interpolation step to improve scatter estimation. The proposed framework can be applied to both DL and DS techniques. For evaluation, this scatter correction framework was performed on simulated DL CEDBT images of 6 digital anthropomorphic breast phantoms. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was calculated between the estimated scatter distributions and the ground truths. We evaluated the performance of the method to correct scatter in patient images acquired from a DS CEDBT prototype system, which is modi fied from the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration DBT system. Scatter correction was conducted for images of a patient with biopsy- proven invasive ductal carcinoma. Signal difference to noise ratio (SDNR) of the iodinated lesion was calculated as the figure of merit for lesion detectability and compared between images before and after scatter correction. Results: Our simulation results showed that the MAPE was consistently less than 5% from the ground truth over all 6 phantoms and outperformed the single -kernel convolution method. The patient images acquired from DS CEDBT showed less cupping artifact and higher lesion SDNR (19.3%) after performing scatter correction. Conclusions: A framework was developed to perform scatter correction for CEDBT. The proposed scatter correction method showed better scatter removal and improved lesion detectability compared to the single - kernel method.

Title: Reducing acetylcholine signaling in the dorsal striatum prevents the onset of OCD-like phenotypes in the SAPAP3 -cKI mouse model Authors : Felicia Lu-Tang Yang, Zach ary B. Hobel, Kimberly Jimenez, Jeff rey M. Malgady, Joshua L. Plotkin Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook NY Presenting author: Felicia Lu-Tang Yang/ lu-tang.yang@stonybrook.edu Presenting the abstract: Obsessive -compuls ive disorder (OCD) is characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts and repetitive actions, and affects about 2% of the world population. Dysfunction of the striatum has been strongly linked to OCD. The striatum is the input nucleus of the basal ganglia a nd plays a central role in action selection and motor learning. Among different striatal cell types, cholinergic interneurons (CINs) account for 1- 2% of the total cell population. Despite the subtle proportion, they ramify extensively and send projections widely throughout the striatum, creating an essential role in regulating striatal output. Post- mortem studies have reported cholinergic dysfunction in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric movement disorders, such as Tourette syndrome and Parkinson's disease. Our lab has also shown that striatal CIN density and evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release is increased in the SAPAP3 knockout mouse model of OCD. However, whether cholinergic dysfunction plays a causal role in compulsive behavior is unknown. We hypothesized that pathologically increased striatal cholinergic transmission contributes to the development of OCD -like behaviors in SAPAP3 KO mice. In this study, we reduced dorsal striatal ACh release in pre -symptomatic SAPAP3 KO mice by knocking down of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene, which is necessary for storage and release of acetylcholine. Lentivirus particles encoding shRNA to VAChT or control shRNA were stereotaxically injected into the dorsal striatum. After the recovery, mice were monitored daily for their compulsive, anxiety - like, and motor -related behaviors for one month, after which electrically evoked ACh release was measured to confirm the knockdown of VAChT. We found that after VAChT -knockdown, SAPAP3 KO mice did not develop compulsive behaviors, while their control -injected counterparts developed severe over -grooming and self-inflicted skin lesions at the expected rate. Taken together, these findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for ACh modulation in the treatment of compulsive behaviors.

It is still unclear w hether t he white matter diffusivity changes topographically coincide with c ortical hypometabolism in M TLE. In thi s study, w e investigated the changes in glucose uptake, white ma tter tracts, and their differences in brain networks of MR-hippocampal s clerosis ( HS) versus MR -negative MTLE ing simultaneous PET/MR. Methods Fifty -four drug- refractory unilateral M TLE p atients (age 18; without other lesions) were scanned on a hybrid PET/MR s canner with 18F -FDG. During the PET RI sequences i ncluding T1-weighted MPRAGE and DTI were Other clinical r ecords , such as MR-HS/negative status and presurgical diagnosis , were collected. Brain region parcellation was performed on the MPRAGE images using Freesurfer (v7.0). The standardized uptake value ratio ( SUVR) nor malized t o the cerebellar gray m atter was obtained. Correlational t ractography analysis w as condu cted w ith D SI-studio. A multiple regression model was used to remove the effects of sex, age, disease laterality, and encoding direction. A n FDR threshold of 0.05 was used. The SUVR discordance of bilateral brain regions was obtained as SUVR_diff = SUVR_ipsi - SUVR_contra. Metabolic connectivity matrices of the regional 18F-FDG SUVRs w ere generated b y calculating pair-wise Pearson correlation between two ROIs across subjects. Results Patient demographics ar e summarized i n Table 1. Mesial temporal structures, such as hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampus, and middle temporal cortex, were found to have a significantly larger SUVR_diff in the MR-HS group compared to the MR-negative group (P<0.001). Notably, the thalamus was also affected (P = 0.00758) . Table 2 shows the results of all the ROIs. Figure 1 de monstrates th e tracts w ith hi gher mean diffusivity (MD) or lowe r fractiona l anisotropy (FA) in the MR-HS group. Noteworthily, the fornix of the brain showed reduced FA and increased M D; this could reflect subtle microstructural damages due to recurrent seizures. Furthermore, the inter-subject metabolic connectivity matrices (Figure 2) demonstrate a los s of structure in the MR-HS group. The root -mean- square errors were contralateral conne ctivity m atrices of the MR -HS group when compared to the ipsilateral matrix of the MR-negative group, indicating the ipsilateral brain of the MR-HS group is more affected. Conclusions This s tudy ide ntified e xtensive network d amage in MR -HS pa tients a mong patients with unilateral MTLE.

MEDICAL STUDENTS1.Title: Degree of Progressive Dilation of the External Iliac Artery After Endovascular Stent Avelar, Medical Student Sintia.escobaravelar@stonybrookmedicne.edu Over 200,000 people are diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms in the U.S. every year. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive procedure that has become the standard of care due to lower perioperative morbidity and mortality rates when compared to abdominal aortic aneurysm open repair. Currently, the EVAR distal seal zones are the common iliac arteries (CIA). These arteries, however, present complications due to their risk for degeneration caused by progression of aneurysmal disease and the presence of stenotic and tortuous iliac vessels. In this study, we seek to establish whether the external iliac artery (EIA) would be a viable option to patients with compromised CIAs by evaluating the degree of progressive dilation of both stented and non-stented CIAs in comparison to EIAs. 28 patients that underwent EVAR with limb extensions into the EIA, either with primary or subsequent intervention, and 20 patients with a bifurcated EVAR and a distal seal in the CIA with no re -intervention were selected using CPT codes. In the group that had undergone EVAR with limb extensions, EIAs were measured pre - and post- operatively, using centerline reconstruction software of corresponding CT scans at three different distances: 1 cm from the iliac bifurcation, towards the end of the stent, and 2 cm past the stent, with corresponding distances measured in the non- stented preoperative or contralateral artery. In the group with a bifurcated EVAR, pre - and post -operative measurements were acquired using centerline reconstruction software of corresponding CT scans. The measurements were acquired at four distances: CIAs at end the of the stent, EIAs the iliac bifurcation, mid corresponding distances in the non- stented preoperative artery. The average diameter of the CIA and EIA were recorded, as well as the interval pathologic growth betw een the studies. With a p<0.001, there was a significant difference found in the change in diameter over time between the CIA to the EIA between the two groups. The study found that both stented and non- stented EIAs demonstrated less progressive dilation r elative to CIAs. Further research would help determine if EIAs are more suitable for patients with compromised CIAs. 2. Title: Noninvasive Measures of Diminished Liver Function Predict Short-T erm Postoperative Complications following Open Reduction Internal Fix ation of Distal Radius Fracture Authors : Jane H E. Komatsu2, PhD; Edward D. Wang2, MD 1 Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA 2 Department of Orthopaedics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA Presenting Author : Jane Burgan, Medical Stu dent, Email : jane.burgan@stonybrookmedicine.edu Introduction : The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between liver function and postoperative complications in patients with distal radius fractures (DRF) within 30 days of open reduction and internal f ixation (ORIF) us ing preoperative aspartat index (APRI) as a noninvasive measure of liver function. Methods : The American College of Surgeons N ational Surgical Improvement Program database was qu eried for all patients who underwent ORIF for DRF between 2015-2021. The study popul ation was divided into two groups based on preoperative APRI: normal liver functi on (APRI 0.5) liver func tion (APRI > 0.5). Postoperative complications within 30 days of ORIF were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between preoperative APRI and postoperative complications. Results : A total of 7,344 patients unde rgoing ORIF for DRF between 2015 to 2021 were included in this study. 6,541 (89.7%) patients had normal APRI and 754 (10.3%) patients had abnormal APRI. In comparison to the normal liver function group, pa tients with abnormal liver function w ere significantly associated with the patient factors: male s ex, diabetes me llitus, b leeding disorders, American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA) classificati on 3, and higher body (p -values of <0.001, 0.026, 0.048, 0.009, and 0.011, respectively). T he abnormal APRI group was found to be significantly associated with major complications, overall complications, septic shock, bleeding transfusions, readmission, and nonhome and respectively). controlling for significant patient demographics and comorbidity factors, multivariate analysis identified the abnormal APRI group to be significantly associated with septic shock, bleeding transfusions, and nonhome discharge (odds ratios, p value (95% confidence Conclusion : Abnormal liver function is significantly associate d with 30-day postoperative complications following ORIF DRF. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between noninvasive estimated liver function using APRI and postoperative outcomes following DRF ORIF. APRI is a quick, noninvasive alternative to estimate patients' liver status compared to the gold standard of liver biopsy. Therefore, this study contributes to the growing research on the relationship between liver disease and orthopedic surgeries, and suggests the utility of APRI to predict surgical outcomes in DRF patients who undergo ORIF.

Liu1 BS, David E. Komatsu2 PhD, Edward D. Wang2 MD. 1Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA 2Department of Orthopaedics, Stony Brook University, Diabetes Mellitus as a Risk Factor for Postoperative Complications Following Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair Introduction: The number of adults with diabetes mellitus in the United States is expected to increase significantly over the next few decades . Along with altered metabolic function, those with diabetes frequently experience upper limb musculoskeletal pathologies, and are more likely to undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair than non- diabetics. Previous studies have shown that patients with diabetes who undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair have an increased risk of postoperative complications when compared to non- diabetics. To further investigate these complications, we used a large national database to determine the 30 -day postoperative complications of insulin- dependent and non -insulin -dependent diabetics compared to non- diabetics. We hypothesized that both NIDDM and IDDM were independent risk factors for postoperative complications. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS -NSQIP) database was queried for all patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (aRCR) between 2015 and 2020. The study population was categorized into cohorts based on diabetes mellitus status: non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM), insulin- dependent (IDDM), and no diabetes. Bivariate analysis was used to compare patient demographics and comorbidities among the cohorts. Multivariate analysis, adjusted for confounding demographics and comorbidities, was used to determine independently associated 30- day postoperative complications. Results: There were 39,877 cases of aRCR in NQSIP included in this study. Diabetics comprised 6,575 (16.7%) of these cases, with 1,817 both NIDDM and IDDM cohorts to be significantl y associated with higher BMI, ASA class 3, hypertension, COPD, bleeding disorders, and preoperative wounds or infection (p < 0.001) . NIDDM was significant associated with sepsis (OR 2.77, p = 0.047, CI: 1.01-7.58) , and 0.11-0.99), and on a ventilator > 48 hours (OR 5.27, p = 0.029, CI: 1.18-23.41). Conclusion: Overall, we found that NIDDM is an independent risk factor for sepsis, while IDDM is an independent risk factor for pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and remaining on a ventilator for greater than 48 hours following aRCR. These findings encourage that use of precautionary measures to help limit adver se cardiopulmonary events in diabetics prior to aRCR. F unding source(s) : None. 4. Title: Liver Dysfunction as Pr edicted by Noninvasive Measures Predicts Short-T erm Adverse Outcomes Following Total Shoulder Arthroplasty Authors : Patricia Cerri -Droz1 BS, Steven H. Liu1 BS, Kenny Ling1 BS, R achel A . Loyst1 BS, David E. Komatsu2 PhD, Edward D . Wang2 MD. 1Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA 2Department of Orthopaedics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, of t otal shoulder arthroplasty has exponentially increased over the past two decades, serving as an effective solution to r estoring function and minimizing the pain that results from s houlder pathology, including proximal humerus fractures, osteoarthritis, and rotator cuff injuries. Much of the observed growth has concentrated within the older patient population, which experiences a greater rate of chronic comorbidities and consequent surgical complications. Liver d amage is an expanding comorbidity that has the potential to be determined through non- invas ive techniques, such as the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) -to- platelet ratio index (APRI), a value calculated from AST and platelet count. As liver damage has been previously associated with a greater number of postoperative complications in previous orthopedic studies, the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between predicted liver disease, with the calculation of ARPI, and postoperative complications following TSA. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to c ollect data on 14 ,547 TSA operations that occurred between the years 2015-2021. These data were t hen divided into two cohorts of abnormal ( APRI > 0.5) and normal (APRI 0.5) based on calculated ARPI values . Patient demographics and comorbidities were then compared among cohorts through bivariate logistic regression. 30-day postoperative complication data were collected and multivariate analysis , controlling for significant patient demographics and comorbidity factors , was performed to determine complications independently associated with abnormal APRI . Results: Abnormal ARPI scores were significantly associated with the male sex (p<0.001), greater BMI (p=0.001) , older age (p<0.001) , and higher American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification status (p<0.001). In general, the overall complication rate was greater in the abnormal ARPI group (11.2%) when compared to the normal group (6.4%). Similarly , the rate minor complications (3.2% discharge (9.0% vs 13.0%) w ere greater in the abnormal ARPI cohort . Increased ARPI score was an independent risk factor for greater overall rate of complications (p<0.001), minor complications (p<0.001), pneumonia (p<0.001), bleeding transfusions (p<0.001), remaining on a ventilator after 48 hours (p<0.001) , and non -home discharge following TSA (p<0.001). In general, those with abnormal ARPI faced a higher rate of and were independently associated with more complications than the normal ARPI group. These results encourage the assessment of liver damage during preoperative risk stratification t hrough accessible values such as ARP I, to limit negative postoperative outcomes following TSA.

Title: Antenatal Anxiety as a Predictor for Postpartum Depression Authors: Christy Chan BS, Brynn Franz BS, Mahesh Tiwari BS, Joseph Chappelle MD Presenting Author: Christy Chan Presenting Author Category: Medical Student Abstract: Introduction Postpartum depression affects 30- 37% of new mothers in the United States. Psychiatric illness is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and maternal distress in the postpartum period is associated with long -term developmental and behavioral e ffects in infants. Our objective was to evaluate the correlation between the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -Item Scale (GAD -7) taken in the 1st trimester and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Methods We conducted a prospective observational study of pregnant women. Women were enrolled between 11- 14 weeks and completed the GAD -7 questionnaire in addition to their routine prenatal care. Women who experienced pregnancy loss or were lost to follow -up were excluded. A EPDS score of 10 in the pos tpartum period was considered to be a positive screen. Chi -square, t -tests, and non- parametric tests, and logistic regression were used where appropriate. Results 100 women were enrolled in the study, with 94 being included in the final analysis. The ave rage EPDS and GAD- 7 scores in the first trimester were 4.4\u00b14.5 and 4.5\u00b14.3. Thirteen women (13.4%) had a positive postpartum EPDS. The 1st trimester EPDS and GAD -7 were both significantly correlated with a postpartum EPDS (p=0.006 and < 0.001). An optimal cut- off of 5 was found for both tools using logistic regression and ROC curves. Logistic regression with these cut -offs found that the GAD -7 had an odds ratio of 18.4 (95%CI 3.2- 107.2), and the 1st trimester EPDS was found to be non- significant. U sing a GAD- 7 cut -off of 5 had a NPV of 97% and a PPV of 40.4%. No other patient data was found to be significantly associated with a positive postpartum screen. Conclusion Peripartum mood disorders are a major cause of maternal morbidity, and our work has shown that the GAD -7 may be useful as a screening tool. Future studies will determine whether interventions designed for these women can decrease their risk of postpartum depression Funding Source: N/A IRB: IRB2019-00205 6. Title: Why the Capacity Consult? The Perspective of Medicine Hospitalists on their Reasons for Consulting Psych iatry to Determine Patient Medical Decision-M aking Capacity Authors : Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 2Stony Brook University Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stony Brook, NY 3Stony Brook University Department of Hospital Medicine, Stony Brook, NY 4Division on Substance Use Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute and Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY P resenting Author: Mansi M Chandra, mansi.chandra@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author Category: Medical Student Abstract: B ackground: Research points to the high utilization and varying clinical impact of routine psychiatric consultation to determine medical decision -making capacity (DMC). The underlying drivers for this demand have not been well characterized. We surveyed general medicine hospitalists to understand their most common reasons for requesting DMC assessments. Met hods : Twenty -six hospitalists at a tertiary -care academic hospital completed a 7 -item survey, using a 5 -point Likert scale rating their reasons for requesting DMC consults (1- least common to 5 -most common). Rating score frequencies, means, standard deviations, medians, and associations were analyzed. R esults : The two most common reasons for requesting psychiatric consultation for DMC determinations, an Underlying Psychiatric/Neurocognitive Diagnosis Management (m=3.92, SD 0.93, Mdn= 4) and Requested by Social Work (m=3.92, S D=0.93, Mdn=4) were also correlated and endorsed as 4 by more than 75% of respondents (i.e. 5= most common; r=0.48, p<0.05). Over 60% of respondents rated Protect Myself Legally (m=3.50, SD=1.14, Mdn=4) 4, which (r=0.49, p <0.05). C onclusions: This study points to several important drivers of routine psychiatry consultations for DMC assessments, including requests by social workers and risk managers and legal defensiveness. Our findings have implications for further research, education and procedures that empower staff to resolve routine DMC questions and focus utilization of limited psychiatry resources towards higher complexity and risk cases.

Title: Diversity of Patient Population Represented on United States Plastic Surgeon's Webpages Authors: Nicole DePaola, 1.R 2. Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Stony Brook University Hospital Presenting author's category: Medical Student I ntroduction: Representation of individuals from diverse backgrounds in healthcare media is critical for healthcare accessibility, inclusivity , and equity. In plastic surgery, where many procedures are elective, it is important to communicate values of patient -centered care. Previous literature has demonstrated a lack of racial diversity on academic plastic surgery center webpages, advertisements for nonsurgical cosmetic products, and plastic surgery social media. However, no study has yet examined the racial diversity of webpage content from a patient search perspective. This study seeks to characterize the patient experience of self -representation in the media when seeking care from a plastic surgeon. The objective is to determine if there is a racial discrepancy in the media appearance of implied patients depicted on United States plastic surgeon's webpages from a patient search perspective. M ethods: A Google search for plastic surgeons in each of the 50 United States was completed. Their webpages were analyzed on the basis of patient diversity in media presented on the homepage. The words, \"( state) plastic surgeon,\" were searched. The first 10 relevant websites were collected. The patients and implied patients on the homepages were counted and classified into one of 6 skin colors, designated I to VI. These somewhat correlate to Fitzpatrick skin phototype, but the Fitzpatrick Scale is a measure of the skin's response to UV exposure, rather than skin color. Percentages of people in each skin tone classification were tabulated and classified as white (I - III) or nonwhite (IV-VI).This data was then compared to the 2020 ASPS demographics report and the 2020 U.S. Census. R esults: 4010 individuals were derived from 496 webpages. 91.89% were classified as \"white\" and 8.11% \"nonwhite .\" Across the 50 states, 264 individuals fell into category I, 826 into category II, 2586 into category III, 260 into category IV, 69 into category V, and 5 into category VI. Chi -square analyses determined that there wa s a statistically significant difference between the racial diversity of our sample of patient -appearing people compared to that of the 2020 US Census (p= <0.001), 2020 ASPS Cosmetic Summary Data Reconstructive Summary Data (p= <0.001). Conclusions: This stu dy highlights the significant difference in media depictions on plastic surgeon webpages and the demographics of patients they are serving. Based on this data, further analyses are needed to identify the influence of these representational disparities and unequal representation on patient care and clinical outcomes.

Title: Chronic Steroid Use as a Risk Factor for Postoperative Complications Following Arthroscopic Edward D. Wang2, MD 1 Renaissance S chool of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA 2 Department of Orthopaedics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA Presenting A Richelle F assler, Medical Student Email: richelle.fassler@stonybrookmedicine.edu ABSTRACT Background: Steroids are a common treatment for many rheumatologic and inflammatory disorders. Chronic steroid use has been studied in joint arthroplasty and arthroscopy, but studies specifically on preoperative chronic steroid use in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (aRCR) are limited. The purpose of this study is to determine association between chronic steroid use and 30-day postoperative outcomes following aRCR. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQ IP) w as queried to identify all patients who underwent aRCR between 2015 and 2020. Patients were divided into two cohorts, non-steroid users and chronic steroid users. Univariate binomial regression analysis was used to compare demographics, comorbidities, and postoperative outcomes betwee n cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for all significant demographics and comorbidities, was used to identify significant 30-day postoperative outcomes. Results : A total of 39,876 patients remained after exclusion criteria, with 39,068 (97.97%) in the non-steroid group and 808 (2.02%) in the chronic steroid group. Patient demographics a nd comorbidities s ignificantly associate d with chronic steroi d use were age 65 (p < 0.001) , female gender ( p < 0.001), B MI 35, ASA 3 (p < 0.001), dependent functional status ( p < 0.001), non- smokers (p = 0.046), of (p < 0.001) wound infecti on (p = loss ( p ( p = 0.013). Multivariate analysis found preoperative chronic steroid use to be an independent predictor of mortality within 30 days following aRCR (OR 8.15, CI 1.45-45.86; p = 0.017) . Conclusion: Preoperative chronic steroid use is independently associate d with higher rates of 30-day mor tality following aRCR. Chronic steroid us e was also significantly associated with UTI and nonhom e discharge following aRCR. As the utilization of aRCR c ontinues to r ise, it is impor tant to unde rstand these potential risk factors to mini mize a dverse outcomes. This know ledge can guide physicians in preoperative management and patient education to properly manage their chronic illnesses and avoid adverse outcomes.

Title: Disparities in Postoperative Outcomes Between Black and White Patients Following Total Shoulder Arthroplasty Authors : Richelle Fassler1, PhD; Edward D. Wang2, MD 1 Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA 2 Department of Orthopaedics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA Presenting Author : Richelle Fassler, Medical Student Email : Richelle.fassler@stonybrookmedicine. edu Intro : Despite the rise in surgical volume for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) procedures, racial disparities exist in outcomes between White and Black populations. Prior studies have demonstrated racial disparities in orthopedic surgery, but there are limited studies on racial disparities in outcomes following TSA. The purpose of this study was to compare 30- day postoperative complication rates between Black and White patients following TSA. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all patients who underwent TSA between 2015 and 2020. The study population was divided into two groups based on race: Black or African American and White. Patient demographics and comorbidities were compared between cohorts using bivariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for all significantly associated patient demographics and comorbidities, was used to identify associations between Black or African American race and postoperative complications. Results: A total of 23,499 patients were included in this study. There were 22,229 (94.6%) patients in the White cohort and 1,270 (5.4%) patients in the Black or African American cohort. Demographics and comorbidities that were significantly associated with Black or African American race were age 40 -64 (p < 0.001), BMI 40 (p < 0.001), female gender (p < 0.001), ASA classification 3 (p < 0.001), smoking status (p < 0.001), non-insulin and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), hypertension requiring medication (p < 0.001), disseminated cancer (p = 0.023), and operative duration 129 minutes (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified Black or African American race to be independently associated with higher r ates of readmission (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09-1.91; p = 0.001). Conclusion: Black or African American race was independently associated with higher rates of 30 -day readmission following TSA. Given the growth of TSA surgical volume, it is important to investig ate racial disparities in TSA outcomes to help reduce these disparities and guide future interventions.

Tantone, MD, David E. Komatsu, PhD, Lawrence C. Hurst, MD ; Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation , Stony Brook University Presenting author : Sandhya Ganesan (Sandhya.Ganesan@stonybrookmedicine.edu) Presenting author' Category: Medical Student Main the abstract: Introduction: Dupuytren's disease (DD), a fibroproliferative disorder of the hand, has been ass ociated with various medical conditions including diabetes mellitus (DM). The association between DD and DM has been widely reported, but the prevalence of DM within DD patients varies widely from 2 -63% in the literature . A major reason for this wide range is the small sample size s of most studies . In order to more accurately ascertain the true prevalence of DD and its association with DM, we conducted a study using data from a TriNetX database cohort of 88,661,090 patients that included 100,218 patients with DD and 6,019,023 patients with DM. Methods : This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with DD and DM. Patient cohorts were created based on the following diagnoses: DD, DM, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The overall risk difference of having a DD diagnosis and prevalence of DD during the years 2010 -2020 w ere analyzed and compared across the DM, T1DM, and T2DM cohorts. Patients with DM were further stratified into groups according to HbA1c values: prediabetes (HbA1c <6.5%), diabetes prescribed anti -diabetic agents: insulin or metformin. The risk of having a DD diagnosis associated with each group was compared to one another using risk differences and ratios. Results : The overall prevalence of DD , T1DM , and T2DM in this cohort was 100,218, 178,168, and 5,537,511, respectively . The prevalence of DD in patients with T2DM was greater than the prevalence in patients with T1DM. Patients with T2DM carried a higher risk of DD patients with T1DM (RR: 1.641; 95% CI: [1.356, 1.986]). Diabetic patients taking insulin carried a lower risk of DD compared to diabetic patients taking metformin HbA1c levels within the diabetic range carried a risk of 0.463%, whereas patients with HbA1c levels within the prediabetic or uncontrolled diabetes range carried lower risks of 0.392% and 0.416%, respectively. Conclusions/clinical relevance: This study further specified the relationship between DM and DD. Specifically, patients with T2DM, diabetic patients who take metformin, and diabetic patients with HbA1c levels between 6.5 - 7.5% carry the highest risk for DD. These findings may be explained by the increased accumulation of advanced glycosylated end products (AGE's ) in patients with diabetes. Future studies investigating the relationship between AGE accumulation and the development of DD may elucidate the connection between DD and DM.

Title: Impact of COVID-19 on Rates of Burnout and Choice of Specialty Among Medical Students at Each Year of Training Authors: Hren, G., Mockler, G. M.D., Reykhart, O. M.D., Lopez, O., Hou, W. Presenting Author: M. Grace Hren. Mary.hren@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting Author category: Third year Medical Student Abstract: Burnout is at the forefront of discussions regarding physician wellness. Burnout is defined as a three - pronged issue, with emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and lack of accomplishments comprising each of the prongs. Burnout has reached levels of significant concern in the medical field, due to the COVID -19 pandemic. We investigated the effects that the COVID -19 pandemic has had on medical students, specifically , by using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and administering it to medical students at each year of study at Stony Brook RSOM . Additionally, we added a brief series of open -ended questions at the end of the survey to assess changes in choice of residency specialty in the setting of COVID -19. Finally, open -ended questions were used to determine if students engage in any activities to help mediate burnout . This cross -sectional study was conduc ted as an electronic, survey/questionnaire that was distributed to students in each phase of medical training. M1 to M4 students at SB RSOM were surveyed within a six- month period of each other . The survey used was the MBI , a licensed and validated study to measure rates of burnout. The MBI asks students to use a Likert scale from 0-6, to rank how frequently they feel emotionally exhausted, depersonalized, and a lack of personal achievement based on a series of questions. At the end of the survey were questions regarding the impacts of COVID -19 and choice of medical specialty. The response rate was 42%. The mean scores of each category across classes was determined . The mean of emotional exhaustion was 3.1-3.56, depersonalization was 1.98- 2.27, and personal achievement was 3.88 -4.36. For the open-ended questions, a common theme students reported was that COVID - 19 affected their learning due to limited in person anatomy time and decreased ability to practice their physical exam schools. They stated they mitig ated burnout by cooking/baking, spending time with family and friends, and exercising. They stated their choice in specialty has not changed regarding the COVID19 pandemic. In conclusion, medical students at Stony Brook: feel emotionally exhausted a few times per month, have feelings of depersonalization once a month, and feel personal achievement once a week. We can say that students have employed coping skills - such as exercise, and time with family/friends, to mitigate burnout. Students also have negatively felt the impact of COVID -19 on their studies. This data can be used to inform decisions made on a systematic level regarding medical student wellness and steps to mitigate burnout.

T he incidence of DRF is in creasing eac h year, with a dis proportionate increase in patients 65 years and older, likely due to greater l ife expectancy a nd increased activity. T he most co mmon mechanism of DRF is a fall on the outstretched hand. Dehydration is a risk factor that has been associated with falls, particularly in the elderly population. Dehydration has been identified as a risk factor for complications in other orthopedic surgery. However, dehydration prior to DRF surgery has not been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this s tudy was t o investigate dehydration as a risk factor for complications following ORIF of DRF. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS -NSQIP) database w as qu eried f or all pat ients w ho underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of DRF between 2015 and 2020. Patient demographics and comorbidities were compared between cohorts using bivariate analysis. Multivariate log istic r egression, adjusted f or all significantly a s sociated pa tient demographic s and comorbidities, was used to identify associations preoperative dehydration status and postoperative complications. Results : 10,864 patients were included in the ana lysis, of which 6,751 (62.1%) patients were in the non- dehydrate d cohort, 2,307 (21.2%) patients were in the mildly dehydrated cohort, and 1,806 (16.6%) were in the severely dehydrate d cohort. Compared to the non-de hydrated cohort , patients with mild dehydration had s ignificantly higher rates of pulmonary embolism (p = 0.030) and non-home discharge (p = 0.002) . Compared to the non-dehydrated cohort, patients with severe dehydration had significantly higher rates of readmission (p = 0.019), non-home discharge (p < 0.001) , and mortality (p < 0.001) . After controlling for significant patient variables, mild dehydration was independently associated with higher rates of pulmonary embolism (OR 4.43, 95% CI 1.03- 19.03; p = 0.045) . Severe deh ydration was independently associated with higher ra tes of readmission (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.00- 2.03; p 1.76; p = 0.008), and 17.55; p = 0.002 ). Conclusion: Mild de hydration is a clinically s ignificant risk f a ctor for pul monary embolism following OR IF o f DRF. S evere dehydration i s a cli nically significantly risk factor for re admission, non-home discharge , and mortality f ollowing O RIF of DRF. T reatment of d e hydration durin g the preoperative period may help to mini mize adverse outcomes. Funding Sou rces: not applicable Financial disclosur e: none 13. Title: Does having a home urology program affect match Urology , Stony Br ook University Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook, New York. 2Office of Undergraduate Medical Education, Stony Brook University Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook, New York. Presenting A uthors: Hyun W oo Joo Presenting tudent Abstract: Introduction : Matching into urology residency is a competitive process. Applicant s from medical schools without a home program may be at a disadvantage due to a lack of mentorship that is c rucial to a s uccessful match . Studies have shown a positive correlation between the presence of a home program and a successful match in a 6-year period. Our study seeks to investigate trends for a successful match to urology residency for applic ants from medical schools with or without a home program. Methods : Deidentified A UA M atch da ta from 2009- 20 was used f or the analysis of applicant characteristics. Categorical va riables w ere analyzed w ith P earson Chi- square statistics. Numerical va riables were analyzed with student t-tests, a nd univariable a nd multivariable line ar regression where appropriate. Significance was defined as p<0.05. Results : There were 4811 applicants includi ng 3539 male applicants. 1478 applicants did not match. 494 applicants with uni dentified me dical school were excluded. 3590 of 4317 remaining applicants had home programs. There was a steady increase in the proportion of students applying to urology residency without a home program (11% from 2009- 12 to 18.5% from 2017- 20). The percentage of matched versus unmatched applicants with (84.6% v 88.9%) or without (58.7% v 52.3%) a home program both increased from 2017- 20 when compared to 2009- 12. Applicants with home programs were more likely to match when compared to those without a home program (OR=1.35 95%CI : 1.29,1.42). The number of interviews pursued was higher for applicants with a home program when compared to applicants without (M=13.0,SD=5.90 v M=7.52,SD=5.91, p<0.001 95%CI : -5.99,- 5.00), but the number of applications submitted was not significantly different (M=60.9,SD=23.9 v M=61.4,SD=34.0, 95%CI : 1.09,1.64, p=0.64). Among applicants with a home program, those who matched had more interviews versus those who did not (M=14.23,SD=5.37 v M=7.19 SD=4.78, 95%CI : 6.60,7.50, p<0.001), M=61.1,SD=28.2, 95%CI : -2.26,1.82, p=0.83) . Among applicants without a home program, those who matched had more interviews (M=11.3,SD=550 v M=3.67,SD=3.27 p<0.001 95%CI : M=54.3,SD=36.4 p<0.001 95%CI : 8.86,19.1) when compared to applicants who did not match. Conclusion : There has be en a steady i ncrease of applicants and higher number of m atched applicants from schools without home programs over time. Applicants with home programs were more likely to match and had a higher number of interviews compared to those without home programs despite a similar number of applications. Future studies should focus on the role of mentorshi p in successful matching. Funding Sou rces: None.

Presenting Authors: Hyun Woo Joo & Netanel Sapir Presenting Author's Category: ear Medical Students Abstract: Introduction: Ranked second for America's male cancer deaths, prostate cancer poses substantial healthcare burdens. Given initial p rostate cancer screening commonly utilizes a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test, this study investigated if \"vulnerable\" (Black, Hispanic, and/or self-p ay) patients received dif ferential post-P SA prostate cancer screening care. Methods: From 2013 to 2015, this New York retrospective cohort study extracted billing information for male residents (aged 55-7 5) with an initial PSA test, but without prior prostate cancer or prostate biopsy. Adjusting for prostate cancer risk factors, vulnerable versus non-vulnerable patients' post-P SA three-y ear prostate cancer-r elated screening care (prostate biopsy or subsequent p rostate specific antigen) was evaluated. Multivariable logistic models examined three-y ear follow-up screening care, evaluating the impact o f vulnerability while holding other risks constant. Model eligible risks included age, initial screening year, Charlson comorbidity score, family history of prostate cancer, smoking, and morbid obesity. Evaluating for differential three-y ear follow-up, observed-t o-expected ratios were contrasted between vulnerable versus not-vulnerable patients. Results: Of 33,840 men with an initial PSA test, 22.9% (n=7,748) had subsequent routine PSA screening, 12.0% (n=4,072) had elevated PSA results, 6.6% (n=2,243) had a prostate biopsy, and 58.4% (n=19,777) had no follow up post-P SA screening care within three years. Vu lnerab le patients had a lower observed/expected ratio (0.93; 95% CI:0.91-0.94) of Clinical Relevance: Vulnerable (Black, Hispa nic, and/or self-p ay) patients were less likely to receive post-P SA three-year follow-up prostate cancer screening care. Future interventions may be directed to address disparities in cancer screening for patients with socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Funding Sources: We recog nize D r. Howard B.

Title: Intrathecal Rituxan as a Novel Treatment Olga Syritsyna, MD, Nikita Patel, MD, Ellen Song, MD. Presenting Authors: Soo Kyung Kim MS4, Simran Arya MS4 Presenting Author Category: Medical Student Anti-NM DA Receptor encephalitis is the most common type of autoimmune encephalitis in young women and typically presents with neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic instability, and rapid progression to death if left untreated. In 40% of patients, the condition is associated with ovarian teratoma; in these cases, oophorectomy has been shown to be therapeutic. Anti-NMDA receptor antibody in the CSF is key to make the diagnosis ; however treatment should be initiate d even without conclusive assay results if clinical suspicion is high. We present a 20 year old female complaining of headache, hallucinations, and memory lapses that quickly progressed to psychosis, dyskinesias, autonomic instability, and seizures consist ent with anti- NMDA receptor encephalitis. This report showcases the use of intrathecal rituximab as an effective treatment for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis that is refractory to initial treatment. The patient was initially treated with high dose steroi ds and intravenous immune globulin with no improvement, and a course of IV Rituximab was initiated. The patient finally began to show clinical improvement after several doses of intrathecal Rituximab. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient's hospital course was complicated by autonomic instability and respiratory failure requiring multiple intubations. Ultimately she required a tracheostomy and PEG tube. Of note she also exhibited orofacial dyskinesias (constant chewing) that led to tongue injury and damage to the endotracheal tube which needed to be replaced several times. When the patient presented at follow-up 1 month after discharge, she was able to ambulate independently and PEG removal was planned for later that month. Her tracheostomy was removed a month after it was placed as she was able to breathe spontaneously. Despite reported fatigue and poor appetite, the patient ultimately had a good recovery after a 2 month hospitalization and there is hope that she will return to prior functional status. 16. Title: Concordance of Ultrasound and MRI Findings for Diagnosis of Spectrum s ynecology, Approval: IRB 2020-00422 No funding sources or financial disclosures Int roduction: Early and accurate diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is key for appropriate prenatal care and operative planning. This study sought to determine the accuracy of ultrasound and MRI for prenatal diagnosis of PAS by comparing final postnatal placental pathology. Meth ods: This re trospective cohort study included women diagnosed with PAS from January 2013 to December 2021 at a single academic institution. Women were divided according to preoperative diagnosis: suspected abnormal placenta, focal accreta, accreta, increta, Clinical outcomes, imaging characteristics , and final placental pathology were abstracted from charts. Statistical analysis included Fischer Exact, Chi -square, and student t tests using SPSS with statistical significance of p<0.05. Re sults: Forty patients had a preoperative diagnosis of PAS: 3 (4.2%) suspected abnormal patients had a correct preoperati ve diagnosis (Table 1 shows demographics) . Accuracy was associated with preoperative type of accreta (p=0.001) , and women with increta or percreta were more likely to have concordant pathology (Figure 1). Placental location (e.g anterior) was the only factor associated with discrepancy between ultrasound and MRI findings (p=0.026). N o specific ultrasound finding w ere associated with accurate prenatal diagnosis, however MRI finding of uterine bulging was significantly predictive (p=0.003). A high risk of incorrect preoperative diagnosis was observed in patients without previa/low lying placenta (p=0.002). Co nclusion: There is a high but variable rate of accuracy between preoperative imaging findings of PAS and postoperative placental pathology. Preoperative findings of increta or percreta on imaging along with women with previa/low lying placenta were more likely have a correct preoperative diagnosis of PAS. Tab le 1.

Loyst; Rachel.loyst@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author Category: Medical Student ABSTRACT Introduction: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (aRCR ) is a common procedure to repair partial - or full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients experiencing pain or discomfort. Rotator cuff tears have been on the rise due to the aging population, with approximately 50% of patients over age 65 presenting with tears. Consequently, the incidence of aRCR has increased. Given the well -known complications of hypertension following other orthopedic surgical procedures, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between hypertension and postoperat ive complications following aRCR. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS -NSQIP) database was surveyed for all patients who underwent aRCR between 2015 and 2021. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and 30- day postoperative complication data were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify postoperative complications associated with hypertension. Results: A total of 46,562 patients were included in the analysis: 20,999 (45.1%) patients were included in the hypertension cohort and 25,563 (54.9%) in the no hypertension cohort. Patient demographics and comorbidities that were significantly associated with hypertension were age 65 years ( p < 0.001), BMI > 30 ( p < 0.001), male gender ( p < 0.001), dependent functional status ( p < 0.001), ASA classification 3 ( p < 0.001), smoking status (p < 0.001), diabetes status ( p < 0.001), COPD ( p < 0.001), and bleeding disorders ( p < 0.001). The postoperative complications that were significantly as sociated with hypertension included pneumonia (p = 0.012), reintubation (p = 0.009), urinary tract infection (p = stroke (p = 0.044), myocardial infarction (p = 0.004), ventilator > 48 hours (p = 0.017), readmission (p < 0.001), nonhome discharge (p < 0.001), and mortality within 30 days (p = 0.020). After adjusting for the patient variables significantly associated with hypertension, multivariate logistic regression identified readmission (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.13 -1.75; p = 0.002) as the only postopera tive complication independently associated with hypertension. Conclusions/clinical relevance: Hypertension was identified as a risk factor for pneumonia, reintubation, urinary tract infection, stroke, myocardial infarction, ventilator > 48 hours, readmission, nonhome discharge, and mortality within 30 days. After controlling for significantly associated patient demographics and comorbidities, hypertension was classified as an independent predictor for readmission following aRCR. This study emphasizes the importance of pre -operative screening specifically addressing hypertension to help improve perioperative risk stratification and help to minimize adverse outcomes in aRCR. Patients with hypertension may require more extensive preoperative screening to help t o reduce adverse outcomes. Funding source(s): No funding.

Wa ng MD b aRe naissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA bDepartment of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA Presenting author: Rachel A. Loyst; Rachel.loyst@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author Category: Medical Student ABSTRACT Int roduction: Distal radius fractures (DRF) account for up to 17.5% of fractures in adults and are one of the most common orthopedic injuries treated in the medical setting. The pain and inflammation associated with DRF is often managed by glucocorticoid therapy. Given the well -known postoperative complications as a result of chronic corticosteroid usage in other procedures , the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between preoperative chronic steroid use and 30-day postoperative complications following distal radius fracture open reduction internal fixation (DRF ORIF). Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Im provement database was queried for all patients who underwent DRF ORIF between 2015- 2021. 30- day postoperative complications following DRF ORIF were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between preoperative chronic steroid use and postoperative complications. Results: A total of 29,675 patients were included in the analysis : 29,012 patients in the nonsteroid cohort and 663 patients in the chronic steroid use cohort . The postoperative complications associated with the steroid cohort were major complications (p < 0.001), minor complications (p < 0.001), overall complications (p < 0.001), pneumonia (p < 0.001), stroke (p = 0.048), myocardial infarction (p = 0.019), transfusions ( deep vein thrombosis (p < < (p < 0.001), nonhome discharge (p < 0.001), and mortality (p = 0.040). Chronic steroid use was found to be independently associated with major complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17- 2.55; (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.09- 3.00; p = 0.021), overall complications 1.19-2.70; p = 0.005). Conclusions: Preoperative chronic steroid use was associated with an increasing rate of postoperative complications following DRF ORIF. As the prevalence of ORIF of DRF increases, these results necessitate careful con sideration of preoperative risks to better select surgical candidates and reduce the chance of postoperative adverse events.

Title: Predilection of Patellofemoral Arth ritis in Patients with Posterior Medial Meniscal Lesio ns Authors : Rachel . Loyst B .S.a, Guilherme Palhares, Strickland, MDb aRenaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA bSports Medicine Institute, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA Presenting author: Rachel A. Loyst; Rachel.loyst@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author Category: Medical Student ABSTRACT Intr oduction: The menisci have a vital role in shock absorption, load distribution, and supporting knee stability. Posterior root tears of the medial meniscus can lead to rapidly progressive osteoarthritis. While much of the research has focused on the clinical consequences of a root lesion, risk factors predisposing to a root lesion have started to gain more attention. The present study aims to compare the presence and severity of patellofemo ral osteoarthritis between patients undergoing medial meniscectomy and medial meniscal root repair. We hypothesized that patients who undergo root repair procedures would have higher rates of patellofemoral osteoarthritis compared to patients undergoing me niscectomy when analyzing pre-operative MRIs. Metho ds: The root repair cohort was matched to a meniscectomy cohort based on sex, BMI, and age at the time of surgery. Radiographic evaluation with Outerbridge scoring of MRI of the knee was performed to dete rmine the severity of degeneration of the knee joint pre -operatively. Kolmogorov -Smirnov test was used to normalize the continuous variables. Mann-Whitney and Independent t-tests were used to compare the groups. Res ults: One hundred and two patients were included in this study (51 root repair and 51 meniscectomy). The root repair group had statistically greater Outerbridge patella scores (M= 2.45\u00b1 1.12) when compared to the patients (M= 1.30) (p = 0.006) and trochlear scores (M= when compared meniscectomy patients (M= 1.55\u00b1 1.40) (p = 0.010). When analyzing using a new patellofemoral scale for grading patellofemoral arthritis, the root repair group had statistically greater scores (M= 8.33\u00b1 3.38) when compared to the me niscectomy patients (M= 5.67\u00b1 3.07) (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Patients undergoing a posteriomedial meniscus root repair had a greater degree of patellofemoral arthritis than patients undergoing a meniscectomy. The presence of arthrosis preoperatively in root lesion patients has presented the question of whether repair is worthwhile or if one should delay surgery until arthroplasty is indicated. Future research should be placed on outcomes of root repair surgery in patients with patellofemoral arthrosis, in addition to considering the patient's age, activity level, and other risk factors.

Title: Factors Associated with Stage at Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer Patients at Stony Brook University Hospital Authors: Lauren Nemesure, 1Renaissance School of Medicine, St ony Brook University, Ston y Brook, NY , USA 2Department of Family, Populati on and Preventi ve Medicine, Ston y Brook University , Stony Brook, NY, USA Presenting Author: Lauren Marzolini, ct Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Stage at diagnosis is one of the most important factors that determine a patient's survival in CRC. Prev ious literature has demonstrated that African American patients are more likely to present at a later stage o f CRC wh en compared to White patients. A higher likelihood of late stage CRC has also been reported in a reas with socioeconomic disadvantage compared to affluent areas. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if racial differences and/or community affluence were associated with a later stage of CRC among patients diagnosed at Stony Brook Universit y Hospital. Methods: This retrospective study included 963 patients diagnosed with CRC from January 2010 through December 2020, with data from the Stony Brook Cancer Registry. Distressed Communities Index (DCI), a proxy for socioeconomic status based on geographic location and data from the U.S. Census, was paired with patient zip codes to investigate the impact of affluence on stage at diagnosis. Chi-squared tests, Independent Samples t -Tests, and One -way ANOVA were used for univariate analyses. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate which variables were predictive of stag e at diagnosis. Results: Patients who identified as Black or Other race were more likely to have Medicaid or be uninsured (p <.001), and to live in a more distressed community (p <.001) when compared to White patients, however distribution of stage at diagnosis did not significantly differ between racial groups. 14% of patients were diagnosed before 50 years old. Age over 65 years (p = .044) and Medicaid insurance coverage (p = .032) were found to be significant predictors of later stage at diagnosis, while DCI20 was found to be a marginally significant (p=0.069) factor in the m odel. Conclusions: In our study, race was not associated with stage at diagnosis of CRC, while those with Medicaid insurance and those living in less prosperous communities tended to have a higher likelihood of a late stage diagnosis. These findings suggest that social determinants of health rather than race may have a larger impact on stage of CRC diagnosis.

Author: Christina Melian christina.melian@stonybrookmedicine.edu, Medical Student Ab stract Introduction: The use of t elemedicine in orthopaedic surgery has gained great interest, especially during the COVID -19 pandemic. By allowing remote communication, patients and physicians are able to maintain relationships in a convenient and timely manner. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient preference for and satisfaction with telemedicine visits (i.e., teleconsultations) when compared to traditional in-person visits. Methods: This was a prospective observational cohort study of 853 patients receiving orthopaedic care at a private outpatient clinic in Christchurch, New Zealand. Patients were random ly divided into two groups: (1) patients receiving telephone consultation remotely; and (2) patients receiving in -person office consultations at the outpatient clinic. All patients received telephone consultations for four weeks during the mandated COVID -19 lockdown, followed by four weeks of telephone or in- person consultation. Patient preference, satisfaction, and duration of visit were recorded. Comparisons of patient preference between groups, visit type, sex, and location were performed using Chi -squar e tests; similarly, satisfaction scores and visit durations were compared using a general linear model. Results: We report that 91% of patients in the telephone group preferred teleconsultation over in- person office visits during the COVID -19 lockdown ( P<.001). A combined- group analysis shows that 55.3% of all patients preferred teleconsultation compared to 31.2% who preferred in- person office visits ( P<.001). Patients in the telephone group reported significantly higher satisfaction scores (9.95 +/ - 0.04, 95% CI [9.87- 10.03]) compared to patients in the in -person group (9.53 +/ - 0.04, 95% CI [9.45-9.62]; P<.001). Additionally, in-person consultations were significantly longer in duration compared to telephone consultations, with a mean visit time of 6.70 mi n +/-0.18, 95% CI [6.32- In setting of COVID -19, patients who utilize d telemedicine were more likely to prefer it over traditional, in -person visits. This increased preference, coupled with higher patient satisfaction scores and shorter duration of visits, suggests a potential role for telemedicine in orthopaedic surgery, which may even extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Presenting author: Jennifer Mor rone, Jennifer.morrone@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author' category: Medical Student Main body of Abstract: Introduction: The influence of mental illness diagnoses upon first-t ime transthoracic aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients' outcomes have not been previously evaluated. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to examine the impact of pre-T AVR mental illness-related diagnoses upon risk-adjusted outcomes for two Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Agency's regulatory periods: 1) the early FDA approval of \"high risk\"-only TAVR patients (January 2012-D ecember 2015); FDA approval including \"intermediate risk\" TAVR patients (January 2016-December 2018). Methods: The New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System ( SPARCS) database was used to create multivariable logistic models; the calculated risk-adjusted post-TAVR outcomes were compared between patients with versus without a preoperative mental illness diagnosis. Mental illness diagnoses included depression-r elated disorders, post-t raumatic stress-r elated elated disorders, alcohol-induced mental disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Study outcomes included postoperative atrial fib rillation (POAF), a mortality and morbidity and 30-d readmission (READMIT). Results: Pre-2016, 7.48% (n = 325/4,346) TAVR patients had a mental illness diagnosis versus 15.59% (n = 1,485/9,524) post-2016. For both early and latter periods, no mental illness impact was identified for risk-a djusted POAF, 30- day readmission, or MM composite endpoints. Conclusions: Across both regulatory periods, no mental illness impact was identified for risk adjusted short-t erm TAVR clinical outcomes or resource utilization. Given this population's small size, th e generalizability of these findings is unknown; thus, national and regional database analyses appear warranted to reconfirm these New York-b ased findings.

Abstract: Introduction: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is routinely performed to evaluate chest pain in the emergency department. Incidental esophageal CCTA findings are common, but their significance is unknown. This study evaluated the predictive value of esophageal findings on CCTA. Methods: A chart review was conducted for patients undergoing CCTA in 2020 at a university hospital emergency department. Patients with CCTA esophageal abnormalities were r eviewed for gastroenterolo gy follow-up (16%) had endoscopy. Gastroenterology consultation reported 11 diagnoses of gastroesophageal reflux disease and 5 diagnoses of hiatal hernia, while 14 patients who saw a gastroenterologist were not diagnosed at time of evaluation. On endoscopy, there were 4 cases with esophagitis, 4 with hiatal hernia, 1 with a gastroesophageal junction polyp, 1 with a distal esophageal ulcer, and 1 with possible achalasia. Of 6 patients who had biopsies, 3 demonstrated esophagitis. No patients were diagnosed with malignancy. Conclusion: Patients with abnormal esophageal findings on CCTA underwent endoscopy at higher rates than the general population but had low diagnostic yield. Gastroenterology follow-up should be reserved for patients with severe symptoms or risk factors that raise suspicion for esophageal malignancy. For patients without severe symptoms or risk factors, trialing a proton pump inhibitor and primary care follow-up may be sufficient. 24. Title: Social Prescribing: Recommending Community Engagement to Patients in Order to Enhance Treatments and Outcomes in Medical Care Authors : Nidhi Patel1 and Stephen G. Post2 PhD 1Stony Brook University Department of Family Population and Preventive Medicine 2Division Head, Medicine in Society and Director Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care & Bioethics, Stony Br ook University Department of Family Population and Preventive Medicine Presenting au thor: Nidhi Patel (email: nidhi.patel12@stonybrookmedicine.edu) Presenting author' C ategory: Medical S tudent Abstract Introduction : In t he last decade in t he UK, t here is a new w ell-funded mov ement within the NHS c alled \"social prescribing.\" Patients a re encouraged w ith the assistance of \"l ink workers\" in p rimary car e clinics t o involve themselves in social interventions including helping behaviors, community, a nd group activities (involving art, nature, movement , conversation, support) to improve their social situation and wellbeing. Currently, there are efforts to launch such program s in Canada and Australia. W e investigated t he physi cal and mental health be nefits of established s ocial prescribing programs to encourage the ir impl ementation in clinical settings a cross U S. Question: How does social prescribing benefit socially isolated populations using pro-social behaviors and how can we impl ement it? Methods : Literature was collected from four databases using key terms , screened using inclusion and exclusion criteria , and reviewed, yielding 54 articles. Data extraction and analysis was done using Rayyan software and Excel. Results : Four components of social prescribing for the socially isolated were commonly discussed in the articles reviewed: a) patient experience, b) patient's health and wellbeing outcomes, c) physician experience and d) healthcare usage outcomes. Quantitatively, one s tudy reported 38.1% decrease in lack -of-companionship, 61.9% less social isolation, 71.4% decreased UCLA Loneliness Scale ratings. Two more studies portrayed 70% less loneliness after receiving social support, and a 26% increase in Wellbeing scores. Econom ically, social prescribing pays for itself: articles showed a 70% reduction in paramedic service calls and 24% reduction in primary care appointments which were based on loneliness or social factors, reducing physician workload and stress. Virtually all articles showed increased participant self -esteem and mental wellbeing, reduced loneliness, and lower health service usage after engagement in group activities. Physical outcomes included reduced weight, BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, anxiety, and depre ssion. Economically and practically, social prescribing decreased high physician burnout and stress by reducing workload while meeting patients' needs. Conclusions /clinical relevance: Social prescribing programs provide significant improvement in the menta l and physical health, and thus lives, of individuals who would otherwise be suffering without companionship or meaning. Participants are empowered to take their health into their own hands. On a practical standpoint, England and US healthcare systems are limited by lack of staff, resources, time, and capacity and formal training to effectively engage with community groups for patients with mental health problems. This contributes to increased physician stress and burnout. Thus, social prescribing link workers may bridge the gap between doctors and the community, increase morale and physician retention.

Title: Assessing Attitudes Towards Telehealth in an Underserved, Uninsured Patient Population Authors: LCSW3 *Thes e two author s contributed equall y to this work Renaissance School of M edicine1; Departme nt of Family Medicine, Ston y Brook Medicine2; Stony Brook School of Social Students Telehealth has the untapped potential to improve healthcare for underserved communities. However, the COVID - 19 pandemic revealed a striking disparity in which patient demographics face barriers to using this modality. Without addressing them, telehealth will remain underutilized and healthcare ineq uities will persist in these communities. This pilot study was conducted at Stony Brook HOME, Renaissance School of Medicine's student - run free clinic in Suffolk County, NY. It aims to investigate barriers to telehealth in this underserved, uninsured population. Surveys were administered bimonthly (n=56) in English (48.2%) or Spanish (51.8%). Most patients were Hispanic/Latino (58.9%), female (53.6%), and 40-60 years old (57.1%). In general, there was both a l ack of telehealth awareness (28.6%) and utilization (16.1%). Most Spanish-speakers came from zip codes with high social vulnerability indices. English- speakers were more likely to have reliable internet access (1.5x), own a smartphone (1.7x), computer (3.9x) and tablet (5.9x). English- speakers were also mo re comfortable using smartphones or tablets than Spanish- speakers (x =4.4 vs. 3.3, Likert scale). Both groups, however, believed that telehealth was not an appropriate equivalent to an in- person visit ( x =2.7 vs. 2.5, Likert scale). Results demonstrate a lack of telehealth awareness, utilizatio n and buy -in for its ability to replace in- person visits. This was compounded by barriers disproportionately felt by Spanish-speakers, including smartphone ownership, reliable internet access and technological comfo rt. Addressing telehealth barriers th rough survey -directed interventions may improve continuity of care and patient outcomes.

Title: Blunt Bowel and Mesenteric Injury : Accuracy of CT - Based Scoring Systems Authors: I. Sethi1, A. E. Aicher1, M. Zawin2, Mukhi, MS1, J. Vosswinkel1, R. Jawa1 1Stony Brook University Medical Center, Trauma, Emergency Surgery, And Surgical Critical Care, Stony Brook, NY, USA 2Stony Brook University Medical Center, Radiology, Stony Brook, NY, USA Presenting Author: Ila Sethi Presenting Author Category: Medical Student Introduction: Assessing the need for surgical management of bowel and mesenteric injury (BBMI) following blunt trauma remains a major clinical challenge. Multiple imaging -based scoring systems , including the Faget and Bowel Injury Predictive Score ( BIPS ) scores, have been suggested to help identify operative BBMI. This study evaluated the efficacy of Faget and BIPS scoring systems in identifying operative BBMI and determine d senior radiology resident accuracy in identifying BBMI. Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted at an ACS Level I trauma cen ter between 1/2009 and 08/2019. Adult BBMI p atients with available index CT imaging at home institution within 24 hours of injury were included . For each patient, a Faget score and BIPS score was calculated. The Faget score predicts need for surgery based on a weighted CT-scoring system (Score >5=surgical BBMI) . BIPS scor ing includes 1 point each for ED abdominal tenderness, WBC count >17, and grade >4 mesenteric injury on CT (mesenteric contusion or hematoma with bowel wall thickening or adjacent interloop fluid collection OR active vascular / oral contrast extravasation Score> index CT report . Independently, senior resident radiologist review ed blinded CT images (1BBMI:2 ma tched controls) and a radiology attending audited image scoring . Results: 14,897 blunt trauma patients were identified . 91 had BBMI and 59 met inclusion criteria . Faget scores were successful in predicting 17/45 patients who required surgery and 12/14 patients who did not require surgery, for a sensitivity of 37.8% and specificity of 85.7%. PPV of the Faget score was 89.5% and NPV was 30 %. The BIPS score was successful in predicting 21/45 patients who required surgery and 10/14 of patients with non- operative BBMI, for a sensitivity of 46.7% and specificity of 71.4%. PPV of the BIPS scoring was 84% and NPV was 29.41%. The senior resident radiologist was able to correctly identify 75% of patients with BBMI. Conclusion : Existing scoring systems are inadequate for predicting operative necessity in BBMI patients . The detail oriented Faget scoring was more accurate, suggesting that although more complex, the granularity in scoring criteria may be beneficial . Overall accuracy may be improved by requestin g radiology reads specific to scoring systems, similar to AAST organ injury scoring. Finally, resident reads have moderate accuracy in identifying BBMI, indicating continued need for collaborative work with attending physicians. Further research is needed to characterize imaging predictive of operative BBMI. Funding sources: no funding sources Financial disclosures: nothing to disclose 27. Title: Abnormal Preoperative Leukocyte Counts and Postoperative Complications Following Total Shoulder Arthroplasty Authors: Emma Smolev BA, Kenny Ling BS, Matthew Kim BA, Edward D. Wang MD Emma Smolev BA, Kenny Ling BS, Matthew Kim BA - Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA Edward D. Wang MD - Stony Brook Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA, Department of Orthopedic Surgery Presenting author : Emma Smolev, em ma.smolev@stonybrookmedicine.edu, Medical Studen t Introduction: Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) has become the mainstay of treatment for degenerative glenohumeral arthritis, proximal humerus fracture, and rotator cuff arthropathy. Expanding indications f or reverse TSA have increased overall demand for TSA. With increasing demand, this necessitates higher quality preoperative testing and risk stratification. Further, the association between abnormal preoperative white blood cell counts and postoperative complications has not been extensively studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between abnormal preoperative leukocyte counts and 30- day postoperative complications following TSA. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for all patients who underwent TSA between 2015- 2020. Patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical characteristics, and 30- day postoperative complication data were collected. Multivariat e logistic regression was used to identify postoperative complications associated with preoperative leukopenia and leukocytosis. The level of statistical significance was set at p <0.05. Odds ratios were reported with 95% confidence interval. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Software version 26.0. Results: 23,341 patients were included in this study, with 1,307 (5.6%) in the leukopenia cohort and 1,243 (5.3%) in the leukocytosis cohort. Preoperative leukopenia was associated with higher rates of bleeding transfusions (p=0.011), deep vein thrombosis (p=0.037), and non- home discharge (p=0.041). After controlling for patient variables, preoperative leukopenia was independently associated with higher rates of bleeding transfusions (OR:1.55, 95% (p<0.001), pulmonary embolism (p=0.004), bleeding transfusions (p<0.001), and (p<0.001). After controlling for patient variables, preoperative leukocytosis was independently associated with higher rates : Within 30 days following TSA, preoperative leukopenia is independently associated with higher rates of bleeding transfusion and deep venous thrombosis, and preoperative leukocytosis is independently associated with higher rates of pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, bleeding transfusion, sepsis, septic shock, readmission, and non- home discharge. Given increasing demand for TSA, perioperative risk stratification is becoming increasingly important to optimize patient outcomes. U nderstanding the predictive value of abnormal preoperative lab values will aid in perioperative risk stratification and minimizing postoperative complications.

Title: EFFECT OF GENDER DISCORDANCE ON SURGICAL OUTCOMES I N PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE P ATIENT S URGERIES IN NYS Authors : Caroline Adrian Torres*1, Jie Yang2, Konstantino Spaniolas3, Aurora Pryor 4 1 Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University 2 Department of Biostatistics at Stony Brook University 3 Department of Surgery at Stony Brook University 4 Department of Surgery at Long Island Jewish, Northwell Presenting author : Caroline Smolkin caroline.smolkin@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author' Category: Medical Student Introduction: Preliminary evidence demonstrates female surgeons often have improved post -operative outcomes compared to their male colleagues, especially with female patients, despite being underrepresented in surgical specialties. This study aimed to identify the effect of patient- surgeon gender discordance on surgical outcomes in three surgical specialties with high female patient populations: bariatric, foregut, and colorectal surgery. Methods and Procedures: This is a retrospective database study using the New York State (NYS) SPARCS database and the first study evaluating outcomes based on surgeon/patient concordance in NYS. Bariatric, foregut, and colorectal surgery cases from 2013 -2017 were identified. Logistic regression models and generalized linear regression models were used to compare outcome factors among four cohorts: gender concordance/female patient (CC/FP), gender discordance/female patient (DC/MP). Gender discordance is defined as patient/surgeon with opposite genders. Gender concordance is defined as patient/surgeon with same gender. Results: BARIATRIC: FP and MP had significantly different 30 -day readmission (p- value=0.0494) and in- hospital complications (p -value<.0001) based on gender concordance or discordance. CC/FP had significant risk of 30- day readmission (OR=0.78, 95%CI 0.68- 0.90) but significant higher risk 95%CI 1.24- 1.43) compared with DC/FP. CC/MP had risk of 30 -day readmission (OR=1.07, 95%CI 0.81- 1.41) but significant lower risk (OR=0.77, 95%CI 0.66- 0.90) compared with DC/MP. FOREGUT: concordance and discordance was significant between FP and MP on LOS (p -value=0.0030), 30- day readmission (p- value=0.0081), and 30- day ED visit (p -value=0.0075). CC/FP had significant less LOS (ratio=0.94, 95%CI 0.91- risk of 30- day readmission (OR=0.75, 95%CI 0.60- 0.94), and lower risk of 30-day ED visit (OR=0.76, 95%CI 0.65-0.88) compared to DC/FP. MP had the opposite trend in risk, although non- significant. COLORECTAL: The difference between gender concordance and discordance was non- significant within FP or MP group as to any outcomes. FP and MP had significantly different 30-day readmissions based on patient -surgeon gender concordance (OR 0.91vs1.10, p-value=0.0379). Conclusion(s): Overall, female bariatric patients show benefit with gender concordance with their surgeon in certain parameters, but also show benefits with male surgeons. Female foregut patients benefit from gender concordance with their surgeon. Although non -significant, male foregut patients benefit from the gender discordance (i.e, having female surgeon). Female colorectal patients show benefit from gender concordance. This emphasizes the need for surgeons to be conscious of care provided to opposite gender patients and underscores the necessity for more female representation amongst surgeons in high female patient population fields.

Title: Body Mass Index as a Predictor for Postoperative Complications Following Carpometacarpal Arthroplasty Authors: Katherine Wang, BA1, Kenny Ling, BS1, David K omatsu, P hD2, Edward D. Wang, MD2 1.Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University 2. Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Stony Brook University Presenting author: Katherine Wang, katherine.wang@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author's Category: Medical Student ABSTRACT Introduction: Carpometacarpal (CMC) arthroplasty is an effective surgical treatment to relieve pain and improve function for osteoarthritis of the CMC joint. The association between BMI and postoperative complications has been studied for other orthopedic procedures, including total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, and total shoulder arthroplasty. However, BMI has not been studied as a risk factor for postoperative complications following CMC arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine the postoperative complications associated with different categories of BMI following CMC arthroplasty. We hypothesized that increasing BMI is associated with more severe complications. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgica l Quality Improvement Program (ACS -NSQIP) database was queried for all patients who underwent carpometacarpal (CMC) arthroplasty between 2015 and 2020. Patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical characteristics, and 30 -day postoperative complication dat a were collected. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on BMI: underweight (BMI was used identify postoperative complications associated with each cohort. Results: 6,432 patients were included in this study: 3,622 (56.3%) patients were included in the normal/reference cohort, 77 (1.2%) patients were included in the underweight cohort, 1,479 (23.0%) patients were included in the obese cohort, 718 (11.2%) patients were included in the severely obese cohort, and 536 (8.3%) patients were included in the morbidly obese cohort. The obese cohort was independently associated with a higher rate of superficial incisional SSI (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.00- 4.44; p = The morbidly cohort was associated with readmission (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.15- 9.74; p 1.11; p = 0.043). Conclusion: Morbid obesity is a clinically significant predictor for readmission and reoperation within 30 days following CMC arthroplasty. Obesity is a clinically significant predictor for superficial incisional SSI within 30 days following CMC arthroplasty. A better understanding of BMI as a risk factor for postoperative complications may allow surgeons to improve preoperative risk stratification and patient counseling.

Title: Same- and Nex t-day Discharge Following Shoulder Arthroplasty are As sociated with Decreased Risk of Postoperative Complications Authors: Katherine Wang B A1, Matthew Kim BA1, Kenny Ling BS1, Ryan Tantone M D2, Samer A MD2, David E. Komatsu PhD2, Edward D. Wang MD2 1. Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University 2. Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Stony Brook University Pr esenting author : Katherine Wang, katherine.wang@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author's category : Medical Student INT RODUCTION: Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is an increasingly popular treatment for degenerative conditions of the shoulder . Improvements in surgical technique and perioperative management have allowed for shorter postoperative hospital stays , which increase patient satisfaction and decreas e health care costs. While the average postoperative in -hospital LOS following TSA is 2 days, outpatient TSA with same -day discharge (LOS of 0) is gaining popularity. Given limited samples in previous studies, this study sought to investigate the association between in -hospital length of stay (LOS) and postoperative complications for patients undergoing TSA. METHODS : All patients receiving anatomic or reverse TSA between 2015 and 2019 were queried from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement (NSQIP) database. Patients were stratified based on LOS: LOS 0 (same -day discharge), LOS 1 (next -day discharge), LOS 2- 3 (traditional LOS , 2-3 days). Patients with LOS of 4 + days were excluded , as those patients have established higher complication rates. Demographic and 30-day postoperative complication data were collected . Multivariate logistic regression analysis investigated the association between postoperative LOS and postoperative complications. RESULTS : 21,315 patients were included in the study. 1639 (7.7%) had a LOS of 0, 12,930 (60.7%) LOS of 1, and 6,746 (31.6%) LOS of 2-3. Compared to the LOS 0 cohort, LOS 2-3 had a greater likelihood of developing overall complication s (OR, 2.598; P= <0.001), major complication 1.700; P= 0.012). I n comparison to the LOS 1 cohort, LOS 2- 3 had a greater likelihood of developing overall compli cation s (OR, 2 .111; P= <0.001), major complication P = <0.001), complication There was no significant differen ce in postoperative complication risk between LOS 0 and LOS 1. DISCUSSION: Patients with same- and next -day discharge following TSA had lower complication risk compared to those with traditional LOS (2 -3 days ). With surgical improvements and careful patient selection, shorter lengths of stay are becoming more feasible. Investigation into postoperative complications and LOS may allow surgeons to determine if health care costs related to discharge can be decreased without compromising patient outcomes .

Farman1, Pathology, Brook Elmasr y, author' Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast ar e a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions confined to the lumens of breast ducts. It is a nonobligate precursor of invasive cancer, and its detection, diagnosis, and management are controversial. Reducing the overtreatment associated with (DCIS) requires biomarkers that can accurately predict the risk of progression to invasive disease. Although the genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with breast carcinogenesis are well investigated, the i mpact of the microenvironmental conditions on phenotypic plasticity and patterns of genetic variation is still less appreciated . In this work, we investigated the potential of three metabolic markers as a predictive biomarker for upstaging of DCIS. carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), as a marker for hypox ia, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) as a marker for nutrient deprivation, and lysosome- associated membrane protein -2 (LAMP2 b) deprivation as a marker for acid adaptation. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis on 84 patients with DCIS. Of those 17 patients were upstaged to invasive cancer and 67 patients were indolent . For every patient, s equential cuts of the same DCIS tissue sample were used. One section for every patient was stained via Hematoxylin and Eosin stain. In addition, Immunohistochemist ry was used to assess CAIX, GLUT1 and LAMP2b expression. All slides were scanned and analyzed using the QuPath digital image analysis . In all scanned images , all representative ducts showing DCIS were annotated manually and divided into oxidative layer , the outer layer which measures about 100-125 um in thickness, and the remaining tissue in the center of the duct: hypoxic layer . The m orphological features of all cells in the annotated H&E sections were extracted from Qupath and investigated with statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism 9. were scored quantitively and semi - quantitively. Then, the correlation between the expression of CAIX, GLUT1 and LAMP2 markers and the risk of DCIS upstaging was investigated . Results The spatial analysis of CAIX, GLUT1 and LAMP2 produced more significant results. The expression of these metabolic markers showed significant increase in oxidative layers of upstaged DCIS. Conclusions/clinical relevance CAIX, GLUT1 and LAMP2 may be useful biomarkers that could predict the upgrade of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This may aid in risk stratification for the management of patients with DCIS.

Title: Sonic Hedgehog and WNT signaling regulate a positive feedback loop between intestinal epithelial and stromal cells to promote epithelial regeneration Title: Emilia J. A gnieszka B. Bialkowska, Vincent W. Yang Stony Brook University Renaissance School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, GI Translational Research Lab 101 Nicolls Rd, HSC T17-090, Stony Upon injury, reserve intestinal stem cells (rISCs) marked among others by B -cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1) exit from the quiescent state and regenerate the epithelium. We previously showed that RNA -binding protein MUS ASHI1 (MSI1) is important for proliferative activity of Bmi1 - CreER rISCs (BMI1+) cells but the mechanism of Msi1 expression induction remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this project is to elucidate the mechanism regulating the induction of M si1 express ion in BMI1+ following radiation -induced injury. METHODS: Bmi1CreER;Rosa26eYFP mice were treated with tamoxifen to initiate lineage tracing of BMI1+ cells and subsequently exposed to 12 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) or 0 Gy TBI (sham -treated). Proximal small intestines collected for analysis. RESULTS: QRT -PCR analysis of BMI1+ cells showed that increased expression of Msi1 was accompanied by increased expression of Axin2 , a WNT signaling activity marker. We performed luciferase assay using Msi1 promoter and overexpression of Tcf4/Ctnnb1, as well as ChIP -PCR analysis, and showed that Msi1 is a WNT target gene. In order to find a source of WNT ligands, we performed immunofluorescence for WNT ligands' secretion. Upon injury, we observed a significant increase of Porcupine expression in stromal cells. Therefore, we performed an organoids regeneration a ssay and we showed that co -culture of BMI1 +- derived organoids with stromal cells isolated from irradiated mice stimulated organoids' regeneration more efficiently as compared to stromal cells isolated from sham- treated mice. We further confirmed that upon injury stromal cells increased the expression of WNT ligands: Wnt5a, and Rspo3. To explain stromal cells are activated upon injury, we i nvestigated signaling pathway that is known to orchestrate an interaction between stromal and epithelial cells, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). We found that SHH expression in epithelial cells is induced upon injury, and its effector, N -terminal SHH is found in stromal cells. Additionally, we observed increased expression of the SHH effector, Gl i1 in the subpopulation of stromal cells. Finally , we inhibited SHH pathway prior to injury and confirmed that block of SHH signaling prevents stromal cells' activation, Msi1 expression in BMI1 + cells and overall intestinal epithelium regeneration. CONCLUSION: A positive feedback loop between intestinal epithelial and stromal cells promotes regeneration upon radiation-induced injury through SHH and WNT signaling.

Title: The Impact of the Covid-19 Infection on Cognitive Function of WTC First Responders Authors: Zennur Sekendiz1, rogram , 2Department o f Family P opulation an d Preventive Medicine, Program i n Public Health Presenting A uthor: Zennur Sekendiz MD M PH/Postdoctoral Associate Zennur.sekendiz@stonybrookmedicine.edu Introduction There is growing evi dence that C OVID -19 infection is related to abnormalities in executive function and visuospatial processing at both acute and post -acute stages of the infection, but it remains unclear whether these changes em erge coincident with C OVID or reflect di fferences i n pre-COVID functioning and might therefore indicate increased vul nerability t o more severe COVID. In this study, we examined longitudinal data to determine whether there decline in cognition 1) coincided with COVID -19 infection, and 2) were more severe among individuals with more severe acute or post- acute C OVID -19 in a s tudy of essential w orkers w hose a ge pl aced them at r educed r isk for severe COVI D. Methods This study included participants (N=323) who participated in a longitudinal occupation- based study of cognitive aging a t midlife that pr edated and cont inued after t he COVID -19 pandemic . Diagnoses of acute COVID -19 were collected and validated with records of a positive SARS -CoV- 2 polymerase chain r eaction test, had a positive antigen test , or IgG -positive antibody testing and either s elf-reported s ymptoms or were deemed asymptomatic. Standard cr iteria were used t o define post -acute COVID, to determine post-acute COVID symptoms, and to assess probable COVID -19 variant . Cognition was measured using the ultra-sensitive Cogstate Brief B attery acr oss six domain- specific measures o f attenti on, response speed, processing speed, throughput, visual worki ng memory, intra-individual variability. G eneralized line ar longitudina l mixed models were used to examin e cogniti ve decline and change following acu te COVID -19 infection. Secondarily, w e moderated t rajectories b y the presence of post- acute- COVID and by probable C OVID-19 va riant. Results The mean age of participants w as 55.2 (\u00b1 6.9) years , 36.3% had evidence of at least mild post -acute- COVID, and most ( 78.0% ) had some college . Longitudinal models identified a decline in response speed ( standardized regression -19 infection after adjusting for pre-COVID functioning, demographics , and medical factors. Effect s izes w ere large, with cha nges i n response speed cons istent with a loss in cog nitive performance consistent with 15.3 years of normal aging in this cohort. The degree of cognitive decline was worsened by COVID -19-severity and was concentrated in those reporting symptoms of post- acute- COVID -19. Conclusion Since pa rticipants with post- acute- COVID -19 had m ore evidence of co gnitive decline , it may be salient to moni tor people with post-acute -COVID -19 for declines in domains of processing speed and visual working memory. Insofar as acute and post- acute -COVID -19 caused cognitive decline, it may be important to determine the long- term prognosis of this decline.

Title: The Impact of Obesogenic Medications on the Success of Weight Loss and the Weight Regain after the Bariatric Surgery Authors: P rogram 2Department o f Surgery -Northwell Health A uthor: Zennur Sekendiz MD MPH/Postdoctoral Associate zennur.sekendiz@stonybrookmedicine.edu Abstract Background Bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective treatment of obesity and its comorbidities. However, some patients fail to achieve meaningful weight loss. The prescription of obesogenic medications (OM) may affect the outcomes of BS. We looked at the effect of OM on postsurgical weight loss and regain Methods This is a retrospective study of 756 patients aged 18 to 75 who underwent BS at the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center in Stony Brook University between January 2015 to January 2020. The effect of the postsurgical OM on the Percentage Weight Loss(%TWL) in two years was analyzed using linear mixed modeling and the percentage of weight regain (%WR) was evaluated using logistic regression. OM included beta -blockers, anti-hyperglycemic agents, anti -histamines, antidepressants, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, steroids and some contraceptives . Results 443(58.60%) of 756 in the first year and 236 (59.9%) of 394 participants in the second year after BS were exposed to OM. The medication group lost signific antly less weight than control (Beta coefficient = -0.6526 p=0.0363, n=756) and %WR was also significantly higher among OM (odds ratio 2.631; 95% CI 1.313 -5.272; p=0.0064) after adjusting for covariates (age, race, gender, surgery type, comorbidities and use of weight loss medications). While older age, depression, diabetes, female gender and sleeve gastrectomy had a negative impact on weight loss, younger age, sleeve gastrectomy and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were significant predictors of %WR . Conclusion The use of obesogenic medications in bariatric surgery attenuates the extent of weight loss and increases the likelihood of weight regain. Replacing the weight promoting medication with weight loss or neutral medication should be considered before and post up period to maximize the benefit.

Title: Host-p athogen interactions ar Diseases, Department of Medicine, Stony Brook U niversity 2Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook U niversity 3Veterans Administration Medical Center, Northport, New York Presenting Fellow Cryptococcus is part of the critical priority fungal group recently listed by the World Health Organization. The arsenal of virulence factors employed by this yeast includes the presence of a polysaccharide capsule and the secretion of enzymes, such as urease. In addition, Cn is a facultative intracellular pathogen that has adapted to reside within the acidic phagosome and to escape phagocytic host cells via a non- lytic process, named vomocytosis. The ability of Cn to progress through its lifespan leads to the accumulation of important pathogenic -related characteristics, such as resistance to phagocytic killing. In response to infection, macrophages produce itaconate, an anti -inflammatory metabolite mediated by the ACOD1 expression, however, its participation in fungal pathogenesis has not been explored yet. Here we have investigated the dynamical interactions between replicative -aged Cn cells and murine macrophage s, as well as important associated factors for fungal intracellular survival. First, old Cn was isolated using a magnetic field system, and cells that were previously labeled to biotin and conjugated to streptavidin microbeads. Then, we used live cell vide o microscopy and a pH -sensitive molecular marker to analyze the phagosome acidity in response to Cn infection. Since, Cn also releases metabolites that affect the phagolysosome pH, the production of urease and capsule were also measured by colorimetric assay and flow cytometry, respectively. To finish, we analyzed polarization and itaconate regulation of infected macrophages via qPC R. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t -test with Welch's correction. The primary behavior for macrophages ingested with young cells was phagosomes that were never acidified (61%), whereas the main behavior for macrophages infected with old cells was phagosomes that remained acidified (55%). Vomocytosis events for macrophages infected with old Cn were slightly r educed (5%) in comparison to young (8%). Although urease production only trend-up for old Cn , the capsule staining was remarkably increased in old generation cells. Macrophages infected with both young and old Cn polarized towards M1, however for macrophages stimulated with old cells presented increased levels of iNOS and TNF- expression in comparison to young cells (0.30 vs. 2.11- fold change; and 3.82 vs. 5.63- fold change, respectively). Lastly, the ACOD1 gene was upregulated in macrophages infected with old Cn (11.7- fold change). Taken together, our data demonstrate the impact that the longevity of Cn cells has during intracellular pathogenic mechanisms. Advances in unde rstanding t he interactions between fungi and macrophages are fundamental f or uncovering novel strategies for the improving management of fungal infections.

T o identify IEC t ype ta rgeted by IL -22 to mediate beneficial e ffect, w e have studied chemical induce d coliti s developme nt in vari ous geneti c mice models. Method: By us ing various int estin al cell specific IL -22Ra1 knoc kout geneti c mice models tried to identify specific cell target of IL-22 in intestine. To induce colitis, mice were given dextran sulphate sodium (DSS, 2%) in drinking water for 8 days followed by 2 days of normal water. IL-22Ra1Math1- PGR mice were i.p. injected with RU486 200 \u00b5g/mouse for 5 days prior to start of DSS and later at 2 days interval. We measured weight loss, histopathological changes in colon tissue and colon length and expression of inflammatory cytokines in colon by qPCR. Goblet cell MALDI -TOF. The data was analysed using Mann Whitney test and 2- way ANOVA. Result: We observed IL -22Ra1 IEC mice on DSS tr eatment show defect in cell proliferation, B3galt5 expression, Paneth cell number. Results obtained from DSS administered IL-22Ra1 Paneth and IL-22Ra1ISC mice revealed their dispensable in IL -22-mediated protection on colon inflammation. Mass spectrometry results revealed a d efect in mucin type- O core 2 elongation. IL -22-dependent regulation of B3galt5 was independent of microbiota as evidenced by primary organoid culture and evaluation of MyD88 IEC mice tissues. Adenovirus mediated over expression of B3galt5 rescued inflammatory phenotype of DSS administered IL -22Ra1 IEC mice. Since B3galt5 is expressed by bot h enterocyte and goble t cell. We generated IL-22R a1 Math1-PGR mice wher e IL-22Ra1 signalin g is compromised in matured and progenit or secretory cells. When subjected to DSS, IL-22R a1 Math 1-PGR mice were more susceptibl e to in flammation as compared t o contr ol mice. Finally , IL-22 induced B3galt5 expression in human goble t cell line and rapid cel l proliferation in a trans -well culture of primar y hum an colon epithelium. Conclusion: Collectively , our data show IL -22-depende nt S TAT3-B3galt 5 axi s and induction of cell proliferation respons e in Math1+ c ells conferred a protecti ve role in intestine.

Clinical Assistant Professor, The Renaissan ce School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Sharnam Ahmed, PGY 2 Pediatrics Presenting Author: Sharnam Ahmed, Resident, PGY 2 Pediatrics We have no financial disclosures or funding from any sources for this research project. Delays in diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children significantly increase morbidity.1 Patients who have delayed diagnosis often require more aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, with their inherent side effects. Additionally, patients who have delayed diagnosis are more likely to have persistent neurologic deficits. Untreated brain tumors can lead to neurocognitive changes and psychological sequelae even in the absence of chemotherapy and radiation. Data demonstrates that the delay from symptom onset to definitive diagnosis can range from 30 days to over 6 months 2. This is more pronounced in children younger than 4 years, those with low grade tumors and those with nonspecific symptoms (such as headache, fatigue, or vomiting). Children usually have multiple emergency departments, pediatrician , and specialist visits before diagnosis.3 The role of social determinants as a factor in delay to CNS tumor diagnosis has not been extensively studied in pediatrics. Racial and ethnic differences, socioeconomic disparities and language barriers have been shown to influence delays in diagnosis and therapy abandonment in other illnesses 4. It has been shown that outcomes of pediatric CNS tumors in low-income countries are worse than those of middle-income countries 5. Research shows that survival rates ar e lower for Latino and Bl ack patients compared to Caucasian counterparts.6 We plan to perform a retrosp ective chart review of patients 0-21 years of age, diagnosed with central nervous tumors at Stony Brook Children's Hospital from 2011-2022. Our analysis will include presenting symptoms, number of visits prior to diagnosis, number of tests prior to diagnosis, medical and psychosocial comorbidities, socioeconomic status, racial/eth nic id entification, and immigration status.

Title: Implementation of Resident Run Virtual Multid iscip linary ASCVD Program in Authors: Irina Arkhipova- Jenkins, MD, MBA1 and Samantha Williams, MD, MPH1 1 Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine, Division of Preventive Medicine and Population H ealth, Stony Brook University Renaissance School of Medicine Presenting Authors: Both authors are presenting. Williams: samantha.williams@stonybrookmedicine.edu Author Category: Preventive Medicine and Public Health Residency ABSTRACT Introduction: Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends lifestyle modifications to lower ASCVD risk in adults with cardiovascular risk factors, however little is known about strategies for effective implementation of these interventions in the Veterans Health Administration. This project describes the implementation of a telehealth delivered ASCVD prevention program at the Northport VA Medical Center. Methods: The 8- week virtual Heart Health Clinic (HHC) was initially designed as a part of the VHA/DoD Joint Incentive Fund ASCVD Prevention Program. Two preventive medicine residents enrolled veterans with ASCVD risk factors, conducted health behavioral assessments using a validated Hypertension Self-Care Activity Level Effects (H -SCALE) questio nnaire, screened for social risk s using the Assessing Circumstances & Offering Resources fo r Need s (ACORN) tool and arranged for social wo rk referrals to address needs. HHC sessions wer e facilitated by a multidisciplinary clinical team consisting of nutritionists, pharmacists, psychologists, exercise therapists and preventive medicine residents who also coordinated ongoing patient monitoring a nd follow-up. Exit questionnaire data c ollected from participants and staff were analyzed to explore satisfaction, barriers and facilitators to HHC implementation, and areas f or improvement. Results: Nine of the 10 participants and eight facilitators completed exit questionnaires. Most patients (88%) and all staff expressed strong satisfaction with the program. Favorable attitudes among clinicians and program alignment with organizational academic mission were b oth conducive to adopting HHC. Among participants, having established health goals at enrollment, preference f or interactive group- based format, and being referred by P CP were associated with greater engagement. Barriers to patient participation included difficulties using teleconferencing technology, inconvenient session timing, and the need for one -on-one coaching. Among clinicians, inadequate staffing, EHR burdens, and competing work demands were the key barriers to program implementation. Conclusion: Implementation of ASCVD preventio n programs at the VA is influenced by a variety of patient, clinician, and organizational factors. Encouraging health goal setting , integrating PCP referrals, and addressing staffing, workflow, and EHR challenges are needed for successful implementation of these p rograms. Clinical Relevance: Optimizing ASCVD prevention programing at the VA requires a pragmati c approach that considers multilevel factors.

Title: Risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (<1250g) exposed to single (soy) vs multiple component (SMOF) emulsions in preterm infants Authors : Allison Beattie, D O, Pediatrics - Resident, PGY -3 and Shanthy Shridhar, MD , Pediatrics - Neonatology Presenting au thor: Resident, SMOF) is a 20% lipid emulsion comprised of four different oil sources, soybean oil, medium chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. is intended to provide an optimal balance of fatty acids to maximize the nutritional benefits a nd while reducing th e propensity f or inf lamma tion caused by pro-inflammatory ma rkers found in traditionally used soybean oil- based emulsions. Objective To determine whether multiple component (SMOF) lipid emulsion had lower risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), when compared to infants of similar birth w eight who received tr aditional single ( soy) lipi d emulsion. Study Design and Methodology Retrospective chart review of infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care unit at Stony Brook between January 2015 and December 2020. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Infants with birth weight (BW) <1250 g, and g estational age (GA) 23-30 w eeks, and those who received TPN (n = 87) were included. The control group included infants who received soy lipid emulsion (n= 67) and the intervention group included infants who received SMOF (n= 20). Infants born with congenital or chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. Risk of BPD was calculated using NICHD Neonatal BPD Outcome Estimator (2011 version). Secondary outcomes included comparison of growth parameters at post-gestational age of 36 weeks, infant comorbidities, lipid tolerance, and maternal comorbidities. Statistical analysis was pe rformed us ing T-test and chi square test, odds ratio with confidence interval was also calculated. Results Eighty -seven pa tients w ere enrolled, sixty-seven in Soy group and twenty in SMOF lipid group. Mean GA in the Soy Lipi d group was (28.1\u00b11.7wks) compared t o 27.4\u00b12.1 wks) in the SMOF group. There was a trend seen in calculated BPD r isk in the SMOF gr oup at DOL 14 (p<0.01) and 21 (p<0.03) compared to risk at birth with a decline at day 28 (figure 1) . Infants exposed to SMOF had a statistical significance in late onset sepsis . Infants in SMOF had a significantly improved weight and head circumference at discharge compared to the Soy Lipi d group (Table1). There was no difference in Fatty Acid profile nor derivatives in the SMOF gr oup when comparing with and without BPD (Figure 2). Conclusion SMOF lipids are well tolerated in our ELBW population with improved w eight and head circumference at discharge. SMOF exposure may predispose infants to late onset sepsis. Further prospective randomized controlled trial is w arranted to s tudy long te rm outcomes.

Due to largely disproven concerns of doxycycline- related dental staining among patients <8 years old, no prospectiv e data exist on efficacy and adverse effects in young children with Lyme disease. Based on emerging data, our institution has used doxycycline during the past decade when alternatives cannot be given. Our study aims to describe short -term adverse effects and treatment failures amo ng young children receiv ing o ral doxycycline for Lyme disease. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients < 8 years old within the Stony Brook Medicine system from 2010- 2020. Patients were identified by ICD -9/-10 codes for Lyme disease prescribed doxycycline at the same visit. We excluded those lacking an objective finding of Lyme disease, including single or multiple erythema migrans (EM), facial nerve palsy, carditis, meningitis (headache with pleocytosis >5 WBC/L), and/or arthritis, those with an alternative diagnosis, and those receiving post -tick exposure prophylactic doxycycline. Data collected included demographics, symptoms, laboratory results, treatments, and outcomes. Descriptive statistics were calculate d. Results: 32 charts were included. Average age was 5.1 years. 66% were male. The majority of the patients presented with a single EM (Table fo r presen ting symptoms). Initial antibiotics were doxycycline (6 3%) or a beta -lactam (37%). Rationale for doxycy cline included beta -lactam allergy or intolerance (47%), required for treatment of clinical syndrome (such as neurologic disease) (28%), concern for alternative tickborne infection (3%), and no reason given (22%). There were no severe adverse reactions to doxycycline; 2 patients stopped due to nausea/vomiting and 1 due to refusal of oral medications. Among the 29 patients who completed doxycycline, there were no known Lyme disease treatment failures. Conclusions: In this small cohort of young children with Lyme disease, doxycycline was generally well -tolerated, without severe short -term adverse effects, and resulted in no treatment failures. As there is no prospective data evaluating doxycycline in this population and future randomized trials are unlikely, t he data presented provides reassurance that doxycycline is effective and safe for this indication.

Transverse Sinus in a 5-day Post-P Determined is an anatomic va riant in w hich the right common iliac artery overlies the left common iliac vein compressing it against the lumbar s pine; bl ood flow is disrupted, resulting in venous stasis which increases the risk of DVT formation. MTS accounts for 2-5% of all DVTs. C adaveric studies es timate mality at 20- 34% [1]. No population-based studies exist t o evaluate the prevalence or incidence of M TS [ 3]. We present a patient 5-day post-partum (PPM) presenting with DVT and PE, who developed ultimately diagnosed with MTS. MTS is generally an underappreciated contributor to DVT and often overlooked. This case highlights the potential morbidity of MTS in the vulnerable post-partum period and encourages physicians to consider MTS in the differential for a PPM patient with DVT. Case Report S ummary: A 33-year-old female G3P3 (IVF x3) with pa st medical history o f obesity s /p ga stric b ypass p resenting 5d postpartum with LLE pain and swelling for 2 days. She denied recent travel, trauma or prolonged immobility. Vitals ini tially s ignificant for tachycardia and US of the LLE extremity revealed extensive thrombosis in the external iliac continuous to the soleal vein. CTA reveale d a RLL subsegmental pulmonary embolism. was LLE thr ombectomy by vascular s urgery. She subsequently developed blurry vision and headache. CTA and MRI/MRV indicate d \"short segment tubular filling defect in the distal right transverse s inus.\" Patient was taken t o the OR w here an extensive LLE D VT including CIV to soleal vein was discovere d. Intraoperative IVUS performed showing compression along the left iliac a xis suggestive of May-Thurner syndrome. Mechanical aspiration thrombectomy remove d ~500 cc clot with placement of stent in left iliac axis and balloon venoplasty. Conclusions/Clinical Relevance: We present an interesting case of MTS complicated by CVA in the postpartum period. Physicians should consider MTS in the post-partum patient presenting with signs of DVT. Perhaps the pelvic organ changes during birth could contribute to the development of complications from MTS, as a case series of 6 women with MTS syndrome each had a history of 2 or greater pregnancies and births [1]. Hypervolemia, a physiological change of pregnancy may worsen the anatomical anomaly r esulting in s ymptomatic ve ssel compression [4]. While ini tial work- up may reveal DVT by duplex ultrasound, physicians must lend consideration to MTS and remain vigilant in monitoring for development of sequelae.

This is likely multi- factorial and may range from unfamiliarity of which assessment tools should be used depending on the patient, lack of exposure on how to use the assessment tools, or the effects of clinician's own perception and interpretation of pain. The inability of a patient to report pain does not indicate the absence of pain. 1 Current literature offers a variety of tools to use for pain assessment in non- verbal patients, including the numeric pain rating scale, Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT), Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Pain Scale, and Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAIN -AD) scale. 2, 3 Appropriate pain assessment allows clinicians to tailor care to each patient's need and thus must be examined.4 Methods Internal medicine residents, hospitalist attendings, nurses, and other health care workers were given an anonymous, electronic survey via e -mail asse ssing their role in health care, comfort level in assessing pain in general, history of receiving any education on assessing pain in non- verbal patients, ability to assess pain in non- verbal patients (including patients with dementia, at end-of- life, delirious, or sedated/intubated), familiarity with different pain scales including the numeric pain rating scale, CPOT, FLACC, and PAIN- AD. Results 39 electronic surveys were collected from residents, hospitalist attendings, nurses, and others, with approximate ly 26 (66%) coming from residents. When asked about comfort level in assessing pain overall compared to the comfort level in assessing pain in non -verbal patients, 30 (76.99%) answered either \"somewhat comfortable\" or \"somewhat comfortable\" or \"extremely comfortable.\" Of the four different pain scales including numeric pain, CPOT, FLACC, and PAIN -AD, by far numeric pain rating scale was the most well -known with 38 (97%) of the survey participants stating their familiarity with the scale, and others FLACC (62%), CPOT (13%), and PAIN -AD (5%) following in order of decreasing familiarity. There was an overwhelming majority of health care workers, with 35 or 95% of the participants, choosing \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" when asked whether further education on assessing pain on non-verbal patients would be beneficial. Conclusions/clinical relevance Residents, attendings, nurses, and others alike agree that they can benefit from further education on assessing pain in non- verbal patients. Future actions should include development of didactic courses, including modules and in- person training, on assessing pain in non- verbal patients, re- assessment of comfort levels among clinicians, and re-evaluating the effects of didactics on clinicians' ability to assess pain in non- verbal patients.

Title: Comparing Learning Experiences f or Virtual Reality and Manikin Simulatio n for Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Education in 1st & 2nd year Medical Students Authors: Masooma Kazmi, M D; Richard N iyazov Rachel N Heslin, MD, MBA, MPH, MA, MS nd Research Center Grant CORIHS approval date/number: IRB2021-00367: Comparing Virtual Reality and High -Fidelity Simulation for Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Education - 6/29/2021 I ntroduction: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) teaches management of cardiovascular emergencies and involves mock resuscitation codes using manikins. Virtual Reality (VR) has been suggested as alternative to in -person simulations. Our objective was to introduce ACLS concepts through VR or manikin simulation to medical students, many without ACLS training previously, and to gauge their learning experience. Methods: Medical students who were in their first or second year were randomly assigned to one of two groups: VR Oculus ACLS or manikin ACLS education. Participants completed an anonymous survey immediately after the learning experience and 2 -3 weeks later. Results: The results show that participants in both VR and manikin groups agreed they enjoyed the activity, learned from the activity, felt they accomplished the task goal, and weren't frustrated by the activity. The VR group, unlike the manikin group, stated their activity required significant mental demand. In the follow -up survey, both groups agreed they remembered the concepts taught. However, the VR group was more likely to recommend the VR simulation. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that both VR and manikin simulations provide favorable learning experiences. Although particip ants in the VR group felt as though the VR learning experience required more significant mental demand, they were likely to recommend ACLS education through VR.

At Stony Brook University Hospital (SBUH), p atients w ith nor mal hepatic f unction receive an initial dose of 2 mcg/kg/min us ing a standardized argatroban protocol. The purpose of this medication use evaluation was to evaluate if 2 mcg/kg/min of argatroban i s the ideal s tarting dose to at tain adequate anticoagulation, as defined as having 2 consecutive therapeuti c aPPT r esults. T he primary obj ective was t o analyz e what dos e of ar gatroban r esults i n therapeutic aPTT l evels. Methods: A r etrospective chart review was conducted for 17 patients that were 18 years and received argatroban at SBUH from A ugust 9th, 2022 to December 26th, 2022 who had 2 consecutive therapeutic aPPT results. The rate of the argatroban infusion when the patient had 2 consecutive therapeutic aPPT results was used t o backwardly cal culate t his in mc g/kg/min b ased on documented body weight. Descriptive statistics were used t o evaluate pat ient demographics and study results. Results: There were 14/17 (82%) patients that received the standard argatroban protocol . In these 14 pa tients, the mode and the median therapeutic argatroban doses were both 2 mcg/kg/min and the mean was 1.89 mcg/kg/min using actual body weight. Of note, two of these patients weighed greater than 140 kg. Conclusions: Dosing argatroban ba sed on a ctual body weight and using an initial dose of 2 mcg/kg/min in patients w ith normal hepatic f unction is mos t likely to result in the rapeutic aPTT le vels in the majority of patients. Additional evaluation of dosing patients weighing greater than 140 kg is needed.

Title: Arteriovenous Malformation in the Setting of a Possible Cesarean Scar Pregnancy Managed Surgically: A Case Report and Literature Review Authors : Julia Kim (OBGYN), Joseph Bacchi III (OBGYN) Presenting author : Julia Kim - juliak1117@gmail.com Presenting author' Category: Resident Introduction Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare gynecologic condition involving abnormal communication between myometrial arteries and vei ns. AVMs can be congenital or acquired, acquired AVMs often being a result of uterine instrumentation. Other causes of acquired AVMs include Complications of prior pregnancies, cesarean scar pregnancy, uterine infection, gestational trophoblastic disease ( GTN) or gynecological malignancies. Patients with uterine AVMs typically present with episodes of sudden heavy bleeding and can often lead to life -threatening hemorrhage. Moreover, the associated vaginal bleeding is often refractory to standard therapy. Th erefore, proper diagnosis and treatment is critical. Diagnosis is centered around imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and angiography. As transvaginal ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice in gynecology, diagnosis is often based on ultrasonographic evidence of hypoechoic areas in the myometrium with vascular flow. Features may be similar to other differentials including retained products of conception (POCs), GTN and hemangioma. Angiography can further be used to assess size and identify feeding vessels while a CT or MRI can help evaluate for adjacent organ involvement. Treatment depends on hemodynamic stability of the patient and, more recently, desired future fertility. There have been case reports of successful treatment with conservative or medical management, uterine artery embolization (UAE), or laparoscopic coagulation for those desiring fertility preservation. Otherwise, hysterectomy is recommended. This case describes the progressi on of a patient with persistent vaginal bleeding in the setting of a missed abortion, possibly a cesarean scar pregnancy, after failed medical then surgical intervention, found to have a delayed diagnosis of acquired uterine AVM. The purpose of this case r eport is to highlight the importance of considering the differential of AVMs based on ultrasonographic evidence leading to proper diagnosis, management, and overall patient care. Results/Case description Patient is a 31 -year-old parity 1, with prior cesarean section 1 year ago, who was diagnosed by a private gynecologist with a missed abortion measuring 8 weeks by crown rump length. She opted for expectant management as she endorsed spotting at that time. At her follow up, she was given misoprostol and mife pristone for failed expectant management. Two weeks after, she only had spotting and ultrasound revealed \"irregular collection of retained product with collapsing debris\". Patient desired to avoid surgery, so she was given repeat medical management. Patient represented in 2 weeks with passage of large blood clots and ultrasound revealed irregular sac measuring 4.6x5.0x5.6cm. She opted for expectant management. One week later, patient presented to an emergency department with a septic abortion. She underwent a dilation and curettage (D &C) revealing chorionic villi and was given antibiotics. Two weeks following surgery, the patient continued to have vaginal spotting with episodes of intermittent heavy bleeding. On ultrasound, there was concern for a \"heterogenous vascular region in the anterior myometrium\" and she was told she likely has a degenerating fibroid and expectant management, and pain control was recommended. Now 3 months after initial presentation, patient presented to our practice for a second opinion given continued vaginal bleeding. Patient had a beta- human chorionic gonadotropin (beta -hCG) of 19 and ultrasound revealed a large anterior lower uterine mass with a transversing dilated vessel (1.7cm) concerning for a large vascular malformation. An MRI revealed an \"aneurysmal expansion of the lower uterine segment with extremely thin myometrium likely reflecting expanded cesarean scar with dilated arteriovenous formation with a diameter of 1.1cm\". Patient underwent bilateral UAE by interventional radiology with interval improvement of vaginal bleeding. Outpatient follow up revealed a negative beta -hCG and ultrasound revealing decrease in both the size and the vascularity of the AVM. Conclusions/clinical relevance The differential diagnosis includes re tained products of conception, cesarean scar pregnancy, uterine perforation, AVM, degenerating fibroid, or GTN. Patient history, clinical presentation and imaging guided diagnosis of uterine AVM with likely prior cesarean scar pregnancy and allowed for proper treatment in this patient. This case highlights many important learning points. First, in cases with persistent heavy vaginal bleeding suggesting failed standard therapy, uterine AVM should be considered on the differential early. This is especially tr ue with visualization of a vascular structure in the myometrium in the setting of recent instrumentation. As presented in this case, delayed diagnosis can impact patient care and safety. Second, it is critical to rule out a cesarean scar pregnancy prior to treatment as this would affect management. In the case presented, it is unclear if the presenting diagnosis was truly a missed abortion or a possibly cesarean scar pregnancy due to the location of the AVM and retained products of conception. As cesarean s car pregnancies, infection, and D&C can precede the formation of an AVM, it is difficult to determine which one or combination of inciting events contributed to the acquired AVM. It is important to note that if a cesarean scar pregnancy was diagnosed at her initial visit, the patient would have undergone a very different treatment course, including methotrexate or surgical wedge resection. Lastly, this case supports the use of UAE as a treatment for uterine AVMs in patients desiring fertility sparing management. Optimal treatment for AVM formation secondary to cesarean scar pregnancy is still unclear. Hysterectomy is still the recommended treatment for postmenopausal patients or patients with life -threatening hemorrhage requiring emergent treatment. Continued exploration of alternative treatment for women desiring future fertility and their success or postoperative risks and complications is necessary for proper treatment of this complex disease.

This study aimed to examine neonatal and infant outcomes in pregnancies complicated by OUD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An IRB -approved retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify pregnancies complicated by OUD using maternal, neonatal, and infant data from 2017 -2022. Two cohorts were created based on timing of the pandemic in March 2020. The primary outcomes were infant developmental delay through 6 months postpartum and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Results Maternal age, BMI, insurance type, active drug use, admission for withdrawal, gestational age at delivery, PTB, mode of delivery, birth weight, and NICU admission were similar between patients who delivered before the pandemic (n=256) and during the pandemic (n=140). The rates of NAS were lower during the pandemic (29% vs 6%, p < 0.001), however those neonates with NAS required more pharmacologic treatment (36.2% vs 58.2%, p < 0.001). In women on medication- assisted treatment (MAT, n=282), NAS (97.9% vs 73.3%) and pharmacologic treatment for NAS (61.1% vs 39.2%) was more common during the pandemic (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference between any developmental delay at 6 months (n = 1 82, 1.7% vs 16.1%, p < 0.001) but no difference at 2 months or 4 months. Conclusions/clinical relevance Necessity of pharmacologic treatment and developmental delay at 6 months was found to be increased during the COVID -19 pandemic. Effects of the pandemic on neonatal outcomes were more profound in women who were on MAT. Funding source(s) - none Financial disclosures - none 11. Title: Isolated Fetal Pleural Effusion with Progression to Non-I mmun e Hy drops Fetalis: A case report and literature review Authors : Julia Kim (OBGYN), Omar Abuzeid (OBGYN/MFM), Cassandra Heiselman (OBGYN/MFM), David Garry (OBGYN/MFM), Herrera author : Julia Kim - juliak1117@gmail.com Presenting author' Category: Resident Main body of the abstract: Introduction Fetal pleural effusions are fluid collections in the chest cavity of a developing fetus. Pleural effusions can be characterized into primary and secondary etiologies. Primary pleural effusions usually result from lymphatic malformation and are unilateral and isolated findings. Primary pleural effusions are more common in males to females with a 2 to 1 ratio. Secondary pleural effusions are usually associated with structural or infectious etiologies and sonographic, genetic, and infection work up is necessary as primary pleural effusion is a diagnosis of exclusion. Most often small pleural effusions will regress spontaneously or stabilize, allowing for conservative surveillance and management of such patients. Some may progress to the contralateral side and eventually in volve development of ascites and hydrops fetalis, a serious obstetrical complication diagnosed by the presence of two or more abnormal fluid collections in the fetus, including ascites, pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, and or skin edema. The most common cause is cardiovascular in origin however it is often a multifactorial and can involve thoracic obstruction, arrythmias, infections, hepatic venous congestion and/or anemia. The development of hydrops is dependent on etiology, but usually has a poor prognosis with risk of intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). The purpose of this case report is to describe the diagnosis and evolution of a patient with fetal pleural effusion with eventual progression to non- immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) with a good perinatal outcome. Results/Case description A 26 -year-old primigravid female at 28.4 weeks gestation with history of LEEP and resolved COVID -19 infection from 2 months prior presented to our high -risk clinic as a consult for concern of fetal ascites on ultrasound. Prior ultrasounds revealed a normal anatomy at 20 weeks and an estimated fetal growth of 343 grams (75%tile). Prenatal records revealed maternal blood type B, Rh positive, HIV, RPR nonreactive, Varicella, Rubella, Parvovirus immune and cell free DNA screening that was low risk and consistent with a male. On our ultrasound, the fetus had an isolated moderate size (4.3x1.3x1.0cm 3) right pleural effusion with otherwise normal anatomy. Fetal echocardiogram revealed moderate to large right pleural effusion again with normal cardiac anatomy, rhythm and function. Weekly ultrasound surveillance found progressive polyhydramnios (AFI 26.2cm to 46.1cm) but stable pleural effusion (7.2x5.7x2.4cm 3). Skin edema developed at 31 weeks and betamethasone was administered given the progression to NIHF. A genetics consult was placed, and an amniocentesis was offered, which she elected not to pursue. The patient presented to Labor and Delivery after spontaneous premature preterm rupture of membranes at 32.4 weeks and was found to be 1.5cm dilated. Latency antibiotics were started. She continued to make cervical change, and a male fetus was delivered at 32.6 weeks via primary cesarean delivery with Apgars 4/6/8 and birth weight 2450 grams. The baby was intubated and transferred to NICU. Postnatal chromosome analysis revealed a normal male karyotype. He tested negative for COVID -19. The infant is now extubated, and status post an octreotide drip and chest tubes with no further pleural fluid accumulation. He had video- assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pleurodesis with lung biopsy revealing acute/subacute lung injury and acute fibrinous pleuritis. At 5 weeks old, the current diagnosis is congenital chylothorax verses lymphangiectasia, as initial revealed 100% lymphocytes. Conclusions/clinical relevanc e Isolated fluid collections can be challenging, especially given the unpredictability of diagnosis and progression. In the case presented, the progression of disease from unilateral pleural effusion to polyhydramnios and skin edema (hydrops) suggests a secondary cause. Antenatal etiology was unclear with negative workup for chromosomal, infectious or structural causes. Drainage of large pleural effusions prior to delivery is recommended for both therapeutic and diagnostic reasons. The finding of lymphocyte predominant pleural fluid may have aided in earlier diagnosis of chylothorax. The survival and good prognosis of this case can be attributed to a few factors. First, the lack of fetal chromosomal or obvious structural anomalies on ultrasound has been associated with better outcomes. Second, late onset of hydrops is a good prognostic factor. Mcoy et al. found that fetuses diagnosed with hydrops before 24 weeks' gestation were more likely to have abnorm al karyotypes and have a perinatal mortality of 95%. Third, NIHF with polyhydramnios has been shown to have a lower risk of IUFD but a higher risk of preterm birth. The increased risk of preterm labor that is conferred with polyhydramnios allude to the pos sible benefit for earlier delivery for patients with NIHF. Further investigation on timing from diagnosis to fetal morbidity and mortality can help guide delivery timing to balance prematurity and risk of IUFD. There is also limited data on fetal long -term outcomes and should be explored to guide treatment and patient counseling. It is also important to note the patient's COVID -19 infection shortly prior to diagnosis of fetal pleural effusion. There have been cases of newborns developing pleural effusions s econdary to COVID -19 myocarditis or pneumonia. Continuing to understand the effects of COVID -19 in- utero can help elucidate what role this infection may have in fetal pleural effusions and ultimately NIHF.

Title: Pr e-operative plannin g for placenta accreta sp : Korgaonkar- C , Parikh B, Kohli H, Gorman M, Bernasko J, Garretto D, Garry D, Heiselman C, Chaitali Chaitali.korgaonkar-cherala@stonybrookmedicine.edu) Presenting Author Category: /Department : Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook University Hospital , Department of Maternal -Fetal M edicine Introduction At our institution, pre -operatively identified placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) cases are discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) to optimize surgical planning. We sought to determine if our MDM approach improves clinical outcomes of women with PAS. Methods Retrospective cohort study at a single institution from January 2013 to December 2021. Patients diagnosed (antenatal or postnatal) with PAS were identified through record review (placental pathology, cesarean hysterectomy, and Accreta Center records) and divided into groups based on if they had a MDM. Our prim ary outcomes were total blood products transfused and intraoperative complications. Data regarding maternal demographics, length of hospital stay, delivery admission and post -discharge complications were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi square tests, student T -tests, and logistic regression modeling, with statistical significance defined as p< 0.05. Results There were 40 patients with a preoperative PAS diagnosis: 21 had a MDM and 19 did not have a MDM. MDM was not significantly associated with any of the studied outcomes (Figure 1). Planned (35.7%) versus unplanned (3.3%) hysterectomy was associated with statistically significant increased risk of post- discharge complications (p=0.009). Planned hysterectomy was associated with a longe r length of stay, 6.86 days versus 2.43 days (p=0.002). Planned hysterectomy did not have significant correlation with intraoperative or delivery admission complications, number of blood products transfused, or ICU admission. Peri-operative complications did not differ between groups (Table 1). There were no instances of ureteral injury, uterine rupture, stroke, MI, PNA, SBO, ileus, fever, acute respiratory failure, D IC, and post- discharge V TE. Conclusions Pre-operative MDM did not improve clinical outcom es of women affected with PAS. Planned hysterectomy was associated with longer length of stay and more post -discharge complications, however women with a planned hysterectomy may represent a cohort of women with more complicated cases at risk for increased complications.

Title: Knockdown MET and EGFR pathway western blot comparison of pErk/ pMAPK signaling by crizotinib/erlotinib combin ation s with next generation MET inhibitors Authors : B. Elizabeth Lee1, DO, Nicolas Coant2, PhD, Jason Linzer3, Zach P helps3, John H aley2, 1SBUH, S BUH 3SBU Presenting h Lee, Pathology PGY2 Abstract: Multiple signal transduction pathways can be concurrently active within a single cell, and extensive crosstalk can occur between RTKs. Understanding pathway crosstalk is vital to guide the rational combination of approved and experimental anti -cancer agents. Both MET and EGFR are proto and EGF family growth factors. Both RTKs can be mutated and promote NSCLC development and progression. Th is project examines MET amplification in NSCLC using MET inhibitor sensitive H1993 cells. Interestingly, apoptosis is observed when an EGFR inhibitor is included, though the EGFR inhibitor has no single agent activity. C ombined MET and EGFR inhibitors were required for inhibition of the ERK/MAPK pathway. Both Crizotinib and inhibitor s) showed c omparable results. A time course of MET and EGFR inhibition reveal that MET inhibition only can transiently inhibit Erk/MAPK activity, while dual MET -EGFR inhibition maintains Erk inhibition. To identify gene knockdowns that, in combination a MET inhibitor, fully inhibit Erk/MAPK and cause apoptosis an siRNA screen was perfomed . siRNA gene phospho-proteomic , proteomic and RNAseq experiments. siRNA studies are being performed to identify the signaling feedback loops responsible for EGFR's combination activity. MET amplified H1993 cells were grown 1640 media RNAMax used siRNAs to knockdown specific target RNAs in the presence and absence of MET inhibitors. After 72 hours, cell lysates were prepared, and pErk and pMET was measured using SDS -PAGE, Western immunoblots, ECL chemiluminescent detection, and cooled CCD imaging. The data were analyzed and plotted using Excel. Initial data identify multiple gene knockdowns which impact Erk signaling (as measured by phospho - Erk immunoblots) only in the context of MET inhibition. These included knockdown of JNK. Gene knockdowns also were identified which impact activation of MET (measured by phospho- MET immunoblots). In parallel small molecule inhibitors of RAF, MET, Erk/MAPK, AKT and related pathways were used. The RAF inhibitor Vemurafeni b and the RSK inhibitor D1870, PAK1 (AZ13705339) reduced pErk in the presence of MET inhibitor. Latest results will be discussed. Phosphorylated ERK (pERK), a marker of cell proliferation was used to screen siRNA knockdowns of candidate genes in H1993 cells Methods : H1993 cells w ere be grown in RPMI 1640 media with 10% FBS. The experiment use d siRNAs to knockdown specific target RNAs in the presence and absence of MET inhibitors. RNAMax transfection reagent was used f or transfection. After 72 hours, cell lysates were prepared, and pErk and pMET was measured using SDS-PAGE, Western immunoblots, ECL chemiluminescent detection, and cooled CCD imaging. The data will be analyzed and plotted using Excel. Drug compound name an d targets: Results : Excel analysis pending - Preliminary blots attached T ime Course: Co nclusion/Clinical relevance : EGFR inhibitors that are used as monotherapy can become troublesome as many cases of NSCLC become resistant to treatment via MET gene amplification pathways. V arious small molecule inhibitors can help identify and help further characterize the MET -EGFR pa thway, which could become useful in designing therapeutics with less resistance and negative side effect profiles.

Recent literature suggests that surgery during index hospitalization may be performed safely without increased risk of mortality. However, the risk of post -operative complicat ions remains unclear. The purpose of this meta - analysis is to assess the association of early surgery with post -operative complications as compared to delayed surgery in patients with IE. Methods: We performed a literature search f or studies r eporting an association between early surgery and study endpoints. The primary endpoint was post-operative neurological complications. The secondary endpoints were post- operative systemic embolic events, recurrence of IE, and need for reoperation. Early surgery was defined as surgery within 14 days of admission. The search included the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, a nd Google Scholar. The search was not restricted to time or publication status. Results: A total of 11 studies with 1857 participants (634 with early surgery vs 1223 with delayed surgery) were included. The mean duration of follow -up was 39 months (ranging between 6 to 66 months). Early surgery compared to delayed surgery was not associated with increased risk of post -operative neurological complications (OR 1.01, 95% 0%. Early surgery compared to delayed surgery was not associated with increased risk for post- operative systemic embolic events, recurrence of IE, or need for reoperation (OR 0.98, 95% p=0.36).

Recent studies suggests that surgery during index hospitalization may be performed without increased risk of mortality. However, differences in this association in patients with native valve IE and prosthetic valve IE remain unclear. Methods: We performed a literature search for studies reporting an association between early surgery and study endpoints in patients with either native valve IE or prosthetic valve IE. The primary endpoint was in- hospital mortality. The secondary endpoints was long -term mortality. The search included the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search was not restricted to time or publication status. Studies reporting mixed native and prosthetic valve popul ations were excluded. Results: A total of 10 studies with 5493 participants (2505 with early surgery vs 2988 with conventional therapy) were included. The mean duration of follow -up was 55 months (ranging between 12 to 120 months). Early surgery in patients with native valve IE was associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28, 0.83; p<0.01). Early surgery in patients with native valve IE was associated with lower risk of long - term mortality, however this effect was primarily d riven by a single study (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08, 0.83; p=0.02). Early surgery in patients with prosthetic valve IE was not significantly associated with risk of in- hospital mortality, however there is a trend toward lower risk (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58, 1.02; p=0.07). There was not enough studies reporting long-term outcomes to assess the association between early surgery and long -term mortality in patients with prosthetic valve IE Conclusion: Early surgery is associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with native valve IE and is not associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with prosthetic valve IE. Further high - quality studies are needed to elucidate the association between early surgery and long -term outcomes in both patients with native valve IE and prosthetic valve IE.

Methods This is a cross- sectional analysis performed in April 2022 examining all projects on the NIH - RePORTER website carrying the following tags: \"obstetrics,\" \"maternal -fetal medicine,\" and \"perinatology.\" Projects with all activity codes were included in the analysis. Variables relating to NIH funding were collected from the NIH Reporter Website. Demographic and academic productivity fo r PIs were abstracted from institutional websites, LinkedIn profiles, and the SCOPUS database. Statistical analysis included Chi -squared and independent t-tests with a significance value of p< 0.05. Results Amongst a total of 609 studies, 39 (6.4%) of PIs were MFM physicians. Non- MFM PIs included physicians from other specialties, midwives, nurses, PIs holding PhD, and masters degrees in science. MFM PIs had significantly lower average of current active NIH funding than their PIs from other specialties ($1,040,750 vs $4,812,368 p=0.03) as well as cumulative career -long funding ($22,499,894 vs $7,784,877 p=0.01). In addition, MFM PIs had on average a lower H -index than their non- MFM counterparts, however the di fference was not statistically significant (23 vs 29 p=0.06). When examining time since training, MFM PIs were more likely to have a shorter time since the end of training than PIs from other training backgrounds (11 vs 18 years p< 0.01). Conclusions/clinical relevance When examining NIH funding, MFMs are a minority of all PIs. MFMs are awarded smaller amounts of funding within the field of obstetrical research than non- MFM PIs. MFM physicians primarily hold a clinical role, leaving less protected research time, which could be a possible cause of this difference. Despite this, differences in publications and productivity were not noted. As the field of academic MFM grows, it is important to investigate ways to increase funding of obstetrical research perform ed by MFM providers.

Methods This is a cross sectional study in April 2022 that examines projects on the NIH RePORTER website, including \"Active Projects\" using the keywords \"Maternal -Fetal Medicine,\" \"Obstetrics,\" and \"Perinatology\" with all activity codes. The principal investigators (PIs) were further examined for demographic and academic variables from university websites, LinkedIn, and SCOPUS. Data was analyzed using Chi -square and Kruskal - Wallis tests with an < 0.05. Results Out of 609 studies, 368 (60.4%) PIs identified as women, 239 (39.2%) as men, and 2 (0.33%) as they. There was no significant difference between women and men PIs holding R01 grants (40.8% versus 44.8% respectively, p=0.51). However, t here was a significant difference between genders holding K grants (men 13.4% vs women 23.6%, p=0.018). Men had higher average funding amounts across their career (men: $34,479,470 vs. women: $13,763,198; p < vs. wome n: 24.9; p < 0.001). On average, women PIs had less time since ending training (16.0 vs 19.25 years, p=0.03). Of the 39 (6.4%) MFM PIs, there were no significant differences between men and women in regards to R01 grants (45.4% vs. 32.1%, p=0.89), K grants (27.3% career NIH funding ($21,767,182 vs. $13,764,264, p=0.094), or average time since training (11.8 vs. 10.8 years, p=0.97). Men MFM PIs had higher average H -indices than women MFMs (37.2 vs. 18.2, p=0.047). Nationally, 8 academic institutions host the majority (53.4%) of all MFM PIs with an active NIH project with the studied keywords Conclusions/clinical relevance While women have more NIH -funded studies than men, they have lower average cumulative funding and H -indices .

Title: Association of Revascularization with Michael Tao MD, Yang Liu MD, Tahmid Rahman MD, John P Reilly MD, Robert Pyo MD Presenting Author: Archanna Radakrishnan, archanna.radakrishnan@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author category: Resident Revascularization in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction has been a subject of ongoing uncertainty and conflicting results. This is further complicated by factors including viability, severity of LV dysfunction, and method of revascularization using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary - artery bypass grafting (CABG). The purpose of this meta -analysis is to evaluate the association of coronary revascularization with mortality in patients with ischemic LV dysfunction. Met hods: A literature search was conducted for studies reporting on all -cause mortality a fter revascularization with PCI or CABG compared to optimal medical therapy (OMT) in patients with ischemic LV dysfunction. The search included the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search was not restricted to time or publication status. R esults: A total of 21 studies with 6062 participants (2838 revascularized, 3224 on OMT) met inclusion criteria. Mean follow -up was 37 months (11- 68 months), mean LV ejection fraction (EF) was 29%, mean age was 61, 85% of patients were male. R evascularization was significantly associated with lower all -cause mortality compared to patients on OMT (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46- 0.71; p<0.01). The association was statistically significant regardless of severity of LV dysfunction or method of revascularization. Heterogeneity between subgroups was low and test for subgroup difference was not statistically significant by EF cutoff of 35% or by revascularization method (p=0.43, I2=0%; I2=59.7%). S ubgroup analysis by viability demonstrated that revascularization was significantly associated with lower all- cause mortality compared to OMT for patients with viability and mixed cohorts with or without viability, but not patients without viability (OR 0.47, 95% p=0.07). The effect size was larger in the subgroup with viable myocardium compared to mixed patients with viable or non-viable myocardium (Z=4.33 vs 2.79). C onclusions: Revascularization in patients with ischemic LV dysfunction is associated with lower risk of all- cause mortality independent of severity of LV dysfunction or method of revascularization. Revascularization is not associated with lower risk of all- cause mortality in patients without evidence of viable myocardium. 21.

Methods: A literature search was conducted for studies reporting on clinical endpoints after revascularization with PCI or CABG compared to optimal medical therapy (OMT) in patients with ischemic LV dysfunction. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Secondary endpoints include heart failure (HF) hospitalization and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The search included the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search was not restricted to time or publication status. Results: A total of 16 studies with 3379 patients (1693 revascularized, 1686 on OMT) met inclusion criteria. Mean follow -up was 38 months (11- 68 months), mean LV ejection fraction (EF) was 28%, mean age was 61, 86% of patients were male. Revascularization was associated with significantly lower risk of CV mortality compared to OMT (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40, 0.74; p<0.01). This association was significant on subgroup analysis regardless of severity of LV dysfunction. Subgroup analysis by viability showed revascularization to be associated with lower risk of CV mortality in patients with viable myocardium but not in patients with non -viable myocardium (OR 0.42, 95% 2.26; p=0.83). Revascularization was not associated with a significant difference in risk of HF hospitalization or AMI compared to OMT (OR 0.9, OMT in patients with ischemic LV dysfunction is associated with lower risk of CV mortality independent of severity of LV dysfunction. Revascularization is not associated with lower risk of CV mortality in patients with non -viable myocardium and is not associated with lower risk of AMI or HF hospitalization.

Title: Mental Health Disparities in the LGBTQ+ population Authors : Namita Akolkar1, MD , April MPH, Allison Eliscu2, MD, Melissa Schwartz1, DO 1Department of Family / Population & Preventive Medicine, Division of Preventive Medicine and Population Health 2Department of Pediatrics / Division of Adolescent Medicine P resenting author: Melissa Schwartz, DO melissa.schwartz2@stonybrookmedicine.edu P resenting author' s Residen t Abstract Introduction: Research has established that LGBTQ+ individuals face substantial mental health disparities compared to the general population. To better understand specific minority stressors, needs, and experiences among subpopulations of gender identities, the Long Island LGBTQ+ Community Health Needs Survey was conducted by Stony Brook Medicine in 2021. This study focuses on the rates of depression and anxiety in people who are transgender or non-binary. Methods: The anonymous online survey, customized for the LGBTQ+ population with input from community partners and focus groups, assessed individuals' healthcare needs, experiences, behaviors, health status including mental health, and access to care. Electronic and in-person promotion and convenience snowball sampling were used to recruit participants in June- September 2021. Results: The sample (N=1,150) consisted of many gender identity subgroups. 63.2% of transgender and/or non- binary respondents reported symptoms of anxiety disorder per PHQ-4 scoring. Compared to cisgender LGBTQ+ respondents, transgender and/or non- binary respondents had statistically significant higher rates of both anxiety and depression (p < 0.001 for each). Non-binary respondents, compared to transgender individuals identifying as male or female, had higher rates of anxiety (p = 0.009), but not of depression(p=0.193). Conclusions /clinical relevance: The LGBTQ+ community is not a homogeneous population; it contains unique subgroups with different experiences, health conditions, and barriers to care. Within the transgender population studied, differences are seen between the gender identities, with those who identify as non-binary fairing worse. Understanding these differences can guide implementation of services to target subpopulations in order to improve care and reduce disparities. Further research on anxiety in the transgender population, and particularly the non-binary population is needed. Strategies are needed to reduce mental health care dis parities by educating clinicians on affirming care, establishing policy based on specific LGBTQ+ needs and experiences, responding to community needs through outreach, and improving access to care.

Title: Improved Post Operative Outcomes with ERAS protocol in the Pediatric Ambulatory Surgical Population Authors and Institution: Niharika Singh MD, Jane Ahn MD, Xin Chen MD, Sherwin Park MD, Robert Moore MD, Helen Hsieh MD, PhD; Stony Brook University Hospital Department of Pediatric S Niharika Singh MD; Niharika.Singh@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author's category: Resident Introduction: Currently, there ar e no enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols standardized in the pediatric population. An international study showed that children undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with ERAS protocols have improved bowel function recovery time, duration of postopera tive ho spital stay, and lower hospital costs.1 Few studies exist that estab lish the best practices in p ediatric surgery; howev er, some cite the use of IV acetaminophen, regional anesthesia, multidisciplinary communication, tailored post op nausea and vomit ing therapy, prevention of hypothermia, and early initiation of ad libitum feeds as means of improving patient outcomes.2,3 The objective of the current study is to determine if implementation of an ERAS protocol would improve patient outcomes in the ambulatory pediatric urologic population. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on pediatric patients who underwent urologic procedures (circumcision, orchiopexy, hypospadias correction, and other) in the ambulatory surgical setting. Outcomes including opioid use, opioid free care, home pain control, time in recovery, need for rescue pain medications, and adverse events were compared between pediatric patients receiving standard of care (n=30) and pediatr ic patients receiving th e ERAS protocol (n=29). Results: The application of the ERAS pathway led to significantly increased opioid free care (43% vs 7%, p<0.01) and increased percentage of families reporting excellent home pain control (100% vs 92%), without increased need for rescue pain medicines (13% vs 16%, p=1), increased recovery time in PACU (63.5 mins vs 66.7 mins, p=0.87), or incidence of adverse events (0% vs 0%). Conclusion: Few studies exist studying ERAS protocols in the pediatric population, but this study shows that postoperative pain measures are improved in pediatric patients receiving ERAS protocol compared to those receiving standard of care, without increased risk of adverse events. Therefore, this work serves as a proof of concept that ERAS protocols can improve postoperative outcomes in the pediatric ambulatory surgical population. Further studies are needed to discern the impact of specific pathway elements on outcomes and the application of standardized ERAS protocols to other pediatric surgical subspecialties.

Case Description: A seventy -two-year old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Room after developing worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, weakness, lethargy, anorexia, confusion, periorbital edema, and scrotal edema. Cardiovascular examination was significant for tachycardia with an irregular rhythm, elevated jugular venous pressure, anasarca, and cool extremities. The differential diagnosis for this patient's acute decompensated heart failure included tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction, and myocarditis. A complete echocardiogram demonstrated severely reduced LV systolic function with diffuse hypokinesis, estimated ejection fraction of 16.5%, severe swirling of contrast at the LV apex consistent with low flow state, severe diastolic dysfunction, regurgitation. The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. He underwent bedside Swan -Ganz pulmonary artery catheter placement with his hemodynamic profile suggestive of mixed cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock. He was placed on a lasix drip for his volume overload, phenylephrine and milrinone for his shock state, and digoxin for rate control of atrial flutter. Hematological blood smears demonstrated intraerythrocytic parasites, which was to babesia species and eventually speciated to Babesia microti (Image 1). Throughout his hospital course he was able to weaned off inotropic support and underwent transesophageal echocardiogram with electrical cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm . His his parasitemia count became undetectable after eight days of Azithromycin and Atovaquone. He made a significant recovery and was discharged home with close follow up. Clinical Relevance: Although Babesia has a low overall incidence, certain areas are endemic such as Long Island and Rhode Island. The symptoms of babesiosis are high grade fevers, chills, diaphoresis, weakness, and anorexia. Given the non- specific nature of these symptoms and low incidence of disease, clinicians require a high index of suspicion to test for and establish the diagnosis. For these reasons, the diagnosis of babesiosis is frequently delayed up to two weeks between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis. While most cases of babesiosis are mild, many diverse sequelae can occur in patients. We would like to share a case of severe electrical and mechanical cardiovascular complication s of Babesiosis and to share the importance of rapid diagnosis in endemic regions. Image 1 27. Title: PROMOTING SAFE GUN STORAGE AMONG VETERANS TO PREVENT AND REDUCE GUN-R ELATED SUICIDE AND ACCIDENTS: A VA RESIDENT CLINIC PILOT I NITIATIVE Authors : Pronoma Srivastava, MD . Internal Medicine, Email: Pronoma.Srivastava@Stonybrookmedicine.edu Mitchell Dittus, MD . Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY. Email: Mitchell.Dittus@Stonybrookmedicine.edu Lisa Fisher, MD. Primary Care. Northport VA Medical Center , Northport, NY. Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY. Email: Pronoma.Srivastava@Stonybrookmedicine.edu Category : Resident Physician, PGY-2 Introduction : Gun locks reduce the risk of firearm related accidents and suicides. This project was developed to increase the frequency of firearm safety screening and gun lock distribution during primary care visits at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) resident primary care clini c in Northport, NY. Methods : We distributed an anonymous, electronic survey to residents in our primary care clinic to determine how frequently the subjects of firearm ownership and safety were discussed with patients, and to assess knowledge of current securement programs at the VA. We then developed an electronic gun safety reminder in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to encourage routine documentation of firearm ownership, firearm storage safety, and the distribution of gun locks. Results : Our survey was completed by 40 of 48 residents. Of the respondents, 87.5% reported never asking veteran patients about possessing firearms, 12.5% reported sometimes asking, and 0% reported always asking. Of respondents, 45% reported being not at all comfortable discussing gun ownership and safety, 50% somewhat, and 5% very comfortable. All residents surveyed were not aware of gun securement programs. Our newly created reminder has been used to screen 7414 patients. Of those screened, 5343 reported having access to f irearms, with an average of 3.1 guns per veteran. Of those with access, 3234 did not safely store their firearm. Of those that did not, 193 were not interested in receiving a gun lock. We have distributed over 2000 locks to veterans so far. Prior to our initiative there were zero locks distributed. Conclusions/Clinical Relevance : Firearm safety and storage was not a routine part of primary care screening in our clinic. There was an overwhelming lack of knowledge on VA firearm securement programs amongst res idents. Our novel EMR reminder greatly improved routine firearm safety discussion and gun lock distribution to veterans.

Title: COVID Pandemic Effect on Prenatal Care Utilization in Women with OUD Authors : Lauren Stewart, MD, Chaitali Korgaonkar -Cherala DO, MPH, Kimberly Herrera, MD, D iana Garretto, MD, David Garry, DO . Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine Presenting au thor: Lauren S tewart, lauren.stewart@stonybrookmedicine.edu, Presenting au thor' s Category: Resident ABSTRACT Introduction: The opioid epidemic and COVID -19 have significantly impacted pregnant patients. The purpose of this study is to identify changes in Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) utilization in women with opioid use disorder before and during t he COVID -19 pandemic. Methods: This retrospective, single center, cohort study identified patients with opioid use disorder presenting for delivery from January 2017 through July 2022. Variables included type of provider (maternal opioid management support (MOMS) clinic, private provide r, resident clinic, generalist clinic), timing of initial prenatal care, postpartum use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) upon discharge (newly prescribed upon discharge, previously initiated, unknown), and timing of initial pediatric consultat ion. Statistical analysis included Chi square and student t tests. Results : There were 396 pregnant persons included in this study. 256 (65%) delivered before COVID and 140 (35%) delivered during the pandemic. Maternal age, insurance type, GA at delivery, PTD rate, mode of delivery, birth weight, and NICU admission were similar between the groups. Prior to the COVID pandemic, prenatal care was more often initiated in the second (27.8%) or third trimester (4.8%) and occur in private (27.6%) or resident clinics (13.8%). During the COVID pandemic, more patients started initial prenatal care in the first trimester (63.3%) and were more likely to establish care in a specialized MOMS clinic (72.4%). Pediatric consultations were more often obtained prenatally (16.7%) prior to the pandemic, whereas during the pandemic pediatric consults occurred after delivery (76.4%). Conclusions : During COVID more patients established prenatal care through a specialized prenatal clinic for people with opioid use disorder. Patients with OUD during the pandemic were more likely to initiate prenatal care in the first trimester, which is earlier than before the COVID -19 pandemic when most patients did not establish care until the second trimester.

Title: Women's Health Social Media Consumption: A cross-sectional survey Authors: Lauren Stewart, BS\u00b2, Fatima Daoud- Yilmaz, MD\u00b9 \u00b9 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine \u00b2 Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University Presenting author: Lauren Stewart, lauren.stewart@stonybrookmedicine.edu, (631) 358-2948 Presenting author's Category: Resident ABSTRACT Introduction: For better or for worse, social media plays an indisputably important role in the sharing of information, with women's health content being no exception. Although social media has the opportunity both to fictionalize health information to a large audience, limited research has been published specifically on women's health information and social media influence. The purpose of this project is to gain an understanding not only of the type of women's health information women seek out, but also the credentials of those producing the content. We hypothesize that followers with medical conditions are more likely to turn to social media for information compared to those with no prior diagnoses. Methods : This cross -sectional study was conducted via online surveys distributed on the social media posts of study team members. Viewers were invited to share the post and embedded link to the survey amongst their own social circles. Survey invitations were not individually extended or solicited in order to minimize bias. Exclusion criteria for the study included non- cisgender women who are under the age of 18 years old, non- English speaking, living outside of the United States, and who do not use social media to view content on women's health. Statistical analysis included chi -square and t -tests as appropriate. Results : A total of 1475 online participants engaged in this survey with 844 meeting inclusion criteria. 74.6% of participants report following accounts because they discuss issues related to their personal health issues. 72.8% report credentials of ObGyn on 1 account they follow. 94.8% of participants reported \"educational videos/content,\" as a reason for viewing women's health content on social media. However, 14.5% of respondents in that same group reported not knowing the crede ntials for at least one account that they followed. Conclusion : Of the surveyed participants who met inclusion criteria, the majority followed or viewed content related to their own personal health and created by ObGyn accounts. However, a large portion of participants also listed \"I don't know,\" or \"N/A\" for accounts they followed/viewed. While this may be indicative of an unawareness of the credentials of the creators they follow, it may also be representative of an inability to recollect credentials. T here is room for further investigation into whether participants' reported credentials for accounts are accurate, as well as further analysis into sub populations, including possible differences in participants with backgrounds in health care versus those without healthcare backgrounds.

The plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow, often producing osseous lesions (1). Although rare, extramedullary proliferation of these plasma cells can occur (2). Extramedullary proliferation has been identified in 10-16% of MM patients, most often in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidney, but has been identified in every organ system. We present a rare case of a 71 year -old female with M M, diagnosed in 2010 and treated with several chemotherapy agents and steroids, found to have metastasis to her pineal gland after initially presenting with altered mentation. Her course was complicated by obstructive hydrocephalus requiring ventriculostom y. Metastasis was confirmed with biopsy from the pineal gland. Metastasis to the pineal gland is rare and typically secondary to primary lung cancer, but other primary lesions including breast, kidney, cervical, esophageal, gastric, colon, and skin have been identified (3,4). Literature review has only yielded two case reports of MM metastasis to the pineal gland (5,6). Though metastasis to the pineal gland is rare, and MM an unlikely primary source, patients known to have MM presenting with neurologic symptoms should be evaluated for extramedullary lesions in the brain.

Title: Detection of Rickettsia rickettsii Antibodies Among Children with Unlikely Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Authors: Joye Wang, DO1; Andrew Handel, MD1,2 1 Department of Pediatrics , Stony Brook Children's Hospital 2 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's Hospital P : Resident I ntroduction: Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a potentially devastating tickborne infection caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. Diagnosis is challenging due to non-specific symptoms and frequently negative antibody -based testing early in disease course. Early doxycycline administration reduces poor outcomes but is sometimes prescribed without clear exposure or suggestive symptoms. Confusion also arises from the detection of R. rickettsii antibodies in patients lacking symptoms suggestive of RMSF , possibly due to cross -reaction with other Rickettsial species of unknown clinical impact . Our study aims to describe RMSF antibody results and clinical presentation in a low incidence region, focusing on patients with R.rickettsii antibodies but lacking typical RMSF symptoms . Met hods : Retrospective chart review of patients 21 years old tested for RMSF IgG within the Stony Brook Medicine system from 2010- 2020. Patients were identified by ICD-9/-10 RMSF diagnosis code and/or IgG test results . Charts without clinical notes were excluded. Data collected included demographics, symptoms, laboratory results, treatments , and outcomes. Based on CDC case definitions (Table) presenting symptoms and serological testing results were used to classify patients as having likely acute RMSF (IgG+ and typical symptoms), unlikely acute RMSF (IgG+ and lacking typical symptoms), or RMSF negative (IgG -, regardless of symptoms). Data were recorded in Qualtrics. Descriptive statistics were calculated . R esults : 172 charts met inclusion criteria and were reviewed . The ave rage patient age was 14 years old and 56% were male. Of RMSF case categories 7.6% had likely acute RMSF, 6.4% had unlikely acute RMSF, and 86% with negative RMSF. Among all 172 screened, 52% had fever, 41% had a rash, and 40% had headache. Of these 'classic triad' symptoms, 10% of patients tested experienced all three and 23% experienced none. Among those with unlikely RMSF, no common clinical features were identified to suggest a shared infectious source. C onclusions : R. rickettsia antibodies were detected in a large portion (6.4%) of children lacking clinical evidence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Among this subset of patients tested for RMSF, no common symptom constellation wasidentified. The source of R.rickettsii IgG in this population is unclear, but a mild infection , possibly due to a different Rickettsial species, is suspected. Limiting RMSF serological screening to those patients with at least some of the classic triad symptoms will reduce unnecessary testing, treatment, and anxiety. T able: Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) clinical, laboratory, and case classification definitions based on the CDC c ase surveillance definitions. Clinical criteria : Fever and 1 other symptom : rash, eschar, headache, myalgia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or hepatic transaminase elevation Confirmatory laboratory evidence Fourfold increase in R.r.

Title: F actors Associated with HPV Vaccine Uptake among Students at Stony Brook University Authors: Christine Yeh, MD (Preventive Medicine Resident; Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine), Kathleen Scarbrough MD, MPH (Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine), Sana Malik, DrPH, MSW, MPH (School of Social Welfar e), Wei Hou, PhD (Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine) Presenting Author: Christine Yeh, MD, christine.yeh@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting Author's Category: Resident Introduction: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in numerous cancers and diseases of the reproductive tract. Although the HPV vaccine has been shown to prevent over 90% of these cancers, vaccination rates have fallen short of the Healthy People 2030 80% HPV vaccination goal. The objective of this study is to determine facto rs associated with HPV vaccine uptake among college students in order to design educational messaging interventions to help increase HPV vaccine initiation and uptake. Methods: An IRB-approved online Qualtrics survey assessing demographic information, HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge (using a validated tool), HPV vaccine status, and barriers and facilitators to vaccination was distributed via university email to all Stony Brook University students aged 18-26 in spring 2022. Analysis included descriptive statistics, Pearson chi-square, Spearman's correlation, and binary logistical regression models. Results: Of the 797 surveys completed, 709 were analyzed using an 80% completion cut-o ff rate. Mean age was 21.08 (SD 2.20), 71% were female, 43% White, 41% Asian, 76% were undergraduate students, and 81% were born in the United Sta tes. The overall r ate for at least one HPV vaccine was 59 %, with a significant difference between males (49%) and females ( 62%), p=.007. Provider recommendation for the vaccine was reported by 72% of the students with a significant difference between males (60%) and females (77%), p<.001. Factors associated with HPV vaccine uptake were perceived vaccine safety (OR = 2.15; (1.57, 2.93)), provider recommendation (OR = 10.24; (4.70, 22.28)), and importance of family opinion (OR = 1.44; (1.10, 1.88)). 73.45% of respondents listed health care providers as their preferred method of receiving information about the HPV vaccine, with Internet/Google search and social media preferred by 51.84% and 35.17% of respondents, respectively. Conclusions: Perception of vaccine safety, provider recommendation, and importance of family opinion were significantly associated with increased likelihood of having had the HPV vaccine. The majority of respondents preferred to receive information about HPV and the HPV vaccine via health care provider recommendation. Clinical Relevance: Identification of significan t predictive factors in HPV vaccination uptake and understanding how students wish to receive information can be useful in designing evidence-based intervention strategies for Stony Brook University students to increase HPV vaccination intention and uptake.

FELLOWS1.Title: ERGONOMICS I N ENDOSCOPY: THE IMPACT OF ERGONOMICS TRAINING C URRIC ULUM ON Dep artment, 2Stony Brook University Hospital, Physical and Occupational Therapy Department, 3Stony Brook University Hospital, In ternal Medicine Depar Sinai, risk of developing musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries associated with repetitive motions and posture during endoscopy. Survey-b ased studies show there is a high prevalence of endoscopy-r elated (ER) MSK pain and injury amongst practicing endoscopists. Implementing a standardized ergonomics curriculum (EC) during training will improve ER knowledge and help develop prote ctive ergonomic behaviors that may minimize long-term pain and disability related to endoscopy. We created a novel standardized EC that educated gastroenterology (GI) fello ws ab out ER and then tested the impact of the imp lemented curriculum. Methods: We performed a prospective, survey-based pilot analysis at Stony Brook University (SBU). The EC consisted of 3 lecture series created in collaboration with our Physical and Occupational Therap y department. These were presented to 11 GI fellows over 3 months in 2022. Two surveys were distributed pre and post-EC: 1.)10-question survey to GI fellows evaluating their ER knowledge; 2.)6-question survey to GI faculty on the GI fellows' observed ergonomic techniques during 2 clinical colonoscopies. Fellows were evaluated on two principles: room adjustment and personal technique modification to optimize ergonomics while performing endoscopy. (see Table 2) Results: A total of 22 surveys evaluating ER knowledge were completed by GI fellows (6 male vs 5 female, see Table 1) pre and post-E C. A total of 36 survey s were collected f rom GI faculty evaluating ergonomic behaviors implemented by GI fellows pre vs post-E C. There was significant improvemen t in ER knowledge amongst the GI fellows (40% vs 70%, respectively (p < 0.001). There was also significant improvement in both room adjustment pre- vs post- EC, (78% vs 98%, respectively (p = 0.005)) and in personal technique modification (2.72 vs 3.21, respectively (p = 0.031)). While the \"time employing a pencil grip on colonoscope\" improved overall post-E C, female trainees were noted to have less improvement compared to male trainees in a subgroup analysis (31-69% vs 56-88%, respectively). This was also noted for smaller glove sizes; glove sizes 6.5 or less, held \"pencil grip\" on the endoscope for less average times vs those with a glove size 7 or greater (25-50% vs 50-88%, respectively). Conclusion: Implementing a stand ardized EC is associated with improvement in ER knowledge and ergonomically favorable strategies employed, which may help mitigate future ER-i njuries amongst GI fellows. Female gender and smaller glove size are associated with less emp loyed \"p encil grip\", a technique theorized to minimize excessive applied force. Larger implementation of a standardized EC should be considered in GI programs across the country.

Title: Using Less Invasive Surfactant Administratio n (LISA) to reduce the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation in the first 72 hours of life by 25% from our baseline prior to July 2021. Authors : Dionne Donald, M.D NICU, Shanthy Sridhar, Surabhi Aggarwal, M , dionne.donald@stonybrookmedicine.edu Neonatal P erinatal F ellow Introduction Surfactant administration remains the standard of care for infants with respiratory distress syndrome(RDS). The Intubation- Surfactant -Extubation technique reduces exposure to invasive mechanical ventilation. However, even after surfactant administration there can be a delay in the discontinuation of invasive mechanical ventilation. LISA further reduces the neonatal exposure to barotrauma and potentially reduces the severity of chronic lung disease(CLD). The objective of this study is to reduce the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation in the first 72 hours of life (HOL) by 25% using LISA. Method This Quality Improvement (QI) initiative was approved by SUNY IRB at Stony Brook University Hospital and performed in our level III academic Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) from July 2021-2022. The project involved literature reviews, creating methodology, simulation training on the Hobart technique with a mannequin, and implementing protocol over five PDSA cycles. (Diag -1) LISA was first introduced to our unit with this QI project. Neonates with a gestational age (GA) of 250/7 to 346/7 weeks(wks) diagnosed with RDS were included. We excluded neonates <25wks or >346/7wks GA, extramural deliveries, neonates intubated in the delivery room and with congenital anomalies. The Hobart technique was utilized for surfactant instillation into the trachea using an angioc atheter. The method adapted for educational strategies included PowerPoint presentations, simulated modules for LISA administration for our medical staff, laminated bedside protocols and development of a simulation video for review. Data was collected pros pectively and reviewed monthly. The project was overseen by the NICU CLD Prevention QI Committee. Data and surfactant audits were presented at the monthly High Reliability Unit meetings. Results Thirty -three patients diagnosed with RDS received surfactan t. LISA Mean GA30.9\u00b1 2.4wks versus control 30.5\u00b12.4wks. LISA mean birth weight 1668\u00b1 versus control 1591\u00b1528grams. 36%(12) received surfactant using LISA. 83% (10) of them remained on non-invasive ventilation at <72HOL. 17% (2) required intubat ion for a second dose of surfactant. There was no statistical difference in the mode of delivery, APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes of life and antenatal steroid exposure. BPD rate was 42% in the LISA group compared to 47% in the control. (Diag- 2) Conclusion LISA can be safely implemented in a level III NICU as a less invasive mode for surfactant administration and reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. During the LISA implementation phase 71% of patients who were intubated for surfactant were extubated by <72HOL which is an improvement from 54% in the pre -LISA phase Funding s ource(s) : N/A Financial disclosures : N/A Diagram -1: Driver's Diagram and Run chart over 5 PDSA Cycles showing surfactant administration via the endotracheal tube and less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) technique from January 2021, prior to the introduction of LISA, to July 2022 the completion of the project.

Title: Impact of Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation on The Developing Kidneys of Premature Infants. Authors: Uzoamaka Ezeanya M A : ' Fundi ng source(s) : None Financial di sclosures: I h ave no f inancial disclosure. Introduction : Neonates born prematurely have substantial risk for morbidities including Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) during the initial days of life in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Use of invasive ventilation for respiratory distress s yndrome (RDS) has been shown to have increased risk of AKI. Limited data exists on the incidence of AKI in patients receiving non- invasive ventilation including Nasal Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (NIMV) and incremental increases in Nasal Continuous P ositive Airway Pressu re (NCPAP). Our study i nvestigate d the incidence of AKI in patients receiving NIMV and CPAP during the f irst 7 days of life. Study Design and Method: This was a retrospective observational cohort study from January 2018-January 2020 approved by Stony Brook IRB. Neonates born with a gestational age (GA) of 25 0/7 weeks to 34 6/7 weeks and admitted to the NICU receiving any respirato ry support were include d in this study. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition was used within the first week of life to diagnose AKI. Statistical analyses included T -test, Chi-square, Odds Ratio and Confidence Intervals. Results: One hundred neonates were included in this study and separated into 2 groups based upon their respiratory support: Invasive versus Non-Invasive. Sixty patients (60%) were in the Invasive group with a mean GA of 27.1 \u00b1 2.4weeks and mean birthweight (BW) (40%) were in the Non- Invasive group with a mean GA 29.9 \u00b1 1.8weeks and mean BW 1203 \u00b1 305grams. Twenty -five percent of patients in the Non-Invasive group were small for gestational age (SGA) compared to 6% in the Invasive group (p=0.02). The Inva sive group had a lower 1minute Apgar score (p<0.01), with more patients exposed to prenatal magnesium (53%; p<0.01) and 5 days of antibiotics (54% -P<0.01) compared to patients in the Non-Invasive group. We found no difference in exposure to two levels of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) in either of the groups. Additional demographic data is listed in Table -1. Six patients were diagnosed with AKI (8.3% in the Invasive group and 2.5% in the Non-Invasive group). Renal Indices including Blood Urea Nitrogen, serum creatinine, urine output, and total fluid intake were similar in both groups (Figures-1). Conclusion: Although the overall diagnosis of AKI was low, premature neonates exposed to non- invasive ventilation had a low incidence of AKI with no impact of increasing PEEP compared to patients with invasive ventilation. A larger, prospective study is needed to further investigate this population. *T able -1 Demographics Demographics Invasive ( to 0.77 p=0.02* min(median) 5 7 -2 2.69 to -1.30 p=0.01* APGAR 5 min (median) 8 8 0.2 p=0.32 42(70%) 33(83%) 7(17%) 1.71 0.65 to days 34(46%) 30(75%) 0.76 0.40 to 1.42 p=0.38 Duration 20.37 gure -1 Renal Indices 4.

Leukemia stem cells (LSC) has been established as source of treatment resistance and disease recurrence in AML . In this study, we aim to analyze LSC subpopulation during treatment using immunophenotypically defined markers and examine whether information gained from LSC analysis could provide additional insights into disease course and therapeutic outcome. Methods: We analyzed flow cytometry data from bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and/or peripheral blood (PB) in patients with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia ) before and after treatment. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were defined as CD45dim+CD34+CD38low/-. Leukemic (TIM3), and CD45RA percent of positive over HSCs. A c hart review was conducted to determine correlation between LSC fractional change and clinical outcome. Results: Fifty AML cases with both pre- and post -treatment data in the past 3 years were included in this study. C onsistent with published literature , patients with significant reduction in LSC subsets had relatively longer remission , while patients with no significant decrease in the LSC subsets demonstrated no or only a temporary remission . Intriguingly, several patient s with drastic reduction in LSC after induction chemotherapy achieved complete remission , despite initial post- treatment bone marrow showing persistence of \">5% leukemia blasts\" indicating possibly failed induction therapy . In contrast, in patient s with persistently high or increased LSC post -treatment, overt clinical relapse occurred quickly despite \"absence \" or <1% of leukemia blast differential counts in bone marrow . Among the three LSC -specific markers analyzed , the changes in LSC characterized by CLL -1 expression showed the best correlation with clinical course. In addition, the LSC subsets measured by CLL -1 in the peripheral blood is highly correlated with that of the bone marrow (R2=0.93, P<0.0001) . Conclusion: This retrospective study explored the value and applicability of LSC detection in routine clinical practic e. The change in LSC subsets provides additional information for early treatment response evaluation and refine s outcome prediction. LSC fraction al change determined by CLL -1 showed the best clinical correlatio n. Future studies will focus on prospective study to determin e the thresholds of LSC fractional change which constitute potential treatment response vs failure and test the feasibility of tracking LSC subsets non- invasively in peripheral blood during treatment to predict therapeutic outcome and potentially guide treatment decisions.

Title: DESIGNI NG A NEW BEHAVIORAL REPORTING TOOL WITH Geriatric and Hospital Medicine Fellow, Stony Brook University Hospital. 2 Medical D irector, Long Island State Veterans Home, Assistant Professor , Department of Medicine, Stony Brook University H ospital. Presenting Poster Poster A bstract - Quality Improvement Poster Abstract Introduction: Behavioral symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are expected to develop in up to 90% of dementia patients. There is no gold standard for assessing BPSD in long -term ca re (LTC). W e aimed t o develop a new behavioral reporting tool for LTC residents that allows for establishing a behavioral baseline , longitudinal assessment of residents with behaviors, and assessing behavioral outcomes after interventions. Methods: Phase 1- Needs assessment: Reviewed 4 months of behavioral logs of all units in the LISVH to determine the most common reasons and percentage completion. We searched PubMed and Embase for validated BPSD instruments, most commonly reported BPSD, and non-pharmacological interventions. Phase 2 - Design . 2.1 Reason for initiating the tool: we established new and readmission, behaviors, unit transfers, peer conflict, or psychotropic dose adjustment as reasons to start the tool based on Phase 1 findings. 2.2 Behavior a nd Intervention code : we included 20 behaviors and \"No behavior\" and 14 different interventions. 2.3 Assessment: We included the time, trigger (if noted), and frequency of BPSD during the shift, the intervention, and the response. Residents must be reassessed ev ery s hift (day, evening, night) and documented even in the absence of behaviors for up to 7days.Phase 3 - Feedback: We described the new tool (Tool A), Cohen-Mansfield Agitati on Inventory (Tool B), and Direct Observation System (Tool C) to MDs, PAs, and RNs. We asked to complete the three tools for any patient on the unit who exhibited behaviors during that day, followed by an anonymous survey comparing the tools i n different categories. W e did a descriptive statistical ana lysis of the responses. Results : We designed a ne w tool that es tablishes a be havior ba seline and assesses B PSD and response to interventions in LTC residents. Our tool is designed to be longitudinal, wit h observations from different providers at different times of the day, to establish patterns and decrease the risk of recall and observation bias. A nove l aspect of our t ool is the inclusion of non-pharmacological m easures as pa rt of the assessment. were surveyed; 62% RN, 25% MDs, and PAs. Conclusions : Our tool was preferred by MDs and RNs for documentati on, establishing patterns, and addressing behaviors. However, it is less likely to be completed entirely and more challenging to learn than other tools, indicating that further im provement is required to make it more s traightforward. Our report system is a promising tool for assessing BPSD and intervention response in LTC residents. Funding s ources: None. Financial disclosures: None. 6. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-l ike Pooja Lamba, C hristina Lee MD, Erick Spitzer MD, Luis A. Marcos MD Division of Infectious D isease Presenting Author: Maryam Munir MD, maryam.munir@stonybrookmedicin.edu, Fellow Background : Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare potentially fatal hyperinflammatory syndrome. Many cases of HLH are in response to infectious pathogens. Although it s association with tick -borne diseases is rarely reported , we hypothesize that HLH may be present in some of the tick- borne diseases which may cause significant morbidity Methods : We reviewed the medical records of all adult Ehrlich iosis, Anaplasmosis and Babesiosis cases admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital from January 2010 to December 2021. Ehrlichia and Anaplasma diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood, whereas diagnosis of Babesia was perf ormed by peripheral blood smear microscopy and confirmed by PCR. HLH diagnosis was based on the 2004 Histiocyte Society Criteria for HLH. Five of the following 8 criteria should be met: 1) fever 38.50C; 2) splenomegaly; 3) cytopenia of two or three lines : ANC < 1 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, hemoglobin < 9 g/dL, platelet count hypofibrinogenemia 150 mg/dL; 5) hyperferritinemia 500 \u00b5g/L; 6) increased soluble IL -2 receptor 2,400 U/mL; 7) low/absent natural killer (N K) cell activity; and 8) pathology showing hemophagocytosis (bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes). Results : Overall, there were 164 cases with Babesia, 47 of Ehrlichia and 35 of An aplasma during study period. Five patients with babesiosis met HLH criteria whereas 2 had 4 out of 5 criteria of HLH. N one of the Ehrlichia or Anaplasma cases met HLH criteria. One patient died. Summary of laboratory finding in table 1. Out of 7 patients (age median =64 years; range: 45-90 -5.2%. All patients received atovaquone and azithromycin, only one had criteria for co- infection with Lyme disease. Patient who died had several comorbidities including interstitial lung disease and o n chronic steroids, the other patients did not have complications Table 1. Summary of clinical features of HLH -like syndrome in Babesiosis C onclusion : Babesia infection can present like a HLH -like syndrome in endemic areas. Most cases responded well to standard -of-care antimicrobials. All these cases had a median low parasitemia, which suggest that a cytokine storm from host immune response may be responsible for this syndrome.

H. pylori (HP) is associated with non- ulcer dyspepsia as well as malignancy. Updated ACG guidelines in 2017 recommended test of cure to assess successful eradication. We reviewed the HP treatment experience for the past 15 years in our facility (Northport VA m edical center). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of US Veterans with H P infection (diagnosed by serum IgG, stool antigen (SA) or gastric histology ) from 1/1/2007 to 12/21/2021 at the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center. We collected data on demographic features, service record, overseas deployment history, medical history , treatment/retreatment choices and outcomes RESULTS: 311 Veterans were diagnosed with H P infection. 276 with positive IgG serology (22/ 276 had positive stool antigen, 35/276 had positive stain on histology), 35 with positive SA (13/35 had positive stain on histology). The median age was 61 years (23 -95 years). 92% men; 50% served in the Army, 22% Navy, 14% Marines, 13% Air Force, 1% 28% Black, 12% Hispanic, 3% other. 70% of the cohort was deployed overseas: 131 to Southe ast Asia, 15 Europe, 80 Middle East, 6 Africa. 247 patients were having pyrosis/abdominal pain/nausea, 72 had diabetes, 165 hypertension, 72 CAD, yperlipidemia . Gastric histological findings: 7 38 moderate chronic gastritis, 52 mild chronic gastritis, and 1 gastric adenocarcinoma. 217 received treatment: 80% were treated with amoxicillin/clarithromycin/PPI. 15 received a s econd treatment, 6 and 5 patients r eceived a 3rd and 4th treatment respectively. 66 patients had evidence of cure at end of follow up: 41 with negative SA , 10 with negative Urea Breath test, 10 with negative stain on stomach biopsy, 5 with normal appearing stomach on endoscopy. 2 had no cure despite few retreatments. No antibiotic resistance testing was available. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Veterans w ith H.Pylori infection were deployed overseas , a likely risk factor. Test of cure was infrequently done in our cohort , especially in the early years, but has increased since the release of the updated 2017 ACG guidelines. 8. Title: Perinatal and Neonatal Outcomes with Psy chiatric Medication Exposure Women with MD; Kimberly H errer a MD Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University Presenting A uthor: Bijal Parikh, MD bijal.parikh@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author' Category : Fellow Introduction To evaluate the effect of psychiatric medication exposure in pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD) on perinatal and neonatal outcomes. Methods This IRB -approved retrospective, single center, cohort study identified patients with opioid use disorder (active or in remission on maintenance therapy) presenting for delivery from 01/2017 through 07/2022. The cohort was divided based on exposure to psyc hiatric medication during pregnancy. Pregnancy, substance use information, and newborn outcomes were obtained, including trends in maternal MOUD utilization. Statistical analysis included Chi square and student t tests with significance levels of p < 0.05 using SPSS. Results 402 pregnant women with OUD were identified with 166 (41.3%) on psychiatric medications and 236 (58.7%) without exposure. There were no differences in maternal co-morbidities, age, obesity, insurance type, active drug use, admission for withdrawal, fetal growth restriction, GA at delivery, mode of delivery, reasons for delivery, relapse postpartum or postpartum care compliance were not different across groups. Those with psychiatric medication exposure were more likely to receive MOUD fr om an OB (32.9% v v 11.7%) prescriber, have their MOUD increased during pregnancy and be treated with Buprenorphine. (Table 1) There was an increased incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) (p=0.04), however severe NAS treated with morphine was not significant across groups (0.67) Conclusions Psychiatric medication exposure in women with opioid use disorder was not associated with worse maternal outcomes but was predictive of NAS.

Methods IRB approved retrospective study of pregnant patients diagnosed with SARS -CoV- 2 virus between 03/2020- 03/2022 that received prenatal care at an academic university. Baseline demographics, vaccination status, symptoms, COVID complications, perinatal outcomes, and neonatal outcomes were collected. The three COVID waves correlated to the following variants: included Chi square tests, student t-tests, and logistic regression with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Results There were 644 COVID positive pregnancies with 342 infected in the first/second trimester and 302 infected in the third trimester. Maternal age, insurance, number of twins, birth weight, and NICU admission were similar between groups. Hispanic ethnicity (31% v 22%; p=0.006) and full vaccination (83% v 92%; p=0.007) were higher in women with third trimester infection. Admission for COVID (2% v 6%; p=0.001), earlier GA at delivery complications (9% v 15%; p=0.02) were greater in third trimester. The Omicron COVID wave was associated with a higher number of first/second trimester infections (45% v 34%, p=0.03). Infection in the first/second trimester was more likely to have symptomatic infections (88% 75%; p< 0.001) (p=0.004), twin gestation (p< 0.001) were independent predictors of preterm birth. (Table 1) Conclusion First/second trimester COVID infection had more maternal symptoms and increased risk for preterm birth.

Title: Wild type through Omicron: Maternal outcomes M D1 1Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Br ook University 2 Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University Presenting A uthor: Bijal Parikh, Presenting author' Category: Fellow Introduction SARS -CoV -2 has been associated with poor maternal complications. Few studies exist that specifically compare maternal outcomes across the waves and variants of the pandemic. We s ought to determine which COVID- 19 wave was associated with worse maternal outcomes. Methods Retrospective study of pregnant patients diagnosed with SARS -CoV- 2 between 3/6/20 and 2/28/22. Three distinct waves of the pandemic were identified that correlated to the following variants: 12/14/21), and Omicron (12/15/21-2/28/22). Baseline demographics and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was development of maternal COVID -19 complications (venous thromboembolism, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute renal or hepatic failure, and transaminitis). Statistical analysis was performed using Chi square tests, student T -tests, and logistic regression modeling, with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Results There were 654 patients included in the analysis with 190 (29%) patients in the wild type wave, 207 (31%) patients in the Alpha/Delta wave, and 257 (39%) patients in the Omicron wave. Baseline demographics are shown in Table 1. Those diagnosed during the wild type wave had statistically significant higher odds of maternal complications compared to Omicron wave (OR 22.9 (95% CI 2.9- 177.4)). Patients in the Alpha/Delta wave had statistically significant high er odds of maternal complications compared to those in the Omicron wave (OR 10.6 (95% CI 1.3-85.1)). The incidence of pneumonia was 7.4% during the wild type wave versus 4.3% in Alpha/Delta versus 0.4% in the Omicron wave (p<0.001). Rates of other maternal complications are shown in Figure 1. There were no cases of stroke, myocardial infarction, acute renal or hepatic failure in the cohorts. Conclusion Maternal complications of COVID were higher during the Wild type and Alpha/Delta waves compared to the Omicron wave. Incidence of specific complications was variable during each wave of the pandemic.

Three distinct waves of the pandemic were identified that correlated to the following variants: 12/14/21), and Omicron (12/15/21-2/28/22). Baseline demographics and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was a composite of obstetric complications (PPH, IUFD, PTL, blood transfusion, pyelonephritis, GDM, and PPROM). Statistical analysis was performed using Chi square tests, student T -tests, and logistic regression modeling, with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Results There were 654 patients included in the analysis with 190 (29%) patients in the wild type wave, 207 (31%) patients in the Alpha/Delta wave, and 257 (39%) patients in the Omicron wave. Baseline demographics are shown in Table 1. Alpha/Delta and Omicron waves had statistically significant higher odds of obstetrical complications compared to wild type (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.31- 3.08). The incidence of preeclampsia with severe features varied from 6.3% during wild type versus 1.4% during Alpha/Delta versus 5.1% during Omicron waves (p<0.026). Patients wit h multifetal gestation had significant lower odds of obstetric complications (OR 0.16; 95% 0.06-0.43). Patients that had no hospitalization had significantly higher odds of obstetric complications (OR 2.77; 95% CI 1.08-7.09). Rates of other obstetric compl ications are shown in Figure 1. Conclusion Obstetric complications varied across COVID waves with a higher risk in the Alpha/Delta and Omicron waves compared to the wild type wave. The risk of preeclampsia with severe features was higher in the wild type and Omicron waves compared to the Alpha/Delt a wave. Multifetal gestation had a protective effect for developing obstetric complications.

The majority of these women experienced the process of labor in order to have a spontaneous vaginal delivery. Neuraxial anesthetic techniques provide effective pain relief and hav e minimal maternal and fetal side effects. Although labor pain itself is not life threatening, it can be distressing. In 2016, MDoloris received 510(k) clearance for the ir HFVI monitor. The HFVI is a measure of high frequency heart rate variability that is proposed to serve as a non -invasive measure of parasympathetic tone that may be useful as an additional guide to effectiveness of nociception during anesthesia. HFVI is scaled from 0 to 100; with previous studies suggesting values 50 indicate adequate analgesia. HFVI values have been shown to decrease in response to painful stimulation, and these decreases are reduced by analgesic agents . Our study will examine the correlation between the ANI values generated by the HFVI Monitor and reported pain in the awake, laboring parturient before and after initiation of epidural anesthesia. Methods : Patients will undergo routine admission to Labor & Delivery and routine management of their labor. The patients will have the HFVI monitor sensors placed and data measured and recorded for at least 3 contractions prior to epidural placement. P atients will be asked to report their pain scores at multiple time points, including pain they felt at the beginning of, the peak, and resolution of uterine contraction. The sa me reporting will resume 15 minutes after epidural medication bolus administration for at least 3 contractions. Results : The primary analysis will assess the strength of correlation between pain and ANI value prior to the placement of the epidural. Additional analyses may include a separate model to assess the association between pain and ANI value after epidural placement. A full model may be run with both epidural and an epidural*pain interaction term to assess how ANI values differ before and after the epidural placement, as well as how the association of pain and ANI values differ before and after the epidural placement. Conclusions/clinical relevance : If there is an increase in the ANI value with the persistence of uterine contraction despite the initiation of epidural anesthesia, we may be able to identify a more objective measurement for adequate analgesia during the painful process of labor. A continuous objective measure of pain would be highly useful for laboring patient s. Funding source(s) : N/a Approval: IRB2022-00459 Approved 10/13/2022 No Exp.

Title: Comparison of Oxytocin Bolus vs Infusion in Elective Cesarean Section Authors : 1Department of Presenting au thor: Ayesha Khan, Ayesha.khan@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting Author Category: Staff Introduction : Nearly 20% of maternal deaths worldwide, are attributed to postpartum hemorrhage. However, the optimal strategy for administering oxytocin, the most commonly used uterotonic agent , remains unknown. Our standard at Stony Brook is an infusion of Oxytocin 18 IU/hour (0.3 IU/min). This is proven to be effective in achieving adequate uterine tone but the time to uterine tone is longer (3-4 mins ) [7]. Significant blood loss can occur with delayed uterine tone since the estimated uterine blood flow is 500- 700 mls/min [8]. We hypothesize that bolus oxytocin is superior to infusion in time to achieving adequate uterine tone. To determine if there is a difference between a bolus of oxytocin and a continuous infusion, we initiated a double- blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) . Methods: IRB approval was obtained and the RCT was registered at ClinicalTrials.go v. The study aims to enroll 120 participants across two arms, bolus and infusion. After cord clamping, the participant receives a bolus of oxytocin/ placebo and a 1-liter bag of infusion of oxytocin/ placebo at the same time . The 1-liter infusion is administered for 1 hour and then the rate i s adjusted as per protocol for the next 3 hours. U terine tone is assessed every minute for 10 mins in both arms. If uterine tone is adequate at 3, 6, or 9 mins, a second infusion of 500ml bag of oxytocin/placebo is started and maintained for 4 hours. If uterine tone is inadequate at 3 or 6 mins, a repeat bolus is administered. If tone is still inadequate at 9 mins, 2nd line uterotonic agents are administered, the infusion rate of 1- liter bag is increased for the next 1 hour and then decreased for the following 3 hours as per protocol . A post-procedure patient satisfaction question is given on the day of surger y. Results: Data from 120 patient s will be analyzed. To date, 60 pa tients have been enrolled. Conclusion: Thi s stud y aims t o identify which method of oxytocin administration provides adequate uterine tone more quickly with f ew side effects and improve d patient satisfaction.

Title: Mechanism of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling induction i n intestinal epithelial cells during radiation injury Authors : Rabina Lakha, Emilia J. Orzechowska Agnieszka B. Bialkowska Affiliation: Department of Medicine, Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA Presenting author : Rabina Lakha author' Category: Staff (SHH) signaling is crucial for embryonic development and in adults. Mutation in this pathway hinders migration, differentiation, and proliferation, including tumorigenesis . Within the intestinal epithelial cells, S HH is induced shortly after irradiation, and its inhibition impairs regeneration by abrogating epithelial -stromal crosstalk . However, the mechanisms regulating the activation of SHH upon injury in intestinal epithelial cells are unknown. Aim: To explore the mechanism that governs the induction of S HH signaling in intestina l epithelial cells upon irradiation. Methods : To identify transcription binding sites in mouse and human SHH promoters, we utilized the NCBI genome browser to obtain nucleotide sequences of the promoters and the JASPAR database of transcription binding sites. We performed a computational a nalysis to identify transcription factors (TFs) that bind to SHH promoter s (mouse and human) with a relative profile score threshold of 85% or above. To assess whether i dentified TFs are induced during irradiation, we collected e nriched intestinal epithelial cells after 3h, 6h, and 24h from 12Gy irradiated and sham -irradiated mice. RT -PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on the intestinal epithelium isolated from sham - and 12Gy -irradiated mice. In vivo experiments were performed with N=3 , while in vitro studies were done with N=6. Statistical analysis was performed using a t -test with a p -value <0.5 as significant. Results : The computational analysis identified 73 TFs binding to the mouse Shh promoter and 217 TFs binding to the human SHH promoter. Comparative analysis showed that 22 TFs are common for mouse and human SHH promoters. For the first analysis, we selected 10 TFs F OXJ2 and H IF1A) based on the fact that they are upregulated in other models upon injury (e.g., DNA damage). Using RT -PCR, we showed that 24 intestinal epithelial cells of mice exposed to 12Gy as compared to sham- irradiated mice. Furthermore, IHC performed on mice intestines showed the presence of phosphorylated- STAT3 in the intestinal epithelial cells of villi a nd crypts, confirming that S TAT3 was activated during irradiation. Conclusions: Our preliminary results identified a set of TFs that bind to the SHH promoter and are upregulated early after radiation injury. We plan to complete an IHC analysis of other identified factors and confirm their binding to the SHH promoters using ChIP- PCR. 4. Title: Keratin 17 is negative Kenneth R.

Although two standard chemotherap ies are available, predictive biomarkers to guide regimen selection have not been defined. We previously reported that keratin 17 (K17) expression is a hallmark of PDAC cases with shortest patien t survival. Furthermore, K17, explored using in vitro and in vivo murine models, drives resistance to gemcitabine (GEM) and 5-fluorouracil (5 -FU), the most common chemotherapeutic agents currently used . Here, we aimed to validate the prognostic value of K17 and to further explore its role as a predictive biomarker. Methods: We used a cohort of 305 cases, with localized disease and who had gone tumor resection. An indirect immunoperoxidase method was used to detect K17 expression on surgical specimens , as previously described . Survival was plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios ( HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regressions for both, overall survival (OS) and progression- free survival (PFS) . Results: Patients in the high-K17 [median= 25mo 1.511, (median= 42mo .). In addition, high K17 expression was associated with shorter median OS (p =0.0533 ) and PFS (p =0.0340 ) in with Gemcitabine/nab -Paclitaxel (GEMTAX) therapy , compared to low-K17 counterparts. Same correlation was observed in patients treated with 5-FU based therapies suggesting that low K17 expression predicts a significant survival benefit in patients treated with 5 -FU based as an adjuvant therapy. When we further separated our cohort by K17 level of expression and compared GEM based and 5 -FU based therapy responses , we found that low K17 expression predicts enhanced therapeutic response to 5- FU based therapy compare to Gem based in advanced stage PDAC (p=0.0231) and patients with tumors with high K17 expression do not benefit from either chemotherapeutic agent (p=0.9485). Conclusions: K17 expression biomarker , significantly correlated with poor OS and PFS in two independent cohorts of PDAC patients. More importantly, our results indicate that high K17 expression predicts PDAC resistance to gemcitabine and 5 -FU chemotherapies and low K17 identifies a group of patients that can benefit from 5- FU based chemotherapy when compare to GEM based therapies . Collectively, our findings have i mplications could guide the development of K17 as a predictive biomarker for gemcitabine - based interv entions in both adjuvant and palliative settings, to optimize therapeutic efficacy for PDAC.

As a r esult, the literature examining the effects of coping strategies on psychological wellbeing has produce d heterogeneous findings . Brief self-report m easures of real-world copi ng strategies ar e needed i n order to accurately assess t he effects o f coping as well as t he interactive effects be tween coping strategy and type of stress (i.e., the fit between the nature of the stress and the coping strategy). The purpose of the present study is to validate a new coping instrument, the Stony Brook Coping Inventory (SBCI), designed to assess stress coping styles in response to discrete stressors. Methods The SBCI i s comprise d of 28 items, with items 1 through 10 assessing common stressors (e.g., financial situation, relationships, etc.) and items 11 through 28 assessing coping strategies used: (1) prayer, (2) social support - seeking, (3) problem -focused coping , (4) reappraisal, and (5) avoidance. College students enrolled in a psychology course at Stony Br ook University were offered course credit for completion of an online Qualtrics survey assessing symptoms of depressi on, anxiety, OCD, stress, and coping. To evaluate the factor structure of the SBCI, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) via SPSS using principal axis factoring and varimax rotation followed by a confirmatory fa ctor analysis (C FA). Results Participants ( n = 488; Mage = 19.86 \u00b1 2.18) were primarily White ( 171; 37.6%) and Asian (n = 171; 37.6% ), and just ove r half of t he sample identified as female ( n = 277; 56.8% ). We excluded participants who compl eted the survey in less than five minutes (n = 54). The factors derived from the EFA aligned with four factors of our a priori model\u2014 reappraisal, social support, avoidance, and prayer \u2014 but not problem -focused coping. Nevertheless, items 13 and 18 had high secondary loadings so we conducted CFA, separating these items into their own factor (problem -solving). These findings aligned with our hypothesized factors except for item 22, which was removed due to low factor loading (.457), negligible influence on Cronbach's alpha, and ambiguous theoretical relationship to the 5 factors. All 5 factors demonstrated strong reliability (s >.7). Conclusions In an undergraduate sample, the SBCI aligne d with our predicted factor structure, demonstrating strong construc t validity . Individual subscales demonstrated stron g reliability . Future studies should examine fit between types of stress and the strategies people use to cope with them.

(Psychiatry and Behavioral Health; Renaissance School of Medicine ; Mind- Body Clinical Research Center1; Stony Brook Family, Population & Preventive Medicine2) Presenting A uthor : Anastasia J. Philippopoulos (Staff; anastasia.philippopoulos@stonybrookmedicine.edu) Main Body Although treatment guidelines recommend intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions for adults with a body mass index (BMI) above 30, many existing weight loss interventions are costly and neglect individual needs. We explore demographic factors associated with engagement with our stepped care treatment program to identify ways to increase participation, particularly among individuals from historically marginalized backgrounds. Eligible family medicine patients (Age 18; BMI 25) were screened by phone for interest in our program from October 2022 to January 2023. BMI scores and demographic information from initial questionnaires (e.g., race, gender, age) were compared to assess factors associated with those who completed a patient navigation visit or declined participation. National and state area deprivation index (ADI) scores were calculated using patients' residenti al addresses to assess socioeconomic disadvantage. Sample characteristics of those who did and did not participate were compared using chi square tests. Individuals in the sample ( n = 221; Mage = 48.2 \u00b1 13.6) primarily identified as female ( n = 152; 68.8%) and non - Hispanic White ( n = 158; 76.7%). Individuals had an average BMI of 32.98 ( SD = 7.44), national ADI of 23 ( SD = 12.1), and state ADI of 5 (SD = 1.5). Of the eligible patients contacted, 36 (16.3%) completed a patient navigation visit (respond ers) and 185 (83.7%) declined participation or were unresponsive (non -responders). Responders and non-responders did not differ significantly on sociodemographic factors such as race ( \u00b2 (1, n = 206) = 1.29; p = .26), gender ( \u00b2 (1, n = 221) = 2.78; p = .10), BMI ( \u00b2 (2, n = 218) = 4.61; p = .10), age group (\u00b2 (2, n = 221) = .49, p = .78), national ADI ( \u00b2 (6, n = 221) = 3.66, p = .72), or state ADI scores ( \u00b2 (8, n = 221) = 4.97; p = .76). Nevertheless, a greater percentage of the responders was female- identifying (80.6% vs 66.5%), non-White (30.6% vs 21.8%), with severe obesity (> 40; 25.0% vs 11.5%) compared to the non- responders. Initial analyses did not reveal significant differences between groups. However, trends in gender, race, and BM I suggest that female- identifying, non -White, individuals with severe obesity may be more likely to take advantage of this free weight loss program. Most contacted individuals were unreachable or otherwise declined participation, despite the visit occurring remotely and free of cost. Thus, finding additional ways to increase engagement, particularly among people vulnerable to overweight and obesity, is warranted.

Title: COVID-19 Symptom Load As a Risk Factor For Chronic Pain: A National Cross-S ectional Study A uthors : Jamie L. Romeiser, M. Singh, of Anesthesiology, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook NY 2Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 3Perioperative Surgical Services, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook NY P resenting uthor Staff I ntroduction: A COVID -19 infection with a high initial severity is associated with development of long -COVID conditions. One such condition is chronic pain. At the population level, it is unknown if severity of a COVID-19 infection is a predictor of chronic pain above and beyond the traditional slate of pre- established risk factors. The purpose of this study is to examine whet her COVID -19 severity of infection may be a new risk factor for chronic pain. Met hods : Using data from the 2021 National Health Interview Survey (n=15,335), this study examined the adjusted odds of experiencing high frequency levels of pain in the past 3 months for those who reported no/mild symptoms from a COVID -19 infection, and those reporting moderate/severe symptoms from COVID -19, compared to those never infected. A 1:1:1 propensity score matched analysis was also performed to examined the odds of pain. R esults : Prevalence of pain was higher in the moderate/severe symptom group compared to the no infection group (25.48% vs 19.44%, p <0.001). Both the adjusted model (odds ratio [OR] = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09, 1.51) and matched model (OR = 1.45, CI = 1.14, 1.83) revealed higher odds of pain for those with moderate/high COVID-19 symptoms compared to no infection. C onclusion : A moderate/highly symptomatic COVID -19 infection may be a new risk factor for chronic pain. As the absolute number of severe COVID -19 infections continues to rise, overall prevalence of chronic pain may also increase. While knowledge continues to unfold on long -haul symptoms, prevention of severe infections remains essential. F unding source : None.

FACULTY1.* Title: Glomerular mRNAs are Alternatively Spliced and Polyadenylated Leading to Multiple Isoforms in Podocytopathies Authors : Amy Webb: Department of Bioinformatics, The Ohio State University C laire Burton: Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital Rachel Cianciolo: Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Claire Moore: Molecular and Chemical Biology, Tufts University School of Medicine Shipra Agrawal: Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine, Stony brook University Renaissance School of Medicine (formerly at The Ohio State University and Nationwide Children's Hospital) Pr as alterna tive splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenyla tion (APA) play important roles in physiology, development, and disease; however, there is very limited knowledge of their roles in glomerular disease and chronic kidney disease. Glomerular disease, often characterized by podocyte loss and injury and proteinuria, can lead to chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease. We hypothesized that AS and APA events of glomerular RNAs is associated with podocyte injury and proteinuria during glomerular disease. Methods: Glomerular damage characterized by proteinuria was induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) or adriamycin (ADR) to mimic human minimal disease (MCD) or segmental Junc tionSeq and APATrap bioinforma tics analyses was performed to detect APA and AS glomerular events. Correla tion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed with known glomerular disease genes, and splicing and polyadenylation factors. Results: Robust proteinuria was induced in both PAN- MCD and ADR -FSGS models, accompanied by hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, and histological alterations in the kidneys (protein casts and podocyte hypertrophy). Out of 13,265 genes, MCD model FSGS 1308 glomerular DEGs with abs(log2FC)>1 and P adjust<0.05. Of 80 analyzed genes with established roles in glomerular disease, 30 were altered in both MCD and FSGS. Signicant AS was identied in 136 and 1875 genes in MCD and FSGS models, respectively. In accordance, of 50 splicing factors analyzed, 3 were altered in MCD and 5 in FSGS. Signicant APA was iden tied in 71 and 746 genes in MCD and FSGS nephrosis, respectively, and of 173 polyadenyla tion factors analyzed, 21 were altered in MCD and 24 in FSGS. Specically, the identied AS and APA events aected genes of the slit diaphragm complex such as Nphs1, Nphs2, and Tjp1, which are critical determinants global due to AS and APA with podocyte and glomerular injury is a newly recognized phenomenon, with potential implications for enhanced mechanis tic understanding and therapeu tic interven tion of glomerular and chronic kidney disease.

Title: A Historical Perspective on Diversity in Clinical Laboratory Sciences Program Authors : Afrinash Ahamad 1 2 3 and Jeannie Guglielmo 1 1Clinical Laboratory Sciences Program, School of Health Professions, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 2Department of Neuroscience and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 3Department of Clinical Microbiology, NYU Langone Hospital, New York, NY Presenting Author : Afrinash Ahamad - Afrinash.ahamad@stonybrookmedicine.edu Funding- no funding is available Abstract Diversity is integral for an effective learning environment and pedagogy. It is a concept that differentiates a group of people from one another based on but not limited to age, ethnicity, gender, health care, mental health, and sexual orientation. Contemporarily, diversity is up- trending in all disciplines of healthcare but systemic inequalities remain and have been reported in healthcare. One way to end the inequalities is to prepare a diverse clinical team from early training so that deep -seated differences can be eliminated, which often merely stem from \"cultural blankness\" and lack of culturally diverse interaction. Currently, in the United States, 244 Medical Laboratory Science programs are training laboratory medicine professionals but the level of diversity in these programs remains enigmatic. In this study, we determined the student and faculty diversity in the Clinical Laboratory Sciences programs at Stony Brook University. We retrospectively analyzed the data over 20 years for the traditional and 8 years for the hybrid programs. Over 20 years, 502 students graduated from the traditional program, and 96 students graduated from the hybrid program. In the traditional program, an average of 25 students enrolled with 75% female and 25% male; in the hybrid program, an average of 12 students with 8.5 females and 3.5 males enrolled. The traditional program had the highest proportion of Asian students (50%), with White students making up 24.5%, whereas the highest proportions in the hybrid program were 35% White students and 24% Hispanic students. Among the 5 boroughs of New York City, the highest proportion of student representation was from Queens and Manhattan in both traditional (24.1%) and hybrid programs (16.7%). There were 30% of male and 70% of female faculty served in the traditional program (20 02-2017) whereas the current representation of full -time faculty is 100% female. Our data show the diversity of students and faculty in clinical laboratory sciences programs at Stony Brook University institution. Our study is the first to highlight the diversity in laboratory science programs over 20 years in the United States. 3.

Borrelia Burgdorferi , a spirochete transmitted via Ixodes tick, is responsible for Lyme borreliosis. An early localized inf ection appears as a conventional Erythema Migrans (EM) rash, a hallmark of the disease reported in a set of the patient population, while atypical or no rash has also been documented in cases of LD. Despite the prevalence of the disease in the United State s, a lack of knowledge on the interpretation of symptoms and the inappropriate timeline used for diagnostic testing results in misdiagnosis and adversely impacts the patient's outcome. We present a case of a 57- year-old Caucasian female, otherwise healthy individual, who visited the urgent care with fever, fatigue, and multiple atypical erythematous macules. The blood results of IgG/IgM for tick -borne disease performed within one wee k after the onset of the symptoms were negative and the patient was diagnosed with a fungal infection. However, persistent fever and fatigue resulted in repeated serological testing and the eventual diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. 4. Title: Np63 Transcription Factor a s a No vel Suppressor of Pso riasis Authors: Christopher E. Eyermann1, Renaissance Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY; 4Stony Brook email: evguenia.alexandrova@stonybrook.edu (faculty) ABSTRACT Introduction: p63 transcription factor is critical for the embryonic development of the outer skin layer, the epidermis. However, its role in the adult skin is poorly understood. Here we genetic ally ablated Np63, the main p63 isoform, in the adult epidermis in vivo and found that besides its known roles in epidermal homeostasis, stemness , and proliferation, Np63 is critical to psoriatic inflammation. Methods : A conditionally inducible LoxP -Cre were phenotype . Single sequencing (scRNA -seq) was used to reveal differentially ex pressed genes and pathways. Mouse skin and human psoria sis biopsies w ere analyzed by IHC, H&E, and immunofluorescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was Np63 binding sites. Unpaired Student's t -test was isolated primary Np63 -ablated keratinocytes revealed a broad upregulation of the inflammatory program at 1 day post -ablation: IL -1/10, IL -4/13, and IL -36 pathway s. We confirmed IL -36 protein upregulation in the ablated mouse skin, which was comparable to human psoria sis vulgaris biopsies. E pidermal stratification defects also mimicked human psoriasis, i.e., expansion of basal Krt14 into the supra -basal layers, its overlap with spinous and granular markers Krt10 and Lor icrin, and patches lost . Mechanistically, IL-18, IL-24, and genes in Np63- ablated keratinocytes, suggesting that Np63 is their negative regulator. Indeed, we found many potential p63 binding sites in the regulatory regions of these genes and confirmed their p63 binding by ChIP/qRT -PCR. Finally , we found that p63 expression is significantly reduced in human psoriatic skin, supporting its negative regulatory function there. Conclusions and clinical relevance: O ur data reveal a novel critical role of Np63 as a keratinocyte- specific suppressor of psoria sis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease driven by an interplay between the immune system and epidermis . It was recently proposed that the epidermis rather than the immune cells play the primary role in psoriasis. Our findings support this unconventional model. Modulation of the levels of p63 or its newly identified negative cytokine effectors may provide a novel path to psoriasis prevention and/or treatment.

Michelle.bloom@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presen ting author Category: Faculty I ntroduction The optimal surveillance and management strategies for breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline therapy is limited by our incomplete understanding of the role of biomarkers heralding the onset of cardiotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a temporal correlation between cardiac biomarkers and subclinical left ventricular dysfunction in breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy. Methods Thirty -one fe males between 46 -55 years old with breast cancer treated with anthracycline chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled. Cardiac biomarkers were correlated with echocardiography with speckle tracking at baseline, post -anthracycline therapy, and 6 months post -anthracycline chemotherapy. Subclinical cardiotoxicity was defined as 10% reduction in global longitudinal strain (GLS). Results There was a relative reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 10% in 5/30 (17%) and 7/27 patients post and 6 months post -anthracycline therapy, respectively. Subclinical cardiotoxicity was noted in 8/30 (27%) and 10/26 (38%) patients post -anthracycline and 6 months post - anthracycline therapy, respectively. Baseline N-terminal pro B -type natriuretic peptide p=0.019), with post ( Interim changes in ST2 and galectin -3 correlated with 6 -month change in F p=0.012 and =- 0.45; p=0.018, for ST2 and galectin- 3, respectively). Changes in galectin -3 from baseline to mid -therapy paralleled changes in GLS. Conclusions/ Clinical Relevance NT-proBNP, ST2, and galectin -3 correlate with reduced LVEF among breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline therapy. Additional trials focusing on a cardiac biomarker approach may provide guidance in the early diagnosis and management of anthracycline- induced cardiotoxicity. T his study adds to the literature on th e use of biomarkers in the prediction of cardiotoxicity among breast cancer patients receiving anthracyclines, with ST2, galectin, and NT -proBNP suggesting the most promise. Here we have utilized noninvasive testing including biomarkers and two-dimensional or three -dimensional strain imaging to assess cardiotoxicity at regular intervals. With the noninvasive nature of this testing, obtaining imaging and biomarkers at baseline and at various intervals early in cancer therapy may be of incremental benefit to these patients. Until further data suggests evidence of a more tailored approach, it is worthwhile to consider continuous monitoring of these patients pre-, during- and post anthracycline therapy Funding source : This study was supported by an investig ator-sponsored research grant from Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Title: Delirium with Psychosis in an Elderly Woman with Autoimmune Encephalitis Authors: Patrici a of Medicine; Catherine Nicastri, M D: D epartment of Medicine. Presenting A uthor: Boromee, MD, author's category: Faculty is ve ry in elderly pa tients w ith acute illne sses. Patients can display a broad array of symptoms ranging from lethargy to severe behavioral abnormality (1). Antipsychotics were used in a case of delirium that turned out to be due t o autoimmune encephalitis. Case description: An elderly female in her 80's with history of hypertension, and hypothyroidism first presented to another facility with confusion and was treate d for urinary tract infection. She returne d with fluctuating mental status. Workup was negative except for EEG showing seizure activity, and she was given 1 gram of Levetir acetam intravenously (IV). She was discharged on Valproic acid 4 days later. She presented to our facility 3 weeks later with visual hallucinations, compulsivity, and insomnia. Her private physician h ad initiated a workup for mild cognitive impa irment. H er exam w as nor mal ex cept that she could not do serial sevens. Repeated workup was normal. Neurology suggested a 5-day course of 1 gram IV methylprednisolone daily, with no improvement. Psychiatry recommended antipsychotics with no response. She developed akathisia with Haloperidol and was given Benztropine. Later, she was given 5 days of IV immunoglobulin, her symptoms improved, and she was presumed to have autoimmune encephalitis. Her antipsychotic regimen was tapered off before discharge. Discussion /Con clusion: Acute illne ss in a n older individual with c ognitive impa irment is a pr edisposing factor for delirium. The etiology is not always obvious. Risk mitigation and prompt treatment therefore rely on a sophisticated strategy to address the contributing factors (1). A systematic review of 26 randomized controlled trials and observational studies, evaluating 5607 adult inpatients with delirium, does not support routine use of Haloperidol or second-generation anti- psychotics f or treating delirium in dult inpa tients (2). This case illustrates how polypharmacy can occur , and adversely affect outcome. Refraining from initiating medications for which there is a lack of clear indication for their use, may be an easier task than deprescribing. References: 1. Meli ssa LP Matisson, MD: Oct 2.

Title: Post Discharge Follow-up Call Found to Decrease 30-Day Pneumonia Readmission Rate. Authors: Patricia Boromee, MD: Department of medicine Valjan, DNP: Department of Medicine; Suzanne Fields, MD: Department of Medicine Presenting A uthor: Patricia Boromee, MD, patricia.boromee@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author's category: Faculty Introduction : The prospect of reducing hospital readmissions is of increasing interest to researchers and policy makers because of its potential to improve the quality o f care and lower h ealth car e cost ( 2). We formed a pneumonia task force with the goal of preventing avoidable hospital readmissions and improving the quality of care provided to patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Analysis of a scripted phone call highlights need for improvement in post discharge phone conversation. Methods: Chart review of readmitted patients revealed opportunities for improvement. Monthly meetings occurred to discuss the data and brain-storm ways workflow and processes of care could be refined, to assure compliance with evi dence-base d guidelines and to effect smooth transitions. Data highlighting oppor tunities for improvement led to the development of an inpatient pneumonia power plan, the use of the Pneumonia Severity Index, the creation of a pneumonia discharge checklist, and the development of a pneumonia discharge patient education tool. We analyze a timely follow-up phone call within 24-48 hours on discharged pneumonia patients with a scripted template. Results: 2021 second quarter had 31 pneumonia discharges; 28 of them (90%) were called. None of 7 patients who received a scripted call was readmitted; 3 of the 24 patients (12.5 %) who received non- scripted call were readmitted. Third quarter had 30 pneumonia discharg es; 28 (93%) were called. None of the 10 who receive d a scripted call was readmitted; 3 of the 20 (15%) who received non- scripted call were r eadmitted. Fourth quarter had 29; 23 (79%) were called. None of the 15 patients who receive d a scripte d call was readmitted; 1 of the 14 (7%) who receive d a non-scripted c all was r eadmitted. Scripted cal ls were associated w ith a 0% readmission rate and non-scripted calls w ere associated w ith 7-15% readmission rate. Conclusion: The use of a 24-48-hour post discharge scripted phone call provides a structured method for the nurse to assess a patient's health status and to ensure hospital follow-up visit, leading to a reduction in readmission rates in the sample studied.

Title: A Rar e Case of Recurrent Rev ersible Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) Causin g Severe Anxiety Author: Patricia Boromee, M D Department of medicine, Hospitalist Division Presenting A uthor: Patricia Boromee, MD, patricia.boromee@stonybrookmedicine.edu Presenting author's category: Faculty Introduction: When patients present with severe thunderclap headache (HA), life threatening etiology such as Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA) must be ruled out. RCVS, a condition that rarely reoccurs, can be a possibi lity. T his rare recurrent R CVS cas e led t o severe anxiety i n our patient. Case presentation: A female w ith history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, c oronary artery di sease v isited a n emergency room (ER) with thunderclap HA but was discharge d home after negative workup. Three days later she visited another facility for non-resolution of HA, she was sent to our facility, and workup including Cat Scan (CT) of the head was negative. She then, had a generalized seizure, and was given 1 mg of Lorazepam and 1500 m g of intravenous (IV) Levetiracetam. S he was adm itted unde r neurology af ter cerebral an giogram showed evidence of RCVS of bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). She was placed on nimodipine, a calcium channel bl ocker used t o treat R CVS. R epeated br ain magnetic resonanc e angiography s howed resolution of stenosis. She was then discharged home. Nine months later, she was again transferred to us with 7 days of debilitating HA. Her exam and blood work were normal. C erebral an giogram redemonstrated right MCA stenosis. She was placed on nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours with resolution of HA. However, she developed anxiety and panic attacks requiring continued psychologic counseling after realizing that she belongs to the 5% of patients who suffer from recurrent RCVS. Discussion /Conclusion: RCVS comprise a group of diverse conditions, all characterized by reversible multifocal narrowing of the cerebral arteries, heralded by sudden onset (thunderclap), severe HAs with or without associated neurologic deficits (1). This condition is severe and ca n be a source of significant distress for patients and providers. Sequelae of RCVS include ischemic or hemorrhagic CVAs. RCVS has been reported in people aged 10 to 76 years, but occurrence peaks at around 42 years and the syndrome is more common in women than men (2). This case highlights that we need to think outside the box when evaluating any medical condition. W e should keep in mind that the geriatric popul ation is not spared from RCVS.

On day 1 of his illness, he became lethargic and was sent to the hospital. Four days prior, he had been documented with moisture associated skin dama ge in the nursing home (NH). In the emergency room (ER) WBCs were 20.02/ mm3 (4.8- 10.8), creatinine was 2.87 ng/dL (0.5-1.2) from baseline, 1.4. E R physician note d a \"stage 4 s acral pr essure injury\" . On day 3, wound care nurse found an unstageable 7 cm x 7 cm, sacral wound, butterfly shape, wit h moist black and yellow necrotic tissue, with serosanguinous exudate, malodorous with purple discoloration proximally, with peri-wound general surgery sharp excisional debridement, a nd electrocautery. Post pr ocedure a \"stage 2 p ressure injury\". Methods: A thorough chart review was performed at the NH and the hospital. Braden scale was used to estimate pa tient's r isk. A Fish di agram was ma de with the patient's r isk factors. This le d to identification of need for process improvement via educating staff to ut ilize a c ommon SBAR c ommunication tool. Results: There were significant discrepancies in the documentation by the ER provider, the wound care nurse and in the surgical post debridement note. The SBAR from the NH was incomplete. Downstaging of the pressure injury , a practice not endorsed, was noted post debridement. Patient had an estimate d Braden score of 10, denoting high risk for pressure injury. Discussion/ Conclusion: This case analysis encompassed t he Braden S cale and led to standardized i n-service training for NH staff r egarding impor tance of SBAR. A s kin int egrity l ecture s eries f or staff at the NH and daily wound care rounds occurred. Medical residents doing geriatric rotation at this NH are actively involved in wound rounds. This pr actice flags pa tients acr oss di sciplines and helps to addr ess e arly i ntervention for securement of specialty beds, moisture barriers for incontinence, etc. References: 1.

If additional aerosol therapies such as bronchodilators or antibiotics are needed, vasodilator therapy may be interrupted. This study assesses aerosol systems designed for simultaneous delivery of two aerosols using continuous nebulization and bolus injection without interruption or circuit disconnection. METHODS: One i-AIRE dual- port breath- enhanced jet two Aerogen\u00ae Solo vibrating mesh nebulizers (VMN) were installed on the dry side of the humidifier. VMN were stacked; one for infusion, the second for bolus drug delivery. The BEJN was powered by air at 3.5 L/min, 50 psig. Radiolabeled saline was infused at 5 & 10 mL/h with radiolabeled 3 mL and 6 mL bolus injections at 30 and 120 min respectively. Two adult breathing patterns (duty cycle 0.13 and 0.34) were tested with an infusion time of 4 h. Inhaled Mass expressed as % of initial syringe activity (IM%/min) was monitored in real time with a ratemeter. All delivered radioaerosol was collected on a filter at the airway opening. Transients in aerosol delivery were measured by calibrated ratemeter. RESULTS: IM %/h during continuous infusion was linear and mean \u00b1 SD: 2.12 \u00b11.45%, 2.47 \u00b10.863% functioned without incident. VMN continuous aerosol delivery stopped spontaneously in 3 of 8 runs (38%); bolus delivery stopped spontaneously in 3of 16 runs (19%). Tapping restarted VMN function during continuous and bolus continuous and bolus nebulization without circuit disconnection is possible for both jet and mesh technology. Monitoring of VMN devices may be necessary in case of spontaneous interruption of nebulization.

Title: The Stony Brook Medical Center Experience with the \"Game C hanging Drug,\" Cenobamate, for Patients with Focal Drug Resistant Ep ilepsy Authors: Hanna h D. Kravets (1) Yana Krutoshinskaya (2) Department of Neurology Stony Brook University Medical Center: (1) High School Student (2) Faculty Abstract It is estimated that about 30% of patients with epilepsy have a drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). It is defined by the international league against epilepsy (ILAE) as failure of adequate trials of 2 toler ated, appropriately chosen and used anti-seizure medications (ASM) to achieve sustained seizure freedom. The odds of seizure freedom with an addition of another ASM, in this patient population was reported as 24% with 3rd ASM and 14% with a 6th. (1) The ILAE encourages surgical evaluation after a failure of a second ASM. This abstract represents a quality assurance project to assess if CNB should be tried at our center before surgical evaluation in our DRE patients with focal epilepsy. We conducted a retros pective chart review on our patients, 18 or older, with focal DRE. The patient's average seizure frequency was compared to 3 months before the initiation of CNB to at least 3 months after a \"final dosage\" was established (follow up ranged from 3 to 28 months). CNB was the last ASM added. Patients who discontinued CNB due to side effects, were taken out of the final analysis (6 patients), as well as 3 patient who were just started on the titration regimen. In total we had 16 patients who met the inclusion criteria. In total there were 16 patients who met the inclusion criteria thus far, 5 men and 11 women. The age range was 25 to 69 years. 7/16 patients (43%) were seizure free for a period of at least 3 months. The average reported seizure reduction was 70% (ranging from no change in seizure frequency in 3/16, and 7/16 with seizure freedom). The men had a 93% seizure reduction while the women had a 59.6% seizure reduction. Of note, of the 3 oldest women in the group (59-69 age range) 2 had no change in the seizure frequency and one had only 30% seizure frequency reduction. Our center's experience, thus far, supports the existing literature that CNB is superior to other ASMs in leading to a significant reduction of seizures in patients with focal DRE. We suspect that our center's higher percentage of seizure freedom, than the one reported in the literature (an estimated 28% seizure freedom) and the total reduction in seizures (an estimated total of 55.6% in the literature) is due to our small number of patients . (2) It is also important to highlight that 5/7 of the patients who became seizure free were on dosages of less than 200mg (ranged from 100mg to 150mg). It is interesting that three oldest women in our group (59 to 69yr), either did not have a seizure frequency reduction, or a relatively low reduction. On the other hand, it was encouraging that 2 patients with failed resective surgery became seizure free on CNB. More research is needed to determine, the types of patients that may benefit most from CNB. The results lend support to consider CNB in patients with focal DRE before surgical evaluation. The study also lends support that dosages less than 200mg can lead to seizure freedom. 12. Title: Child bearing Practices Among Pediatric Critical Care Medicine Physicians Authors: Amarilis A.

In particular, many choose to delay having children while putting their career first . The consequences of delaying childbearing include infertility and higher risk pregnancies in those with advanced maternal age. Pediatric critical care medicine (PCCM) can be rewarding but can also be very demanding with the care for unstable critically ill children , the need for end -of-life discussions with caregivers , its long work hours, multiple alternating night and day shifts, 24- hour calls, and non- clinical work duties. Nevertheless, little is known of the effect, if any, that a PCCM career exerts on parenthood. Th is study aimed to elucidate childbearing decisions among practicing PCCM physicians and assess whether those decisions differed throughout time. M ethods: After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, a REDCap survey was posted on the Facebook Pediatric Critical (Intensive) Care group and the Facebook PICU Women Physicians Group between March and April, 2022. The survey was followed by a phone interview of participants who were willing to be contacted for more information about their childbearing practices. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics , fisher exact tes t for categorical data comparisons , and thematic analysis for qualitative data for which t hemes and ideas were summarized. R esults: Most PCCM faculty had their first child as a facu lty (52.3 %) or fellow (2 5.5%), and the time when they had had their first child was similar regardless of when they underwent PCCM fellowship training ( P = .47). Those who underwent PCCM training in previous eras had higher childbearing rates , except for those who trai ned in the 1990s who had the highest rates of having no children ( P < .001 ). Most (78.6%) PCCM trainees wish ing to have children planned to have a child as faculty. The most common factor influenc ing childbearing decisions among PCCM physicians w as their career , in particular their desire to finish training, career advancement goals as faculty, and long work hours. Other factors included their age , finances , and marriage time. C onclusion: Most pediatric intensivists begin having children as a PCCM faculty or fellow. This has not changed significantl y over time. The major factor for delaying childbearing is their career. Further studies are needed to assess whether childbearing while practicing PCCM , with its particular work and career demands, has an impact on the physician's health , wellbeing, career, and work performance.

Title: Severe Methotrexate Toxicity in a 16-y ear-old of Pediatrics, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, New York P resenting Author : Nicole Muhlbauer, MD, Nicole.muhlbauer@stonybrookmedicine.edu Category: Faculty Introduction: Although genetic evaluation in patients with a pediatric malignancy is not typically completed prior to initiation of therapy, an unanticipated chemotherapy toxicity often prompts further investigation. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is characterized by defects in the DNA damage response pathway and the i nability to maintain genomic stability. Aberrations in FA proteins results in a heterogenous spectrum of clinical syndromes including congenital anomalies, bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. 1 In this case, we report a patient with monoallelic FANCM mutations who experienced life -threatening methotrexate toxicity resulting in permanent end -organ damage. Case: A previously healthy 16- year-old boy of Hispanic descent presented with fatigue, weight loss, and epistaxis. The patient was diagnosed high risk pre -B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia with central nervous system involvement. He initiated interim maintenance therapy which included vincristine, mercaptopurine, intrathecal methotrexate, and intravenous high- dose methotrexate (5 gm/m 2 over 24 hours). During the methotrexate infusion the patient experienced nausea, emesis and diarrhea. At completion of the 24 hour infusion, his serum creatinine increased more than six -times his baseline level and measured 3.15 mg/dL; the methotrexate level measured 564.00 mol/L; the expected level at 24 hours is <150 mol/L. In addition to hyperhydration with alkalinized fluids and high- dose leucovorin, dialysis was initiated and the patient received glucarpidase within twenty -four hours. Within two days of the initial toxicity, he developed severe mucositis of his entire gastrointestinal tract requiring a patient- controlled analgesia pump for pain control. Additionally, he experienced an acute liver injury with a transaminitis, a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and coagulopathy. Five days following the initial toxicity, he had an episode of hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Following the arrest, brain imaging was consistent with methotrexate induced - leukoencephalopathy and hypoxic brain injury. A genomic evaluation was performed to identify an underlying cause for the significant methotrexate toxicity. Whole exome sequencing detected two monoallelic FANCM mutations inherited from the patient's mother. The L211Yfs*2 variant is a truncating lesion resulting in loss of function and is identified as a likely pathogenic variant. The p. A122V variant mutation has not been described as pathogenic to date. Conclusion Here we report a case of childhood pre -B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia with two monoallelic mutations in FANCM that experienced severe methotrexate toxicity resulting in hematologic, nephrotic, hepatic, and neurologic damage. This serves to support the need for extended genomic profiling of pediatric patients who experience unexpected toxicity to chemotherapy, despite any preceding clinical stigmata that would be suggestive of FA.

Title: WeStep: An Individualized Neurorehabilitation Gait System using Music and AI Authors: Margaret S chede l1, Shubham CAS; 2Department of Computer S cience, C EAS; 3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , CEAS; 4Department of Physical T herapy, S HP Presenting author : Lisa Muratori, lisa.muratori@stonybrook.edu Presenting author' Category: Faculty Introduction : Gait impairment is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). The general hypothesis underlying the motor deficits in PD is that there is an overactive indirect basal ganglia pathway, resulting in nearly constant thalamic inhibition, and the inability to select and execute a desired motor plan. A potential therapeutic approach is to tap into the ability of music to stimulate rhythmical movement. Music -based rehabilitation has been guided by the finding that the majority of the brain regions and networks activated by listening to music are not exclusive to music listening, but also process language, auditory perception, elements of cognition, and/or motor control. Entrainment is thought to result from direct and dynamic neuronal coupling between the auditory and motor systems. This wealth of musically -delivered motor guidance may function to mitigate hypokinetic tendencies and improve other components of rhythmic gait . Methods : We are investigating the use of music in a unique therapeutic intervention aimed at improving gait in individuals with PD : Wearable Sonification Therapy Equipment for Parkinson's (WeSTEP) . WeSTEP uses two innovative approaches: the use of error signals (rather than correct movement cueing) and a multivariate, gait - sonification algorithm that can provide r eal-time auditory feedback. Using our WeSTEP system, we are creating an individualized model for each person with PD based on their own target optimal walking pattern . From acquired body- worn sensor data, the applied machine learning method learns the parameters of the individualized model used for detecting distortions in gait. The learning amounts to optimizing the parameters of the model with respect to an adopted cost function. Results : We compare models generated from traditional LSTM and transformer -based models as transformers are considered the current state-of-the- art for sequential data. Using low-profile sensors sending feedback to the user through a smartphone , we distort music as the individual deviates from their target gait. The negative biofeedback is used as a training tool to improve walking with the resulting distortions reflect ing both temporal (velocity, double support time) and spatial (stride length or symmetry) components of gait. This novel form of rehabilitation training allows the user to discover how to modify their gait through a largely implicit process of motor adaptatio n, using auditory error signals delivered through music on their own phones to drive trial- and-error learning . Conclusion: The WeSTEP has the potential to produce large changes in gait coordination and rhythmicity in people , across a wide range of cogniti ve abilities, without requiring a diversion of attentional resources.

Title: Mental Health Service D emand in Stony Brook's Outpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Division Through the Covid-19 Pandemic Authors : Allison Department Psychiatry an d Behavioral H ealth Division: C hild and A dolescent emergence of he Covid- 19 pandemic presented challenges and oppor tunities for mental healthcare services and interventions, and according to research significantly impacted the mental health of the child and adolescent population. Multiple stressors experienced by children and adolescents during the pandemic, including social isolation (Fong & Iarocci, 2020) , loneliness, l ack o f physical ex ercise, f amily stress a nd wellness (Gassman- Pines et al, 2020), a nd an overall feeling of being unsafe have been not ed as significantly increasing the risk for mental health problems of anxiety and depression (Racine et al, 2020) . Increased access to mental health s ervices ha s been imperative to meet this increased demand for services. At the Stony Brook Outpatient Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, a 177% increase in de mand f or services (based on number of ne w patient visits) was seen from fiscal year 2018/ 2019 to 2021/2022. The current s tudy explored the perceived i mpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment seeking behaviors. Methods: As part of routine clinical operations, caregivers completed intake questionnaires via a HIPPA - compliant online survey platform prior to the scheduled intake evaluation appointment. The intake packet included questions regarding the main reasons for wanting help for their child, as well as demographics , and symptom questionnaires including the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL, Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). CBCL data is cur rently available after December 2021. Qualitative coding w as used to identify themes for presenting concerns and reasons for seeking diagnostic evaluation or therapeutic treatment. Descriptive statistics and regression were used f or analysis. Results: Caregivers of 2,209 children (Mean age = 12.14 years, SD = 3.6) seeking m ental he alth c are services between October 2020 and October 2023 completed the online intake questionnaires. Preliminary coding indicated tha t 9% of caregivers identified the COVID -19 pandemic or virtual learning as a part of the reason for seeki ng mental health e valuation or treatment for their c hild. The mention of the COVID -19 pandemic or virtual learning w as pos itively as sociated w ith chi ld age and parental education ( p-values < .001) but was not significantly a ssociated with time . Caregivers with a COVID/remote learning presenting con cerns also r ated t heir children as having significantly higher anxious, depressed, and somatic symptoms and lower rule breaking behavior on the CBCL than those who did not ( p-value s <.05). Conclusions/clinical r elevance: The C OVID -19 pandemic continues to be perceived b y caregivers as impact ing child a nd adolescent mental health. Internalizing symptoms in p articular may have been exacerbated b y pandemic- related factors and sequalae. Funding Source: N/A CORIHS approval : IRB 2022- 00352 Title: Importance of ALK gene sequencing in pediatric anaplastic large cell ly mphoma Authors : Michelle Nash, MD Rina Meyer, MD Nicole Muhlbauer MD, MPH Devina Prakash, MD Laura Hogan, MD Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Presenting Author: Michelle Nash, MD ; michelle.nash@stonybrookmedicine.edu, Faculty Introduction Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements are commonly found in pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). ALK gene rearrangements encode constitutively activated ALK fusion proteins that regulate downstream pathways involved in cell growth, survival, and cell -cycle control. At diagnosis the distinction between ALK positive and ALK negative ALCL is typically made through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in s itu hybridization (FISH) looking for classical rearrangements, most commonly with NPM1 . ALK inhibition is a therapeutic strategy currently being explored in pediatric ALCL. However, IHC and FISH alone do not predict sensitivity to specific ALK inhibitors. Methods Case report Results A previously healthy 12 year-old boy presented with fevers, pleural and pericardial effusions, lung nodules and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Cervical lymph node biopsy demonstrated ALCL, ALK + (via IHC and FISH showed t(2;5) confirming an NPM1 -ALK fusion protein). He achieved complete remission after 2 cycle he relapsed and started monotherap y with crizotinib, a first generation ALK inhibitor. He had progressive disease after 3 weeks and was changed to combination chemotherapy with brentuximab and nivolumab with the addition of alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor. He again had progres sive disease within 3 weeks and received therapy with ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide with a mixed response. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was done at time of second relapse and demonstrated the already known NPM1 -ALK fusion, but also found an ALK I1171T mutation. NGS was not done at diagnosis so it is unknown if this mutation was present at diagnosis or an acquired mechanism of resistance. Based on preclinical studies and limited clinical studies demonstrating that ALKI1171T mutations are resistant to crizotinib and alectinib but may maintain sensitivity to ceritinib, the patient started ceritinib in combination with brentuximab. Within 4 weeks of starting ceritinib he achieved a complete response that was sustained long enough to get him to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Conclusion Testing for the presence of ALK rearrangements via IHC is standard in pediatric ALCL but cannot solely predict sensitivity to specific inhibitors. Consideration should be made for upfront ALK gene sequencing as this may drive therapeutic decisions regarding which inhibitor is most likely to result in a clinical response.

Title: Does the presence of peripher al eosinophilia in pediatric in flammatory bowel disease correlate with disease activity? Authors : Sean O'Connor MD1, Sameer Imdad M D2 Hector Alcala P hD MPH3, and Lesley S mall-Harary M D2 1 Stony Brook University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics 2 Stony Brook University Hospital, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology 3 Stony Brook University Hospital, Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine Presenting au thor: Lesley Small-Harary Email: Lesley.small-harary@stonybrookmedicine.edu Category: F aculty No funding or financial disclosures Background Inflammatory bow el disease (IBD) , characterized b y chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, af fects over 2 million Americans, including 80,000- 100,000 children. The pathogenesis of IBD remains an area of ongoing study and involves a complex interplay of genetics, environment, microbiota and immune response. Eosinophils are a rich source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and have been known to play a role in disease progressi on. There has b een an interest i n the rol e peripheral blood eosinophilia (PBE) may have in IBD flares . In children, PBE at diagnosis has been positively correlated with a more severe disease phenotype. Our study aims to determine if thi s association between P BE and increased di sease activity exists a t other p oints in time throughout the disease course in patients with I BD on i nfliximab or a biosimilar . Objective To determine if pediatric inf lammatory b owel disease pa tients receiving infliximab or biosimilar with increased di sease activity have increased peripheral blood eosinophilia. M ethods Pediatr ic IBD or the ir infliximab/biosimilar infusions were recruited to participate in the study. D isease activity w as as sessed us ing the Pediatric U lcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI ) or the Pediatric Crohn's D isease Activity Index (PCDAI) scoring systems . Routine bloodwor k was obtained prior to each infusion and was used to assess for the presence or absence of peripheral blood eosinophili a. Results There were 48 subjects prospectively recruited to pa rticipate in this study. S ubject s were separated into two groups, those whose disease was in remission and those with active disease based on PCDAI/PUCAI scores . We found that 30 patients were in r emission while 18 patients had clinically active disease. There w as no statistical ly signif icant difference between the two groups in terms of peripheral blood eosinophilia as defined by % eosinophilia > 3. In fact, a lthough not statistically s ignificant, a higher percentage of patients in remission had peripheral blood eosinophilia. Discussion /Conclusion This study demonstrated s imilar r ates of PBE in pa tients w ith active IBD c ompared to p atients w ith IBD in clinical remission based on PCDAI and PUCAI scores. One possible explanation for the lack of difference seen betwee n groups may be that by using patients on i nfliximab/biosimilar , we select ed patients that were well know n to our practice and relatively w ell controlled on biologic therapy . Another explanation could be that elevated di sease s cores m ay not be directly cor related w ith m ore active disease and may be secondary to functional GI symptoms. References 1.

A dvanced t umor growth and m etastasis r emain t he major reason that renders many patients as poor candidates f or surgical i ntervent ion. The mineral dust-induced gene mdig is an environmental regulated gene found to be overexpressed in many human cancers . In breast cancer, high expression of mdig is associated with poor overall survival (OS) of the patients but is favorable for better OS with lymph node metastasis. Methods W e employed CRISPR Cas 9 gene editing approach to knock out mdig in triple negative breast can cer (TNBC), M DA-MB-231 cells. Wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) cells w ere subjected t o global ChIP sequencing , single cell R NA s equencing a nd quantitative proteomic s for further analysis. NSG mouse model of orthotopic xenograft of the MDA-MB-231 cells w ere established for bioluminescent imaging of the mice. Immunohistochemistry and publ icly av ailable da ta mining tools w ere ut ilized. Result s Loss of mdig is a common feature in a ggressive breast can cers. W e provide evidence showing diminished expression of mdig in human TNBC. Mdig promoted the growth of primary tumors in mic e but inhibit ed the metastasis of these cells in vivo. Knockout of mdig resulted in an enhancement of H3K36me3 in the genome and upregulation of some X chromosome -linked genes for cell motility, invasion, and metastasis . Silencing MAGED2, one of the most upregulate d and H3K36me3- enriched g enes r esulted f rom mdig depletion, can pa rtially r everse the invasive migration of mdig knockout cells. The anti-metastatic a nd inhibitory r ole o f mdig on H3K36me3 is an important finding, where our data suggest that mdig is antagonist against H3K36me3 that enforces expression of genes, suc h as MAGED2, for cell invasion and metastasis. Conclusion Our studies suggest the different roles of mdig played during the earlier and later phases of tumorigenesis. Through its a ntagonistic pr operties on the trimethylation markers, including H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me3, mdig promotes the expression of oncogenes such as c- Myc, EGFR to promote tumor initiation and growth in the early phase of tumorigenesis . When tumors are well-developed in the later phase, loss of mdig will result in an elevation of H3K36me3 that mostly promotes the transcription and expression of genes contributing to EMT, invasive migration, and metastasis of the cancer cells. This study unraveled n ew mechanistic insights f or metastasis or chestrated b y mdig that can s erve as pot ential biom arkers with s ignificance in br east canc er therapies.

Title: Minimal Residual Disease in Hematologic Malignancies: A Scoping Review Authors : Anthony Huang, MS, MLS(ASCP) and Gloria Viboud, PhD, SM(ASCP) MB Department : Clinical laboratory S ciences, Medical Molecular Biology p rogram, S chool of Health Professions Presenting au thor: Gloria faculty, email gloria.viboud@stonybrook.edu Abstract Introduction . Hematologic malignancies ( HMs) ar e a heterogeneous group of cancers characterized b y neopl astic c ells originating from the blood or lymphatic s ystem. T reatment of HMs is not always c ompletely effective, leaving a small population of residual malignant cells in the patient's body. This phenomenon is termed minimal residual disease ( MRD) and is important to be detected and quantified to inform subsequent clinical treatment. The way MRD is defined and detected in different HMs vary significantly , as different genes, markers, and limits of detections are used for each one. Most published papers describing MRD do so in the context of one disorder or one methodology at a time. This study aims to provide a comprehensive and updated review of these studies and describe how MRD is defined and detected in all applicable hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloma (MM) , and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Different methodologies are currently us ed to de tect MRD for each malignancy , including multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and next generation sequencing (NGS). Which methodology has the highest sensitivity h as always been a point of intense debate. This stud y review s the use of ea ch m ethodology and their respective limits of detection to detect MRD in HM. Methods . A scoping r eview w as performed on p ublished m edical l iterature, us ing s tudies de scribi ng at least one of the previously mentioned methodologies and its limit of detecti on, in the context of detecting MRD of at least one of the hematologic malignancies. Exclusion criteria: studies published before 2015 and those without written in a language ot her than English. Results . A tot al of 240 articles ga thered b y the literature search were s creen ed, and 118 studies remained to be thoroughly reviewed. The limit of detection to assess MRD for each methodology and malignancy was compiled. What m arkers ar e used t o track cl onal t umor c ells or where the future of MRD de tection is heading was also summarized. Conclusions . When comparing the three methodologies, it was determined that NGS, the newest methodology used for MRD detection, is generally more sensitive than MFC and PCR. However, it is the most expensive and time-consuming method. Less commonly used methodologies could be further researched and standardized to elucidate M RD in a patient.

Title: Providing Molecular Diagnostics Training to Strengthen Health Systems in Resource Limited Countries Authors: Gloria Viboud, University Stony Brook, New York \u00b2Roche Romania, Diagnostics Division, Bucharest Presenting author: Gloria Viboud, faculty, email gloria.viboud@stonybrook.edu ABSTRACT Objectives : Advances in molecular diagnostics are expected to contribute significantly to improving the health of people worldwide. However, incorporation of these technologies in less developed countries remains a challenge. Despite Romania's recent economic growth, the country is in dire need for medical and laboratory staff trained in modern technologies. The aim of the study was to develop a curriculum easily deliverable to health care professionals in Romania, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the training in i ncreasing their understanding of molecular tests. Methods : The program was developed in accordance with the CDC's quality training standards. It was offered to 50 healthcare professionals and it consisted of online asynchronous lectures and optional synchr onous review sessions. Training effectiveness was evaluated following CDC guidelines based on pre - and post -assessments answered anonymously. Results : 81% of the participants completed the training successfully. Based on the learner's self -assessment, the course was successful in improving the overall knowledge of molecular diagnostics, specifically to understand molecular techniques and interpret results. Conclusions : There was a very high participant satisfaction with the overall training. This study can serve as a model to be used in other less developed countries willing to incorporate molecular diagnostics to their clinical labs.
