But there's another deadline looming: There are only three weeks left to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA for 1998. This site, by Brentmark Software Inc., a developer of financial-planning programs, may not have any snazzy fonts or cool graphics, but it pulls together more Roth information than most consumers will ever need. It lays out who is eligible for the Roth, its specific tax benefits (you pay the taxes up front, not when you take the money out) and reviews various Roth calculators available on the Web. Those looking for a basic primer will find \"The Roth IRA: A Detailed Overview\" and the \"Top Ten Roth IRA Myths\" sections helpful. The site spells out important changes in the Roth IRA, such as a new restriction on the number of conversions allowed. But some of the information can get pretty dense, like the Congressional documents and IRS notices. If you get really lost, there is a message board where you can pose questions to financial planners. Copyright \u00a92023 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
