Dr. Emily grew up in the woods of Northern Minnesota and was always interested in how nature influences our well-being. From a young age, she knew that she wanted to be a doctor to care for children and teach them the importance of good health habits and the healing power of nature. She knew that the current medical model did not fit her values. She wanted to have time during an office visit to get to know her patients. A public health-study-abroad experience to South Africa exposed her to traditional healers who emphasized that the physical, mental and emotional aspects of a person's health need to be addressed in order to achieve true health. This was exactly the type of doctor she wanted to become. Dr. Emily graduated from [Bastyr University](http://www.bastyr.edu) in Seattle, Washington and is one of the few naturopathic doctors to complete a three-year family medicine residency at Bastyr Center for Natural Health. Her current practice focuses on pediatric care, natural fertility, and postpartum care. appointments Dr. Emily sees patients out of [Neighborhood Naturopathic](https://www.neighborhood-naturopathic.com), Please click the button above to schedule online, if problems email hello@neighborhood-naturopathic.com or call (206)486-8383 to schedule.
