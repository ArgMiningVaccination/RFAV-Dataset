By Graham Osborne Concern about side effects from prescription drugs is helping to drive growth in Australia's complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) industry, healthcare experts claim. It is said about 140,000 Australians are admitted to hospital every year because of problems associated with the use of medicines. A report by the Australian National Audit Office has identified patient anxiety about ''adverse effects from conventional drugs'' as a major factor in the growth of complementary medicine - also known as traditional or alternative medicine. Australia's CAM industry is now worth $4 billion annually, part of an estimated $88.5 billion annual global market that represents ''a paradigm shift in medicine occurring right across the Western world'', according to market research company IBISWorld. Two-thirds of Australians now use complementary medicines, including vitamins, minerals, herbal, aromatherapy and homeopathic products, and three-quarters of a million people see a complementary therapist each year. ''People are certainly frustrated with the medical model,'' says University of Technology Sydney Faculty of Health researcher Dr Jon Wardle, a founding director of NORPHCAM - the Network of Researchers in the Public Health of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. ''CAM now comprises about half of the entire healthcare sector in Australia and many patients have embraced what they see as a more 'natural' approach, after being left dissatisfied at the end of treatment journeys with conventional medicine,'' Wardle says. Some of the most popular CAM courses available at universities, TAFE and private colleges include naturopathy - a holistic practice that uses herbal medicine, diet and nutrition to help the body heal itself; dietitian/nutritionist - disciplines that examine how food and nutrition can be used to treat health problems; osteopathy - which focuses on how the skeleton, joints, muscles, nerves and circulation work together to improve health; acupuncture - an ancient Chinese practice where needles are inserted into the skin to stimulate parts of the body; herbal medicine - which uses herbal remedies, including vitamins and minerals, to promote health; massage - including Western and Chinese therapeutic massage; chiropractic - which uses spinal manipulation and other measures to treat skeletal and muscular problems; traditional Chinese medicine - including acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine; and reflexology - massage of the feet, hands or ears to promote healing in other areas of the body. Employment prospects for CAM professionals are tipped to grow ''very strongly'' in the period to 2017, according to the federal employment initiative Job Outlook. The promising employment forecast is backed by statistics, showing that the number of people who visited an osteopath jumped by 48 er cent from 2010 to 2012 - thus making it the fastest growing health occupation in Australia. There are about 25,000 accredited CAM practitioners in Australia, says health researcher Dr Sandra Grace, Senior Lecturer in Osteopathic Medicine at Southern Cross University, Lismore. Three CAM professions are nationally registered - chiropractic, osteopathy and Chinese medicine - while various professional associations accredit the others. Dr Grace says the number of people who regularly use CAM therapies has continued to increase since the expansion of accredited CAM training in the 1980s. Nutritional medicine student Daen Heuston says his natural health education began when he was eight and his father banned Coco-Pops from the house. ''Dad made his own muesli and vegetable juices and was a firm believer in knowing exactly what was in the foods we ate,'' he says. Heuston spent eight years ''stuck in a rut'' working at a Sydney casino, before travelling to London and catching the British TV show Supersize versus Superskinny. It echoed his father's food-as-medicine approach. Back in Sydney he enrolled at the Endeavour College of Natural Health in George Street, where he's now in the third and final year of a degree in nutritional medicine. Total tuition fees for the course are about $35,000. Nutritional medicine is a naturopathic modality that considers food and nutrients in relation to health and disease, examining the quality of food that is harvested, its preparation and the balance of macro and micronutrients. ''Endeavour is a great place to learn and the lecturers are so passionate about natural health, which really makes a difference,'' Heuston says. ''I've also enjoyed the student clinic, which gives senior students the chance to treat the public, under the supervision of qualified practitioners.'' After graduation, Heuston hopes to work in a multimodality clinic - where practitioners from orthodox and natural therapies practice under one roof. He is eager to help in the fight against Australia's obesity epidemic which he says needs to be approached holistically. Endeavour College also offers courses in naturopathy, acupuncture, massage, reflexology and homeopathy. One of Sydney's first CAM education providers, the Australasian College of Natural Therapies (ACNT), this year opened a campus in Pyrmont, which is now home to more than 800 students. ACNT, one of the largest colleges of natural medicine in the world, offers courses in naturopathy, western herbal medicine, massage therapy and nutritional medicine. Established 30 years ago, ACNT has grown from a single classroom in Bondi to training more than 2000 students each year - online and at its Sydney and Brisbane campuses. Despite its increasing public acceptance, CAM still faces overt hostility from some sectors of the medical profession. About 400 doctors and scientists recently formed a lobby group called Friends of Science in Medicine and called on Australian universities to remove ''alternative medicine'' degrees on the grounds that it is ''pseudo-science''. ''But the issue of legitimacy is moot because the public already thinks that they are legitimate, and now they need to be held to the same level of regulation as conventional therapies,'' Wardle says. ''Many GPs would love to practice as holistically as a naturopath. But they just cannot in a system that only rebates them for 15 minutes.'' Alexandra Kury says a ''strong passion'' to study nutrition led her to complete a bachelor of science degree at the University of Sydney, before beginning a masters degree this year in nutrition and dietetics. ''I have always had a love for nutrition and healthy eating, as well as a desire to help people. So this, paired with my interest in science, made me realise that nutrition and dietetics would be a perfect career path,'' Kury says. ''There are so many more people who are diagnosed with nutrition-related chronic disease, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, and scientific-based nutritional advice is needed now more than ever. ''I am learning about all aspects of human nutrition including nutritional science, clinical dietetics, research methodology, public health, community nutrition and food service management.''. Kury says it will cost her about $30,000 to complete her masters course and will allow her to join the Dietetics Association of Australia as an accredited practicing dietitian. ''To clear up any myths about dietitians, we don't eat healthy all the time,'' she says. ''Everyone in my course is a food lover and when we aren't studying food, we are talking about "}
