Methods: Data for 2,146,130 infected people were collected, including the vaccination status. COVID-19 patients were classified according to the number of the received vaccine doses: no, first, second, and third. To evaluate the short-term risk of CVDs after infection, adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multivariable logistic regression analysis after adjustments for covariates. Results: Compared non-infected people, aORs [95% CIs; p value] for CVDs within a month after infection were 2.80 [2.64-2.97; < 0.001] in overall infected people and and 2.07 [1.91-2.24; < 0.001] in those who were infected after receiving no, first, second, and third vaccine doses, respectively. Among participants who received second doses of vaccine prior to contracting COVID-19, the aOR in those vaccinated with only the mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273; Reference) was lower than those vaccinated with the virus-derived vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and AD26.COV2-S; aOR Conclusion: Although COVID-19 increased the CVD risk, the inverse association in the risk of CVDs according to vaccine doses was significant in a dose-response manner. Our findings suggest that second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine prevent the risk of CVDs after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 2,146,130 infected adults ( 20 years), the inverse association in the short-term risk of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke, according to vaccine doses received was significant in a dose-response manner.
