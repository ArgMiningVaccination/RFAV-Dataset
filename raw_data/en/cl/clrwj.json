What we are truly missing is the relationship of the \"I\" [pure immediacy] with the astral body -- or (the relationship) of the original soul -- in which we are blindly immersed, so as to use it as a body of desire, nevertheless being always overwhelmed by it. In reality, it is always -- like the \"I\" [pure immediacy] -- used by the astral body, whose real nature is divine.\" - page 84, A Practical Manual on Meditation by Massimo Scaligero translated by Eric Bisbocci \"The function of suffering is to remove the soul continually from desire. Desire appears as pain so that it cana gain become the current of the \"I\" [pure immediacy], which the \"I\" [pure immediacy] needs to operate within the depths of the soul, right down to the etheric and to the physical. Pain takes form from any event that seems to elicit. In essence, demanded from the soul's spiritual depths, makes use of that event. We must not let ourselves be deceived by the thought that, if there were not that given event, pain would not appear. Pain is what is demanded from the depths, when we are incapable of a profound movement according to consciousness, or spiritual practice, which is to say, when spiritual practice is weakened and becomes form, routine, or a habit devoid of inner life.\" - page 156, A Practical Manual of Meditation by Massimo Scaligero translated by Eric Bisbocci \"In the gradual work of purification, dissolution, and recombination of the soul forces, the pupil can go through moments of tension, of struggle, or of depression, which are really indicative of inner tasks or trials; they are foreseen moments of experience. If we do not remember the sense of such moments and do not draw from the central principle of the \"I\" [pure immediacy], whose enucleation indeed demands to be radically measured up against the forms of the \"human being,\" the situation can become severe and, if it is not adequately controlled, pathological. Overcome by such a situation, we, as pupils, have in this, a warning that there is something in our method that is wrong. We must turn back and start anew from the beginning. Our wisdom is the precisely the humility of starting again from the beginning; with this, we draw again from the true force, perhaps with an immediacy and purity, previously unknown to us.\" - pages 158-159, A Practical Manual of Meditation by Massimo Scaligero translated by Eric Bisbocci \"We do not yet know the soul, for the \"I\" [pure immediacy] has yet to penetrate it in the waking state. There is a profound area of the soul, unknown to the \"I\" [pure immediacy], because it is occupied by obstructing Entities [reflected light + darkness masquerading as light], whose activity within the soul, the soul mistakes for its own activity. The initial movement of the soul's liberation is suffering, but the obstructing Entities [reflected light + darkness masquerading as light] take possession even of this, by inserting aversion and fear into it.\" - page 160, A Practical Manual of Meditation by Massimo Scaligero translated by Eric Bisbocci \"It is a matter of working to connect the problem to the \"I\" [pure immediacy] -- namely, the chaotic movements to the [pure immediacy], the weaknesses to the soul to the \"I\" [pure immediacy]. That is to say, it is to unload everything onto the \"I\" [pure immediacy], namely, onto the principle that can truly sustain everything. The more pain it sustains, the stronger it becomes, within the soul. Here, one can comprehend the real meaning of painful trials. They are always a demand for the presence of the \"I\" [pure immediacy], namely, the stimulus by which we can observe carrying within ourselves the force that can do anything. Instead, we are obtusely led, as in ancient times, to lean upon the soul, by means of which at one time we were legitimately connected to Atman, or to the Tao, or to the Buddha. The spiritual practitioner of today must attain the sagacity to travel the path of the \"I\" [pure immediacy]. Traditional methods do not lead us to the \"I\" [pure immediacy], but to the soul and the body. They bind us evermore to our psychosomatic nature, namely, to our weakness. Only the \"I\" [pure immediacy] can descend into the soul and into the body and cognize the soul's convoluted forces, and experience them without being touched by them -- rectifying them. This descending is essentially an ascending, a perceiving of the original forces. The essence of the principle of invulnerability and of the absolute identity with the world's creative Entities -- the principle that does not know contrasts, but only unabmiguousness. The presence of the Logos [Eternity] in the \"I\" [pure immediacy] , as its innermost essence, is not only the possibility of curing any type of breakdown of the soul forces, as well as the path to the reconciliation with things, with our fellow human beings, with the world, but, above all, it is the principle of the resurrection of what is original and cosmic within the structure of the soul, by way of trials, which in reality are brief moments of death.\" - pages 162-163, A Practical Manual of Meditation by Massimo Scaligero "}
