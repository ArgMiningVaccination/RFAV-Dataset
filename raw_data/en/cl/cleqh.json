Tilda Johnson: I don't understand the decision here. I get they're trying to add some mysticism but how would a medical doctor ever think that holistic healing is the right career choice (they reference 200k in school debt)? You'd learn in med school that most of our actual medicines were initially 'plants' where we took the useful compounds and turned them into medicine. Giving any kind of credibility to holistic medicine seems irresponsible given the fact that this show does try to portray race/gender/class struggle in some ways. I have no issue with night shade as a plot point, all of these super power origins are equally unbelievable. Is there a need to package it with kind of credibility? Where we see people hawking multi level marketing (facebook, campuses, schools) herbal remedies (essentially snake oil) shouldn't good writers at least consider that this could be damaging? Maybe people won't read into it and maybe it's a minor issue, but it just nags at me. "}
