With this understanding comes the development of new and improved therapies - the ultimate goal of our researchers. Dalton partners with many units across the campus. Investigators hold primary academic appointments in one of several colleges such as the School of Medicine, the College of Veterinary Medicine, the College of Engineering, and the College of Arts and Science. The facility houses molecular biologists, cell biologists, biochemists, biological engineers, electrophysiologists and integrative physiologists. Collaboration between scientists within the center and across campus is one of the greatest strengths of Dalton's efforts.
