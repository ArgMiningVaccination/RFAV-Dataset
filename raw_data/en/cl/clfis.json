Sedona Arizona has always been a sacred place to the Native American as they considered the area to be the birthplace of their spirituality. The natives sanctified the area for special spiritual ceremonies as they experienced deep spirit here, buried beneath the red rocks, the earth emanating a sacred high vibrational energy to the air. Many of these ceremonies include the four elements that they believed to be essential to life. All things visible and invisible originate from only one source of life. Thus, the four faces of all-including unity, out of which the elements arose, enable man to develop spiritual consciousness and become aware of this unity of the elements. Fire, water, air and earth manifests as follows: the element of water has magnetic properties which is known to nurture and all us to endure. The element of fire has electrical properties which is know to all us to be creative. Air is a detaching element and allows co-existence of the two main elements, fire and water. The element of earth binds fire, water and air making it possible to create the formation of materials with different properties.
