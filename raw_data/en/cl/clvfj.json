When he is not practising law, he is teaching yoga or lending a healing touch to rid his patients of their physical afflictions. Consulting naturopath, accpressurist, yoga teacher and chiropractor are some of his many personas. This forty something resident of Shreenagar believes life is short and is driven about making every moment fruitful. Umesh B Kapoor never intended to become a doctor. With a masters degree in law, he never needed to be one. Call it tyrst with fate or his tremendous zeal, he felt a strong urge to do something to eliminate the stress factor from one\u00c2fs life. His search of well-being compelled him to do a course in yoga at the Yog Vidya Niketan, Dadar. Soon he began teaching at the same institute and during this phase he was drawn towards other alternative therapies. In a short span he learnt naturopathy and accupressure. Today, he is the secretary of the International Institute of Natural therapy and the only chiropractor in Mulund. \"Chiro\" means hand and \"practic\" means practise, he says, eloborating, \"It is an ancient treatment that can be defined as a system of therapeutics based upon the theory that any disease is caused by interference with nerve functions and body circulation\". This form of treatment is particulary useful in treating chronic disorders like cervical spondylosis, frozen shoulders, slip disc, knee/joint pains and all types of back aches. It is also useful in treating cerebral palsy, spasticity in children upto 7 years of age, loss of speech and other neuro-muskelo skeleton diseases. \"However, in the above cases results do not mean complete recovery. Depending upon the type, cause and nature of the problem it is possible to reduce further damage, there is definite improvement in the flexibility of spine, and body movements of such patients become comfortable,\" informs Dr Kapoor. Fifty year old Keneth Lester is a happy woman today. Bed-ridden for almost six months with a severe backache she was recommended emergency surgery, but thanks to chiropractic treatment, she is now able to walk upto Dr Umesh\u00c2fs clinic for her regular check-ups. B A Kothari from Zaver Road says, \"My knees were very painful but after undergoing chiro practor treatment they are not trouble some,\" he states. How does it work? The science of chiro practor gives great importance to intervertebral nerve compression and the changes relating to it. The science also believes that the nervous system is the main cause for maintaining physiological equilibrium. When the movement of spine is rigid or limited or painful, the chiropractor makes diagnosis by listing the location of misalignment, abnormalities etc. Thereafter he will give a little thrust or adjustment to relieve the patient from disorder, pain or rigidity. Role of diet Diet has a very important role in this treatment as wrong combination of food produce toxins in our system. If these toxins are not flushed out of our body, they form clots which gradually turn into osteophytes. Osteophytes block smooth flow of blood and ultimately result in severe disorders. \"Careless eating habits is indeed the root cause of all disease. I recommend garlic and cinnamon on a regular basis to all my patients,\" he discloses, and adds, \"Sometimes I face problems from the Jain community but I have managed to convince their spiritual leaders and now most of my patients recognise garlic as a form of medicine and consume it without hesitation\". His charges vary from Rs 200-300 per sitting. "}
