Yet this is really nothing but the strongly marked shadow of its real nature -- warm, luminous, and penetrating deeply into the phenomena of the world. This penetration is brought about by a power flowing through the activity of thinking itself -- the power of love in its spiritual form.\" (R.Steiner: \"The Philosophy of Freedom\") Our Table of Contents is long this issue. The \"Editor's Page\" begins by comparing the United States with George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" - with the question: when are the animals (metaphor - no insult meant) who still support the present administration going to wake up? In \"Letters\" the letters are few, but not uninteresting. Please don't hesitate to write us, even to bash. No censorship here. In \"Politics and Society\", the lead article is mostly reproduced from a \"Popular Mechanics\" investigation into the 9/11 conspiracy theories. The report decisively rebuts all the so-called conspiracy \"facts\" currently polluting the web on this question. We also reproduce the complete text of George Galloway's statement to the U.S. senate. We don't know if Galloway is on the level or not, but he sure has chutzpah. Then there's a speech by Bill Moyers in which he describes the pressures from the White House on the media, especially public radio. \"Censorship\", by the way, is our word, not his. There's been a lot of talk lately about the possible relation between vaccinations and autism. Who knows whom to believe? Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (a future presidential candidate if I ever saw one - but why hope?) has looked into the questions and is convinced that the relation is real. Don't miss it! An article about the globalization movement by Gavin Tang follows. In \"Education\", journalist Todd Oppenheimer describes his investigation into Waldorf education in the U.S. You won't be surprised to learn that his conclusions are positive. Eugene Schwartz, a long-time Waldorf educator, goes into the question of whether Waldorf schools are religious, spiritual, or not - or what. If you want to see truly objective answers, read this. A historical article on Waldorf education by Stewart Easton brings up the rear. Our old-time readers will remember the \"Children's Corner\", which disappeared a couple of years ago. It is resuscitated now, (in English and Spanish) and will continue, especially if we get some positive feedback. Rudolf Steiner's autobiography continues under \"Anthroposophy\". Interviews of the very famous and the not so famous (at least outside of Italy) are offered. An old but revealing interview by Ron Rosenbaum with Bob Dylan, and one by Gaither Stewart with Natalia Ginzburg, a very interesting Italian writer. This interview, by the way, is the title essay in Stewart's new book of essays, some of which originally appeared in SCR. It is available free of charge as an Ebook at [ On the Side of the Losers](https://southerncrossreview.org/Ebooks/ebstewart-losers.htm). \"Science and Technology\" brings us another insightful essay by Steve Talbott, this time about what he calls New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman's \"barren vision\" of India's technological development. Bradford McKee worries, and rightfully so, about today's children being alienated from nature. And Don Cruse discusses the ideas of some noteworthy personalities with Ken McClure. The \"Fiction\" section is full this time, with one of your editor's more sinful stories. The growing popularity of the tango isn't the only reason to re-publish one of Argentina's leading author's (Luisa Valenzuela) story. It's about people with a tango beat background. Our serialized fiction continues with Luise Rinser's \"Miryam\", my \"Frequent Flyer\" and the start of George Orwell's \"1984\". Some poems by Adrienne Rich grace the Table of Content's bottom line. You can find us under the Southern Cross constellation in the Traslasierra Valley, Province of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. Visitors always welcome. Just follow the sign that reads: La Cruz del Sur. See you next time.
