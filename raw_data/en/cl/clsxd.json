Part of the comprehensive assessment work is to formally identify unmet health needs in the community. Community stakeholders helpe d to prioritize the unmet needs. The prioritized needs will be a focus for strategic planning and the required implementation strategy development. We are grateful to all t he public health and community members who joined us in this important work. During 2015 members of the community were asked to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs. Researchers at the Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University analyzed the survey data. Sanford further analyzed the data, identified unmet needs, and partnered with key community stakeholders to develop a list of resources and assets that were available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritizat ion exercise was also conducted to identify the most significant health needs and to further address these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. Sanford Hillsboro will focus on strategies to address and imporve the following community health needs: Physical Health Mental Health Services The report focuses on community assets as well as community health needs. The asset map/resource list is included in this document along with the action steps that will be taken to address each identified need. At Sanford Hillsboro , patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not -for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad needs of communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work with communities, we can bring health and healing to the people who live and work across our communities. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, Jac McTa ggart Chief Executive Officer Sanford Medical Center Hillsboro 3 Sanford Hillsboro Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 Sanford Hillsboro Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital community benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment helps the community build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental chang es and community health improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retaining not -for-profit status. The purpose of this community health needs a ssessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a community benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. Study Design and Metho dology 1. Non -Generalizable Survey An on-line non-generalizable survey was conducted on -line through a partnership b etween Sanford Hillsboro, Sanford Mayville, Traill County Public Health, Steele County Public Health and the City of Halstad and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the on -line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a s nowball approach . Data collection occurred throughout the mont h of April 2015 and a total of 54 respondents participated in the on -line survey. The purpose of this non -generalizable survey of community leaders was to learn about the perceptions of area c ommunity leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders, legislators, and agency leaders representing chronic disease and disparity. 5 A Likert scale was dev eloped to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being ad dressed by Sanford and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the early findings from the su rvey and to discuss the top health issues or health -related issues facing the community. The attendees at the September 2015 community stakeholder meeting helped to determine key priorities for the community. 3. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was co nducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. Once gaps were determined the group proc eeded to the prioritization process. A multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 4. Secondary Research The secondary data includes community health profiles from the North Dakota Department (DOH) of Health for Traill and Steele Counties, North Dakota and the Robert Wood Johnson County Health Rankings. The (DOH) indicators that were reviewed for this assessment include: population data, vital statistics, adult behaviora l risk factors, crime and child risk. Key Findings - Primary Research The key findings are based on the generalizable and the non -generalizable survey data. Key indicators were ranked on a 1 -5 Likert scale, with 5 being the highest concern ranking. Surv ey results that rank 3.5 or higher are considered to be high ranking concerns the survey. 1. Aging : The number one ranking concern among respondents overall is the cost of long term care. The availability of memory care and the availability of long term care also rank as top concerns for the aging. 2. Children and Youth : When considering children and youth, the availability and cost of activities for youth, availability and cost of quality childcare, bullying, the availability and cost of quality infant care, and the availability and cost of services for at -risk youth, are also ranked as high concerns. 3. Safety : The presence of street drugs and alcohol and drug dealers in the community, child abuse and neglect, and domestic violence are the highest safety con cerns of the respondents. 6 4. Health Care : The health care indicator addressed access to affordable health insurance, access to affordable health care, the cost of affordable dental insurance, and the cost of affordable vision insurance, timely access to sub stance abuse providers and mental health providers, and affordable prescription drug coverage are the highest concerns among the respondents. 5. Physical Health: Cancer, chronic disease, inactivity and lack of exercise, obesity, and poor nutrition and eating habits are the highest physical health concerns. 6. Mental Health/Behavioral Health : Depression, stress, underage drug use and abuse, underage drinking, drug use and abuse, smoking and tobacco, and alcohol use and abuse are the highest concerns for mental h ealth/behavioral health. Key Findings - Secondary Research Based on the 2015 County Health Rankings Health Outcomes Premature death: The premature death indicator is defined as years of potential life lost before age 75 per 10 0,000 population. The mortality health outcomes indicate that North Dakota as a state has more premature deaths (307.1 per 100,000) than Minnesota (2.62.6 per 100,000). Traill County, North Dakota was ranked best in the state as #1 out of 47 counties for length of life.

Violent crime is lower in Traill County at 48 per 100,000 population than in North Dakota at 240 per 100,000 population. Steele County is at 25 per 100,000 population. Youth account for 22% of the population in Traill County and 21.5% of the population in Steele County. Elderly account for 18.6% of the population in Traill County and 19% of the population in Steele County. The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Aging Children and Youth Safety Health Care Access Physical Health Mental Health 8 Members of the community stakeholder group determined that physical health and mental health services are the top unmet needs and pr iorities. Sanford has determined the 2016 -2019 implementation strategies for the following needs: Mental Health Physical Health Implementation Strategies Priority 1: Physical Health in the Community Obesity and inactivity are closely linked. Keeping active can help people stay at a healthy weight or lose weight. It can also lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain cancers, as well as reduce stress and boost mood. Inactive (sedentary) lifestyles do just the opposite. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, and other authorities recommend that for good health, adults should get the equivalent of two and a half hours of moderate -to-vigorous physical activ ity each week. Children should get even more, at least one hour a day. Sanfo rd has made physical health a high priority, and has set measurable outcomes . The outcomes include assessing a baseline for weight and scheduled periodic measurement, education session participation and exercise participation. The Sanford Health fit program is available to all classroom teachers and includes four areas of focus; nutrition, activity, behavioral health and sleep. The program is a vailable to promote healthy lifestyles in homes, schools, and daycares. Priority 2: Depression Depression is a common but serious illness that can interfere with daily life. Many people with a depressive illness never seek treatment. But the majority, ev en those with the most severe depression, can get better with treatment. The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 14% of residents in Traill and Steele counties have reported fair or poor mental health days. Sanford has prioritized depression as a high priority and has set strategy to perform assessments for depression in the primary care setting and to improve PHQ -9 scores for patients who are diagnosed with depression. The goal is to improve PHQ -9 scores for patients with depression. The meas urable outcome is the percentage of patients with major depression or dysthymia and an initial PHQ -9 score greater than nine whose six -month PHQ -9 score is less than five. Sanford Health will continue to provide a directory of services for community member s. 9 Sanford Hillsboro Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 10 Table of Contents Page Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment 12 Acknowledgements 12 Description of Sanford Hillsboro Medical Center 15 Description of the Hillsboro Community 16 Study Design and Methodology 17 Limitations of the Study 18 Key Findings 19 Community Health Concerns Personal Health Concerns Demographics Health Needs and Community Resources Identified Prioritization Addressing the Needs 44 2016 -2019 Implementation Strategies 46 2013 Implementation Strategies Impact 50 Community Feedback from 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment 53 Appendix 55 Primary Research 58 Asset Map Prioritization Worksheet Non-Generalizable Survey Results 62 Secondary Research 98 Trail County Community Health Profile Steele County Community Health Profile Definitions of Key Indicators / County Health Rankings Trail County and Steele County Comparison 11 Sanford Hillsboro Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 12 Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital community Benefit program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research.

The medical center employs approximately 130 people, including two family medicine physicians and a family medicine p hysician assistant. Services available at Sanford Hillsboro include 24/7 emergency care, general acute care, physical, occupational and speech therapy, radiology, IV therapy, lymphedema management, nutrition consultation, respite care, bariatric and pathol ogy and FM Ambulance services. 16 Description of the Hillsboro Community Hillsboro is a city of 1,600 people located on the banks of the Goose River in the heart of the Red River Valley of eastern North Dakota. It serves as the county seat for Traill Co unty. Hillsboro was founded in 1869 by German settlers and named for railroad baron James J. Hill who stopped in the area in the late 1870s and found hospitality from a homesteader. Hillsboro is conveniently located halfway between the metropolitan citie s of Grand Forks and Fargo on Interstate 29. The surrounding area is prime farm land, and agriculture has dominated the area's economy from the beginning. One of the major industries and employers is American Crystal Sugar which operates a large sugar beet processing plant north of the city. The plant has been responsible for both an increase in population and a steady stream of available jobs. Hillsboro has a strong economy with mo re than 60 businesses. It offers many amenities usually found in larger cities including K -12 education, medical facilities, parks, a pool, golf course and fitness center. 17 Study Design and Methodology 1. Non -Generalizable Survey An on-line non-generalizable on -line survey was conducted through a partnership between the Sanford Hillsboro/Mayville/Halstad/Traill and Steel County Collaborative and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and main tained links to the on - line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurred throughout the month of April 2015 and a total of 54 respon dents participated in the on -line survey. The purpose of this non -generalizable survey of community leaders was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders, legislators, and agency leaders representing chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were includ ed in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. As stated in the generalizable survey methodology, many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the requi red prioritization. 2. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the early findings from the generalizable survey and to discuss the top health issues or health -related issues facing the community. Community st akeholders helped to determine key priorities for the community, and these priorities are the focus of the implementation strategies for 2017 -2019. 3. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. The community stakeholder group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what needs remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 4. Secondary Research The secondary data include s community health profiles from the North Dakota Department of Health for Traill and Steele County, North Dakota. The Robert Wood Johnson County Health Rakings were also researched for Traill and Steel County. 18 Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in the Traill and Steele Counties in North Dakota and the area of Halstad, Minnesota. However, when comparing certain demographic characteri stics (i.e., age, income, minority status) with the current population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, it was evident that white, more highly educated, and higher income earners were overrepresented. Overrepresentation of this nature is typical in health needs assessments. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. Invitations were extended to county and community leaders, organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities. The Inter nal Revenue Code 501 (r) statute requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute include: persons who represent the broad interests of the community serve d by the hospital facility including those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; leaders, repres entatives, or members of medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations. Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. In some cases there were surveys that were submitted without names or without a specified area of expertise or affiliation. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment process. Public comments and response to the community health needs assessment and the implementations strategies are welcome on the Sanford website under \"About Sanford\" in the Community Health Needs Assessment section. 19 Key Findings 20 Community Health Concerns Aging Population The greatest area of concern among respondents is for the aging population, including the cost of long term care and the availability of memory care. Secondary research finds that 58.4 percent of the population in Traill County and 49.5 percent of the popu lation in Steele County are over 65 years of age. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding the AGING POPULATION The North Dakota Long Term Care Association states that a primary reason for the concern about the cost of long term care is because people are not purchasing long term care insurance. When long term care services are required it may be a surprise to learn the true cost of the service. Resources for family/friends and resources for the elderly to help them stay in their homes are becoming widely available through programs such as the North Dakota State University Extension Office and the Sanford Faith Co mmunity Nurse Program. Children and Youth The survey respondents have very high concerns for the children and youth of the community. The availability and cost of activities for children and youth, the availability and cost of quality child care, bully ing, the availability and cost of quality infant care, and the availability and cost of services for at -risk youth are high concerns. 3.43 3.44 3.60 3.61 3.70 3.81 3.89 4.43 1 2 3 4 5Cost of activities for seniors (N=54)Availability of resources for grandparents caring for grandchildren (N=52)Availability of resources to help the elderly stay safe in their homes (N=53)Availability of activities for seniors (N=54)Availability of resources for family/friends caring for and making...Availability of long term care (N=53)Availability of memory care (N=53)Cost of long term care (N=53) Mean (1=Not at All; 5=A Great Deal) 21 Level of concern with statements about the community regarding CHILDREN AND YOUTH 2.65 2.65 2.81 3.00 3.72 3.80 3.83 3.85 3.87 4.02 4.04 4.04 4.13 1 2 3 4 5School dropout rates (N=54)Teen pregnancy (N=54)School absenteeism (N=54)Youth crime (N=54)Cost of services for at-risk youth (N=53)Cost of activities for children and youth (N=54)Cost of quality infant care (N=54)Availability of services for at-risk youth (N=54)Cost of quality child care (N=54)Availability of quality infant care (birth to 2 years) (N=54)Bullying (N=53)Availability of quality child care (N=54)Availability of activities for children and youth (N=53) Mean (1=Not at All; 5=A Great Deal) 22 Health Care Access and Cost Top priorities among survey respondents are access to affordable health insurance, the cost of affordable vision insurance, access to affordable prescription drug insurance, and the cost of affordable dental insurance.

Access can include the availability of health care providers and a workforce available to address the needs. Limited access can challenge the ability to receive appropriate levels of care and may pave the way to the utilization of higher cost entry points into the system through the emergency room. The cost of care may influence the health of individuals. A Dartmouth study fin ds that North Dakota is considered a high quality state for health care in comparison to other states. North Dakota is also considered to deliver health care at a low cost in comparison to other states. Sanford provides a community care program and financ ial assistance policy to address assistance to all who qualify for charity care. During fiscal year 2014 Sanford contributed over $51 million for charity care for our patient population that required care without the ability to pay for services. Sanford ha s financial counselors available at all clinic and medical center facilities to assist patients with applications for assistance and access needs. One example of a community resource that is addressing the access needs of patients is Sanford's My Sanfor d Nurse program (formerly called Ask -A-Nurse). My Sanford Nurse served 324,295 individuals from throughout the footprint and nation during fiscal year 2014 and provided a community benefit of over $1.8M with more than 45,965 nursing staff hours. There is n o fee for this service. Timely access for mental health and behavioral health providers continues to remain a concern across the community. Workforce gaps among mental health and behavioral health providers remains a challenge. Sanford has an aggressive r ecruiting program and continues to recruit these experts to our community. The North Dakota Human Services Behavioral Health Interim Committee is also focused on developing the behavioral health workforce for the state in the areas of adult psychiatry, chi ld and adolescent psychiatry, and substance abuse providers. Sanford leaders are serving on the stakeholder group with this interim committee, along with other community providers. Physical and Mental Health Survey respondents have high levels of concer n for physical and mental health issues. The top concerns are cancer and chronic disease. Additional high ranking concerns include inactivity and lack of exercise, obesity, and poor nutrition. Stress and depression rank the highest concerns for mental hea lth. Secondary research through the 2015 County Health Rankings find that the average number of self - reported mentally unhealthy days reported in the last 30 days is at 2.2 days in Traill County and 2.3 days in Steele County. Traill County residents rep orting poor or fair health is at 13% and Traill County is at 12%. Traill County residents reporting that they are obese are at 36%; Traill County is at 32%. Traill County residents who report being physically inactive is at 27%; 30% of the residents in Ste ele County report being physically inactive. (See Appendix ) The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 9% of Traill and Steele County residents have been told by their health provider that they have cancer (excluding skin cancer ). (See Appendix) 24 Level of concern with statements about the community regarding PHYSICAL AND MENTAL Concerns about cancer : The prevalence of cancer among community members is on the minds of our residents. The Roger Maris Cancer Center in Fargo, North Dakota is located in close proximity to Mayville. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States for the adult population. According to the UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences 2015 Biennial Report, digestive system cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in our state, followed by breast cancer. The study finds that the risk of cancer in North Da kota is higher than in the rest of the nation. Sanford is committed to serving the cancer needs of our community through the Roger Maris Cancer Center and the 13 medical oncologists/hematologists, 5 radiation oncologists, 2 pediatric oncologists/hematolog ists, 7 palliative care board certified physicians, 1 oncology clinical psychologist, 1 medical geneticist, 3 genetic counselors, 1 doctor of nursing practice, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurse practitioners, 7 pharmacists, 4 radiation oncology medical physi cists, and several hundred transmitted diseases (e.g., AIDS, HIV, chlamydia) (N=53)Infectious diseases such as the flu (N=54)Other psychiatric diagnosis (N=54)Suicide (N=53)Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (N=54)Obesity (N=54)Poor nutrition and (N=54)Depression (N=54)Inactivity and lack of exercise (N=54)Stress (N=53)Chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis) (N=54)Cancer (N=54) Mean (1=Not at All; 5=A Great Deal) 25 Roger Maris Cancer Center holds a number of accreditations including Joint Commission Accreditation, the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer - Silver Commendation, the National Accreditation Progr am for Breast Cancer through the American College of Surgeons Accreditation by the American College of Radiology - Radiation Oncology, Edith Sanford Breast Health Comprehensive Center recognized as a Certified Quality Breast Center of Excellence through t he National Consortium of Breast Centers, Breast Imaging Center of Excellence through the American College of Radiology, Certification by the Quality Oncology Practice Initiative through the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Advanced Care Cert ification by The Joint Commission for Palliative Care Services. The Sanford Roger Maris Cancer Center desires to detect cancer at earlier stages when there is a better chance for cure. One example of the Center's focus on early detection is colorectal scr eenings. Colorectal cancer screenings can detect precancerous colorectal polys which, if removed, can prevent colorectal cancer and reduce an individual's colorectal cancer risk by 50%. In 2014 at Sanford Roger Maris Cancer Center there were 158 colore ctal cancer cases, 74 (47%) of which were more advanced (stage 3 or 4). Treatment results compared favorably with other cancer centers in the region and nationally. North Dakota is at the bottom third of the country for colorectal cancer screenings, which leads to later detection and more advanced colorectal cancer stages. Having one of the familial cancer syndromes increases the likelihood of developing cancer. The Roger Maris Cancer Center has a familial cancer syndrome clinic, where the team assists in coordinating care and helping individuals with an increased risk of cancer to plan for future screenings, and customizes the patient's treatment plan. Genetic risk assessment is an important component of the care at the Sanford Roger Maris Cancer Center. Concerns about other chronic diseases : The top chronic diseases among respondents include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes. Respondents were also concerned about comorbidities such as obesity, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity. The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 24.2% of Traill and Steele County residents have been diagnosed with arthritis. The state health data also reports that 76.2% of Traill and Steele County residents are overweight or obese, whi ch makes it more uncomfortable when dealing with arthritis. Traill and Steele County residents who report that they have been told by their provider that they have hypertension is 24%, and 40.3% report the same for high cholesterol. ( See Appendix) 26 Whether respondents have any of the following chronic diseases Concerns about hypertension : Hypertension is addressed at Sanford through a standardized protocol, frequent blood pressure monitoring, and referral throughout all departments. Continued impr ovement has been realized since the implementation of the standardized protocol. Concerns about hypercholesterolemia : Sanford providers address hypercholesterolemia through evidence -based guidelines. Patients are closely monitored to assure a reduction in heart disease risk. Concerns about diabetes : Sanford offers a comprehensive diabetes education program. Sanford diabetes clinics and centers are dedicated to empowering people with diabetes to feel better and prevent long -term complications. Sanford of fers assessment and personalized education care to give patients and their families the tools they need to manage diabetes while living well. Endocrinologists, certified diabetes nurses and certified diabetes dieticians provide diagnosis, assessment, one -on-one education, and instruction. The chronic disease self -management Better Choices, Better Health program at Sanford is offered free of charge to community members. Better Choices, Better Health is modeled after Stanford University's chronic disease se lf-management program. The workshops are 2\u00bd hours long and meet weekly for 6 weeks. The program is facilitated by two trained lay leaders and one or both have a chronic condition. Research has found that after participating in the program individuals are b etter able to manage their symptoms, communicate more easily with their doctors, are less limited by the disease, and generally feel better. Concerns about obesity, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity : Sanford Enterprise chose obesity as an impl ementation strategy for the 2013 CHNA. Strategies included an annual obesity symposium for providers and monthly education programs for community members. The Sanford obesity symposium was attended by more than 400 registrants during April 2013 and March 2 015. The symposium will be held again during March 2016. The symposium is evidence -based. Sanford providers and national experts serve as faculty for the symposium. 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.9 1.9 5.6 11.1 11.1 13.0 22.2 0 10 20 30 40 50Alzheimer'sCOPDAsthmaStrokeCongestive Heart FailureCancerDiabetesArthritisHigh cholesterolHypertension Percent* 27 The Sanford Health fit initiative, http://sanford fit.org/ a childhood obesity prevention initiative, continues to grow and mature as we work to refine the offerings and enable broad replication and meaningful use. Supported by the clinical experts of Sanford Health, fit educates, empowers and motivates families to live a healthy lifestyle through a comprehensive suite of resources for children, parents, teachers and clinicians. fit is the only initiative focusing equally on the four key contributing factors to childhood obesity: Food (nutrition), Move ( activity), Mood (behavioral health), and Recharge (sleep). Sanford's fit Initiative has come a long way since its inception in 2010. Through fit we are actively working to promote healthy lifestyles in homes, schools, daycares, our clinical settings, and throughout the community by way of technology, engaging programs, and utilizing key role models in a child's life. The fit website for Juniors , Kids and Teens creates an entertaining and interactive on -line environment where they can play games, watch videos and take daily challenges. Parents benefit from their own set of resources where they can find tips and tools on becoming healthy role mode ls and raising fit kids. To date, the children's and parent's sites have received more than 7.5 million visitors. Over 700 pieces of content have been added to the sites including videos, slideshows, games, articles, and even fit songs . In addition to the web, fit is developing meaningful school resources to bring value and fun into the primary educat ion setting. We are doing this by integrating fit points into science and math components to provide health promotion, an avenue into the classroom without taking valuable time away from those critical subjects. fit4Schools - fit4Schools includes unique fit-based lessons integrated into daily classroom activities . fit4schools.sanfordfit.org is an on -line school resource that incorporates topics into math and science curriculum. To date the program has 14 STEM (integrating science, technology, engineering , and math) unit plans that can be downloaded for classroom use. To date it has: o Reached 50,000 schools o 180,000 page views from educators across the country o 12,000 lesson plan downloads, representing 600,000+ students We are also reaching thousands of s tudents through several pilot school programs. o fit4Schools - fit4Schools, which includes unique fit-based lessons integrated into daily classroom activities, is in its final phase of development. It is being piloted in seven elementary schools in the Sanfo rd region. Community o The fit friends, Denny, Abby, Sam, Alex and Marty, along with the fit team, have been making a variety of appearances at events across the Sanford footprint. fit has been at over 2 dozen events interacting with more than 15,000 children and parents to spread the word about the fit platform and resources. o Smartphone Apps - Through a series of fun and engaging apps, fit will continue to activate kids at the touch of a fingertip to live a fit and healthy lifestyle related to Mood, Recharge, Food and Move. o MOVE2Draw is a simple and fun way for kids to move and create their own unique drawings. Once a drawing is completed, it can be stored on the MOVE2Draw website. 28 o eMOO Dicam is a photo application that allows the user to enhance a photo and bring the mood to life and share with others. Looking Forward o fit is continuing to look to the future for ways to continue to make a meaningful impact on children and families both o n-line and off -line. Other exciting expansions that are in the works include: Clinical Setting - Resources for the clinical setting to spur actionable and understandable discussions between health care providers and families. Health Coaches - Exploring mea ningful ways for health coaches to promote healthy choices with children and adults. Engage Key Role Models - Firefighters and youth sport coaches are role models and have a big influence on children so that's why fit is developing resources for them to te ach the principles of fit along with sports fundamentals and other outreach efforts. fitClub 4 Boys - 10-week after school program for boys, ages 8 -12, to develop knowledge of fit principles and healthy behavior choices. fit Parent/child - Class for paren ts and children to understand healthy choices and the benefits of living a healthy lifestyle. Concerns about mental/behavioral health : During the 2013 CHNA process, Sanford Health developed an implementation strategy to fully integrate behavioral healt h services or access to behavioral health outreach in all regional clinic sites in the Fargo, Sioux Falls, Bismarck and Bemidji regions. A key implementation strategy for Sanford Health is to fully integrate behavioral health services into all primary care clinics. Sanford One Care is addressing behavioral health in primary and specialty care clinics and medical centers. Sanford One Care uses technology to conduct behavioral health screenings in order to identify behavioral health concerns as early as p ossible. Through deployment of Medical Home with fully integrated behavioral health care services, Sanford is providing patient -centered care collaborative teams to meet the needs of Sanford patients. 29 During 2015 Sanford hosted a behavioral health symposiu m. The symposium was designed to enhance the competence of health care professionals in the identification, treatment and management of behavioral health issues impacting specialty and primary care. Sanford behavioral health experts are serving on the No rth Dakota Behavioral Health Stakeholders Advisory to the Department of Human Services Legislative Interim Committee to shape policy. The North Dakota Behavioral Health Stakeholders group works to address unmet needs in behavioral health in North Dakota. U sing a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) template of the components of a comprehensive system of behavioral health care, the group has identified needs in North Dakota and is working on solutions to meet those needs. Types of behavioral health services addressed by this group include adult mental health, children's mental health, substance abuse, and workforce development. Concerns about substance use and abuse : Survey respondents have a high level of concern about alcohol use and abuse in the community and about underage drinking and use of drugs. Additionally, smoking and tobacco use and drug use and abuse among adults are high concerns. Level of concern with statements about the community re garding SUBSTANCE USE AND ABU SE Safety The highest concerns for survey respondents in the safety category are the presence of drugs and alcohol in the community, child abuse and neglect, and domestic abuse. Secondary research finds that alcohol -impaired driving deaths have reach ed 33% in Traill County and 50% in Steele County.

Mean (1=Not at All; 5=A Great Deal) 31 Personal Health Concerns Respondents' Personal Health Status The study results suggest possible discrepancies between respondents' perceived personal health and their actual health status as determined by objective measures. For example, using the Body M ass Index (BMI) which calculates weight status using an individual's weight and height , the majority of respondents are overweight or obese. However, the vast majority of community respondents rate their own health as excellent, very good or good. Respo ndents' rating of their health in general 88.7% of the respondents rate their health as good or better Respondents' weight status based on the Body Mass Index (BMI) scale 65.3% of respondents report a BMI that is overweight or obese 0.0 0.0 11.3 32.1 47.2 9.4 0 10 20 30 40 50Don't knowPoorFairGoodVery GoodExcellent Percent 36.7 28.6 34.7 0.0 0 10 30 40 50Obese (BMI of or greater)Overweight (BMI (BMI from 18.5 to 24.9)Underweight (BMI less than 18.5) Percent 32 Length of time since respondents last visited a doctor or health care provider for a routine physical exam and length of time since they last visited a dentist or dental clinic for any reason o 21% of respondents have waited longer than a year to visit a d octor or health care provider o 17.3 % of respondents have waited more than a year to see a dentist Preventive Health Preventive health care promotes the detection and prevention of illness and disease and is another important component of good health and well -being. Community results indicate that within the past year, the majority of respondents had a blood pressure scr eening, blood sugar screening, cholesterol screening, dental screening, flu shot, pelvic exam (females), breast cancer screening (females), and cervical cancer screening (females). However, there are many screenings and tests that a majority of respondents did not receive (i.e., bone density test, cardio screening, glaucoma test, hearing screening, immunizations, STD test, vascular screening, colorectal cancer screening, prostate cancer screening (males), and skin cancer screening in the past year. Many tes ts and screenings may be conditional upon guidelines, which can be age sensitive/appropriate.

Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. The U nited States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that if you are 50 to 74 years old, be sure to have a screening mammogram every two years. If you are 40 to 49 years old, talk to your doctor about when to start and how often to get a screening mammogram. Cervical cancer screening : Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecologic cancer to prevent, with regular screening tests and follow -up. Two screening tests can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early: The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for pre-cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not tre ated appropriately. The HPV test looks for the virus that can cause these cell changes (human papillomavirus) (http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/) The Pap test is recommended for all women betwee n the ages of 21 and 65 years old, and can be done in a doctor's office or clinic. Colorectal cancer screening : Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can also find col orectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Regular screening, beginning at age 50, is the key to preventing colorectal cancer. 34 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for colorectal cancer using high -sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy beginning at age 50 and continuing until age 75. Prostate cancer screening : The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties, ri sks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unless they have received this information. The discussion about screening should take place at: Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected to live at least 10 more years. Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This includes African Americans and men who have a first -degree relative (father, brother or son) diagnosed with prostate cance r at an early age (younger than age 65). Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first -degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age). After this discussion, those men who want to be screened should be tested with the prost ate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part of screening. If, after this discussion, a man is unable to decide if testing is right for him, the screening decision can be made by the health care provider , who should take into account the patient's general health preferences and values. Assuming no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between future screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test: Men who choose to be test ed who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years. Screening should be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher. Because prostate cancer often grows slowly, men without symptoms of prostate cancer who d o not have a 10 -year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit. Overall health status, and not age alone, is important when making decisions about screening. Even after a decision about testing has been made, the d iscussion about the pros and cons of testing should be repeated as new information about the benefits and risks of testing becomes available. Further discussions are also needed to take into account changes in the patient's health, values and preferences. Skin cancer screening : The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine screening (total body examination by a doctor) to find skin cancers early. The USPSTF recommends that doctors: Be aware that fair -skinned men and women aged 65 and older, and people with atypical moles or more than 50 moles, are at greater risk for melanoma. Look for skin abnormalities when performing physical examinations for other reasons. 35 Flu Vaccines The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that everyone six months and older receive a flu vaccine annually. Findings from the generalizable survey indicate that 37% of respondents did not have a flu s hot last year. The Center for Disease Control states that influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Even healthy people can get sick from the flu and spread it to others. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to d evelop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. Fruit and Vegetable Intake The study results suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet vegeta ble and fruit recommended dietary guidelines. Only 28.4 % of respondents reported having 3 or more servings of vegetables the prior day, and 17% of the group reported having 3 or more servings of fruits the prior day. According to the U.S. Department of H ealth and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it is recommended that individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day depending on age. A diet high in fruits and veg etables is associated with decreased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e., few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a reduced -calorie diet can be beneficial for weight managemen t. Secondary research provided by the North Dakota Department of Health finds that 84.4% of residents in Traill and Steele County report not getting 5 fruits and vegetables each day.

Guidelines from t he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that individuals participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week to help sustain and improve health. Number of days in an aver age week respondents engage in MODERATE and VIGOROUS activity Tobacco Use Study results indicate that the vast majority of community respondents are not currently tobacco users. However, over 37% of respondents have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, which indicates former smoker status according to the Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention. Secondary research through the 2015 County Health Rankings finds that 13% of Traill County residents and 12% of Steele County residents are current smokers. 5.7 11.3 34.0 49.1 11.8 27.5 49.0 11.8 0 10 20 30 40 505 or more days3 to 4 days1 to 2 daysNone Percent* MODERATE activity (N=51) VIGOROUS activity (N=53)37 Whether respondents have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their entire life How often respondents currently smoke cigarettes and use chewing tobacco or snuff Mental Health Mental health is an important component of well -being at every stage of life and impacts how we think, act and feel.

In regards to binge drinking, 26.5% of respondents report binge drinking at least once per month. Secondary research through the 2015 County Health Ranking indicates that 16% of Traill County and 26% of Steele County residents report binge drinking.

Health Needs and Community Resources Identified One of the requirements for a community health needs assessment is to identify the resources that are available in the community to address unmet needs. Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the primary and secondary research and identifying the unmet n eeds from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. The key comm unity stakeholders from Hillsboro, Portland, Mayville , Halstad, Traill and Steel Co unty participated in the asset mapping and reviewed the research findings. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what needs remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the priori tization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. The asset map includes identified needs from the following: Identified needs from the non -generalizable survey Concerns expressed by the key stakeholder group Secondary research data Community resources that are available to address the need(s) The asset map can be found in the Appendix. 43 Prioritization The following needs were brought forward for prioritization: Aging Children and Youth Safety Health Care Access Physical Health Mental Health Preventive Health Sanford is addressing all of the assessed needs that fall within our scope of work. In some cases the need is one where we do not have the expertise to adequately address the nee d; however, Sanford leaders will communicate these findings to community leaders and experts who can best focus on a solution to the concern. A document that shares what Sanford is doing to address the need or defends why Sanford is not addressing the ne ed can be found in the Appendix. Members of the community stakeholder group determined that mental health and physical health are the top unmet needs. Sanford has determined the 2016 -2019 implementation strategies for the following needs: Mental Health Physical Health 44 Addressing the Needs 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment Sanford Hillsboro Identified Concerns How Sanford Hillsboro is Addressing the Needs Aging Cost of long term care Availability of memory care The cost of LTC is governed by the State of North Dakota. We can continue to control our costs but North Dakota Human Services determines the actual costs. When we built our LT C facility in 2008 a study was completed to show the need for memory care, the previous board decided that was not our business. Now the availability to purchase LTC beds for such a purpose is not an option, along with our facility has no property to expand and our LTC beds run full. Children and Youth Bullying Availability of activities fo r children and youth Cost of activities for children and youth The local s chool has a program for bullying. As part of Physical Health, will be working with high school and local public health unit in determining where child activities are happening and what can be provided as we are a very small community.

Have secured a small grant to go to 9 seni or citizen centers in area to talk about physical exercise (includes diet) and chronic disease. We hope to have a health fair also to educate the public. Preventive health Flu shots and immunizations Sanford conducts flu blitzes in the community, and when patients come into clinic, immunizations are recommended. 46 2016 -2019 Implementation Strategies 47 Implementation Strategies Priority 1: Physical Health in the Community Obesity and inactivity are closely linked. Keeping active can help people stay at a healthy weight or lose weight. It can also lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain cancers, as well as reduce stress and boost mood. Inactive (sedentary) lifestyles do just the oppo site. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, and other authorities recommend that for good health, adults should get the equivalent of two and a half hours of moderate -to-vigorous physical activity each week. Children should get even more, at least one hour a day. Sanford has prioritized physical health and has set measurable outcomes that include assessing a baseline weight and periodic measurement, education session participation and exercise participation. The San ford Health fit program is available to all classroom teachers and includes four areas of focus; nutrition, activity, behavioral health and sleep. The program is available to promote healthy lifestyles in homes, schools, and daycares. Priority 2: Depression Depression is a common but serious illness that can interfere with daily life. Many people with a depressive illness never seek treatment. But the majority, even those with the most severe depression, can get better with treatment. The North Dakota Departm ent of Health reports that 14% of residents in Traill and Steele counties have reported fair or poor mental health days. Sanford has prioritized depression as a top priority and has set strategy to perform assessments for depression in the primary care setting and to improve PHQ -9 scores for patients who are diagnosed with depression. The goal is to improve PHQ -9 scores for patients with depression. The measurable outcome is the percentage of patients with major depression or dysthymia and an initial PHQ -9 score greater than nine whose six -month PHQ -9 score is less than five. Sanford Health will continue to provide a directory of services for community members. 48 Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Strategy for Sanford Hillsboro Me dical Center FY 2017 -2020 Action Plan Priority 1 : Physical health of the community Projected Impact : Programs and services are available to all members of the community Goal 1 : Provide on-line program Sanford fit for children and parents in the community Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Dedicated Resources Leadership Note any community partnerships and collaborations (if applicable) Provide Sanford fit program to the local schools and childcare providers Sanford fit is available to all students and families in the area through classroom and fit website Will have a kick off event that introduces the WebMD fit program to the school in late summer.

The impact has been positive and the work will continue into the future through new or continued programming and services. Impact of the Strategy to Address Mental Health Services Sanford Health completed an inventory of services that are available in the area to address mental health needs. A directory was developed for the purpose of making the information available to the members of the community. The directory was updated in 2015 and will be updated again in 2016. Revised copies of the mental health resource directory have been made ava ilable to public health and community members can obtain a copy at the hospital. Copies will also be distributed to area senior centers during 2016 and at the health fair/education blitz. Impact of the Strategy to Address Services for the Elderly Sanford Health completed an inventory of services that are available to meet the needs of seniors in the com munity and rural areas. A directory was developed for the purpose of making the information available to the members of the community. The directory was updated in 2015, and was added to the mental health services directory. Revised copies of the mental h ealth and services for the elderly resource directory have been made available to public health and community members can obtain a copy at the hospital. Copies will also be distributed to area senior centers during 2016 and at the health fair/education bli tz. 52 Impact of the Strategy to Address Day Care Sanford Health worked in collaboration with community leaders to secure daycare services for the community. A director was hired and a local facility was secured and renovated f or the daycare services. The provision of day care services in the community fulfilled a need in the community. Late in the fall of 2015 the daycare closed due to the ability to retain and hire new staff. The community is looking at a possible solution of a partnership with the City of Hillsboro and Mayville State to assume ownership of the building and expand the daycare services that Mayville currently offers in Hillsboro. 53 Community Feedback from the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment 54 Sanford Health is prepared to accept feedback on our 2013 community health needs assessment and has provided on -line comment fields for ease of access on our website. There have been no comments to date aside from a question asked about the service area f or this report. A reader wanted to know if a separate report was developed for the Lisbon, North Dakota area. Since there is no hospital in Lisbon, a community health needs assessment was not conducted solely for that community. 55 APPENDIX 56 Primary Research 57 Hillsboro / Mayville 2016 CHNA Asset Map Identified concern Key stakeholder Survey Secondary data Specific areas of concern Community resources that are available to address the need Gap?
