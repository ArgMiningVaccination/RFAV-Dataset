But in today's Europe, it is the voiceof the patient and of patient organisationsthat holds the greatest sway over politi-cians. Forming a strategic alliancebetween the people who use cancer serv-ices and those who provide and plan theseservices is therefore vital if Europe's can-cer community is to maximise its impact.The US cancer community providesmany good examples of how such analliance might work. The CancerLeadership Council (CLC) is one. Set upin 1993 by eight cancer patient organisa-tions with the aim of influencing healthpolicy decisions, the CLC has expandedto include non-patient groups such as theAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), the American Cancer Society,the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS),and the American Society for TherapeuticRadiology and Oncology (ASTRO). TheKathy Redmond EDITOR CLC is now a 29-member forum, whichtakes positions on issues as diverse asstem cell research, reimbursement ofclinical trials, regulation of pain medica-tions and FDA guidelines. Policy makerslisten because the views represent a broadspectrum of the US cancer community -not just physicians. The American Federation of ClinicalOncologic Societies is another example. Itis an informal coalition of professionaloncology societies representing physicians,nurses, social workers and other healthcare providers, established to advocate foruniversal access to quality cancer care.Such informal alliances provide the oppor-tunity for members to meet, explore issues,generate practical solutions, and developplans for action without the hierarchy, costsand bureaucratic trappings of a formalorganisation. Closer to home, theEuropean Breast Cancer Conference pro-vides a good example of a successfulpatient-professional partnership.Whether the issue be inequities in accessto quality care, bureaucratic clinical trialregulations or insufficient research fund-ing, collaboration between patient and pro-fessional organisations can achieve farmore than when each works in isolation.Given the recent establishment of a num-ber of pan-European cancer patient advo-cacy organisations, and also the currentfocus on uniting Europe's professional can-cer bodies, it is probably easier for this tohappen today than ever before.A stronger voice within Europe CoverStory John Smyth: unity is strength John Smyth likes to get things done. Head of a major research centre and member of EMEA's scientific advisory committee, he argues for closer cooperation between academiaand industry. He also wants a stronger voice for oncology in Europe, and hopes to convincehis FECS colleagues to opt for greater unity when he takes on the presidency this October. It's impossible to escape comparisons with the European Union when talking to JohnSmyth, the incoming president of theFederation of European Cancer Societies(FECS), and professor of medical oncolo- gy at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.While the EU undergoes painful soul searchingon its constitution, Smyth's mission for FECS isto bring about a fundamental switch to a single,unified organisation rather than a loose federa-tion of societies. And of course one of the keyaims of such unity is to work more effectively atEU level, to influence decision makers in criticalareas of cancer research and treatment, such asdrug licensing, clinical trials and care standards. The unity theme extends further, as Smyth has been one of the early proponents of multi-disciplinary oncology work that's been developingunder his guidance since he took up his post inEdinburgh way back in 1979. He is now also thedirector of the Edinburgh University Centre forCancer Research, which is housed in a newbuilding alongside the oncology clinics at thehuge Western General Hospital, links withMarc Beishon 6CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005several other oncology-related units on site toform one of Europe's major cancer centres. He's quick to emphasise that this multidisci- plinary work does not mean bringing togetherjust say medical and surgical oncology, but alsopsychology to help treat patients as a whole. In afield where the word 'holistic' is often bandiedabout, Smyth and his colleagues have a goodclaim for a strong, all-round patient managementprogramme, which also includes a psychosocialresearch component. \"There aren't any trivial conversations in can- cer, but I tell our trainees that it is possible tohelp everyone who comes through our door andthat patients should feel comforted when theyleave the consulting room. Knowing the medicalfacts is easy - any doctor can learn them - butgetting communications right is hard. After all,one of the main reasons people go into medicineis to help others.\" Good communications is also the key enabler for Smyth's work and ambition outsideEdinburgh. He admits that there still is a lot oftalking to do to persuade entrenched interests inCoverStory CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 7He stresses the importance of communications lines, particularly between industry and academia COLIN MCPHERSON / CORBIS / CONTRASTOCoverStory 8CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005the various cancer societies to share his vision for FECS - and he has of course witnessed at firsthand the formation of divisions in the oncologycommunity over the years, particularly in Britain. Smyth's present commitments also include being the oncologist on the UK's Committee onSafety of Medicines, and he's on the scientificadvisory committee at the European MedicinesAgency (EMEA), where again he stresses theimportance of opening up communicationslines, particularly between industry andacademia. \"Most of my research has been ondrug development, and the process of approvingand licensing medicines is extremely impor-tant,\" he says, adding that there is too much atstake for 'snobbishness' about industry byacademics to continue. He has a platform to explore the academic issues - he is also the current editor-in-chief ofthe European Journal of Cancer , adding to a con- siderable workload. Apart from the administra-tive duties of running the cancer centre, and hisinternational work, Smyth continues to seemelanoma and ovarian cancer patients, teachundergraduates and direct research programmes(on ovarian cancer, melanoma and drug develop-ment). He's also a governor of the local hospice. He does this with rigorous attention to time management and delegation, self-expressed \"irre-pressible enthusiasm and humour\", and probablywith the power of a beautifully modulated voice- Smyth was an international singer with theMonteverdi choir under the very demandingconductor John Eliot Gardiner, and he is possiblythe only medical oncologist to have sung onstages from La Scala to the Lincoln Centre. Indeed, he went to the Cambridge University ona choral scholarship, but chose to read naturalsciences. \"I decided not to pursue music, largelybecause I had a brother who was a child prodigyon the piano and didn't want to compete withhim.\" A second love was (and is) flying - hejoined the Royal Air Force at Cambridge, andflies small planes today as a hobby. But thanks toa \"general interest in science and people\" hefound himself studying medicine, moving to StBartholomew's (Bart's) in London, and went onto benefit from a 'magical' training before theonset of more structured - and curtailed - devel-opment that doctors in Britain have to conformto today, according to Smyth. \"It's rare now in Britain for anyone to have the experience I did. As an oncology consultant, forexample, I did some neuro, thoracic, paediatric,gynae and breast work. It's quite right now thatyou can't be an expert in all these, but I do thinkdoctors have to specialise too soon these days.\" As for medical oncology, Smyth was attract- ed to this then very new discipline by one of hismentors - and that's another aspect of his train-ing that is 'disappearing' today, he feels. \"I'm con-cerned about the lack of mentoring and appren-ticeship for young doctors. I was fortunate inhaving two mentors who had a profound affecton me.\" The first was gastroenterologist AnthonyDawson (who became the Queen's physician) -\"He had an extraordinary capacity to talk to peo-ple about chronic illness - I learnt a hugeamount from him about talking to patients aboutcancer as a disabling disease. \"I'm concerned about the lack of mentoring and apprenticeship for young doctors\" \"Both men helped me understand that you can face up to apparently appalling situations\"CoverStory CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 9\"Then I worked for Gordon Hamilton Fairley, real- ly the founder of medical oncology in Britain. Hehad a fantastic capacity to talk to people aboutdeath. Both men helped me understand that youcan face up to apparently appalling situationsrather than do what a lot did then in the 1970s,which was not discuss such 'dark' matters.\" After working for Hamilton Fairley at Bart's he went to the Institute of Cancer Research atthe Royal Marsden, where he did laboratorywork and \"had one of my few original ideas,about the importance of adenosine in lympho-cyte metabolism, which resulted in pentostatin, adrug still used today to treat rare forms ofleukaemia and lymphoma. This subsequently ledto the widely used lymphoma drug, fludarabine.\" This work got Smyth his PhD and a travel- ling fellowship to the National Cancer Institutein the US, where he \"fell under the spell\" ofmany more mentors, famous names in oncologysuch as Bob Young, Bruce Chabner and VinceDeVita. He returned to the Royal Marsden, and then two years later was offered the professorship atEdinburgh, just after his 33rd birthday. \"This wasvery scary, but I was able to draw on my cadre ofmentors to help me. I was amazed to get the job- I didn't expect to have an academic career, as Iwas always middle-of-the-road in exams, but Iwas strongly inspired by the people around me inmedical oncology.\" Certainly the rigour of the US approach to drug development made a great impression - hesays that those who feel the early chemotherapydays failed to deliver misunderstand medicaloncology. \"The Americans were very protocoldriven and very good at publishing evidence,which you need to be when working with a nar-row therapeutic index and sailing close to thewind between help and harm. They built upwhat we would now call an evidence base - andmany Europeans went to the US to learn thisdiscipline.\" With hindsight, there was, he adds, a ten- dency to push on for too long with what workedfor leukaemia and lymphoma, and to push thera-pies to the limit. \"But I don't think anyone wasseeking to cure cancer - there has also been con-fusion for the public who don't realise that canceris a condition of the body, just like getting older.\" At Edinburgh, he found that surgical and radia-tion oncology were already well established, andadded the third - medical oncology - componentas part of a joint cancer centre effort. \"This waspartly out of necessity - I couldn't set up a cen-tre in a big city on my own - but mainly becauseI believed in multidisciplinary working. It hasserved us well; we now have 21 consultants, allthe clinics are multidisciplinary, and we havesome 30,000 outpatient appointments a year.\" Nor did he have to sell the importance of clinical research - there were already ongoingtrials and he joined in by setting up a drug devel-opment and pharmacology lab, tapping into ahigh standard of medical expertise in the areathat has long been a feature of Edinburgh. Atraining programme was set up, and Smyth'sgroup established a good reputation for drugtrials and relationships with industry, andbecame one of the leading British clinicalresearch centres - in fact it was one of only twoplaces earmarked for investment by the thenImperial Cancer Research Fund. A standout development, and one that Smyth is especially proud of, was work withGlaxo on the first of the 5HT3 anti-emetic (anti-nausea and vomiting) drugs - his group conduct-ed the first worldwide trials. \"This has been oneof the greatest contributions to patient toleranceof chemotherapy,\" he says. He was also a partic-ipant in the now defunct early clinical trials With daughters Anna and Sarahat a familycelebration CoverStory 10 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005that will do what you want, such as yeast.\" Britain, he adds, is favouring basic research toomuch, while universities have become obsessedwith research assessment and getting paperspublished in high-impact journals. \"Clinical trials- including our first into man Phase Is - don't fallinto this remit and the research is expensive.Clinicians get paid more than lab scientists, anduniversities don't have the resources to providemore lectureships and professorships.\" An example: \"We've just medicine,with Fran Balkwill at Bart's, that may influencediseases such as ovarian cancer. But the value ofsuch trials will only be realised in the lab, as weare looking at scientific end points.\" This drug -infliximab - is used, he says, to treat rheumatoidarthritis, but also inhibits the tumour necrosisfactor. \"So far it looks very encouraging in treat-ment of women with ovarian cancer. Applyingscience in such a dynamic clinical experimenthas been very exciting.\" As a centre, Edinburgh now looks to have considerable strengths. In addition to theregional clinical centre, Smyth's UniversityCancer Research Centre embraces research pro-grammes on basic genetics and cell biology, acolon cancer genetics unit, research into prostatecancer and leukaemia and a combined pro-gramme investigating endocrine sensitivity andresistance in breast and ovarian cancer. Basic sci-ence and clinical research are linked by the drugdevelopment programme, which translatesmolecular and preclinical pharmacology to earlyclinical trials. There are also ovarian and breast tumour banks, with many tissues having the advantage offull histories: \"We not only know where the tis-sues came from but what happened to thepatient subsequently,\" says Smyth. \"We've beenharvesting them for years. These tumour bankswill be an absolute gold mine over the next ten \"These tumour banks will be an absolute gold mine over the next ten years or so\"group at the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), where hegained a lot of peer support and had fun meetingothers - often at people's houses around Europe. \"While we were very conscious of physical toxicities we also wanted to learn about the emo-tional experience and what we now call quality oflife,\" he continues, mentioning that his wife, AnnCull, a research psychologist, set up a psychoso-cial oncology group and played a key role withthe EORTC in establishing a group of quality oflife researchers, with Edinburgh developingassessment tools. On-going work on what heterms \"symptoms research\" - not just sicknessand pain but distress - has a current focus onfatigue (\"a complex mix of the physical, emotion-al and psychological\"), and ties in with Smyth'score interest in patient communications. Where Smyth feels he has really taken a lead is with the clinical research effort, although ithas been a struggle to reach the funding level thecentre now enjoys, and also to attract staff. \"It'smuch more challenging for scientists to work onhuman material. If you want a paper in Nature or Cell you work on clean, well-worked systems Appropriate nerves before a liverecordingat the SalzburgFestivalCoverStory CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 11years or so.\" Another strength of Edinburgh, he adds, is simply having research people rightalongside the hospital clinics. \"As I travel theworld I've found relatively few places where thelab and clinical complexes are physically joinedup,\" he says. Many of the successes and problems at Edinburgh will be familiar to those in other can-cer centres, but as Smyth points out, one of thefundamental differences between Europe andthe US is the former's wide diversity in patientand professional expectations and experience asyou move among countries and regions. \"TheEuropean oncology world has always been acomplex mix, with great intellectual ability andgood funding, but heterogeneity is the challenge- it's no good trying to impose say the British orFrench way on the rest of Europe.\" FECS, he says, has been addressing issues such as clinical trials best practice and multidis-ciplinary working through workshops for junioroncologists. But there's a much bigger picture -the image and accessibility of the Europeanoncology community as seen by healthcare deci-sion makers, politicians, industry and the public.While FECS remains as essentially a 'talkingshop' - albeit discussing important issues -opportunities to present a coherent voice to theoutside world will be lost, says Smyth. As thingsstand, there are just too many interest groupscompeting for attention - and a single oncologysociety may have had a better chance, say, ofstaving off the worst of the European clinicaltrials directive, \"which has been an absolute dis-aster for academic research.\" \"I realise that people are worried about loss of identity and visibility but I think that you canbe an important part of a big enterprise as well asa small one.\" Certainly, FECS and other bodiessuch as the EORTC and the European Societyof Medical Oncologists (ESMO) - of whichSmyth is a past president - have made concertedefforts to lobby on issues such as the trials direc- tive and the recognition of medical oncology. ButSmyth is angling for the professionalism andclout that a unified society can bring, and com-ments that there has been too much \"amateur-ish\" lobbying work and protectionist behaviour. A case in point in Britain, he says, stretches back to the 1980s. \"With medical oncology stillfairly new we formed the Association of CancerPhysicians - and the radiotherapy people were sojealous they set up the British OncologicalAssociation. This year, for the first time, we arefinally having a single meeting.\" If people areserious about multidisciplinary working, thereshould be no room for big egos and professionaljealousies, he says. That names for disciplinesaround Europe are confusing and inconsistent -such as what comes under 'clinical oncology' -and that some professionals have private practiceto protect, makes the situation yet more chal-lenging, he adds. \"We are spending too much time and money duplicating efforts, with people massaging theiregos in little fiefdoms,\" he says. \"Ultimately, thisis about improving patient care by providinggreater equality of access to drugs and equip-ment around Europe. We stand a much betterchance of doing this as a unified society than byarbitrary lobbying by small groups.\" The situation is compounded too by the pro- liferation of meetings, which are \"seriously out ofcontrol\", according to Smyth. This is partly driv-en of course by the huge increase in industrymoney over recent years, but he feels profession-als are now faced with an impossible choice ofevents. \"I could be away 40 weeks of the year andnot necessarily be any wiser,\" he says, adding thatgetting the right mix of new materials and theright people is often hit and miss. But he consid-ers meetings and workshops to be pivotal to pro-fessional learning - \"Education isn't about hand-ing out recipes from a textbook or a journal. You \"If FECS remains a 'talking shop' opportunities for a coherent voice in the outside world will be lost\"CoverStory 12 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005need debate and discussion. Cancer medicine is a very difficult and subtle art form - you add sci-ence to the art. It's so easy to do something thatis useless, harmful or just misleading.\" Smyth would like to see fewer meetings, appropriately themed at certain times, and whichalso open up more balanced debate on the impli-cations of research. Again, he hopes that FECS- or son of FECS - will be able to help stream-line events. He notes the standing ovation given to a Herceptin (trastuzumab) breast cancer trial paperat the last American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO) meeting, but is concerned that theensuing headlines are picked up by patients andlobbyists without prior debate about cost impli-cations and priority setting for treatment andscreening. \"Glivec is another good example -drugs like this can place huge unscheduled bur-dens on our health funders. But these 'irre-sistible' drugs don't come out of the blue - resultsare known well in advance of the big announce-ments and we should have systems that allowgovernments to anticipate research. We have totake responsibility for the hype and curtail it toallow data to settle in a more mature way.\" Part of the streamlining process involves drug licensing and relationships with the drugindustry. Smyth's primary interest in drug devel-opment, extensive consulting work and positionson the British and European approval bodieshave given him considerable insight into phar-ma's workings - although some decisions remaina mystery. \"We have to have a more open, honestand practical dialogue with industry. Over 25years I've seen the attitude that academia is eth- ically pure and industry is commercially tainted.While such views may have had some validity, wehave to recognise now that pharma has extra-ordinary financial resources, some of the world'sbest scientists and the best technology. My con-tact with companies tells me that unless the sci-ence is sound and the medicine works they willnot try and sell it.\" For EMEA, his hope is that it will offer an equivalent European licensing marketplace forthe industry to the US Food and DrugAdministration, where most commercial activityis currently focused. This should come about asrecognition grows that Europe has different pri-orities to the US and may offer a better route tomarket for some drugs. Smyth adds that EMEA'sscientific advisory committee is also very keen toopen up dialogue with industry to make sure that'pivotal' Phase III trials are done to a high stan-dard, with the result that medicines are madeavailable faster to the public. \"It's tragic whenmillions of euros are spent on a Phase III trialthat is poorly conceived and we can't give alicence - not because of the end result, butbecause the protocol was not well designed. I'vehad recent experience of this, and it is hard tounderstand why companies set out on expensivetrials that are fatally flawed.\" However, while it's in everyone's interest to shorten time to market, he adds that he's nothappy with some recent fast-tracking - in partic-ular Iressa (gefitinib), which was approved in theUS from non-randomised trials, and which hashigher toxicity than anticipated. \"The pendulum \"Education isn't about handing out recipes from a textbook. You need debate and discussion\" \"With more treatment opportunities than we can afford, how do we prioritise?\"CoverStory CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 13has swung too far away from our previous very conservative stance,\" he says. While stressing that the oncology world needs to play its part in becoming much betterorganised, Smyth says that societies - nations,that is - have to create ways of involving the pub-lic in healthcare decision making. \"It's one of thethings I'm really interested in and it fits in withmy remit at FECS and drug licensing - and I'vespoken on public platforms about it. With somany more opportunities for cancer research andtreatment than we can afford, how do we set pri-orities? It's absolutely clear to me that such deci-sions are not for doctors or lobbying groupsalone, but in Britain I know of no public forumwhere we argue the case for healthcare.\" While noting that the EU breast cancer res- olution is a good example of effective lobbying,he comments: \"You will always find people whosupport breast cancer for well understood rea-sons - but it's a pity if society has to fall back ongroups of vulnerable patients and a few spokes-people who can argue their case.\" Meanwhile, healthcare administrators such as hospital directors should not be placed in aposition where they have to choose between dif-ferent cancer treatments. That leaves the politi-cians - and Smyth has no truck with the\"unspeakable nonsense\" they spout at electiontimes. Those who do take responsibility have hisadmiration - such as the Finnish health ministerwho addressed the last European CancerConference (ECCO) meeting. \"She said thatultimately she makes the decisions and stands bythem.\" He would like to see such debate more closely linked with health promotion efforts,mentioning that Scotland has one of the world'sbest melanoma databases - and although inci-dence in men has trebled in the last 20 years,survival has improved thanks to an allied educa-tion programme that has seen people presentingearlier. Prevention is another area he wants todevote more time to, especially strategies thattarget young people. If all this sounds like far too much work for any one person, Smyth says his university will begiving him time out to do the FECS work - he'sseen too many colleagues overloading themselvesto make the mistake of stretching himself too thinly. Home life is probably less frantic now thathis four daughters have grown up and are safelypursuing non-medical careers, and there's acountry cottage to retreat to. His bass voice isnow a bit too 'old' to sing on the big stage, but fly-ing is very much on the agenda - he and his wifehave recently flown over Mt Blanc and watchedwhales off the South African coast in a smallplane - as he says, you can't think of any otherproblems once at the controls. At 60, his immediate work ambitions lie in two areas. At FECS, in whatever shape itbecomes, he's intending to take a more \"harmo-nious\" message to European politicians and pro-fessional groups, recognising though that a lot oftime-consuming \"listening and talking\" will needto be done. In Edinburgh, with all the physicaland manpower resources in place for a moderncancer centre, the push is on for translationalresearch to be rolled out into clinical medicineand he's in no doubt that many new treatmentswill be available. \"Also, I hope I'll be around longenough to see a recreation of interest in academ-ic medicine in Britain,\" he adds. But what really makes him tick are \"family, champagne and humour - humour especially is avery important part of life, no more so than tocancer patients, for whom it's a coping strategy.\" No doubt a few bottles will be opened too if he gets everyone singing from the sameEuropean hymn sheet. En route for Mont Blancin a plane olderthan himself!Grand Round 14 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005ECCO 13, that great meet- ing and mixing place forthe cream of Europe'soncology researchers andclinical practitioners, gathers in Paris this October againsta background of momentous changesin oncology and Europe. Rapid advances in molecular biology are opening a new era of tar-geted treatments, requiring scientistsin basic, translational and clinicalresearch to work together in anunprecedented way. At the clinicallevel, there is an accelerating trendtowards specialisation of treatmentby organ. The process, althoughuneven, is associated with better out-comes, raising questions of whetherpatients should be treated only bypractitioners and units accredited forthe relevant organ. Meanwhile, theexpansion of Europe is opening upopportunities to disseminate knowl-edge and best practice. Debates over how heavily Europe invests inresearch, how it organises itsresearch effort, what support it givesto clinical and paediatric research allrequire the cancer community tomake its voice heard. But concerns that the voice of European oncology is weak and divid-ed have prompted a heated debateover the need to reform - or replace -the Federation of European CancerSocieties (FECS), the body that organ-ises the biennial ECCO conferences.This debate is expected to culminatein the announcement of the launch ofa single European cancer society. FECS has been the voice of oncologists in Europe for a quarter ofa century. It is an umbrella organisa-tion for the six main oncology disci-plines: the European Society forTherapeutic Radiology and Oncology(ESTRO), the European Society ofSurgical Oncology (ESSO), Paediatric Oncology,Europe (EONS)and the European Association forCancer Research (EACR). But critics argue that FECS is fundamentally flawed. It is organisedchiefly along disciplinary lines anddoes not represent thousands of clini-cians who treat cancer patients butidentify themselves as organ special-ists rather than cancer specialists -gynaecologists, urologists, or gastro-intenstinal surgeons for example.Being a federation, it is difficult tospeak with the full weight and author-ity of Europe's oncologists, unless thesix member societies have a commonline. Furthermore, while eachmember society continues to holdseparate congresses, showcasing their Anna WagstaffOn the road to a single European cancer society Members of the Federation of European Cancer Societies are debating how to present a united front to win a better deal for research and treatment.But how can disciplines with different priorities and agendas speak with one voice?CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 15Grand Round CORBIS / CONTRASTOGrand Round achievements and highlighting their own issues, Europe's oncologists willnever have the public profile or lobby-ing power that ASCO (the AmericanSociety of Clinical Oncology) offers tocolleagues in the US. Even the critics agree that FECS was a wonderful creation, bringingtogether oncology disciplines at atime when the concept of multidisci-plinary treatment was in its infancy.Luigi Cataliotti, president of theEuropean Society of SurgicalOncology (ESSO) remembers hisfirst ECCO conference, 20 years ago,as a unique forum. \"It was acompletely different way to approachcancer. The principal of an ECCOconference is to listen to speakers youwould not normally hear; to listen tobasic researchers, or as a surgeon goto a medical oncology symposium.\" However, almost everyone, includ- ing Cataliotti, agrees that FECS mustadjust to some new realities. Harry Bartelink, outgoing presi- dent of FECS, has led calls for oncol-ogists to work more closely with one 16 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005ing up EORTC, which conductsmost of Europe's clinical trials, forthe new era of molecular biology andtargeted treatments. The strategy isto make sure that, wherever possible,clinical trials comparing one outcomeagainst another include a translation-al research element, using tech-niques such as gene profiling orgenomic or proteomic analysis to dis-tinguish which patients will benefitfrom which treatments. Everything depends on getting basic/translational and clinicalresearchers to work closely - and to getthe research funds. The EORTC isassembling a network of core academ-ic institutes and cancer centres thatare able to collect and store tissue, andhave the labs and scientists to carry outhigh-tech analysis. It is building itsown academic research fund with aview to providing seed money for whatcould be costly trials, and is hoping toconvince the EU that its work is worthfunding. It is advising research teamshow to cope with the obstacles posedby the way the clinical trials directivehas been implemented in eachMember State, and is putting pressureon the EU to revise the directive. Eggermont believes there are huge prizes to be won from exploringtargeted treatments, so long as thecancer community can convince thepublic and politicians. He points outthat EORTC receives funding fromthe US National Cancer Institute,while the EU refuses to contribute, asituation he describes as madness.\"You need a unified organisation thatis so powerful that the politicianscould not avoid seriously dealing withit. I would argue for an organisationthat would bring together the scienceand the clinical parts of the oncologyworld, represented on a board thatwill define policy, and prioritise pro-grammes, education and training. Byanother. He says that, despite FECS nominally bringing everyone together,and despite its emphasis on multidis-ciplinarity and on bringing basicresearch to the clinic, member soci-eties have always worked on theirown. \"The only overlapping item wasthe ECCO conference. Now wewant to bring them under one roof,with one organisation, and one frontfacing the outside world, and takinggreat care to create much closer con-tact between the disciplines, as wellas incorporating the organ-orientedspecialists.\" Bartelink believes that the current fragmentation is fatally underminingthe efforts of the cancer community tomake its voice heard. One result, heclaims, is that cancer is missing out onresearch money, despite its high level ofscientific credibility. \"Other areas aregetting more attention. That is some-where that we failed, and others werestronger in promoting their own area.\" His big fear is that the era of tar- geted drugs, each with a higher pricetag than the last, could lead to a US-style two-tier health system develop-ing in Europe, where only peoplewho can afford a higher insurancepremium get access to the latest ther-apies. He is convinced that a unitedvoice from European oncologists willbe far more influential in persuadinggovernments and health insurancesystems to provide the funding need-ed to ensure equal access to qualitytreatment, than if the task is simplyleft to medical oncologists. He alsobelieves that a united oncology voicecould play a role in persuading theindustry to charge affordable prices. Lex Eggermont, president of the European Organisation for Researchand Treatment of Cancer (an affiliateof FECS), is another champion ofthe proposed European cancer socie-ty.

These arguments have been around a long time, but at the end oflast year they came to a head when themedical oncologists warned that if rad-ical changes were not made, theywould pull out and go it alone. Thiswas no empty threat, because it is themedical oncologists - the ones whosign prescriptions and carry out clini-cal trials - who attract lucrative phar-maceutical industry interest in theECCO conferences, and FECS andsome of its member societies rely onthis money to a greater or lesser extent,to finance their work. Consequently,much of this year has been taken upwith discussions to find a way forwardthat everyone can live with. This is not just a case of medical oncologists holding a gun to the headof other FECS societies. The need forchange is recognised well beyond theranks of ESMO. Eggermont, surgeon, oncologist. Moreover, thereare many medical oncologists in theESMO leadership, including its presi- dent Paris Kosmidis, whoare deeply committed to the multidis-ciplinary approach and veryreluctant to break ranks with otherFECS societies. At issue here is not whether European oncologists need to changethe way they are organised, so much ashow. In particular, how to achieve a more powerful unified voice for oncol-ogy as a whole, while ensuring that allparts of the European professionaloncology world are effectively repre-sented and able to address their partic-ular challenges. How to strike this bal-ance within the structure of a unifiedcancer society is the subject of heateddebate between FECS members, whomust each defend their own speciali-ties, while benefiting oncology and thetreatment of cancer patients as awhole. Europe's medical oncologists craverecognition. They look at theASCO conference - that glittering US stage where medical oncologistsparade in front of the world's media -and they want it. And with some rea-son. Despite a seven-fold gap inresearch funding, 50% of presentationsat ASCO come from Europe, includinga good proportion of papers presentedat the prestigious plenary sessions. The contrast could hardly be greater with Europe, where medicaloncology is not universally recognisedas a specialist discipline. ESMOpresident, Paris Kosmidis, says thatthis damages patient care, more thanit wounds his members' pride. \"If you go to the US, in which med-ical oncology is the leading force foroncology, and you look at five-yearsurvival and the treatment outcomesof cancer patients, it is much betterthan in Europe. They have well-organised training programmes, theyhave officially qualified physicians,and each cancer patient receives theproper and right treatment.\" By contrast, in Germany, patients are routinely prescribed chemothera-py by gynaecologists whose primarytraining is in surgery, or by physicianswho lack specialist oncology training.In other European countries, drugsmay be prescribed by 'clinical oncol-ogists' who are also responsible fordelivering radiotherapy. ESMO has been campaigning for years for medical oncology to berecognised as a specialist discipline.The society is conducting Europe-wide research into medical oncologyservices to establish, country bycountry, how many medical oncolo-gists there are, how they weretrained, the number of comprehen-sive cancer centres, which drugs areavailable and whether all cancers aretreated properly. ESMO has also built a network within EU countries working towardsGrand Round ESMO WHAT'S DRIVING ESMO? Paris Kosmidis: A single, powerful European cancer society is essential so that Europe'stop oncologists can win better recognitionnearer to homeGrand Round greater homogeneity of training, with a minimum of five years. Where suchtraining doesn't exist, ESMO tries tofill the gap. Currently ESMO is focus-ing on training programmes in Centraland Eastern European countries,including Estonia, Latvia, Poland andRomania. \"The progress they havemade is really amazing,\" says Kosmidis.\"We see these people coming to ourconference and presenting their ownresearch work.\" Medical oncologysocieties have been springing up fast inthese countries, and are now busy dis-seminating the latest knowledge andlobbying their own politicians. However, it is slow progress, and many European medical oncologistsfeel they are being held back by thelack of a public platform equivalent toASCO. They hope the proposed singleEuropean cancer society may be ableto offer such a platform. If not, thedemands to go it alone will continue. Kosmidis looks to ASCO as his model for the new unified society. Thisis a controversial choice, becausealthough it is a society of 'clinicaloncologists', it is dominated by med-ical oncology to the virtual exclusion ofall else. Kosmidis argues this is justi-fied by research and clinical reality. \"Ifyou compare the progress that hasbeen made in surgery, radiotherapyand medical oncology, the differenceis tremendous. The progress that hasbeen made in the survival, quality oflife and disease free survival is relatedabsolutely and directly to the treat-ment of chemotherapy. If you look atcolon, breast and lung cancer, you willsee that all the most recent prolonga-tion of life has come through targeted 18 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005treatments. One example is Herceptin[trastuzumab], which will probablysoon be given on an adjuvant basis.These patients live longer and certain-ly some of them will be cured. We'venever seen that before.\" Kosmidis would like to see the proposed European cancer societyopen to all disciplines, but based onindividual members. \"Members givepower to the society. We feel that onesociety which is really multidiscipli-nary is an absolute necessity forEurope to make progress in treatment,prevention, palliation, education andin more powerful lobbying of politi-cians. It is our obligation as leaders.\" Kosmidis will look in vain for otherFECS societies to share hisenthusiasm for the ASCO model. However, he can count on many in thesurgeons' society, ESSO, to support asingle, membership-based society,albeit from a different perspective. The president of ESSO, Luigi Cataliotti, points out that surgeryremains the single most importantcurative treatment for cancer, andbecomes ever more central with earlydiagnosis. He wants an organisationthat can attract all the surgeons whooperate on cancer in Europe, many ofwhom do not see themselves as 'can-cer surgeons'. Most of these surgeonsdo not work exclusively with cancerand identify themselves primarily asgeneral surgeons, gynaecologists,urologists, head and neck surgeons,and so on. It has been difficult forESSO to recruit them. While theItalian Society of Surgeons alone hasa membership of 6000 - a large pro-portion of whom do cancer opera-tions - ESSO's entire Europeanmembership languishes at around2,000 surgeons. Paradoxically, Cataliotti believes a single cancer society could be theanswer, because by breaking downthe boundaries between disciplines itwould provide a space for multidisci-plinary organ-specialist groups thatcancer surgeons could more readilyrelate to. This would also tackle whathe sees as the main professional issuefacing ESSO - persuading surgeonsto become part of a truly multidisci-plinary culture. \"The first thing that a surgeon has to lose is the principle of beinga 'prima donna',\" says Cataliotti. \"A'prima donna' surgeon is not a good \"The first thing that a surgeon has to lose is the principle of being a prima donna\"ESSO THE SURGEONS ' CASE FOR UNITY Luigi Cataliotti: A single society could provide space for multidisciplinaryorgan-specialist groups like EUSOMA,which cancer surgeons could relate toCANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 19surgeon treating cancer, because you have to accept the collaboration ofothers. When we visit a patient withbreast cancer, we start together, theradiologist, the pathologist, the sur-geon, the plastic surgeon, the radio-therapist and the medical oncologist,from the beginning - not after thesurgical treatment. Patients have tofollow a very well-defined pathway.This is the main issue, to create thismentality.\" ESSO has discussed turning itself into a federation to which organbased societies could affiliate, butthe latest proposals for a singleEuropean cancer society are nowseen as a possible way forward,although enthusiasm within ESSOfor dissolving into a larger society isby no means universal. Cataliotti is also currently President of EUSOMA, theEuropean Society of Mastology,which has blazed a trail with guide-lines on training and accreditation ofall the disciplines involved in treatingbreast cancer, and accreditation ofspecialist breast cancer units. He isconvinced that organising aroundmultidisciplinary organ-based groupsis the way to go, and talks of fledglinggroups already in existence for urolo-gists, coloproctologists, lung sur-geons and others. \"Very often small hospitals exist in Europe where patients with a gas-tric cancer, for example, are treatedby a surgeon who at the same timeoperates breast, colorectal, and thy-roid cancer. Governments have to beconvinced that to improve canceroutcomes, they have to accredit units, accredit specialists, and insiston proper training.\" He believes thata strong unified European cancersociety would be ideally placed toconvince them. Cataliotti can foresee ESSO as a 'faculty' within a new cancer society,while EUSOMA will probably be theorgan group for breast cancer multi-disciplinary treatment. But he doesn'tunderestimate the problems in mak-ing such far reaching changes. \"Wecan imagine what will happen in 5 or10 years, but the first period will bedifficult. We have a reality that has tobe respected. ESSO exists, and themembers of ESSO don't want to losetheir identity. They want to recognisethemselves. At the same time,EUSOMA members want to pre-serve the identity of a society of spe-cialists who work under the umbrellaof breast cancer, because it has beenterribly efficient and constructive.The new society has to guaranteethat surgeons or breast specialistscan work together as a faculty or as agroup.\" The key question is whether can- cer surgeons who did not join ESSOcan be persuaded to join a unifiedEuropean cancer society. \"WhatESSO members are saying is: 'Pleasetake it slowly. Not in a few months,but in a few years, or we will lose thechance to encourage surgeons in allspecialities with an interest in cancerto be members of the new societyand to give their contribution to themultidisciplinary approach to cancertreatment.\" The other group most inclined tovalue unity over autonomy is the paediatric oncology society, SIOPE.Paediatric oncologists have never hada problem with their own identity,but they feel appallingly let down bythe political establishment and arelooking for a powerful voice that cancompel governments and the EU topay more attention to children withcancer in Europe. Between 60% and 80% of drugs given to child cancer patients are notactually licensed for use in children.The potential for lifelong damage bythese powerful drugs and by radio-therapy is all the greater in bodiesthat are still developing.Paediatricians are desperate to seeGrand Round Between 60% and 80% of drugs given to child cancer patients are not licensed for use in children SIOP EUROPE PAEDIATRICIANS IN SEARCH OF A VOICE G\u00fcnter Henze: The voice of cancer in Europe must be strong; a paediatric facultywould provide adequate representationfor the paediatric oncologists Grand Round targeted drugs developed for their patients, and for molecular markersthat can tell them which childrenneed intensive treatment, and whichcan be spared. SIOPE president G\u00fcnter Henze says that paediatricians do what theycan with limited resources. Theyhave a strong culture of internationalnetworking, reflected in the fact thatthe majority of child cancer patients(as high as 95% in Germany) areenrolled in treatment optimisationtrials. He argues that this research-driven approach to treatment hascaused mortality rates to fall faster inchildhood cancers than in other can-cers in recent decades. \"We analysethe results, we look for strengths andweaknesses, and then adapt the sub-sequent trials to the results.\" Because childhood cancers are too rare to be of much interest to thepharmaceutical industry, and in theabsence of significant governmentfunding, child cancer research isheavily dependent on charity funding- and vast quantities of unpaid over-time. But this fragile research basehas been badly damaged by the EUclinical trials directive, which hasmade trials more bureaucratic andhas more than doubled the cost ofconducting a trial. The paediatric system of research based treatment is not justunderfunded, but is actuallypenalised in some countries. InGermany, health insurance compa-nies have, on occasion, refused to payfor patients treated within clinical tri-als because they say it is science andnot health care. Now the EU clinicaltrial directive is increasing the costs,particularly of international trials.Henze believes that this added bur-den is unsustainable, and says if theEU makes laws, it must also providethe financial support to make it pos- 20 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005sible to comply with them. With the support of FECS, SIOPE has convinced MEPs tosponsor amendments to the DraftRegulation on Medicinal Productsfor Paediatric Use to guarantee thatthe needs of the academic sector aretaken into account. Most of thesewere accepted at the first reading ofthe draft legislation in earlySeptember. However, the main focusof the Regulation is on encouragingpharmaceutical companies to under-take clinical trials for paediatric indi-cations, by extending their patentsfor six months. Henze says, \"Trial protocols - highly complicated treatment plans - are being written by paedi-atric oncologists in the evenings andon weekends and holidays. This isserious work, and it has to be paidfor. We cannot have a situation wherepharmaceutical companies say 'weneed this price' and the manufactur-ers of equipment say 'we need thisprice', and there is no money left forphysicians and nurses. We are treat-ing life-threatening malignant dis-ease, and everything that has to dowith these diseases cannot be anissue of charity.\" Unlike the other FECS societies, SIOPE is not an independent society,but part of the international SIOPnetwork. With no full-time secretari-at of its own, and a pressing need fora greater voice at the political level,the prospect of being part of a pow-erful unified European cancer socie-ty is attractive, provided paediatriconcologists can trust that society tofight for them. Henze clearly believesthey can. \"The voice of cancer inEurope must be strong, and if wehave a paediatric faculty within thesociety, I think this would give a rea-sonable representation for paediatriconcology.\" Of all the FECS member soci-eties, radiation therapists and oncologists are probably most happywith the status quo. There are noissues about recognition, as radio-therapists work almost exclusivelywith cancer, in tightly organised mul-tidisciplinary teams concentrated inthe larger hospitals and cancer cen-tres. They are also relatively confi-dent in their powers of political lob-bying. Their priority, according toESTRO president Michael Brada, isto ensure equity of access to highstandards of radiation everywhere inEurope and promote research intoimproving treatment results. Radiotherapy, he says, is given to 50% of all cancer patients and is thesecond most important curativetreatment after surgery. It is also themost technical of the three clinicaloncology disciplines. A good service requires up-to- date equipment, adequate mecha-nisms to ensure that the equipmentESTRO RADIOTHERAPISTS ARGUE FOR A HALF -WAY HOUSE Michael Brada: A cooperative of societies that could join forces where appropriatewould be best. If everyone merges intoa single structure, individuals may feel lost CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 21works as it should, and investment to update radiation oncologists, physi-cists, biologists and technologists inthe latest techniques and multidisci-plinary approaches. ESTRO recently completed a study of the radiation oncology needsin each country together with a sur-vey of the availability of equipmentand skilled personnel. The findings,says Brada, document huge discrep-ancies across Europe, and shouldprovide a potent lobbying tool. \"Wewant to make this information avail-able for each individual country sothat the societies within each ofthese countries can appeal to theirgovernments that this is the standardthat is required.\" ESTRO has also put into place EQUAL, a Europe-wide qualityassurance programme. Radiotherapycurrently involves complex tech-niques, some of which allow far high-er radiation doses than were previ-ously possible, making the accuracyof dose delivered particularly critical.EQUAL developed quality assurancetools, and has a centre in Paris thatprovides quality assurance teststhroughout Europe. At the same timeESTRO is encouraging radiationoncologists to lobby for quality assur-ance programmes within their owncountries. Education is also a priority, with 13 annual ESTRO courses as well asconferences. Brada says: \"We feelthat this education should spread toall European countries and every-body should have access to it, regard-less of the wealth of the country.\"Attendances from Eastern andCentral European countries in particular have been strongly encour-aged through heavy subsidies.ESTRO can point to notablelobbying success at EU and nationallevels, resulting in significant invest-ment programmes in the UK and theNetherlands, improvements thatBrada hopes will be replicated inother European countries. ESTRO has also done better than other FECS societies in gettingits hands on EU research grants, tofinance - amongst other research -their work on quality assurance andthe research into disparities acrossEurope. Brada accepts that FECS needs to find ways to appeal to a broaderlayer of cancer professionals, and heis not hostile to the idea of a singleEuropean cancer society. But hewould prefer a \"cooperative\" of soci-eties rather than an individual mem-ber society. \"I'm not sure our mem-bers want to be part of some enor-mous organisation where their voicegets lost. \"It would be much simpler if each organisation remainsautonomous, but joins forces inactivities that are better carried outtogether, such as PR, lobbying,annual conferences and educationalactivities. Beyond that, each oneshould be able to do what they needfor their own professionals. \"If a single very big structure is created, individuals disappear andthe leadership is just some distantheadquarters. It is likely that every-body will get disenchanted and cre-ate a repeat of their own society.\" IFanyone has cause to be disen-chanted, it is probably basic cancer researchers. EACR PresidentBill Gullick maintains an impeccablediplomatic silence, but he is clearlynot happy with the direction of thedebate. It could be that, as past pres-ident of FECS, he values theFederation and sees no need forchange. But he and his members mayalso wonder what basic researcherswill get from an organisation thatcynics may claim has been created tosatisfy the medical oncologists' desireto capture the limelight. The targeted treatments that medical oncologists want to parade ata European equivalent of the ASCOconference are, after all, the result ofdecades of work by basic scientists,Grand Round Availability of radiotherapy equipment and skilled personnel varies enormously across EuropeEACR WHOSE RESEARCH IS IT ANYWAY ?

It is the views of patientorganisations that politicians care aboutGrand Round delving into the way our bodies regu- late themselves: identifying signallingnetworks, documenting genomic pro-files, visualising and thegenes, proteins and other compo-nents in molecular detail. Further-more, the contribution of basic andtranslational researchers will beessential to the introduction andevaluation of any individualised can-cer drugs in the future. Gullick says: \"This is a challenge for all of us. It involves a number ofgroupings who have not worked veryclosely before - basic scientists,translational researchers, biotechcompanies and pharmaceutical com-panies - as well as organisations suchas the patient advocacy groups whocan affect political decisions as towhether these types of medicines aremade available.\" Gullick's own laboratories at the University of Kent, UK, are currentlyinvestigating why only 30% of breastcancer patients who test Her+respond to trastuzumab (Herceptin).Finding an answer to this questionmay prove vital in persuading govern-ments to make this drug available asan adjuvant. They are also trying to develop simpler tests that do not requireDNA sequencing, and can be done ina standard hospital pathology lab. Gullick sees resources for research as the biggest challenge.Like many others, he was shocked bythe findings of a survey that showedEurope spends one-seventh of theamount invested in cancer researchin the US. \"Most of the problems of 22 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005translational research are due tofunding. \"There are three countries in Europe that invest around 400 mil-lion euro each - the UK, France andGermany. Then there is a group ofcountries such as the Netherlands,Sweden and Italy that invest around50 million euro, and the rest haveeffectively no spend on cancerresearch at all. So one of the issuesis: why is there such an enormousheterogeneity of activity?\" Despite lack of investment and poor career opportunities, whichcause many young scientists to optfor other professions, this is a stimu-lating time for basic cancerresearchers. The science is progressing at a dizzying speed and scientists areenjoying the experience of workingclose to the clinical frontline and see-ing the impact they are having onpatients. Gullick is excited by the younger generation who do opt for cancerresearch. \"We've just chosen theEACR Young Cancer ResearcherAward, and to say I was impressed isan understatement. We had five orsix candidates who were simply out-standing. We are going to sponsorthem to go to ECCO to present theirwork to give an opportunity for otherscientists to hear these results andlearn from them.\" He is equally excited by the potential of young scientists fromEastern and Central Europeancountries. EACR has been makingconsiderable efforts to draw them in,particularly through its fellowship programme, which offers a chance towork in some of Europe's leadingcancer research institutes. One result is that the EACR con- ference has been rapidly growing inboth size and stature - Gullick is par-ticularly pleased to be welcomingleading medical oncologists like Jos\u00e9Baselga to the next EACR confer-ence. More than 700 people attended last year, among them an Americanresearcher who said that if a confer-ence of such a high scientific levelhad taken place in the US, it wouldhave had an attendance of 7,000.That shows, says Gullick, that theproblem is not with the quality ofEurope's scientists. Given the pressing need to con- vince the politicians to put moremoney into cancer research, theprospect of a single, powerful cancersociety might seem attractive. ButGullick believes governments onlylisten to patient organisations, andthink that scientists are interested inscience for its own sake. \"We areseen as a special interest group andtreated as any other special interestgroup.\" A unified cancer society could deprive researchers of the public pro-file they are beginning to build, afterdecades of pioneering work. If thenew society bears any resemblance toASCO, they have every reason to fearthe spotlight will fall on clinicalresearchers, eclipsing the contribu-tion of basic research and their needfor resources. \"It is an exciting time for basic cancer researchers - the science is progressing at a dizzying speed\"CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 23Oncology nurses are equally scep- tical about a new unified cancer society, although for different rea-sons. EONS president Jan Foubertargues that FECS never acted as atruly multidisciplinary society andthat the proposed new structure islikely to be even more narrowlyfocused. The Federation, he says, never lobbied for the nurses' cause, thoughFoubert accepts part of the blame,saying that EONS should perhapshave demanded more. But he saysthat while EONS did participate inmeetings, they never felt their voicewas heard. He cites as one examplethe lack of response by the othersocieties to EONS' suggestions foradding a nursing research element toproposed clinical studies. \"When they talk about multidis- ciplinary, they mean the surgeon, theradiotherapist and the oncologist. Forme, and for most nurses, it alsomeans nurses, psychologists, dieti-cians, physicians - all the people who are taking care of the cancer patient.\" Well-trained cancer nurses, he argues, are absolutely essential to pro-viding adequate patient care. Theyspend more time with patients. Theysupport them and their families, advis-ing on nutrition and ways to cope withstress, nausea and fatigue. They play akey role in symptom management,advising patients about treatments toalleviate pain, anaemia or neutropenia,and teaching them to recognise whensymptoms need immediate attention.In short, good oncology nurses are vitalfor addressing the problems that can-cer patients find hardest to live with. The trouble is, only a few coun- tries offer nurses the training orresponsibility to fulfil this role, andthere are wide discrepancies acrossEurope. In some countries becominga cancer nurse requires a full extrayear of training; others require only aone-day course, or modules. EONSis campaigning for oncology nursingto be fully recognised as an accredit-ed speciality throughout Europe, butfundamental differences in culturalapproaches to nursing make this anuphill struggle. While some countriessee it as an academic profession, withdegree and PhD courses, othersregard nursing as strictly vocational.In some countries, you can become anurse at 16 years of age. The focus of EONS has therefore been on education. They have puttogether a core oncology nursing cur-riculum, which details contents, con-tact hours and how the courses shouldbe taught. However, it is not a recog-nised European standard, and eachcountry chooses its own approach. A new EU initiative, the Bologna Agreement, is set to change all this,through a common European modelfor higher education. Under its termsa nursing qualification will be definedas a bachelor's degree, and further bachelor standard qualifications willbe required for specialist nursing.This offers a uniform system wherenurses need a degree and a furtherdegree in oncology nursing. EONS isrestructuring its core curriculum to fitthe competency-based Bolognamodel, and wants its course to be thestarting point for discussions on anoncology nursing curriculum. EONS has also constructed cours- es on such topics as fatigue manage-ment, nutrition, and most recently onhaematological toxicities (TITAN). Thetake up of courses is increasing asoncology nurses become more organ-ised and as EONS gains experience inadministering courses for differentnursing cultures in many languages. In eight years, the number of national societies in EONS has risenfrom 22 to 28, with Bulgaria the latestof an influx of countries from Easternand Central Europe. The fact that 23societies expressed an interest in theTITAN course illustrates the impactthat EONS is having. EONS has gained respect and self-confidence and now seems tohave escaped from the shadow of themedical disciplines in FECS. \"Wehave become an independent organi-sation, with our own strategy, busi-ness plan and sponsoring, our owngood conference and our own part-nerships with industry,\" says Foubert.It has also found itself a new strategicumbrella group, in the recentlyformed European Federation ofNurses (EFN), a body with EU sta-tus that has as its aim to \"strengthenthe status and practice of the profes-sion of nursing and the interests ofnurses in the EU and Europe\".EONS is part of the EuropeanSpecialist Nursing Organisations sec-tion of the EFN and has a seat on theEFN General Assembly. Grand Round EONS NURSES ON THE SIDELINES Jan Foubert: I think we will get more by working with European nursingorganisations, but if there is a new Europeancancer society, we will keep the door openGrand Round Foubert says bluntly, \"I think we would have more chance to haveoncology nursing recognised as a spe-cialty by working with European nurs-ing organisations than by workingwith the current FECS.\" However, heis advising the EONS council to keepthe door open to any new Europeancancer society: \"We should partici-pate in the months and years ahead tosee how this new society will look.You have to keep talking and hopethese people will listen to you.\" DID SOMENE SAY UNITY ? Six FECS societies reflect six different sets of problems, and conflicting prior-ities. With the inevitable argumentsover where research, money, trainingand equipment, should be concentrat-ed, could a unified European cancersociety ever be a runner? Bartelink,who as President of FECS speaks assomewhat of a father figure, has littledoubt. \"This is really the strong argu- ment for the new society. Becausethis debate should happen inside thesociety. It is much better to have thismultidisciplinary approach within theboard or wherever, rather than havemedical oncologists 'all patientsneed and two days 'we need modern linearaccelerators' and ESSO says 'allhospitals need modern laparoscopicsurgery'. That would be a disaster,because none of the three will get themoney.\" The question for the FECS soci- eties is who will be the dominantvoice? Will everyone have an equalsay, or will some end up trapped, with 24 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005neither power nor profile, within aEuropean ASCO? Eggermont, from EORTC, acknowledges this concern, particular-ly among smaller organisations, butargues that it is when each societyfights for itself that only the most pow-erful voices are heard. \"I think that pre-cisely the smaller organisations - forinstance the scientists in the EACR, orthe surgeons - have everything to gainfrom the creation of a European cancersociety, because hardnosed discussionsand scientists will drive the agenda. Idon't think those discussions wouldnecessarily be dominated by medicaloncologists. They would be dominatedby realistic priority setting, by agreeingthat everything will be science and evi-dence driven. It is a much better plat-form to create a political and represen-tative agenda.\" Bartelink is clear that most European oncologists do not want toadopt the ASCO model or to singleout medical oncologists as contribut-ing the most to progress in cancertreatment. \"Let us not forget thatsurgery and radiotherapy are still thetreatments that cure most cancerpatients. Progress has come from allthe disciplines. Surgeons have devel-oped techniques that are less muti-lating, radiation oncologists have sig-nificantly improved their technology,producing less severe side-effects,and higher cure rates, and, of course,medical oncology, thanks to newresearch developments, has con-tributed too.\" Despite these assurances and Kosmidis's insistence that ESMO hasno wish to eclipse other disciplines,many see it as inevitable that money and influence from close ties withindustry will make ESMO top dog ina single organisation. Whether thatturns out to be the case, depends inpart on the hard bargaining that isstill going on within the Federation todetermine how much autonomy andfinancial resources different disci-plines will have, and how the leader-ship of the proposed society will bedetermined. Getting this right could set the scene for the blossoming of a multidis-ciplinary organ-specialist approach,and give Europe's cancer professionalsa unified and powerful voice that cansecure desperately needed investmentsin research and services. Getting itwrong could set back the cause of atruly multidisciplinary approach thatrecognises that progress in cancer caremeans a great deal more than new andbetter drugs. Lex Eggermont: A single European cancer society will set realistic, science-drivenevidence-based priorities. The smaller FECSsocieties have most to gain \"It is when each society fights for itself that only the most powerful voices are heard\"DrugWatch 28 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005Over the past decade, vaccina- tion strategies for the treat-ment of cancer have been investigated with renewed vigour, per-haps catalysed by a greater under-standing of clinical successes achieved withmonoclonal antibody and cytokine-based therapies. However, before vac-cines become fully integrated into thearsenal of weapons currently used totreat cancer, they must show not onlyefficacy but also safety and limited orno toxicity. Recently, a number ofcancer vaccines have moved into thestages of development where clinicalbenefits and good safety profiles canbe determined convincingly. Reports from a number of Phase II and Phase III studies suggest cancervaccines are not only well-toleratedbut that they are also meeting clinicalendpoints, ranging from significanttumour responses to improvements inmedian survival time. Results fromsuch trials build on a significant bodyof Phase I clinical data which suggestthat, in general, this class of thera-peutic is safe and that the attributedadverse event rate is low. Cancer vac-cines that have such a safety profile may be readily integrated into currentstandard-of-care regimens, particularlyin the first-line setting where combi-nation strategies TARGETED VS NON -SPECIFIC Cancer immunotherapies can broadlybe divided into two categories:tumour-specific and highly-targetedproducts, for example vaccines orantibodies that target a specifictumour antigen, and therapies whichmodulate the immune system in anon-tumour-specific way. An exampleof the latter is BCG, which has beenused for many years in the treatmentof bladder cancer and has beenshown to provide superior benefitsover chemotherapy regimens inpatients with a high risk of progres-sion. While the precise mode ofaction of the treatment is not known,it is accepted that it has an effect onthe immune system. Likewise, the cytokines IL-2 (interleukin 2) and IFNa (interferon ) have found widespread use in thetreatment of different malignancies,such as renal cancer and melanoma, yet they offer only modest benefits andfrequently lead to toxic side-effects. In between these two approaches lie cell-based therapies, in which wholetumour cells or cell extracts are used asthe immunogen. While tumour-specificimmune responses may be induced,the precise target(s) of the response isnot usually known. Furthermore,immune responses against other com-mon tissue antigens may also beinduced. Despite the lack of finespecificity of the immune responseinduced and the labour involved in theproduction of autologous, cell-basedtherapies, a number of products havecompleted Phase II and Phase III tri-als with promising results. The explosion in the identifica- tion of tumour-associated antigens(TAAs) in multiple cancer typeswhich occurred in the 1990s repre-sented a critical phase in the ability toapply tumour immunology research tothe development of immunotherapystrategies.

The successfultargeting of specific tumour antigensin vivo has been exemplified by theuse of monoclonal antibodies.Although they failed to live up to theirpromise in the 1980s, they have sinceenjoyed a renaissance in the treat- ment of different cancers, and thereare currently eight therapeutic anti-bodies approved by the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) billion in 2004.While the success of monoclonal A number of studies suggest cancer vaccines are not only well-tolerated but meet clinical endpoints KAREN KASMAUSKI / CORBIS / CONTRASTO30 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005DrugWatch antibody therapies cannot be denied, other targeted approaches are nowwaiting in the wings, including vacci-nation. Unlike monoclonal antibodies,which are usually delivered as a bolusinfusion, a vaccine's therapeuticpotential has to be transducedthrough multiple biological stepswithin each patient before any clinicalbenefit is realised. This offers bothadvantages and disadvantages over themore direct effects of infused mono-clonal antibody therapies. On the pos-itive side, a vaccine-based approach: Induces a broad polyclonal cellularand humoral immune response Leads to a response of potentiallygreater longevity, requiring fewerinjections Does not require 'humanisation' ofthe immune response, unlike the useof monoclonal antibody therapies,which are usually of murine origin Costs less However, success is dependent on the induction of a potent and 'appro-priate' immune response in a patientgroup that may be immuno-compro-mised. Furthermore, an efficaciousresponse may take a month or more toinduce. Despite these drawbacks, adiverse array of cancer vaccines hasmade the transition from pre-clinicalresearch to clinical development overthe past 5-10 years. The positiveresults now being observed in the clin-ic owe much to a greater understand-ing of the immune system, the timingand method used to deliver the thera-peutic antigen(s) and the increasedsensitivity of monitoring tools. THE MAIN CONTENDERS Given the time and money requiredto take a product from pre-clinicalresearch to pivotal Phase III clinicaltrials, only a small number of cancervaccines have to date progressed tothe stage at which efficacy can beestablished convincingly. However, clinical responses including tumourshrinkage, disease stabilisation andimprovements in time-to-disease pro-gression are being reported in con-trolled trials. And more importantly,statistically significant increases inpatient survival have been detected(see Table).For example, in June 2004, AphtonCorporation of Philadelphiaannounced the results of a Phase IIItrial of Insegia, a synthetic peptide,similar to a portion of the hormoneGastrin 17, linked to the diphtheriatoxin. The study compared Insegiawith placebo in patients withadvanced pancreatic cancer anddemonstrated a statistically signifi-cant increase in patient survival time;150 days for patients receiving thevaccine compared to 83 days forthose on placebo. And in February 2005, Seattle- based Dendreon announced encour-aging results for its immunotherapyproduct autologous cells loaded ex vivo men with asymptomatic,metastatic androgen-independent(hormone-refractory) prostate cancerwhen compared to placebo.According to the final three-yearintent-to-treat analysis of the ran-domised Phase III study, patientsreceiving Dendreon's investigationalproduct showed a 4.5-monthimprovement in median survival timeand a more than three-fold increasein survival after 36 months comparedto patients receiving placebo. This isnow being followed up with a secondPhase III clinical trial, with the objec-tive of confirming recent findings so that FDA approval of Provenge maybe sought. Other immunotherapies have led to positive results in subsets of treat-ed patients, for example, antibodyresponders in Aphton's Phase trialof Insegia in colorectal cancerpatients, in including CancerVax'trials of Canvaxin in melanoma. Inthe latter study, retrospective analysesshowed treatment with Canvaxin,which consists of irradiated cancercell lines, significantly improved sur-vival of patients with stage IVmelanoma. The median overall sur-vival time of 268 patients with thecancer, who received Canvaxin fol-lowing the surgical removal of theirtumours, was 42.4 months comparedto 14.3 months for 170 historical con-trol patients who did not receive thevaccine. Furthermore, a Phase IIb study of Canadian firm Biomira's BLP25 lipo-some vaccine, a synthetic MUC1peptide encapsulated in a system, has shown encourag-ing improvements in overall survivalin non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC) patients - although it did notquite attain statistical significance -and it has been granted fast-trackapproval by the FDA. Another candidate is TroVax, a vaccine based on the TAA 5T4 deliv-ered by attenuated vaccinia virus,MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara),under investigation by OxfordBioMedica in the UK. A recent announcement reported interim data from two Phase II clini-cal trials in which TroVax was admin-istered in combination withchemotherapy to patients with late-stage colorectal cancer. Immune responses specific to antigen 5T4 were observed in 100%of patients who were suitable for analysis. This observation is particu-larly encouraging given that a retro-spective statistical analysis of datacollated from a Phase I/II studyshowed a highly significant correla-tion between the strength of 5T4-spe-cific immune responses and Transgene France. TEMPERED EXPECTATIONS Cancer vaccine strategies are often atodds with classical clinical develop-ment approaches. For example, theyare usually trialled in potentiallyrefractory patient groups in which theability to galvanise an immuneresponse may well be compromised.And the decision as to where a cancervaccine is best placed as a therapeu-tic is a difficult one. Scientifically, the adjuvant setting, in which diseaseburden is minimal, may well repre-sent the optimal slot to detect clinicalbenefits. However, it requires a bolddecision to commit to this type ofstudy, because large patient numbersare required and clinical endpointsare protracted. Financially, this trans-lates to trials that are exceptionallyexpensive to conduct and that takemany years to yield results, and this isproblematic, especially for biotechcompanies. The selection of bothindication and setting, whether adju-vant, first-line or second-line treat-ment, has to balance the speed inreaching clinical endpoints with thetime needed for the immuneresponse to become effective in 'dis-ease management'. The expectation that vaccines will cure cancer may have to be tem-pered in certain indications and set-tings. While tumour regressions havebeen in a number of clinicaltrials, stabilisation of disease leadingto enhanced survival may be a morerealistic expectation in patients with large tumour burdens or with rapidlygrowing cancers.Despite the challenges, this is anexciting time for the cancer vaccineinvestigational arena. Results fromsome of the Phase III trials, such asstudies on Canvaxin, GVAX andPANVAC-VF should be available thisyear or early 2006. If the primary objectives are met, product registration could followwithin a year or two. Furthermore, important advances are being made in the search for sur-rogate markers and the ability to pre-dict whether individual patients arelikely to respond to a specific treat-ment. Such information will help torefine the design of clinical trial pro-tocols and target patients who aremore likely to gain benefit from theimmunotherapy. Subsequently, it ishoped that cancer vaccines will soonbecome commonplace alongside sur-gery, chemotherapy and radiotherapyfor the treatment and management of cancer.

Yet in Europe, green tea is drunk by few.Which is a pity, because it is probablythe healthiest choice. Like black tea,green tea is made from the leaves ofthe tea plant Camellia sinensis . The difference is essentially that, forblack tea, the leaves are fermented,while for green tea they are not.Green tea therefore contains plentymore chemicals called polyphenols.These are It is theseingredients that may make green teagood for our health. Years ago, epidemiologists noted that cancer rates in populations thatconsume green tea were lower thanexpected. We should not get tooexcited about such findings. Forinstance, tea drinkers could also beavoiding things that cause cancer orhave a lifestyle that protects them.But encouraging results about greentea kept coming in and eventuallyformed a compelling body of evi-dence. The curiosity snowballed and,currently, research into the health aspects of green tea is buoyant.Studies in test tubes show that theingredients of green tea inhibittumour growth and cause the deathof cancer cells. In animal experi-ments, green tea impedes the devel-opment of chemically induced can-cers. Some green tea ingredientsseem to enhance the effect of anti-cancer drugs. Other compounds pro-tect our organs against the damagethat cancer drugs can have, forinstance, on the heart. Taken along-side chemotherapy, green tea couldmaximise the benefits of such drugsand minimise their risks. These effects may be valuable for a range of cancers. Importantly, theyare supported not just by one or twoinvestigations, but by dozens of stud-ies from around the world. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Do we have data from clinical tri- als, or is all this based on lab experi-ments? So far few such studies havebeen completed. A rare exception is aprospective investigation from Chinaof 254 women with ovarian cancer.While 78% of the green tea drinkerssurvived for longer than three years, the figure was only 48% for theabstainers. The authors of this studytherefore believe that \"increasing theconsumption of green tea ... mayenhance epithelial ovarian cancersurvival.\" Another analysis found similar effects for sufferers ofprostate cancer. Antioxidants in green tea are not only important for cancer, they mightalso play a role in cardiovascular dis-ease. Regular green tea consumptionnormalises lipid metabolism, reducesblood pressure, slightly lowers bodyweight, stabilises glucose metabolismin diabetes patients, and might evenneutralise some effects of smoking.Collectively these effects are likely toamount to a significant protectionfrom heart disease, stroke and othercardiovascular problems. However, clinical trials are again scarce. A Japanese team observed203 patients who underwent a coro-nary angioplasty. Of these, 109 hadcoronary artery disease while the resthad normal coronaries. Patients withnormal coronary arteries consumedsignificantly more green tea com-pared to those who had diseased Edzard Ernst*Green is the new black It enhances survival in ovarian and prostate cancer patients and protects their hearts against damage from chemotherapy drugs.

The authors were optimistic: \"The more green teapatients consume, the less likely theyare to have coronary artery disease.\"Before you rush out to buy a car loadof green tea, a word of caution. All these findings are encouraging but,to be sure, we really need the resultsof clinical trials. These will take awhile to come through. The goodnews is that green tea is delicious and refreshing. The bad news is that tomatch the dose used in the researchstudies, you need to drink up to 12cups a day.DrugWatch In a Chinese study, 78% of green tea drinkers, but only 48% of abstainers, were alive at three years TIZIANA AND GIANNI BALDIZZONE / CORBIS / CONTRASTOInsideTrack Playwright, dissident, and first President of post-communist Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel lost his first wife to cancer in 1996, and was himself diagnosed with lung cancer later that sameyear. He'd survived years of suppression and imprisonment and had begun to lead his countryinto a new era. How did Havel now cope with this new challenge? Cancer World asked him. Ihave to say that my cancer was surgically removed almost as soon as diagnosed, so Ireally did not experience cancer as a disease. Whatever experience I have is related to itsaccompanying effects or indirect consequences.A little tumour was discovered at a certain time- and basically by coincidence - in my lungs,which I did not feel or know about and whichdid not hurt. However, the tumour was very dan-gerous, growing fast, every day mattered, andtherefore I was soon operated. The surgery went well; it is true I lost a piece of my lung, but the tumour was removedand there were no remnants, metastases or otherconsequences. Nevertheless, the reduced size oflungs has resulted in a long series of secondarypulmonary ailments and I have also sufferedfrom diverticulitis, which is an intestinal dis-ease. I have become a man who is no longerquite healthy, I have even been through timeswhen I was on the verge of death, and I mustforever be very, very careful. With most serious ailments, it is always very important to have someone close, who gives thepatient strength. In my case, it was my wife whogave me strength and helped me, and who waswith me through everything. 34 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005As for medical care, I observed one thing: it isvery advisable to openly discuss such seriousdiseases with the patient from the very begin-ning. Unfortunately, the practice in our country- contrary, for example, to America - is not toreveal anything to the patient, particularly if heor she suffers from a serious disease. The reasons are understandable, of course, but my personal experience is that you arestronger if you know what you are sufferingfrom. The knowledge helps the patient face thedisease, as opposed to a situation when he orshe is drowning in a bottomless sea of secretsand concealment. I have also found that it isgood if doctors can cooperate as colleagues andrespect one another. Prestige and envy gamesare the worst thing a treated patient canencounter, and they invariably turn against thepatient at the end of the day. Doctors are human beings just like anyone else, with all human virtues and vices, they arenot something special, but my experience indi-cates that the more communicative a doctor is,the better he or she gets along with other doc-tors or nurses, seeks or gives advice, comparesopinions or defends his or her position, the bet-ter for the patient.Let's be honest... Vaclav Havel \"The more doctors feel able to seek advice and compare opinions, the better for the patient\"InsideTrack CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 35With his second wife, Dagmar Veskernova (Dasa). Havel credits her with saving his life. Following surgeryto remove half his right lung, he was on a ventilatorin intensive care when he seemed to be choking.Dasa was there on a visit, and it was she who summonedhelp. A few weeks later, Dasa and Vaclav Havelwere married Vaclav Havel Living in truth Telling it as it is has always been more than just a moral imperative for Havel. It is a political weapon that he usedfirst in the 1960s as a playwright who helped propelCzechoslovakia towards the political reforms and cul-tural revival that became known as the Prague Spring.After the invasion and occupation of his country byWarsaw Pact forces in 1968, and the subsequent polit-ical clampdown, Havel would argue that dissent means\"living in truth\" - a view not always popular with fellowdissenters who advocated a more ideologically basedresistance. This same emphasis on personal honestyand integrity was later to infuriate his political aidesand allies when, as Czechoslovakia's first post-commu-nist President, he insisted on voicing his own selfdoubts in public. Apparently he believes there arethose in the medical profession who might also benefitfrom a greater willingness to admit they may not haveall the answers and to seek advice from others.

CORBIS SYGMA / CONTRASTOMaster piece All in the blood How the Pavlovsky family put Buenos Aires on the haematological map Despite being home to three generations of Pavlovskys - Alfredo, the founder, Santiago, now medical director, and Astrid a fellow - Fundaleu is no family firm. On the contrary, itwas the Pavlovskys' commitment to looking outward to international networks that made itpossible to develop this world-class leukaemia centre in Buenos Aires. Most doctors remember their early suc- cesses, so it is no surprise thatSantiago Pavlovsky can recall the first adult patient he cured of leukaemia. What ismore remarkable is that he still takes a closeinterest in his first patient, 37 years later. The year was 1968. At 27, Pavlovsky, back in Argentina from Europe, was scarcely older thanhis patient. The 23-year-old man had justmarried, and the diagnosis of acute lympho-blastic leukaemia must have sounded like a deathsentence. Pavlovsky could offer hope. He had recently attended the first international convention ondaunorubicin and he treated his patient with thisnew cytotoxic drug. Being unsure of the side-effects, he asked the young couple to ensure thatthe wife did not become pregnant. Of course, shedid. Pavlovsky and the family waited anxiously tosee what would happen to father and baby. All turned out well. The father went into remission that turned into a cure, and his wifedelivered a healthy baby boy. The couple hadfour more children and the firstborn has chil-Peter McIntyre 38 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005dren of his own. Now aged 60, the patient is stillwell. Pavlovsky said, \"I see him at least once ayear. He has never had a recurrence. This wasthe first adult patient I ever saw cured.\" This quietly spoken Argentinean is very aware that this one life saved has led to a wholeextended family. A sense of family is part of hispersonal identity. Fundaleu (Foundation AgainstLeukaemia), of which he is medical director inBuenos Aires, was founded by his father. Hisidentical twin bother, Miguel, is also a distin-guished haematologist in Argentina, and hisdaughter Astrid works alongside him. Santiago Pavlovsky winces at the suggestion of a dynasty. He is as proud of dissuading his son(a successful economist) from following himinto medicine, as he is proud that his daughterhas done so. \"Not dynasty, but probably destiny,\"he says with a smile. Pavlovsky also has a commitment to interna- tionalism. He sees co-operation between spe-cialists and centres as ever more important toprovide sufficient research data on rare cancersand different oncogenes.Master piece CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 39His grandfather, Alejandro Pavlovsky, was born on the banks of the Don in Rostok, in what wasthen Russia (now Ukraine). Russian Jews weresubject to discrimination and pogroms by theCossacks. Many converted to Catholicism andleft. At the age of 18, Alejandro joined olderbrothers and sisters in Argentina, where heworked his way up to become chief executive ofthe Buenos Aires municipal authority and mar-ried a woman from Mendoza. Santiago's father,Alfredo, was the tenth of their 11 children. Alfredo graduated from the University of Buenos Aires in 1931, and his PhD thesis on thedetection of malignancy made him famousalmost immediately. Santiago says, \"His idea was to differentiate a lymph node that was tuberculosis, which wasvery common, from a lymph node that wasmalignant disease. They looked the same. Myfather used a needle to take an aspiration andput the cells in a smear and he looked at themunder the microscope. He compared what hesaw with what the pathologists said in theirreport until he was able to differentiate them based on what he could see.\" Alfredo won a top prize in Argentina, and Adolfo Ferrata, 'the father of Italian haematol-ogy', was so impressed that he included thethesis as a chapter in his text book in 1936. Alfredo Pavlovsky spent a lifetime treating haematological diseases. He was one of thefounders of the International Society ofHematology in Paris after the war, and in 1954was President of the Fourth InternationalCongress of Hematology in Mar del Plata,Argentina. BLOOD BROTHERS He and his wife, Maria, had five children,including identical twins Santiago and Miguel in1941. The twins went to school together (wherethey could swap classes without their teachersknowing), and learnt to ride horses together.Both became haematologists. Both work mainlyin non-profit organisations. The Miguel works on coagulation, thrombosis Santiago Pavlovsky winces at the suggestion of a dynasty - it is more a case of destiny, he says Santiago Pavlovsky (seated at the table) withhis team of doctors,nurses, scientists andtechnicians at his CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005and vascular disorders, while Santiago specialis- es in haematological malignancies. Santiago began working at the Haematology Research Institute of the National Academy ofMedicine in Argentina, where his father wasDirector. He married young and, with his wifeTatiana, left for France to do his fellowship.Tatiana spoke good French and English and wasquickly able to get work in Paris. Pavlovskyrecalls, \"She was my economic support becausemy fellowship was very lowly paid, and difficultto live on for one, much less two. Her salary wasthree times my fellowship.\" Professionally, Pavlovsky struck gold at St Louis Hospital, Paris, joining Jean Bernard, thenthe leading haematologist in Europe, later aFrench academician, and still alive and lucid atthe age of 98. \"I had two big inspirations in mycareer: one was my father, the other was JeanBernard. He was the big professor type. He ranthe best haematology department in Europe andwas very well known all over the world. JeanBernard was very strong in leukaemias and laterin lymphomas. I admired him because he start-ed collaboration with the Americans, triallingdrugs in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL]in children.\" These Cancer and Acute Leukaemia Group B (CALGB) trials showed the effectiveness ofanthracyclines; 40 years later, daunorubicin isstill a first-line treatment for ALL. Pavlovsky returned to Buenos Aires in 1967, to create the oncohaematology department athis father's institute. Other young doctors andscientists were also returning. With FedericoSackmann at the Children's Hospital in BuenosAires, and other colleagues, launchedthe Argentinean Group for the Treatment ofAcute Leukaemia (GATLA). Four institutions grew to 25. They began by copying the work of Bernard, but quickly builttheir own expertise. Pavlovsky recruited patients to clinical trials and built a statistics department that could turn datainto a coherent story. As chairman of GATLA,he worked tirelessly to collect data and spreadtreatment protocols across the country. \"We held two big meetings a year in Buenos Aires to which all the physicians from aroundthe country came. Most of them were veryyoung at that time and very enthusiastic aboutdoing clinical trials. We were learning together.Argentina is a huge country with long distances.In the beginning most of the children came toBuenos Aires to be cured, but later many physi-cians who had trained in Buenos Aires wentback to their provinces to treat the children withthis new national protocol. \"At that time, in the late 1960s, to tell a patient that the disease could be cured was blas-phemy. In the 1970s we started to mention theword 'cure' in relation to acute lymphoblasticleukaemia in children.\" By 1973, the team was confident enough to co-organise in Cuba the first Latin Americancooperative group on haematology. This inspiredclinical trials over a wide range of disorders.Pavlovsky became chairman of the group lookingat haematological malignancies, bringing togeth-er data from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, CostaRica, Cuba, Uruguay and Venezuela, agreeingprotocols for treatment and publishing in inter-national and peer review journals. The LatinAmerica group developed protocols for child-hood leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease, lymphomaand multiple myeloma. The children's hospitals were good and the paediatricians and young scientists were enthu-siastic. \"Everybody was looking for new things.The idea of doing a clinical trial was new. Theidea of curing a cancer patient was new. Olderhaematologists had very little knowledge ofchemotherapy. For them the most importantthing was a diagnosis because there was nothing He worked tirelessly to collect data and spread treatment protocols across the countrythey could offer as a cure. They were very happy for this new generation to take care of this job.\" Before computers, fax, couriers and e-mail they punched holes in cards to record data, typedup reports on manual typewriters and circulateddrafts through slow and unreliable postal servic-es. They published in leading internationaloncology journals, often struggling as much withthe English as they did with the science. In 1979 the Argentinean group joined a col- laborative cancer treatment research programme(CCTRP) sponsored by the US National CancerInstitute. This paired centres in the US with theNational Cancer Institutes in Mexico, Brazil,Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and Chile. TheCancer Research Institute in Buenos Aires wastwinned with the Lombardi Cancer Center inGeorgetown University, Washington DC. In 1983, Pavlovsky became co-ordinator ofMaster piece CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 41the CCTRP programme and moved toWashington, where he was also cancer advisorto the Pan-American Health Organization(PAHO). By the time he returned to Argentinain 1986, his father had died and his generationhad become the established leaders of cancerresearch and treatment. Military dictatorship, a disastrous war with the UK, an economic crisis and 'Reagonomics'had a destructive impact on public services inLatin America, and it became more difficult tocarry out collaborative work. A CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE In the 1950s, Alfredo Pavlovsky had foundedFundaleu, the Foundation Against Leukaemia,to fund and carry out applied clinical research.Now in the 1980s Santiago Pavlovsky began tobuild this organisation into a centre of excel-They published in leading oncology journals, struggling as much with the English as the science Alfredo and Maria Pavlovsky with their children. In the centre picture, Santiago is secondfrom the left with his twin brother MiguelMaster piece 42 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005lence. He brought in the best doctors he could find and raised money from private companiesand rich individuals. In July 1989, Fundaleuopened the Angelica Ocampo Research andTreatment Centre, dedicated to leukaemia. In 1991 Fundaleu was one of the first centres in Latin America to start stem cell trans-plantation to treat leukaemia, myeloma andlymphoma. The team carried out 820 stem celltransplants over the following 14 years, mainlytaken from peripheral blood. This requiredcareful selection of patients. Pavlovsky said: \"Youhave to avoid the patients in the late stagebecause they cannot be cured. We tried to edu-cate the medical profession to transfer the patientearly enough to be able to use the transplant.\" The reputation of Fundaleu grew through- out the 1990s. In October 2003, it opened anoutpatient department complete with molecularbiology, flow cytometry, pathology and bacteriol-ogy laboratories. Pavlovsky says that his scien-tists can now identify the molecular structure ofcancers and pinpoint the oncogenes for individ-ual patients. \"The objective is not only to achieve clinical remission but molecular remission. Patientswho show complete molecular remission havemore chance of being cured. If you are able toidentify an oncogene that causes the diseaseyou can follow whether this oncogene disap-pears or at least is reduced many times. If theoncogenes do not decline the disease will comeback; if the oncogene disappears they will be inremission for ever.\" Fundaleu sees 700 new patients a year and has 7,600 patient visits. Only 20% of patientsare children now that children's hospitals offer excellent treatment. The team carries out stemcell transplants on patients of all ages, includingpatients over 70 years old. Most patients receive chemotherapy as out- patients, although a patient who has an infec-tion or a reaction to chemotherapy can stay for24 hours without being admitted to the hospital.Patients also receive round-the-clock telephonesupport. Pavlovsky was determined to attract top-line doctors, nurses and scientists. \"Fundaleu is nowpaying good salaries to doctors, nurses, techni-cians and scientists and providing good equip-ment for them to do research. I think thatFundaleu is now an inspiration for many otherinstitutions in the way that we combine clinicalpractice and research.\" Fundaleu employs only graduate nurses, most of whom have a post-graduate qualificationin cancer nursing. \"We probably have one of thebest rates of nurses to patients in the world -one nurse for every two or three patients. All ournurses can deliver intensive care in any of ourrooms. Hundreds of nurses come here to learnhow to take care of patients with chemotherapyand our oncology nurses do a lot of teachingaround the country. \"We educate our nurses to learn about the treatments, side-effects of chemotherapy, andthe doses they have to deliver. Well-trained nurs-es provide a safety net. If they know the doses ofthe drug and they know the side-effects, they canavert any prescription mistakes by the physician.\" Aged 63, Pavlovsky plans to work for anoth- er seven years, before focusing on family and \"Fundaleu is an inspiration for others in the way that we combine clinical practice and research\"His scientists can now identify the molecular structure of cancers and pinpoint the oncogenesMaster piece CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 43horses in retirement. But retirement must wait. Pavlovsky, who was named Doctor of the Year in2000 by the Argentine Ministry of Health, isdriven by the need to encourage young doctorsto support international research. \"Clinicalresearch means you do not only follow a proto-col but you collect data and help the statisticianto evaluate the data, and present the data in ameeting and, last and most important, you pub-lish the data. If you have 800 cases with goodinformation on treatment, outcomes and side-effects, and you enter an international meta-analysis, your 800 patients can become20,000.\" Fundaleu is collaborating in a study organ- ised from Spain, treating acute promyelocyticleukaemia (APL) with ATRA (tretinoin), a drugdeveloped from Chinese herbal medicine.Fundaleu is part of the extra-nodal lymphomastudy group (IELSG) run Franco Cavalli atthe Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerlandin Bellinzona. This looks at very rare lymphomaswhich affect one site, such as the testes or stom-ach, where international collaboration is theonly way to collect enough data. Evidence fromFundaleu was included in internationalCochrane Collaboration reviews her second of fellow-ship at Fundaleu. Her father believes that thechanges in her professional lifetime will be evenmore dramatic than in his own. \"In my lifetime I have passed from practi- cally no cure for haematological malignancies toaround children with ALL Hodgkin's lymphoma and around 50% of thenon-Hodgkin's lymphoma. I have seen a dou-bling of the multiple myeloma and chron-ic lymphocytic leukaemia [CLL]. leukaemia [CML]. Glivec [imatinib]is the first drug in the world that appears to bekilling the neoplastic cells without killing nor-mal cells. Each year, the news improves. Morethan 80% of patients who were treated fouryears ago are still alive without disease. It is fantastic. \"In my daughter's time, I do not think there will be one drug to cure all neoplastic diseases,but there will be other drugs targeted at specificdiseases. I am sure that Astrid and her genera-tion will see more and faster changes than I haveseen.\" \"I'm sure that Astrid and her generation will see more and faster changes than I have seen\" Santiago Pavlovsky (with the whip) in competition in Argentina with carriage and horsesWith his wife, Tatiana, at the meeting of the Challenge Fundin Rome in January 2005The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) is continuing toexpand and update its internationallyrespected collection of MinimumClinical Recommendations (MCRs) for the treatment of cancer. The supplement toAnnals of Oncology vol 16, 2005, contains 35 updated MCRs, freely available for oncologistsaround the world. Each of the MCRs provides vital, evidence- based information for physicians, including theincidence of the malignancy, diagnostic criteria,staging of disease and risk assessment, treat-ment plans and follow-up. They aim to providethe user with a set of requirements for a basicstandard of care that ESMO considers neces-sary in European countries. They are notdesigned to replace extensive clinical practiceguidelines or review articles. To keep abreast of the rapid changes in the field of medical oncology, each MCR undergoesan annual update. The ESMO Guidelines TaskForce invites a coordinator (author) to draft anMCR on a specific topic, according to a standardoutline; the draft is revised with the input of theSpotlight on... 46 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005ESMO Minimum Clinical Recommendations Inadequate diagnostics, inappropriate treatment and poor follow-up deny cancer patients their best chance of survival. Whether you work in a hospital in rural Hungary or at theJules Bordet in Brussels, ESMO's updated recommendations spell out what you need to doto ensure your patients receive an acceptable standard of care. ESMO Guidelines Task Force and subsequently submitted to the ESMO Faculty for review; andfinally, comments from the Faculty are consideredby the Task Force and a final version is preparedfor publication. Rolf Stahel, chair of the ESMOGuidelines Task Force, says \"The minimum clini-cal recommendations are an important expressionof ESMO's mission to disseminate knowledge, inorder to maintain a high common standard inmedical practice for cancer patients.\" He addsthat they also help support negotiations withpoliticians, administrators, and insurance compa-nies about what level of care should be madeavailable, and are an important part of the devel-opment of medical oncology as a specialty. Vesa Kataja, a Finnish medical oncologist who sits on ESMO's Guidelines Task Force,says that the great thing about the MCRs is theyare easy to use. \"Finland is a country with a hightax rate and well-organised national healthcare,which for many years has utilised nationalguidelines on different disease entities, includ-ing several in oncology. In a situation like this,one would think that there is no cause for even more guidelines. However, the nationalSpotlight on...

Kataja takes every opportunity to promote discussion of the ESMO MCRs, for instance atthe Meeting for Residents in Specialist Trainingand the Annual Meeting of the Finnish Societyof Oncology. \"I have recommended them as read-ing for medical students in preparation for theexamination in oncology, for residents and othercolleagues in response to consultation - I toldthem 'see what the ESMO MCR says on thesubject' - and referred to them in my lecturesand presentations. There is no doubt in my mindthat in these days of information influx, theESMO MCRs, with their practical approach,will find a steady place in everyday clinical life -all over Europe.\" As important as practicality is credibility. It is inevitable that during the elaboration of theMCRs, controversial issues on diagnostic andtherapeutic recommendations regularly arise.Stahel is keen to emphasise that the publishedRecommendations represent an ongoing processthat needs the participation of all ESMO mem-bers. To encourage this, and to give some insightinto some of the more finely balanced decisions,the Guidelines Task Force plans to publish con-troversies on ESMO MCRs in future issues ofAnnals of Oncology .

Now a group of politicians has got together to make sure it does. Agroup of around 30 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) havegot together to launch MEPs AgainstCancer. The new forum (whichabbreviates to MAC) describes itself as an all-party informal group, committedto promoting action on cancer as an EU priori-ty, and harnessing European health policy tothat end. The forum is headed up by a triumvirate - Alojz Peterle, Adamos Adamou and Liz Lynne- that patient, oncologist andcampaigner, and is representative of both theregions of Europe and the political spectrum ofthe Parliament. Peterle, who spearheaded the formation of MAC, comes from Slovenia. He was primeminister when Slovenia declared itsindependence from the former Yugoslavia in1991, and has spent the last couple of yearshelping to hammer out the ill-fated EUconstitution. Four years ago he was diagnosedwith prostate cancer, which he fought bymaking radical changes to his lifestyle. He hassince been declared free of the disease. Peterlebelieves widespread negative attitudes that see cancer as an automatic death sentence canfatally undermine the determination of patientsto survive and sap the political will to improvestandards of care. \"My personal priority is to getmore and more awareness among MEPs in theEuropean Parliament and also among MPs inthe Member States, because with legislation wecan influence a lot.\" Adamou comes from Cyprus, and is an oncologist by profession. He is a member of theCyprus Anticancer Association, and has a trackrecord of urging political action on cancer. Hispriority is to ensure that every European cancerpatient has an equal chance of an earlydiagnosis and good-quality treatment. Heargues that the most dramatic improvements inthe near future will be made through improvedstructuring of cancer care services, and wantsto see MAC contributing to this goal. \"I believethat the MEPs Against Cancer forum will helpraise awareness on an issue that affects all ofus directly or indirectly, and will aid in theestablishment of European standards for cancerprevention and treatment.\" Anna Wagstaff MEPs Against Cancer can hildrun.sundseth@ecpc-online.orgLiz Lynne comes from the UK, where she has a long history as a member of the nationalparliament working on health in general andcancer in particular, including as co-chair of theAll-Party Breast Cancer Group. She feelsMEPs have to take up the fight against cancer,not least because 3 million of their constituentsare diagnosed every year and 2 million will diefrom the disease. \"Although I believe healthpolicy should be up to individual MemberStates, it is important for us in the EU to sharebest practice in research, treatment and care,\"she said, giving a special mention also to theneed to pressurise governments to aid moreresearch into the disease. The initiative has been warmly welcomed by the European Cancer Patients Coalition(ECPC), which has offered to run thesecretariat. ECPC chairman Lynn Faulds Woodsaid: \"The European Parliament has producedmany policies and recommendations whichhave the capacity to improve the lives of cancerpatients across Europe, but we patients knowthere can be big gaps between policy andputting recommendations into practice.Thousands of lives are being lost unnecessarilyto cancer every year, and it is only through ourpolitical representatives being prepared to putthemselves forward in groups like MAC tocampaign for change that we will see majorimprovements in the way cancer patients aretreated.\" Peterle hopes that the MEPs in MAC will not only play a legislative role, considering andintervening on the many draft directives thatimpact in one way or another on cancer, but willalso form a bridgehead to their own national governments, which is the level at which manyof the key decisions will be taken. TheEuropean Council Recommendation onScreening for Cancer, he says, is a case in point.Though the European Commission has adoptedthe recommendation as a political priority, itcannot insist on its implementation by MemberStates - that decision will be up to nationalparliaments. There are many issues, however, that MEPs will be able to influence directly. Jan G, acancer patient whose life may have been savedbecause he fought his way into one of the earlyimatinib (Glivec) trials, hopes that public accessto information about clinical trials in Europewill be one of them. Jan, who sits on the board of the ECPC, points out that when cancer patients developresistance to existing drugs, getting early accessto an experimental drug could save their life.Though Europe now has a clinical trialsdatabase (EudraCT), set up by the EuropeanMedicines Agency (EMEA), patients cannotaccess it to find out about trials they may beeligible for. \"It is one of my hopes that MEPsAgainst Cancer will understand the importanceof transparency on basic data on clinical trialsfor patients,\" he says. Whether or not MAC takes up this issue, Peterle is clearly committed to working withpatient groups. \"I think it is important thatMEPs are related more closely withorganisations such as the ECPC, because Ithink those groups should feel the support ofpoliticians. Together we will do more, I'm sure.\" MEPs Against Cancer is headedby three co-chairs.From left Lynne and AlojzPeterleSpotlight on...

He decided to operate. This is how,after two years, they discovered that my wife'stumour was operable. My wife is now feelingwell, although at that time she had been toldthat she had only a matter of months to live.\" Lawyers, specialists and representatives of patient associations come across many similarcases of patients who are not referred to a spe-cialist centre in a timely manner. In most casestoday the oncologist only sees the patient whenhe or she already has advanced disease. \"Ovarian surgery is done in nearly all hospi- tals in the country despite the fact that in theo-ry these types of intervention are only permittedin cancer centres with good pathological servic-es,\" says Dr \u00c1gnes Ruzsa, head of the oncologi-cal department of the Zala County Hospital.\"Today cancer surgery is carried out in nearlyevery small hospital in the country. Sometimesthe patient is never referred to an oncologist. They just remove the tumour, they assume thepatient is cured and send them home.\"According to Dr Ruzsa, who believes it shouldbe a fundamental requirement that subsequentchemotherapy should be done only in oncologydepartments or centres, another common prac-tice is that they say, \"We must give something,\"so they give some chemotherapy, but in thewrong dose and without keeping to establishedprotocols and prescriptions. \"The importantthing is to keep the patient.\" Dr L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Thurz\u00f3, head of the oncology clinic of Szeged, has carried out a survey of thetreatments of ovarian cancer. He found that, inthe given year, only 480 patients out of 1,200had been given chemotherapy. \"Only 30-35% ofthe patients were referred to follow-up care andwere therefore treated adequately. The othersdisappeared from the system. This result isdamning even if we take into account that the Kun's article, which originally appeared under the heading No Taxol , alerted the public to the fact that, as a cancer patient, your survival can depend on where you are treated - and that in turn can depend on who you know or how much 'gratitude money' you pay AceReporter 52 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005figures include a number of older people who were in poor physical condition and thereforewere not eligible for treatment,\" says DrThurz\u00f3. Furthermore Dr the Street Hospital,states that cancer patients' outcomes depend onwhere the disease is diagnosed. In some centrescancer patients can receive state-of-the-arttreatment like anywhere else in the world, sothis is not the primary problem. \"For example,we have just removed the ovary from aneighteen year old girl. It turned out that theovary contained a very dangerous type of cancer.The results were sent to the US for consultation,and she received the most appropriate therapy.Today she has recovered. If this had happenedin a small hospital without an oncology back-ground, this girl would not be alive today.\" According to Dr Magyar, only 40% of the available diagnostic instruments are used to diag- nose cancer. \"For instance, in the case of pelviccancers, MRI scanning is obligatory in order todetermine the most effective therapy. Nowadays,this happens in only 50% of cases, even thoughcarrying out the scan significantly improves thechances of being cured. This is also the case withtumour marker examination. In one year only350,000 examinations were done in Hungary,while in Austria more than 2 million examina-tions were undertaken,\" says Dr Magyar. \"Moreover in Hungary some doctors are all too quick to state that the patient is beyondhope. In most cases we see patients whom doc-tors in a county or smaller hospital have given upon, despite the fact that their tumour is operableand can be treated. The only option for thesepatients is to look for an informal route to get-ting back into treatment, by seeking contacts viafriends and relatives. These are the ones whorefuse just to sit back and wait to die.\"Carelessness? Negligence? Lack of professional expertise? Fighting for patients or reputation?Experts say that all of these are to blame for thefact that 30-40% of patients do not get adequatetreatment today. According to Dr Magyar, it is inexplicable why AIDS patients must by law be referred to aspecialist institute, while in the case of cancerpatients there are no such requirements.Moreover, mistakes are rarely highlighted. \"The efficacy of a clinic, department or doc- tor is rarely monitored,\" says Magdolna Dank,head of the department of the Radiological andOncology Clinic. \"This means that clinics anddoctors get away with prescribing incorrect dosesand regimens of chemotherapy. It is not uncom-mon for departments that are not eligible to usechemotherapy to prescribe a completely differ-ent drug rather than refer patients to a specialistinstitute where he/she could get the appropriate treatment. Medicines have different prices, and the patients could be given different drugs. Mostof the time a small hospital - usually for eco-nomic reasons - chooses an inappropriate treat-ment, but the insurance pays for this treatmentanyway. There is a need to evaluate each clinicand department, to determine which cancerservices they should be allowed to provide.Moves are already afoot to regulate this situation,and departments have been informed whichtreatments they are authorised to administer.However, so far this is not being enforced,\" saysthe specialist medical oncologist. According to Dr Dank, the absence of spe- cialists is causing great problems. There is a lackof specialists in medical oncology, radiationoncology, radiology and pathology. Furthermore,it is very difficult to recruit doctors to work inoncology. Without new blood, the future ofoncology is uncertain. It is widely agreed that amultidisciplinary approach is required to devel- Clinics and doctors get away with prescribing incorrect doses and regimens of chemotherapyAceReporter CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 53op the best treatment plans and that a team should consist of radiation oncologist, patholo-gist, medical oncologist, surgeon, and wherepossible a psychiatrist. However, this is very dif-ficult to achieve in the absence of specialists. Mr Szabolcs Ott\u00f3, the vice director of the National Oncology Institute, speaks of an epi-demiological crisis, because Hungarian cancerstatistics are so much worse than could be justi-fied given the country's level of developmentand the age profile of its population.International data show cancer incidence at50,000 per 10 million inhabitants, while inHungary the figure is nearer 70,000. Mr Ott\u00f3 has been looking for answers to the question of why so many Hungarians get cancerand end up dying from their disease, and whatcan be done about it. Besides the most commonreasons such as smoking, alcohol and poor nutri-tional habits, he thinks the organisation ofHungarian cancer services plays a role, as doesone other important factor: the lack of an openand honest relationship between the doctor andthe patient. Statistics show that a patient who is treated in Hungary has a 10-15% lower chance (or forsome types of cancer even worse) of surviving acancer experience than those treated in westernEurope. But even within the country there aredifferences. According to the Hungarian Association Against Cancer, patients are sometimes told thattheir required treatment is either not available,or not covered by health insurance. \"Everyautumn and summer patients have to face thefact that the money to pay for cancer treatmentshas run out and therefore hospitals stop offeringthese treatments,\" says Mrs Vasv\u00e1ry, the leaderof the Association. Most of the supplies of cancer medicines are allocated to the National Oncology Institute,and the drugs are allocated on the recommen-dation of specialists. According to oncologistsand insurance companies, it is not possible for apatient to be unable to get the necessary drug,but patients' experiences tell a different story.Sometimes the National Institute refuses arequest from a county hospital. In this case,patients either have to wait two to three weeksor start the treatment with another, less effective medicine. Sometimes doctors stop therapy inthe middle of the course of treatment becausethere is no more drug available. You can come across cases like this, even though the primary duty of all oncologydepartments is to provide all the necessarymedication, even if sometimes it means thatthey have to use the medication of somebodywho has passed away. Cancers are classified into four stages. In stage I nearly all patients are curable. In the sec-ond and third stage 30-50% of patients can becured, depending on the type of cancer, and inthe fourth stage almost nobody can be cured. InHungary, nearly one quarter of the patients arediagnosed with stage IV disease. \"It is fundamental that patients with tumours will do anything to be cured,\" says DrMagyar. \"In my hospital it is not possible for theleader of the decision-making team, who hasthe power to decide where a patient is referred,to live off 'gratitude money' [bribery], becausewe have an oncological committee whichdecides on a random basis who is referred towhich doctor. I have very little face-to-facecontact with my patients, and in this way mydecisions can be independent.\" But generally the words of the doctor- lawyer Dr Judit Kismarton are true: it isdefinitely the 'gratitude money' and theeconomic situation that are to blame for thefact that most patients are referred too late tothe appropriate institute. \"The fact that in manyhospitals the patient is not referred to anoncologist, but is simply operated 'in-house',even if the cancer has spread, without prelimi-nary investigations or follow-up treatment, isbecause by referring the patient on, the hospitalloses out on both the health insurance paymentand the 'gratitude money'\". Last year, according to the cancer registry, 78,000 cancers were diagnosed in Hungary. Ifwe could implement international standards wecould improve our average survival figures by 10years. In the past 25 years the number of peopleregistered disabled because of cancer has dou-bled, despite the fact that the criteria for beingregistered disabled have been tightened.Impact Factor 54 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005The gap between Europe and North America on the treat-ment of young children with rhabdomyosarcoma may not be aswide as readers of recent papers inthe Journal of Clinical Oncology might have suspected. The main paper (JCO 23:2618- 28) reported on the third study of theInternational Society of PaediatricOncology (SIOP) on malignant mes-enchymal tumours (MMT outcomes for chil-dren with non-metastatic rhab-domyosarcoma and reduce systematicuse of local therapy such as radiother-apy. It was accompanied by an edito-rial commentary from the US(pp2586-87), which explained the'philosophical differences' that existbetween the continents in relation torhabdomyosarcoma management,predominantly focusing on thegreater enthusiasm for local treat-ment in North America. MMT 89 lead author Michael Stevens and James Anderson, a mem-ber of the US Intergroup Rhabdo-myosarcoma Study Group (IRSG)IRS-IV investigation and co-author ofthe JCO editorial, are two of the main'protagonists' in this philosophicaldebate. Yet while both agree thatsome differences still exist, they actu- ally adopt positions much nearer toone other than the rhetoric wouldsuggest. \"We're close\", says Anderson, who is chair of the Department ofPreventive and Societal Medicine atthe University of Nebraska MedicalSchool. \"There's been a great deal ofinteraction and exchange of informa-tion over the last couple of years. It'smy sense that the respective thera-peutic approaches are moving closer,with the Europeans becoming some-what more aggressive with local ther-apy than they have been in the pastwith some subsets of patients, and wein the US adopting less aggressiveapproaches for patient groups inwhom the Europeans have shownsuccess.\" MEETING OF MINDS Stevens, CLIC Professor ofPaediatric Oncology at the Universityof Bristol, movingtowards meeting in the middle,\" hesays. \"There has been a move awayfrom a uniform rule in North Americathat everyone gets radiotherapy, to aslightly more selective approach.They've taken on board our demon-stration that some patients can becured with less treatment than they might normally give, and we've lookedcritically at our own results and havemade amendments to our strategies.\" The principle behind the MMT stud-ies is to limit the use of local therapyas far as possible, particularly radio-therapy. The great majority of chil-dren with rhabdomyosarcoma arevery young, yet radiotherapy histori-cally has formed an important part oftheir treatment, bringing with it sig-nificant long-term effects. The MMT 89 results in relation to overall survival, however, don'tcompare favourably to the US IRS-IVinvestigation, which featured earlyradiotherapy for several groups ofpatients, including the very young.\"You can't deny that the results of theIRS-IV study look somewhat betterthan ours,\" Stevens concedes. \"Theirresults are stunningly good fortumours of the orbit, with 100% sur-vival claimed. We have had to acceptthat the MMT 89 experiment didn'twork in its entirety and that some ofthe patients we tried to treat withoutradiotherapy actually do need it.We've consequently made modifica-tions to our treatment strategies byintroducing radiotherapy for morechildren on the basis of those results.Alex MathiesonMinimising radiotherapy in children with rhabdomyosarcoma US and European paediatric oncologists are finally finding common ground over which patients need potentially damaging aggressive local treatment, and which can be spared.CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 55Impact Factor But the fundamental of the whole debate is - can you actually cure asmany children without exposingthem to more treatment than isnecessary?\" Stevens accepts that the price of trying to answer this question can behigh. \"It brings major anxiety thatsome children who relapse may weren't treated moreaggressively in the first place,\" hesays. \"And those who don't die butare salvaged will require more treat-ment in the end than might other-wise have been necessary.\" TREATING FOR THE LONG TERM But keeping an eye on the long-termpicture is enormously important,Stevens believes. \"If we are going tocreate a population of young peoplewho have survived cancer in child-hood, we want to minimise the con-sequences of their experience of thedisease and its treatment in adultlife,\" he says. \"One of the great diffi-culties of applying this general princi-ple is that it is something you can talkabout comfortably across a popula- tion, but find more difficult to do inrelation to an individual child. But Iknow that if I have a two-year-oldwith a tumour of the orbit, I will domy best to treat him without exposureto radiotherapy if I can.\" The position historically taken in North America is that it doesn't mat-ter whether the child is two or eight -the majority still get radiotherapy andwill receive treatment longer thansimilar patients in Europe. Thatapproach is being softened, however,as Anderson explains. \"Patients with orbital rhab- domyosarcoma are emblematic of thedifference in approach,\" he says. \"Inthe US, we typically use local controlas part of the initial therapy in anattempt to maximise the cure rate.The SIOP approach is directedtowards attempting to minimise thelate effects, recognising that they willobserve high recurrence but with avery high salvage rate for thosepatients.\" But Anderson too believes thatthe last couple of years have seen movement from both sides towardssimilar approaches. \"Patients withalveolar histology tumours who closedSIOP study received radiation as partof their initial therapy as a result ofcomparative analyses with the USexperience,\" he says. \"That's a casewhere, for a subset of patients, theEuropeans have moved towards amore North American approach.\"And the North Americans have recip-rocated, Anderson states. \"We've recently opened a study for the treatment of low-risk rhab-domyosarcoma,\" he explains. \"Untilquite recently, the standard length oftherapy in the US was just shortof a year. In the new study, patientswith low-risk disease have had theirtherapy cut to 24 weeks, largelybecause we know from Europeanstudies that similar patients treatedfor a very short time - 9-16 weeks -have done quite well. Those data gaveus comfort in reducing the length oftherapy.\" Things have moved to the point where researchers from the two con-tinents are considering creating acombined dataset and running somecollaborative comparisons. \"We've begun discussions along those lines,\" Anderson confirms. \"Weboth have an extensive historical data-base on the experience of treatingchildren with rhabdomyosarcoma.The IRS-IV and MMT 89 studieswere conducted almost contempora-neously, so the idea is that by assem-bling data from those studies in oneplace with variables defined in thesame way, we can begin to make someformal comparisons.\" While North America and Europe may be at loggerheads insome spheres, this looks to be onearea where peace has broken out.

However, such potential applica- tions have been brought into questionby recent studies suggesting COX-2inhibitors show cardiovascular toxicity.The first indication anything wasamiss came with the VioxxGastrointestinal Outcomes Research(VIGOR) study, published inNovember 2000 in the New England Journal of Medicine (343:1520-28). While demonstrating a reduced inci-dence of gastrointestinal lesions in thearm taking the COX-2 inhibitor the study also showed ahigher incidence of myocardial infarc-tion for this group compared to thosetaking the standard dose of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugNaproxen (1000 mg a day). As thisstudy lacked a placebo group, it wasunclear whether the effect was due toan increased cardiovascular risk with Vioxx, or the protective effect ofNaproxen, or whether it was merely achance finding. Two studies published in the March 17, 2005 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , review- ing the cardiovascular effects of twoCOX-2 inhibitors have helped clarifythe situation.

In the latest study, Reddy and col- leagues decided to test their hypothe-sis that the combination of more thanone drug targeting more than onegene used at very low doses wouldsynergistically increase the cancerprevention efficacy, while at the sametime lessening toxicity. \"In addition to COX-2 inhibitors we decided to focus on statins, sinceobservational studies have shown thatcolon cancer rates are suppressed inpatients taking these drugs,\" saidReddy.

More than one third of Europe's cancer patients are using someform of complementary oralternative medicine (CAM),yet fewer than one in five of these patients have received advice from theirdoctor about the therapy they use, with the vastmajority acting on the basis of information fromfriends and family. These are among the keyfindings of the first Europe-wide study intoCAM use specifically in cancer patients, whichwas published this February in the Annals of Oncology (16: 655-663). Fourteen countries participated in the sur- vey, covering a total of 956 patients. In mostcountries, usage was around 30-40%. Two ofthe highest rates were reported in Switzerland(48.6%) and the Czech Republic (58.8%), con-sistent with previously documented high levelsof CAM use in neighbouring Germany, whichwas not included in the study. The highest useof all was recorded for Italy, at 73.1%, but as theauthors point out, the results may be skewedbecause the data came from a palliative careunit. At the opposite end of the scale, only14.8% of patients in Greece reported usingPat Healy CAM. The authors speculate that a combinationof lack of availability, high compliance with tra-ditional medicines, cultural norms and underre-porting for fear of being 'found out' by their doc-tors may partly explain why this figure is so low. Though CAM use in Europe still has some way to go to catch up with the US, where rateswell above 40% are consistently reported, acomparison with earlier studies shows thatEuropean patients are turning to CAM inincreasing numbers - indeed CAM is nowEurope's second fastest growing industry. The term CAM covers a wide variety of therapies. The most popular forms of CAMreported in the survey are herbal medicines andremedies, with homeopathy, vitamins and min-erals, medicinal teas, spiritual therapies andrelaxation techniques also widely used. A partic-ularly significant finding is that most patientsusing CAM were taking biologically based ther-apies (as classified by the US National Centerfor Complementary and Alternative Medicine),and that the use of herbal medicines tripledafter a cancer diagnosis. Interestingly, the typeof herbs used varies considerably by country:mistletoe in Switzerland, olive leaf paste inPatient Voice CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 61Greece, nettle leaves/tea in Turkey, aloe vera in Serbia and Spain, Ovosan in the CzechRepublic. Also reported were green tea, essiactincture, Chinese herbs, sage tablets,Echinacea, cod liver oil, fresh juice and vegeta-bles, vitamin E, glucosamine, chamomile, pep-permint, selenium, yeast extract, multi-vitamins,Ayurveda herbs, vitamin C, soya drinks, ginseng, mulberry carti-lage, calcium, magnesium), papaya tea, beetand carrot juice, a mixture of aloe, honey, rhakiand wine, and angelica herb. The survey notes that improvements in physical and psychosocial well-being andincreasing hope are the main reason for patientsturning to CAM. But it also finds that \"dissatis-faction with some aspects of conventionalhealth care, poor doctor-patient relationship,accessibility, perceived effectiveness and des-peration may also be key motivating factors.\" Soit is not surprising that patients are turning toCAM on the word of family and friends or themedia rather than information and adviceoffered by physicians and nurses. Some of these patients spend a lot of moneyon CAM - 123 euros on average, with the high- est reported amount being 4,140 euros a month.But more than half of all patients spend nothing,because they use herbs that come free. Like many cancer patients, Nazira Visram, from Cancer Voices in the UK, is willing to tryanything to improve her quality of life. But sheis careful to do so only in consultation with herphysicians. She has lived with a breast cancerdiagnosis for three years. Her conventionaltreatment was a lumpectomy, followed by sixweeks of radiotherapy and then tamoxifen. Buther reaction to the drug was so severe that shestopped taking it after 6 months. PAIN AND PANIC CONTROL Nazira was experiencing severe pain and foundimmediate help when she started using reflexol-ogy. She describes it as \"absolutely amazing\",helping with pain control and calming herenough to give her time to reflect and \"to get outof panic mode.\" She also tried yoga, whichtaught her to breathe correctly, which hasbecome part of her normal routine. She says:\"There is a lot to cancer. The psychological partis not understood. You are taken care of clinical-ly, but then you need signposting throughout thecancer journey.\" Her own conventional treatment carries a possible side-effect of a greater risk of osteo-porosis. She takes prescribed calcium tablets toreduce the risk and has cut back on dairy prod-ucts. She drinks soya milk and takes eveningprimrose, magnesium and zinc, \"things I thinkwill help me get a balance into my body.\" She hastold both her oncologist and general practitioner(GP) about her use of CAM because she feels itis important to keep her doctors on her side. Shealso has asthma, and acknowledges that \"I needtheir support if I run into difficulties.\" Nazira volunteers as an educator and train- er for Cancer Voices, an umbrella group of Nazira Visram, a volunteer with the UK patient and carer group Cancer Voices, believes a changeof attitudes is needed so that patients can feel able to talkto their doctors about any CAMs they usePatient Voice 62 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005patients' and carers' organisations, in the hope of improving communications between usersand health professionals. This has brought herinto contact with other cancer patients, so sheis aware of people who want to try out thingsthat have worked for others, without discussingit with their doctors. \"Cancer is individual andyour treatment is planned for you taking all per-sonal factors into account. What works for oneperson won't necessarily work for another. It isthis lack of knowledge that worries me.\" Shethinks some patients fear that discussing CAMuse with their doctors may affect their futuretreatment, underlining the need for better com-munications. Nazira wants action to changeattitudes so that patients feel able to tell their doctors about anything they introduce into theirlife style. Bradley Pearl, a GP working in a UK practice serving a multi-cultural population, has a relaxedattitude to certain CAM. He sometimes recom-mends homeopathy, because it uses vanishinglysmall amounts of substances, although he admits\"one never knows what is actually in it.\" His initial response to a cancer patient ask- ing about a herbal remedy they have read aboutwould be to find out exactly what the treatmentis. Just because something is herbal doesn'tmean it is harmless, he says, and there is evi-dence of some herbs interacting with a range ofprescribed medicines. He observes: \"People are often happier tak- ing something that is called 'herbal' rather than aprescription medicine, even though we knowexactly what is in it. Herbal medicines can con-tain anything - and most active things we knoware plant derived.\" Pearl says that alternative therapies are potentially a mine field, so it is important thatpeople using them should let their doctors know. NO EVIDENCE BASE Why do some doctors take a more conservativeview? \"As doctors we are interested in treatingpeople through evidence-based practice. Wewant to know what is there, what has beenshown to work and what has been shown to beless beneficial. Not many alternative medicineshave passed the gold standard of being properlyinvestigated through clinical trials,\" he says. Andhe points out that cancer patients are a particu-larly vulnerable group of people who \"are oftengrasping at straws and particularly open tocharlatan practitioners.\" Roger Wilson, cancer patient and now director of Sarcoma UK, says patients are entitled to make up their own minds -hopefully in an informed way COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE? Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine. An example is using aroma- therapy to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery. Alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. An example is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended bya conventional doctor. Source: US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health, USAPatient Voice CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 63Most studies show that it is younger, better- educated and more affluent people who useCAM. Even the most highly qualified peoplecan take risks when they become patientsthemselves. Helle Viola Hangaard, a Danish GP, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. She hadbeen aware of a lump in her breast long beforeher diagnosis. When a mammogram confirmedshe had cancer, she had a mastectomy followedby chemo- and radiotherapy. She admits taking vitamins and antioxidants after another patient recommended them. Thekey motivation for trying these therapies wasthat it was something active she could do byherself. \"Having cancer turned my world upsidedown and I knew I had to change something.My marriage, my children and my job were allOK, so it had to be something else,\" she says. She did not discuss it with her own GP, arguing that as a qualified doctor herself, shewas well equipped to make her own decisions.But she stopped taking the antioxidants afterdiscovering that they can reduce the effective-ness of radiotherapy. Subsequently she alsogave up the vitamins. She says she was takingup to 11 vitamin pills a day and stopped\"because I was feeling so good.\" Asked if she gets cross with her own patients if they don't comply with her advice,Helle stalls and says she works with patientswith learning difficulties. But she admits thatshe does get cross with the patients' carers ifthey supply alternative medicines. Roger Wilson, director of the charity Sarcoma UK, finished his conventional treat-ment in September 2000 when, unknown tohim, his doctor believed he had only a year leftto live. He does not approve of alternative ther-apies but supports a complementary approach\"which recognises that no doctor knows every-thing and that patients are entitled to make uptheir own minds - hopefully in an informed and logical way which feels right for them.\" He takes a lot of supplements and usually discusses his use with his oncologist, exceptwhen he decided to use resveratrol. \"This is theactive good bit in red wine, and as he hadendorsed red wine, it seemed unnecessary.\" Roger takes selenium, a natural trace min- eral which has been lost to the western diet andmay destroy cancer cells. He also takes vitafla-van and Vitamin E, both antioxidants, and beta-carotene which converts to Vitamin A inthe body and is believed to inhibit tumour for-mation. He also takes zinc, starflower oil andfolic acid. Before taking these supplements, he was already taking multivitamins and Omega 3 fishoil. He drinks a lot of green tea and eats a dietbased on organic vegetables, fresh bread, andfish rather than meat.

Reprinted with permission from ESMOcasts that the doctors will eventually address the CAM history of patients as a routine part of tak-ing their medical history - a procedure that isalready under discussion in the US. Karin Schmidt, a researcher in complemen- tary medicine at the Peninsula Medical Schoolof the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth,argues that there is also a pressing need forhealth professionals to inform themselves moreon the CAM their patients are using. She isworking on a new website which will offer con-densed summaries on CAM therapies, which isdue to start in September and is financed by theEuropean Union. The hope is that this willprove a useful resource for doctors, and also pro-vide patients with a much-needed authoritativealternative to the many very dubious sources ofinformation currently found on the Internet. One suggestion put forward by the authors of the recent study is that Europe should followthe example of the US, where 64% of medicalschools offer courses in CAM. They point out,however, that this doesn't deal with the funda-mental problem that for most CAMs, reliableevidence-based information just doesn't exist,and without such evidence, doctors' reluctanceto advise on such therapies is understandable.They conclude that \"the need to increase theevidence base of CAM therapies using method-ologies that are appropriate and sensitive toCAM cannot be overemphasised.\"Patient Voice 64 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005checked to ensure that it doesn't conflict withprescribed medicines.

Reprinted with permission from ESMOe-World 66 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005The no-computer virus Costs, compatibility and patient privacy have all been cited as reasons why patient records cannot be computerised. But the inability, and reluctance, of doctors and hospitals to useinformation technology more widely is killing thousands of people. Whether or not a treating doctor has Alex's full medical recordavailable can literally mean lifeor death,\" says CynthiaSolomon of Sonoma, Califor- nia. Her son Alex, now in his 20s, grew up withhydrocephalus, a rare and life-threatening con-dition in which fluid accumulates in the brainand needs to be drained through special shunts.So Ms Solomon had no choice but to become awalking filing cabinet of records on allergies,pituitary-gland problems, brain scans and \"everypiece of paper a doctor ever wrote about Alex'scase.\" She worried constantly. There were closecalls, such as the time that Alex went on a tripand ended up, unconscious, in some distanthospital. Ms Solomon could not get his paperrecords to the new doctor and had to pray thatAlex would not get the wrong antibiotics or belaid on his back, which might have killed him. To Ms Solomon the information problem with health care today is so glaring that she even-tually took matters into her own hands, as bestshe could. She took out a second mortgage, hiredsoftware programmers and developed a comput-er system, called FollowMe, for online medicalrecords that any doctor can, in theory, access anywhere and anytime. FollowMe will not fix theworld's health-care industry - only about 400families now use it - but Ms Solomon has cor-rectly identified the woeful, even scandalous,failure of the health-care industry worldwide toadopt modern information technology (IT). The solution seems obvious: to get all the information about patients out of paper files andinto electronic databases that - and this is thecrucial point - can connect to one another sothat any doctor can access all the informationthat he or she needs to help any given patient atany time in any place. In other words, the solu-tion is not merely to use computers, but to linkthe systems of doctors, hospitals, laboratories,pharmacies and insurers, thus making them, inthe jargon, 'interoperable'. This may be obvious, but today it is also a very distant goal. According to David Bates, thehead of general medicine at Boston's Brighamand Women's Hospital and an expert on the useof IT in health care, the industry invests onlyabout 2% of its revenues in IT, compared with10% for other information-intensive industries.Superficially, there are big differences betweene-World CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 67countries. In Britain, 98% of general practition- ers have computers somewhere in their offices,and 30% claim to be 'paperless', whereas inAmerica 95% of small practices use only penand paper. But, says Mr Bates, this obscures thelarger point, which is that even the IT systemsthat do exist cannot talk to those of otherproviders, and so are not all that useful. It shows. People on the right side of the dig- ital divide increasingly take for granted that theycan go online to track their FedEx package, totrade shares, file taxes and renew drivers'licences, and to do almost anything else -unless, of course, it involves their own health.That information, crumpled and yellowing, isspread among any number of hanging folders atall the clinics they have ever visited, and proba-bly long since forgotten about. The most inti-mate information is, in effect, locked away fromits owners in a black box. Many IT bosses find this baffling. John Chambers, the chief executive of CiscoSystems, the world's largest computer-network-ing company, says that health care is down therewith mining as the most technophobic industry. Jeff Miller, a manager at Hewlett-Packard (HP),a large computer-maker, calls health care \"one ofthe surreal because hospitals splurge onthe latest CAT-scan or MRI equipment, but arestingy with their back-office systems. It is, hesays, like \"Detroit putting out futuristic hydro-gen cars but using paper processing and manuallabour for the manufacturing.\" This has perverse consequences. According to the Institute of Medicine, a non-governmentalorganisation in Washington, DC, preventablemedical errors - from unplanned drug interac-tions, say - kill between 44,000 and 98,000people each year in America alone. This makesmedical snafus the eighth leading cause ofdeath, ahead of car accidents, breast cancer andAIDS. \"It's like crashing two 747s a day,\" saysMark Blatt, who was a family doctor for 20years before he joined Intel, the world's largestsemiconductor-maker, to manage its health-care strategy. There should, he says, be moreoutrage. US President George W. Bushlooksat an electronicmedical recordsystem visitto every yearBROOKS KRAFT / CORBIS / CONTRASTOHealth care is down there with mining as the most technophobic industrye-World 68 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005RICH PICKINGS Improving computer systems, of course, would not eliminate all medical errors. But mostresearchers believe that they would reduce themdramatically. One study in America estimatesthat IT could prevent 2 million adverse druginteractions and 190,000 hospitalisations a year.Another study reckons that electronic orderingof drugs can reduce medication errors by 86%.By contrast, research published in March in theJournal of the American Medical Associationwarns that IT, if the software is badly designed,could actually increase errors. But almost every-body agrees that well-designed IT is essential toimproving quality in health care. The same goes for its cost, an increasing burden to ageing societies in the rich world andeven in poor countries such as China. HP's MrMiller reckons that redundancy and inefficiencyaccount for between 25% and 40% of the $3.3trillion the world spends on health care everyyear, and could be eliminated with proper IT. A study from a clinical research centre atDartmouth College in New Hampshire reachesa similar conclusion, estimating that a third ofAmerica's $1.6 trillion in annual health-carespending (as of 2003) goes to procedures thatduplicate one another or are inappropriate. Estimating how much IT could save, after taking account of the considerable cost of apply-ing it widely, is not easy. Writing in Health Affairs , an American journal, in January, Jan Walker and five colleagues (including Mr Bates)at the Centre for Information TechnologyLeadership in Boston concluded that a fullyinteroperable network of electronic healthrecords would yield $77.8 billion a year in netbenefits, or 5% of America's annual health-carespending. This includes savings from fasterreferrals between doctors, fewer delays in order-ing tests and getting results, fewer errors in oralor hand-written reporting, fewer redundant Medical SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 69tests, and automatic ordering and re-fills of drugs. It does not include, however, perhaps thebiggest potential benefit: better statistics thatwould allow faster recognition of disease out-breaks (such as SARS or avian flu). The key word in all such estimates is always 'interoperable', says Mr Bates, pointing to thedifferences between two pilot programmes inAmerica. In one, the Californian city of SantaBarbara set up a city-wide peer-to-peer network(in which the computers of different practicesand clinics can talk directly to one another).This allows doctors, say, to pull up portable-document-format (PDF) files from one another.But the information in them - text, with num-bers buried in it - is 'unstructured' and so notvery useful. It is the equivalent of faster faxing,and not what people mean by interoperability. The other American pilot, located in Indianapolis and managed by the RegenstriefInstitute, a non-profit medical-research organi-sation, comes closer. It has created a city-widenetwork in which physicians can, with thepatient's permission, log on to a complete med-ical history that includes all previous care at the11 participating hospitals. Already, the databasecontains 3 million patient records, 35 millionradiology images, 1.5 gigabytes of diagnoses, 20million order-entries by physicians, and so forth.The key difference is that, wherever possible,the data is entered in a structured and formattedform. Test results are in neat rows and columnsand tagged in a way that every other computercan recognise and compare against other appro-priate numbers. This is the sort of IT solutionthat not only cuts waste and errors, but alsohelps physicians to make better decisions. What, then, would the ideal IT architecture of health care in future look like? It would start,says Intel's Mr Blatt, with wireless data entry bynurses and doctors. Practices and clinics wouldhave secure 'Wi-Fi hotspots' - using a radiotechnology called 802.11 - and staff would walk around with small handheld devices that trans-mit all inputs to the database in the back office.Another source of input might be tiny radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips that areattached to patients and send basic informationwhen they come in range of a radio field.Patients could also add inputs themselves. Afirm called Health Hero, for instance, makes acute little device called a Health Buddy thatpatients take home and plug into their tele-phone lines. A couple of times a day, it asksthem basic questions or takes their heart rate,and sends the data to the doctor. Behind the scenes, all this data would be formatted and stored according to recognisedstandards. Contrary to widespread concerns,this does not require a single central repositoryor any other particular hardware architecture.Instead, it relies on common software protocolsand formats so that individual computer appli-cations can find and talk to one another acrossthe Internet. Most of these standards, such asXML, SOAP and WSDL, already exist and areused by many industries. Others, such as HL7,LOINC or NCPDP (spelling them out makesthem sound no less obscure) are unique to thehealth-care industry and govern data inter-change between hospitals, laboratories andpharmacies. On top of these, there need to behacker-proof layers of authentication and pass-word protection so that only the right people getaccess. There is still some work to do to refine these technologies. In January, eight of the world'slargest IT companies - Microsoft, Oracle, IBM,HP, Intel, Cisco, Accenture, and ComputerSciences - teamed up to form an 'interoperabil-ity consortium' for that very purpose. In general,however, \"the technology is very, very ready,\"says Robert Suh, the technology boss atAccenture, a consultancy that is helping The solution is to link the systems of doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacies and insurerse-World 70 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005Britain's National Health Service (NHS) and regional governments in Australia and Spain toimplement electronic health records. In fact, Britain's - or rather England's - NHS is among the pioneers worldwide. Thisyear, it will begin rolling out a \u00a36.2 billion ($12billion) project in which five regions in Englandwill form networked IT 'clusters' so that 18,000NHS sites, including all family doctors andacute-care hospitals, can share standardisedinformation on patients. These clusters willeventually be linked through a 'spine' (called theN3 and run by the main UK telecoms provider,BT) with huge bandwidth to create, in effect,one national network. Scheduled to be complet-ed by 2010, the plan, like most IT projects, hashad some early hiccoughs and has been greetedwith cynicism by some doctors. But other coun-tries will be looking to it as a model. Another pioneer is Denmark, which began rolling out a similar network for the regionaround Copenhagen in 2001 and expects tocomplete it by 2007, before covering the rest ofDenmark. Torben Stentoft, the boss of HvidovreHospital in Copenhagen and the head of thecity's network, says that his main concern is thenitty-gritty of dealing with all of his legacy com-puters which need to be tweaked or replaced.But he feels that he has his society's full support.\"Nobody is against this. Everybody is asking forit,\" he says. In particular, the Danes find nothingterribly controversial in the idea of a nationalhealth identification number, which theyalready have, and spend little time worryingabout how to fund the new systems, since theirtax kroner are doing that. AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM Mr Stentoft is in an enviable situation, especial-ly if viewed from America, which has the world'slargest and costliest health-care system. Americais as enthusiastic as any country about electron-ic health records. President George Bush hasembraced the idea, and he spoke about itpublicly some 50 times last year. He haseven appointed a \"national co-ordinator forhealth information technology\" to fullyinteroperable, within tenyears. But America's health-care system is sodifferent from others that it faces some special complications. The first big difference is that, whereas most other rich countries have 'single-payer' (i.e.government-run) health-care systems, Americahas a highly fragmented industry with many pri-vate providers and insurers doing businessalongside large government programmes (suchas Medicare, for old people). This means that infunding a new IT infrastructure \"the financialincentives are not exactly aligned,\" says MrBates. In single-payer systems, the expenditurescome out of the same pocket - the taxpayer's -that the savings go into. But in America, he esti-mates, the practices and hospitals that pay forthe IT only get 11% of the cost savings, with therest going to insurers and employers (who buythe insurance). The resulting mismatchedincentives, says Mr Bates, could derail the entireproject: \"It's a situation where America couldend up far behind.\" This calls for some combination of govern- ment subsidies and private-sector financialincentives, argues the Markle Foundation, acharity in New York that is dedicated to theproper use of IT in health care and nationalsecurity. Over half of all doctors in America workin small practices. And, say Markle'sresearchers, a typical practice (defined as fivedoctors handling 4,000 patient-visits a year)would make losses if it had to pay the estimated$15,000 a year for three years that it costs toinstall an interoperable IT system and to learnhow to use it. The practices, Markle concludes, therefore need incentives of $3 to $6 per patient-visit,or $12,000 to $24,000 a year, which comes to$7 billion to $14 billion a year for three years,or between 1.2% and 2.4% of total ambulatory-care revenues. The trickier question is how toadminister this largesse, whether it is providedby insurers and employers or the government.The money could be disbursed directly andspecifically for the IT systems. Or it could begiven indirectly in some sort of pay-for-perfor-mance arrangement. The other big difference between America and countries such as Denmark is public per-ception of the robustness of privacy laws. Thee-World CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005 71European Union has stricter privacy laws than America, and Europeans have relatively moreconfidence in them. For information sharing,\"ours is a much more porous environment,\" saysAlan Westin, a professor at Columbia Universitywho has written several books on privacy issues.This is not primarily an IT issue, although theInternet does seem to raise the stakes. In February, one database broker, ChoicePoint, had to inform some 140,000 peo-ple that it had accidentally sold sensitive infor-mation about them. Also in February, a statisti-cian of the health department in Palm BeachCounty, Florida, inadvertently e-mailed a list ofmore than 6,000 HIV carriers to all employeesof the department. This makes many Americans suspicious of plans that involve sharing sensitive health infor-mation. Although opinion polls in Europe showoverwhelming support for interoperable medicaldatabases as long as these are properly regulat-ed, a February poll by Harris Interactive foundthat Americans are currently evenly split, with48% saying that the benefits outweigh the priva-cy risks, and 47% saying the opposite. Some70% of Americans in the poll worried that sensi-tive data (on sexually transmitted diseases, say)might leak. This is unfortunate, says Michael Callahan, a health-care lawyer at Katten Muchin ZavisRosenman, a law firm in Chicago, since aweighty tome of legislation was passed in 1996precisely to prevent such leaks. Called HIPAA(short for \"Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act\"), the law defines strictcodes for sharing medical data and takes effectin stages. HIPAA creates a national 'floor', saysMr Callahan, with some states following evenstricter statutes, and involves the federal govern-ment in enforcement and prosecution. HIPAA is not quite as strong as equivalent laws inEurope, he thinks, but strong enough. Mr Westin disagrees. The HIPAA rules are \"not at all adequate\" for shared medical records,he says. So the only way to sell such records tothe American public, he says, is to design thewhole system with privacy as a priority. Thisrules out any form of medical identificationcard, to which Americans would be hostile(even though they think little of giving theirsocial-security numbers, a de facto ID, whenrenting DVDs). It also means avoiding a centraldatabase that could be hacked. The bestapproach, says Mr Westin, is to emulate the'locators' used by American police. Cops inCalifornia who arrest a New Yorker cannotaccess information about that person directly,but can view a directory of such informationand request it from the authorities in New York.Finally, rather than allowing sceptics to opt outof the new system, says Mr Westin, the systemshould from the start require patients actively toopt in. As the Markle Foundation puts it, the tech- nology must be designed in such a way that\"decisions about linking and sharing are made atthe edges of the network\" by patients in consul-tation with their doctors, and never inside thenetwork. This goes to the very heart of the mat-ter. For even though it is fine to start hoping forthe day when interoperable electronic healthrecords create vast pools of medical informationthat could be used to find new cures and battleepidemics in real time, their ultimate purpose isto make one simple and shockingly overduechange: to enable individuals, at last, to haveaccess to, and possession of, information abouttheir own health.

A courageous victim of sibling loss tells howshe healed her wound and re-appropriated her personal story. When she was 14, Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn's elder and only brother, Ted, died of aplasticanaemia after having spent eight yearsin isolation.At the funeral, a woman took her bythe arm and whispered: \"You willhave to be very good now, your par-ents are going through a lot.\" Thewords made her feel \"selfish,ashamed\", writes Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn as she recalls the omert\u00e0 (law of silence) that was imposed onher following her brother's death.\"My brother's illness, hisdeath...became a frozen lake some-where deep inside me, one thatwould take me years to locate, to rec-ognize, and ultimately, to thaw.\" While her parents struggled to copewith the tragedy by evasion or immer-sion in work, Elizabeth sank in a pat-tern of self-destruction, and foundherself falling apart at age 26, with noidea why. She entered therapy andher book recounts the journey sheundertook to reclaim her disfran-chised grief, re-form her identity, andfinally summon the courage to talk toher parents about her brother's death,almost 30 years after the event. A journalist by profession, DeVita-Raeburn drew on the experiences ofsome 200 victims of sibling loss toconvey in her book the powerful emo-tions involved in the loss of a brotheror sister.In order to heal herself, she neededfirst to mourn and make sense of herloss. She tells how she had to \"exca-vate the grief\" she had buried, and re- claim her story. \"I found this process of narration, of telling with a point ofview, healing beyond all expectation.\"Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn gave her-self permission to speak, a permissionthat had been denied to her for manyyears. She argues convincingly thatsibling loss has been much neglected,not only at the familial level (over-shadowed by parents' loss of theirchild, the sibling is not consideredamong the truly bereft), but also atthe societal level (at least northAmerican), with research on sibling loss still scant.DeVita-Raeburn vividly evokes theprocess of retrieval and re-appropria-tion she underwent, but her psycho-logical analysis of sibling loss is lessprofound and ignores importantworks such as those of JacquesLacan, Melanie Klein, NicolasAbraham and Maria T\u00f6rok. Theamazing power of sibling relation- ships could also have been fur-ther explored. Finally, a meta-physical or religious approach tothis topic (the death of a siblingis viewed on the same level asthe death of a parent or child in Judaism) would have been of greatinterest, but this is perhaps the mate-rial of another book. While most victims of sibling losschoose not to talk of their loss,DeVita-Raeburn opted for the morepainful route - she opened the woundand found the words to express hersuffering and make meaning out ofher family's tragedy. In doing so, shehealed herself. \"Now I have a storyand it's mine\" she writes at the end ofher book.

Containing no less information,Vaincre son cancer Les bonnes questions, les vraiesr\u00e9ponsesThierry Philip Milan, 19.00 ITis a known fact that by making the appropriate lifestyle choic- es, up to half of all cancers can beprevented. The challenge of reducingthe cancer burden lies in the ability totransform this knowledge into behav-ioural and societal change. Full ofdetailed data, useful tables and dia-grams, this handbook, published bythe Union Internationale Contre le Cancer, offers a wide range of evi-dence-based cancer preventionstrategies which European NGOscan adapt to the specific needs oftheir countries. Part I describesEurope's cancer burden, with a high-ly readable chapter by Elsebeth Lyngeon the social inequalities of cancer,and the various approaches (cogni-tive, contextual, etc.) for changinghealth behaviour. Part II is devoted tospecific prevention strategies (tobac-co control, diet, occupational expo-sures, screening, etc.), whose imple-mentation, it is hoped, will bringabout real change. Finally, the book(available also in French, Germanand Italian) provides recommenda-tions for comprehensive cancer pre-vention programmes.Copies can be ordered from the UICC(fax +41 LeaguesAgainst Cancer UICC, 224 pp, euro 20.00 First published in 1933 by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (a financially independ-ent organisation), Martindale provides comprehensive information on drugsMartindale: The Complete Drug Reference34th editionEdited by Sean C. SweetmanPharmaceutical Press, 2766 pp, \u00a3275.00 Thierry Philip's book consists of short chapters on the different aspects ofcancer, from diagnosis to treatment.Philip interweaves his own experi-ence as an oncologist with descrip-tions of patient cases. Although attimes a little pompous, Philipacknowledges his own doubts andlaments the fact that oncologistsremain unaware of certain aspects ofthe disease, unless they themselveshave sat on the other side of the table.What is most important, he stresses,is \"to listen to the patient and see himas a whole person.\" One must hopethat the human qualities evoked byPhilip will help make the reality ofoncology departments moreamenable to patients. 78 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2005Bookcase and medicines. Thoroughly updated and expanded, the 34th edition isdivided into three parts. By far thelargest, Part I contains 4418 mono-graphs on drugs (including drugs stillunder evaluation) and ancillary sub-stances arranged in 51 chaptersaccording to their therapeutic usesand actions. Each chapter beginswith a short but thorough diseasetreatment review followed by adescription of each drug. These arepresented in alphabetical orderaccording to the chemical names andin format: nomenclature,pharmaceutical information, adverseeffects, precautions (including con-tra-indications), pharmacokinetics,uses and administration, name of pro-prietary preparations according tocountry. The texts are written in aremarkably concise, clear and bal-anced style. As an example, in thechapter devoted to antineoplasticdrugs (102 pages), the disease treat-ment review addresses adverse effectsand their treatment, precautions,interactions, resistance, choice ofantineoplastics (with a very usefultable of common chemotherapy regi-mens for malignant diseases) and 21pages on the management of malig-nant diseases. Part II consists of a series of 926monographs on not easily classifieddrugs and other substances, herbals,and drugs no longer clinically usedbut still of interest. Part III (630 pages) contains briefdetails on proprietary preparationsfrom 32 countries (all Western coun-tries plus others such as India,Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Thailand,etc.) and covers drugs supplied onprescription as well as those solddirectly to the public. Beyond its encyclopaedic dimension- no other work compares in breadthand depth of coverage - Martindale isunique in its field for other reasons. The book provides healthcare profes-sionals with unbiased, evaluatedinformation on drugs used throughoutthe world and it is based on a hugenumber of sources from scientific andmedical literature, including majorstudies, guidelines, and usefulreviews. Information from pharma-ceutical companies is also used, butonly in conjunction with other avail-able data.The bibliographical references (morethan 37,500) appear at the end ofeach paragraph and cross-referencesto the disease treatment reviews alsoappear in the drug monographs. Despite its size, Martindale is easy to handle thanks to its comprehensivegeneral index (314 pages!). Entriesrefer to drugs (by names, synonyms andchemical names), diseases and pro-prietary preparations. There is also adirectory of manufacturers containingsome 9,500 entries for all the prod-ucts and proprietary medicines men-tioned in Martindale . The numerous headings, togetherwith the new typography and layout,make this 34th edition very readable.Its uses are multiple: it enables physi-cians to verify specific points, it deep-ens their knowledge of drugs andtheir role in therapeutical strategies,and provides updates on ways of han-dling pathologies. The copious biblio-graphical references are also of greatuse both to physicians working inhospitals and those in general prac-tice.Reliable, comprehensive and impec-cably organised, this book (also avail-able in Spanish) is still the ultimatereference in therapeutics.More up-to-date information fromMartindale can be obtained from var- ious electronic versions (www.medici-nescomplete.com). IFhandbooks are intended to be highly accessible, both in shape and content, then this pocket-sized handbook of clinical haematol-ogy is an ideal companion forinternists, hospitalists and familypractitioners involved with haematol-ogy and particularly with malignanthaemopathies.Since it was first published threeyears ago, the book has been updatedand revised and covers the coreknowledge of haematological disor-ders.Its originality lies in a clever formatconsisting solely of highly usefultables, informative diagnostic andtherapeutic charts and algorithms.Each pathology is presented in thesame format, covering epidemiology,clinical aspects, diagnostic tools,staging, prognostic features, treat-ment, etc.The succinct yet detailed presenta-tions (including small chapter onlymphoproliferative diseases of gran-ular lymphocytes) provide readerswith a quick view of each pathologyand help to orientate them in theworld of haematology.
