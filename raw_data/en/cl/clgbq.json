We view the body as one integrated web with a fine and delicate balance between different organ systems. With the current medical approach the body is divided between different medical subspecialties. Our approach is to take all aspects of one's health history into consideration, including our unique genetic makeup, nutrition, exercise, stress, environmental toxicity, social relationships, and treat the body as a whole.
