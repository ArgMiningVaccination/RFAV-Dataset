As it is in German, I took the liberty of translating it: The 126th German Medical Congress today in Bremen deleted the additional designation of homeopathy from the further education regulations for doctors (MWBO). The request brought by Bremen delegates was decided by the physician parliament with a large majority. The Bremen delegates justified their request with the fact that 13 of 17 state medical associations have already deleted the additional designation of homeopathy from their further education regulations. The further education regulation is to create uniform rules for the post-graduate training of doctors. However, there is no longer any question of uniformity if 13 state medical associations do not follow the MWBO. In the debate, Dr. Johannes Grundmann once again pointed out that it is not a matter of prohibiting people from using homeopathic remedies. \"However, it is the task of the medical associations to define and check verifiable learning objectives,\" Grundmann said to great applause. In September 2020, the Bremen Medical Association had become the first such chamber in Germany to remove homeopathy from its education regulations. The complaint of a Bremen physician against it had subsequently been rejected in two instances. Most recently, the Bremen health insurance was the first to terminate three selective contracts for the remuneration of homeopathic services. ____________________________ I feel that this is a nice victory of reason over unreason. I might even go as far as assuming that [our petition of 2021](https://edzardernst.com/2021/09/petition-to-the-german-medical-association/) might have helped a little to bring it about: Dear President Dr Reinhardt, Dear Ms Lundershausen, Mrs Held, Dear Ms Johna, We, the undersigned doctors, would like to draw your attention to the insistence of individual state medical associations on preserving \"homeopathy\" as a component of continuing medical education. We hope that you, by virtue of your office, will ensure a nationwide regulation so that this form of sham treatment [1], as has already happened in other European countries, can no longer call itself part of medicine. We justify our request by the following facts: - - After the landmark vote in Bremen in September 2019 to remove \"homeopathy\" from the medical training regulations, 10 other state medical associations have so far followed Bremen's example. For reasons of credibility and transparency, it would be desirable if the main features of the training content taught were not coordinated locally in the future, but centrally and uniformly across the country so that there is no \"training tourism\". Because changes to a state's own regulations of postgraduate training are only binding for the examination committee of the respective state, this does not affect national regulations but is reduced to only a symbolic character without sufficient effects on the portfolio of medical education nationwide. - Medicine always works through the combination of a specifically effective part and non-specific placebo effects. By insisting on a pseudo-medical methodology - as is \"homeopathy\" represents in our opinion - patients are deprived of the specific effective part and often unnecessarily deprived of therapy appropriate to the indication. Tragically, it happens again and again that the \"therapeutic window of opportunity\" for an appropriate therapy is missed, tumors can grow to inoperable size, etc. - Due to the insistence of individual state medical associations on the \"homeopathic doctrine of healing\" as part of the medical profession, we are increasingly exposed to the blanket accusation that, by tolerating this doctrine, we are supporting and promoting ways of thinking and world views that are detached from science. This is a dangerous situation, which in times of a pandemic manifests itself in misguided aggression reflected not just in vaccination skepticism and vaccination refusal, but also in unacceptable personal attacks and assaults on vaccinating colleagues in private practice.

Rausche _______________________________________ The [first reported reactions](https://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/134597/Zusatzbezeichnung-Homoeopathie-soll-aus-MWBO-gestrichen-werden) from politicians are positive, while those of homeopaths are predictably the opposite: German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) expressly welcomed the delegates' decision, writing via Twitter. \"Good medicine stands on the ground of science. For homeopathy, there is no place there. In such a question, one must show one's colors.\" Paula Piechotta, a Green Party member of parliament, was equally pleased. \"... it is good when in times of Fake Facts and right-wing conspiracy theories clarity is provided where clarity is needed. Thank you \u00c4rztetag,\" she tweeted. Michaela Geiger, chairwoman of the German Central Association of Homeopathic Physicians, noted the decision \"with astonishment.\" Homeopathy has a high acceptance among the population, she claimed.
