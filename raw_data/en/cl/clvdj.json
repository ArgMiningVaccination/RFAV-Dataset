It is simply a vaccine for two strains of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) that in some instances can lead to cancer in some women (Gardasil's other two HPV strains are forgenital warts, which don't cause cancer).\"\"According to Merck's package insert on Gardasil, the end-point in its clinical trials for the vaccine's efficacy, or effectiveness, was NOT cancer, but instead was the presence, or non-presence, of vaccine-relevant pre-cancerous lesions (CIN 2/3). There isabsolutely no proof, and no clinical trialsthat show Gardasil protects against cancer in the long-term.\" https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/11/05/gardasil-vaccine-is-a-flop-for-good-reasons.aspx8http://www.activistpost.com/2013/09/another-doctor-testifies-hpv-vaccine.html Bednarczyk RA, et al.
