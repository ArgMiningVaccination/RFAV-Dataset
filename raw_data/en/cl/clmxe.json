BUILDING CODE AND ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS IN NEW BUILDING CONSTRUCTION State Building Code and Energy Conservation Standards in New Building Construction CHAPTER 4-88-81 STATE BUILDING CODE AND ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS IN NEW BUILDING CONSTRUCTION Organization of the State Building Code and Energy Conservation Standards in New Building Construction Intent Scope Definitions Responsible Agency Code Administration and Enforcement Updating and Amending the Codes Limitation Supplements Appendix Chapter of the UBC and UMC 4-88-81-81. Organization of the state building code and energy conservation standards in new building construction. 1. History. The legislative assembly adopted the state building code in 1979 and the state energy conservation standards in 1977. The state building code is codified as North Dakota Century Code chapter 54-21.3, and the energy conservation standards in new building construction is codified in North Dakota Century Code chapter 54-21.2. In 1983 the legislative assembly transferred responsibility of the state building code from the state construction superintendent to the director of the office of management and budget and removed reference in the energy conservation standards to any designated office. In 1993 the legislative assembly amended the energy conservation standards, giving the office of management and budget responsibility for implementing, updating, and amending the code. The legislative assembly designated that the state building code will consist of the uniform building code published by the international conference of building officials. In 1985 the legislative assembly added the uniform mechanical code as a component of the state building code, with an amendment to section 504{f), LPG Appliances, of that code. For manufactured housing, the legislative assembly identified the manufactured homes construction and safety standards under 24 CFR 3280 adopted pursuant to the Manufactured Construction and Safety Standards Act [42 U.S.C. 5401 et seq.] as the state building code for manufactured housing. In 1991 the legislative assembly amended North Dakota Century Code section 54-21.3-03, designating the 1989 edition of the model energy code as the minimum energy conservation standards that must be met. In 1991 the legislative assembly amended subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 54-21.3-03 to allow cities, townships, and counties to amend the state building code to conform to local needs. In 1993 the legislative assembly amended subsection 1 of North Dakota Century Code section 54-21.3-03 to permit the director of the office of management and budget to adopt rules to implement and periodically update the code, and to adopt rules to amend the code. Subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 54-21.3-03 was also amended by the legislative assembly to require cities, townships, and counties that elect to administer and enforce a building code to adopt and enforce the state building code. This provision became effective August 1, 1994. 2. Administration. Administration and enforcement of the state building code and ene11gy conservation standards in new building construction are local responsibilities. The director of the office of management and budget assigned the director of the office of intergovernmental assistance the 608 responsibility to develop rules and regulations to implement, update, and amend both codes as necessary. 3. Inquiries. Inquiries regarding the office of intergovernmental assistance may be addressed to the building code administrator: Building Code Administrator Office of Intergovernmental Assistance State Capitol -14th Floor Gee East Boulevard Avenue Bismarck, NO 585e5-e17e History: Effective December It is the intent of this chapter to prescribe rules for implementing, updating, and amending nationally recognized standards for use in the construction, alteration, movement, demolition, repair, and use of buildings in the state of North Dakota.

History: Effective December 1, 1994. administration and enforcement. The administration and enforcement of the state building code and energy conservation standards for new construction are the responsibility of each city, township, and county. No jurisdiction is required to administer and enforce building codes, but those that elect to administer and enforce building codes must adopt and enforce the state building code as of August 1, 1994, and thereafter.

The OIA will assemble a technical review committee within six months of the publication by the ICBO of updated versions of the UBC and UMC, changes announced by the secretary of energy concerning energy conservation standards, and updates to the MEC and ASHRAE energy conservation standards. The committee will be assembled by nominations from the following entities: a. Two members from the North Dakota building officials association. One member must be from a jurisdiction of less than ten thousand people. The size of a county will be determined by the population of nonincorporated areas, and jurisdictions that have relinquished their authority to administer and enforce the codes to the county; b. One member from the North Dakota chapter of the American institute of architects; c. One member from the North Dakota society of professional engineers; d. One member from the North Dakota association of builders; e. One member from the North Dakota association of mechanical contractors; f.

The technical review committee will meet once for up to two days to review the updated UBC and UMC, MEC, and ASHRAE 99-1, as applicable, and statewide proposed amendments. The committee may also propose amendments. All proposed amendments will be made available by the OIA, and a second meeting of the committee will be scheduled for one day to receive testimony on each proposed amendment. The committee will then develop a recommendation on each proposed amendment, and for adoption of the UBC, UMC, MEC, and ASHRAE 99-1, as applicable. The committees recommendations will be distributed by the OIA to all interested parties. 611 2. Submission of an amendment. Each proposed amendment must be submitted to the OIA for consideration by the technical review committee within one hundred twenty days of the publication of the updated code. 3. Statewide meeting. Within thirty days of the publication of the recommendations from the technical review committee, a statewide meeting will be held to hear testimony and vote on the recommendations. The statewide meeting may be held for up to two days. 4. Voting. Each jurisdiction that has adopted and administers and enforces the state building code and the energy conservation standards for new building construction may vote on the recommendations developed by the technical review committee. The OIA will be responsible for certifying voting eligibility up to one week prior to the statewide meeting. The number of votes permitted by each eligible jurisdiction will be as follows: Number of Residents 30,000 -49,999 50,000 + Number of Votes 1 2 3 4 5 6 The population of an eligible county will be determined by subtracting the population of eligible cities. 5. Publication of amendments. The OIA will publish and distribute all adopted amendments. 6. Contingency. During interim years, supplements are published for the UBC and UMC by the ICBO. If the OIA, in consultation with the entities represented on the technical review committee, determines that significant changes have been made to the codes, a technical review committee may be assembled and statewide voting may occur. History: Effective December 1, 1994. of North Dakota Century Code section 54-21.3-03 specifies that for manufactured homes, the state building code consists of the manufactured homes construction and safety standards under 24 CFR 3280 adopted pursuant to the Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act [42 U.S.C. 5401 et seq.].

As used in this section, the term 11automatic adjustment clause .. means a tariff provision that provides for increases or decreases, or both, without prior hearing, in rates reflecting increases or decreases, or both, in gas supply costs incurred by a natural gas utility. 2. An automatic adjustment clause that does not conform to principles set out in this section may not be in the public interest. This section contemplates that the filing of a proposed tariff which includes a nonconforming automatic adjustment clause may result in suspension of all or part of the tariff. 3. The automatic adjustment clause must be in a form that provides for periodic adjustments per unit of sales equal to the difference between gas supply costs per unit of sales included in base rate schedules and gas supply unit of sales projected for the adjustment period. 4. Gas supply costs included under the adjustment clause must be set forth tariff approved by the commission. 5. The utility shall maintain a balancing account in which the difference between the actual gas supply cost and the amount collected through the adjustment cause is recorded. The balancing account must accrue interest monthly at a rate equal to the utility's rate of return on rate base last authorized by the commission. 6. An automatic adjustment clause must include a balancing surcharge, which must be recalculated at least annually. The amount of the surcharge must equal the amount in the balancing account at the time of the proposed change that results from the recalculation divided by projected weather normalized sales volumes for the following twelve months. 7. Notice of change in the adjustment must be filed with the commission prior to billing. The notice must include: a. Workpapers calculating the adjustment; b. Copies of applicable pipeline tariffs and an explanation of regulatory approval status; c. A history of the balancing account since the last surcharge update; and 763 d. To the extent possible, an explanation of market and other factors causing the change. 8. If a current price is in litigation or otherwise being collected subject to refund the utility shall so advise the commission, inform the commission of the final outcome, and record the outcome in the balancing account. 9. If a particular circumstance prevents the use of a standard provided in this section, or its use would result in an undue burden, the commission may permit deviation from the standard. 18. The commission may review an automatic adjustment clause at any time to ensure the maximum economies in those operations and purchases which affect the rates to which the clause applies. The commissions review may include an evidentiary hearing. In making its review, the commission may examine and, if appropriate, cause to be audited, the practices of a utility relating to costs subject to an automatic adjustment clause, and may require any filings and reports that may be necessary to carry out the review. including volumes, prices, and contracts for each supply source and a disclosure of any affiliation between the utility and the seller of natural gas or other items to the utility. 11. Each utility shall cause an independent audit of its automatic adjustment clause to be performed annually. A copy of the auditors report must be filed annually with the commission.

The commission will not issue the permit if any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant is currently in violation of any law or rule of this state, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [Pub. L. 95-87; 91 Stat. 445; 39 U.S.C. 1291, et seq.], or any law or rule in any state enacted under federal law or regulation pertaining to air or water environmental protection, incurred in connection with any surface coal mining and reclamation operation, or if any of the following are outstanding: a. Delinquent civil penalties under North Dakota Century Code sections 38-12.1-98 and 38-14.1-32, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [Pub. L. 95-87; 91 Stat. 445; 39 U.S.C. 1291, et seq.], or any law or rule in any state enacted under federal law or regulation pertaining to air or water environmental protection, incurred in connection with any surface coal mining and reclamation operation. b. Bond forfeitures where violations upon which the forfeitures were based have not been corrected. c. Delinquent abandoned mine reclamation fees. d. Unabated violations of federal and state laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred in connection with any surface coal mining and reclamation operation. e. Unresolved federal and state failure-to-abate cessation orders. f. Unresolved imminent harm cessation orders. 2. If a current violation exists, the commission will require the applicant or person who owns or controls the applicant, before the permit is issued, to: a. Submit proof that the violation has been or is being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation; or b. Establish that the applicant, or any person owned or controlled by either the applicant or any person who owns 779 or controls the applicant, has filed and is presently pursuing, in good faith, a direct administrative or judicial appeal to contest the validity of that violation. If the administrative or judicial authority either denies a stay applied for in the appeal or affirms the violation, then any operations being conducted under a permit issued under this section must immediately cease, until the provisions of subdivision a are satisfied. 3. Any permit issued on the basis of proof submitted under subdivision a of subsection 2 that a violation is being corrected, or pending the outcome of an appeal under subdivision b of subsection 2, will be conditionally issued. 4. The commission will not issue a permit if it finds the applicant, anyone who owns or controls the applicant, or the operator specified in the application, controls or has controlled surface coal mining and reclamation operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful violations of any law or rule of this state, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [Pub. L. 95-87; 91 Stat. 445; 3e u.s.c. 12e1, et seq.], or any state or federal program approved under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, of such nature and duration, and with resulting irreparable damage to the environment as to indicate an intent not to comply with those laws, rules, or programs. The applicant, anyone who owns or controls the applicant, or the operator must be given an opportunity for hearing on the determination under North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-3e. 5. After an application is a~~Pevea deemed ready for approval, but before the permit is issued, the ee~~ss~eA---w~~~ PeeeAs~aeP--~~s commission's decision to approve or disapprove the application will be made, based on the compliance review required by subsection 1, in light of any new information submitted under subsection 2 of section 69-e5.2-e6-e1 and subsection 6 of section 69-e5.2-e6-e2. 6. In addition to the requirements of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-21, no permit or significant revision will be approved, unless the application affirmatively demonstrates and the commission finds, in writing, on the basis of information in the application or otherwise available, which is documented in the approval and made available to the applicant, that: a. The permit area is not on any lands subject to the prohibitions or limitations of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-e7 or the area has met the application review procedures of section 69-e5.2-e4-e1. b. For alluvial valley floors: 78e (1) The applicant has obtained either a negative determination; or (2) If the permit area or adjacent area contains an alluvial valley floor: (a) The operations would be conducted according to chapter 69-95.2-25 and all applicable requirements of North Dakota Century Code chapter 38-14.1. (b) Any change in the use of the lands covered by the permit area from its premining use in or adjacent to alluvial valley floors will not interfere with or preclude the reestablishment of the essential hydrologic functions of the alluvial valley floor. (3) The significance of the impact of the operations on farming will be based on the relative importance of the vegetation and water of the developed grazed or hayed alluvial valley floor area to the farm's production, or any more stringent criteria established by the commission as suitable for site-specific protection of agricultural activities in alluvial valley floors. (4) Criteria for determining whether a mining operation will materially damage the quantity or quality of waters include: (a) Potential increases in the concentration of total dissolved solids of waters supplied to an alluvial valley floor to levels above the threshold value at which crop yields decrease, based on crop salt tolerance research studies approved by the commission, unless the applicant demonstrates compliance with subdivision e of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-21. (b) The increases in subparagraph a will not be allowed unless the applicant demonstrates, through testing related to local crop production that the operations will not decrease crop yields. (c) For types of vegetation specified by the commission and not listed in approved crop tolerance research studies, a consideration must be made of any observed correlation between total dissolved solids concentrations in water and crop yield declines. 781 (d) Potential increases in the average depth to water saturated zones (during the growing season) within the root zone that would reduce the amount of subirrigated land compared to premining conditions. (e) Potential decreases in surface flows that would reduce the amount of irrigable land compared to premining conditions. (f) Potential changes in the surface or ground water systems that reduce the area available to agriculture as a result of flooding or increased root zone saturation. (5) For the purposes of this subsection, a farm is one or more land units on which agricultural activities are conducted. A farm is generally considered to be the combination of land units with acreage [hectarage] and boundaries in existence prior to July 1, 1979, or, if established after July 1, 1979, with boundaries based on enhancement of the farm's agricultural productivity not related to mining operations. (6) If the commission determines the statutory exclusions of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-21 do not apply and that any of the findings required by this section cannot be made, the commission may, at the applicant's request: (a) Determine that mining is precluded and deny the permit without the applicant filing any additional information required by this section; or (b) Prohibit surface coal mining and reclamation operations in all or part of the area to be affected by mining. c. The applicant has, with respect to prime farmland, obtained either a negative determination or if the permit area contains prime farmlands: (1) The postmining land use will be cropland. (2) The permit specifically incorporates the plan submitted under section 69-e5.2-e9-15 after consideration of any revisions suggested by the United States soil conservation service. (3) The operations will be conducted in compliance with chapter 69-e5.2-26 and other standards required by 782 this article and North Dakota Century Code chapter 38-14.1. d. The operations will not affect the continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitats. e. The applicant has submitted proof that all reclamation fees required by 30 CFR subchapter R have been paid. f. The applicant has, if applicable, satisfied the requirements for approval of a cropland postmining land use under section 69-05.2-22-01. 7. The commission may make necessary changes in the permit to avoid adverse effects on finding that operations may adversely affect any publicly owned park or places included on the state historic sites registry or the national register of historic places. Operations that may adversely affect those parks or historic sites will not be approved unless the federal, state, or local governmental agency with jurisdiction over the park or site agrees, in writing, that mining may be allowed.

History: Effective August 1, 1980; amended effective June 1, 1983; May 1, 1988; July 1995. General standards -Suitable plant growth material -Removal. 1. Timing. Suitable plant growth material must be removed after vegetative cover that would interfere with its use is cleared from the areas to be disturbed. To prevent suitable plant growth materials from becoming contaminated by other materials, all suitable plant growth materials to be saved must be separately removed and segregated as required by subsection 2 prior to any further surface disturbance. 2. Materials to be removed and saved. a. The suitable plant growth materials, commonly referred to as topsoil (first lift suitable plant growth material) and subsoil (second lift suitable plant growth material) as identified by the soil survey required by section 69-05.2-08-10 must be removed and segregated in two separate operations, unless otherwise approved by the commission. The topsoil removal operation for an area must be completed aA~-a~~feve~-8y--the--eeMMtsstefl before subsoil removal begins or before any other disturbances occur in that area. If use of other suitable strata is approved as a supplement to suitable plant growth material, all such materials to be saved must be removed and segregated. Further disturbances which significantly alter an area must not begin until the subsoil and other suitable strata removal operations for that area have been completed and approved by the commission. b. (1) All topsoil must be removed from all areas to be disturbed, except in situations as provided by subsection 4. (2) Sufficient subsoil must be removed from all areas to be disturbed to satisfy the redistribution requirements of subsection 4 of section 69-05.2-15-04. 3. Materials to be removed in shallow suitable plant growth material situations. If the thickness of suitable plant growth materials averages less than six inches [15.24 centimeters], the commission may specify other suitable strata to be removed and treated as suitable plant growth material. 4. Suitable plant growth material removal will not be required for minor disturbances which occur at the site of small structures, such as power poles, signs, or fence lines. 788 5. Suitable plant growth material supplements and substitutes. a. Topsoil supplements. Selected subsoil or other suitable strata may be used as a supplement to topsoil if the permittee or operator demonstrates that the resulting soil medium is equal to or more suitable for sustaining vegetation than the available topsoil. This demonstration must include the vertical and areal extent of supplemental materials and determinations of pH, electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, percent coarse fragments, percent organic matter, texture, and other chemical or physical analyses as required by the commission. The operator may be required by the commission to include the results of any field trials or greenhouse tests to demonstrate the feasibility of using a mixture of such materials. The permittee or operator shall also demonstrate that the resulting medium is the best available soil medium in the permit area to support revegetation. b. Subsoil supplements. The permittee or operator may be required to use other suitable strata to supplement subsoil materials if the commission determines additional suitable materials for spreading over affected areas are necessary to meet the redistribution requirements of subdivision a of subsection 4 of section 69-05.2-15-04, provided other suitable strata are available. Samples of the strata to be saved must be taken at sufficient locations to determine the areal extent of the suitable strata. The sampling locations must be approved by the commission. Chemical and physical analyses of the samples taken must include pH, electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio. and textural analysis as required by the commission. c. Subsoil substitutes. Selected overburden materials may be substituted for subsoil if the operator demonstrates to the commission that the resulting soil medium is equal to or more suitable than the available subsoil for sustaining vegetation. Overburden sampling and chemical and physical analyses must be provided by the operator as required by the commission. d. Supplemental and substitute materials must be removed, segregated, and redistributed according to the applicable requirements for suitable plant growth material in this chapter. History: Effective August 1, 1980; amended effective June 1, 1983; January 1, 1987; May 1, 1990; January 1, 1993; -Hydrologic balance - Sedimentation ponds. 1. General requirements. Sedimentation ponds must be used individually or in series and: a. Be constructed before any disturbance of the undisturbed area to be drained into the pond. b. Be located as near as possible to the disturbed area and out of perennial streams. unless approved by the commission. c. Meet all the criteria of this section. 2. Sediment storage volume. Sedimentation ponds must provide adequate sediment storage volume. Sediment storage volume must be determined using the universal soil loss equation. gully erosion rates. and the sediment delivery ratio converted to sediment volume, using either the sediment density or other empirical methods derived from regional sediment pond studies if approved by the commission. 3. Detention time. Sedimentation ponds must provide the required theoretical detention time for the water inflow or runoff entering the pond from a ten-year. twenty-four-hour precipitation event (design event}. The theoretical detention time must be sufficient to achieve and maintain applicable effluent standards. The calculated theoretical detention time and all supporting materials must be included in the permit application. 4. Dewatering. The stored water must be removed by a nonclogging dewatering device or a conduit spillway approved by the commission. and have a discharge rate to achieve and maintain the required theoretical detention time. The dewatering device may not be lower than the maximum elevation of the sediment storage volume. 5. Each operator shall design. construct. and maintain sedimentation ponds to prevent short circuiting to the extent possible. 6. The design. construction. and maintenance of a sedimentation pond or other sediment control measures do not relieve the operator from compliance with applicable effluent limitations. 7. 799 event), there must be no spillway outflow iRPe~gR--iRe emePgeAey--spt~~way--fPem---iRe---ieA-yeaP;---iweAiy-fe~P-Re~P ppeetptiaiteA as a result of runoff from the design event or lesser runoff events, unless multiple runoff events occur before the pond can be dewatered in accordance with approved plans in the permit. 8. Sediment must be removed from sedimentation ponds on a periodic basis in order to maintain an adequate storage volume for the design event. 9. An appropriate combination of principal and emergency spillways or a single spillway must be provided to safely discharge the runoff from a twenty-five-year, six-hour precipitation event for a temporary impoundment, a fifty-year, six-hour precipitation event for a permanent impoundment, or a larger event specified by the commission. The spillways must be capable of safely discharging the required event when the impoundment is at high water elevation. Commission approval of open channel spillway grades and allowable velocities must be obtained and velocities must be nonerosive. Earth or grass lined spillways may be used only where sustained flows are not expected. 18. The minimum elevation at the top of the settled embankment must be one foot [38.48 centimeters] above the water surface in the pond with the emergency spillway flowing at design depth. For embankments subject to settlement, this minimum elevation requirement applies at all times. 11. The constructed height of the dam must be increased a minimum of five percent over the design height to allow for settlement, unless it has been demonstrated to the commission that the material used and the design will ensure against settlement. 12. The minimum top width of the embankment may not be less than the quotient of (H+35)/5, where H is the height, in feet, or (H+18.7)/5, where H is the height, in meters, of the embankment as measured from the upstream toe of the embankment. 13. The upstream side slope of the settled embankment may not be steeper than a horizontal to vertical ration of 3:1 and the downstream side slope of the settled embankment may not be steeper than a horizontal to vertical ration of 2:1. 14. The foundation area must be cleared of all organic matter, all surfaces sloped to no steeper than a horizontal to vertical ration of 1:1, and the entire foundation surface scarified. Cutoff trenches must be installed if necessary to ensure stability. 791 15. The fill material must be free of sod, large roots, other large pieces of vegetative matter, and frozen soil, and in no case shall coal processing waste be used. 16. The placing and spreading of fill material must be started at the lowest point of the foundation. The fill must be brought up in horizontal layers in the thicknesses required to facilitate compaction and meet the design requirements of this section. Fill adjacent to structures, pipe conduits, and drainfill or antiseep collars must be compacted to a density equal to that of the surrounding fill by hand tamping or by using manually directed power tampers or plate vibrators. Compaction must be conducted as specified in the approved design. In lieu of the specific design requirements of this subsection and subsections 11 through 14, the operator may demonstrate that the design of the structure has a minimum static safety factor of 1.3 for a normal pool with steady state seepage saturation conditions. 17. If a proposed impoundment can meet the size and other criteria of 38 CFR 77.216, or is located where failure would be expected to cause loss of life or serious property damage, the following additional requirements must be met: a. An appropriate combination of principal and emergency spillways must be provided to safely discharge the runoff from a one-hundred-year, six-hour precipitation event, or a larger event as specified by the commission. b. The embankment must be designed and constructed with a seismic safety factor of 1.2 and a static safety factor of at least 1.5 for a normal pool with steady state seepage saturation conditions, or a higher safety factor as designated by the commission. c. Appropriate barriers must be provided to control seepage along conduits that extend through the embankment. d. The criteria of the mine safety and health administration as published in 38 CFR 77.216 must be met, and a copy of the plan sent to the district manager of the United States mine safety and health administration under that title submitted to the commission as part of the permit application. 18. Impoundment inspections. a. A registered professional engineer, or other specialist under the direction of a registered professional engineer, shall inspect each impoundment as required under subdivision b of this subsection. The registered professional engineer and specialist must be experienced in the construction of impoundments. 792 b. Inspections must be made regularly during construction, upon completion of construction, and at least yearly until removal of the structure or release of the performance bond. c. After each inspection the registered professional engineer shall promptly provide the commission a certified report that the impoundment has been constructed or maintained as designed and according to the approved plan and this chapter. The report must include discussion of any appearance of instability, structural weakness or other hazardous conditions, depth and elevation of any impounded water, existing storage capacity, any existing or required monitoring procedures and instrumentation, and any other aspects of the structure affecting stability. d. A copy of the inspection reports must be maintained at or near the minesite. 19. The embankment, including the surrounding areas and diversion ditches disturbed or created by construction, must be stabilized with respect to erosion and sudden drawdown by a vegetative cover or other means immediately after the embankment is completed. The active upstream face where water will be impounded may be riprapped or otherwise stabilized to protect the embankment from erosion and sudden drawdown. Areas where the reestablishment of vegetation is not successful or where rills and gullies develop must be repaired and revegetated according to section 69-05.2-15-06. 20. In addition to the requirements of subsection 18, all impoundments meeting the criteria of subsection 17, must be examined according to 30 CFR 77.216-3. Other impoundments must be examined at least seMtaAA~a~~Y quarterly by a qualified person for appearance of erosion, structural weakness, and other hazardous conditions. The annual inspection required by subsection 18 will be considered one of the examinations required by this subsection. 21. Plans for any enlargement, reduction, reconstruction, or other modification of dams or impoundments must be submitted to the commission. Commission approval of these plans is required before modification begins, unless a modification is necessary to eliminate a hazard to public health, safety, or the environment. 22. Sedimentation ponds may not be removed until authorized by the commission and the disturbed area has been stabilized and revegetated. The structure may not be removed sooner than two years after the last augmented seeding unless the last augmented seeding is a supplemental seeding into an established vegetation stand that is effectively controlling erosion. When the pond is removed, the affected land must be 793 reclaimed, unless the pond has been approved by the commission for retention. If the commission approves retention, the pond must meet all the requirements for permanent impoundments of section 69-95.2-16-12.

History: Effective September 1t 199e; amended effective November CHAPTER 75-82-84.1 AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Regarding proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-04.1, Child Support Guidelines Public hearings were conducted in Grand Forks on June 14, 1994, and in Bismarck on June 15, 1994, concerning proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-04.1, Child Support Guidelines. The proposed amendments are intended to comply with state and federal law requiring the department to establish child support guidelines. Some judicial decisions had the effect of requiring amendments to assure the guidelines cover all cases. Though not required by statute or judicial decision, the department has also concluded that improvements and refinements of this chapter were necessary. The most significant of these changes provides a means of recognizing all of the obligors child support duties in determining the obligation in each case. Other significant changes include a means of imputing income based on earning capacity. Many minor and technical changes were also made. No change to the schedule of child support amounts was made except to correct calculation errors, to identify guideline amounts for persons with monthly net incomes below $400, to provide application for families with seven or more children, and to provide application for persons with monthly net incomes in excess of $10,000. 75-82-84.1-81.

History: Effective February 1, 1991; amended effective January 1, instructions. Determination of support amount -General 1. Calculations of child support obligations provided for under this chapter consider and assume that one parent acts as a primary caregiver and the other parent contributes a payment of child support to the childs care. 2. Calculations assume that the care given to the child during temporary periods when the child resides with the obligor or the obligors relatives do not substitute for the child support obligation. 3. Net income received by an obligor from all sources must be considered in the determination of available money for child support. 4. The result of all calculations which determine a monetary amount ending in fifty cents or more must be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar, and must otherwise be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar. 5. In applying the child support guidelines, aAa !n obligors monthly net income amount ending in fifty dollars or more must be rounded up to the nearest one hundred dollars, and must otherwise be rounded down to the nearest one hundred dollars. 6. The annual total of all income considered in determining a child support obligation must be determined and then divided by twelve in order to determine the obligors monthly net income. 7. Income must be documented through the use of tax returns, current wage statements, and other information sufficiently to fully apprise the court of all gross income. Where gross income is subject to fluctuation, particularly in instances involving self-employment, information reflecting and covering a period of time sufficient to reveal the likely extent of fluctuations must be provided. 8. Calculations made under this chapter are ordinarily based upon recent past circumstances because past circumstances are typically a reliable indicator of future circumstances, particularly circumstances concerning income. If 814 circumstances that materially affect the child support obligation are very likely to change in the near future, consideration may be given to the likely future circumstances. 9. Determination of a child support obligation is appropriate in any matter where the child and both of the child's parents do not reside together. 10. Each child support order must include a statement of the net income of the obligor used to determine the child support obligation, and how that net income was determined. 11.

The fair rental value of the land being purchased; or b. The total principal and interest payments actually made toward the purchase of the land.

When the other parent of a child living with the obligor does not live with the obligor, the cost of supporting that child is determined by: a. Applying the obligors net income and the total number of children to whom the obligor owes a duty of support, to section 75-02-04.1-10; b. Dividing the amount determined under subdivision a by the total number of children to whom the obligor owes a duty of support; and 816 c. Multiplying the amount determined under subdivision b times the total number of children to whom the obligor owes a duty of support and who are also living with the obligor. 2. When the other parent of a child living with the obligor also lives with the obligor, the cost of supporting that child is determined by: a. Applying the combined total net income of the obligor and the other parent and the total number of children to whom the obligor or the other parent owes a duty of support, to section 75-02-04.1-10; b. Dividing the amount determined under subdivision a by the total number of children to whom the obligor or the other parent owes a duty of support; c. Multiplying the amount determined under subdivision b times the total number of children to whom the obligor owes a duty of support and who are also living with the obligor; d. Dividing the obligors net income by the combined total net income of the obligor and the other parent; and e. Multiplying the amount determined under subdivision c times the decimal fraction determined under subdivision dM 3. For purposes of the calculation described in subsection 2, income may not be imputed under section 75-02-04.1-08. 4. When the other parent of a child living with the obligor also lives with the obligor, no deduction for the cost of supporting that child may be made, under subsection 4 of section 75-02-04.1-06.1, from the obligors income if the obligor fails to furnish reliable information sufficient to determine the other parents income. H;story: Effective February 1, 1991; amended effective January 1. Determination of support amount in multiple-family cases. 1. This section must be used to determine the child support amount presumed to be the correct amount of child support in all cases involving an obligor who: a. Owes duties of support payable to two or more obligees; or 817 b. Owes a duty of support to at least one obligee and also owes a duty of support to a child living with the obligor who is not also the child of that obligee. 2. If a court consolidates proceedings involving an obligor and two or more obligees, the court must determine all obligations that may be determined in the consolidated proceeding without regard to whom the initial moving party may be. 3. A hypothetical amount that reflects the cost of supporting children living with the obligor, as determined under section 75-02-04.1-06, and a hypothetical amount due to each obligee under this chapter must first be determined for the children living with the obligor and each obligee, whether or not the obligee is a party to the proceeding, assuming for purposes of that determination: a. The obligor has no support obligations\u00b7 except to the obligee in question; and b. The guidelines amount is not rebutted. 4. A hypothetical amount due to each obligee under this chapter must next be determined for each obligee who is a party to the proceeding, assuming for purposes of that determination: a. The obligors net income is reduced by: (1) The amount of child support due to all other obligees, as determined under subsection 3; and (2} The cost of supporting a child living with the obligor, who is not also the child of that obligee, as determined under section 75-02-04.1-06; b. The guidelines amount is not rebutted; and c. Any support amount otherwise determined to be less than one dollar is determined to be one dollar. 5. For each obligee before the court, the support obligation presumed to be the correct amount of child support is equal to one-half of the total of the two amounts determined, with respect to that obligee. under subsections 3 and 4. 6. The fact, if it is a fact, that the obligor is required to pay, or pays, a different amount than the hypothetical amounts determined under subsections 3 and 4 is not a basis for deviation from the procedure described in this section. H;story: Effective January 1, 1995. a. b. An obligor is 11underemployed11 if the obligorls gross income from earnings is significantly less than prevailing amounts earned in the community by persons with similar work history and occupational qualifications. 2. An obligor is presumed to be underemployed if the obligor1s gross income from earnings is less than six-tenths of prevailing amounts earned in the community by persons with similar work history and occupational qualifications. 3. Except as provided in subsections 4 and 5, monthly gross income based on earning capacity equal to the greatest of subdivisions a through c, less actual gross earnings, must be imputed to an obligor who is unemployed or underemployed. a.

Parental responsibility for children in foster care. It is important that parents maintain a tie to and responsibility for their child when that child is in foster care. Financial responsibility for the support of that child is one component of the maintenance of the relationship of parent and child. 1. In order to determine monthly net income, it is first necessary to identify the parent or parents who have financial responsibility for any child entering foster care, and to determine the net income of those financially responsible parents. ff-tRe-eR~ta~s-~aFeAts-t~ve-~A-se~aFate-Re~seAetas; eaeR-~aFeAt~s--f~AaAe~at--Fes~eAs~8~t~ty--m~st--8e--se~aFate+y aeteFm~Aea~---Net--~Aeeme--feF--eaeR--~aFeAt--m~st-se-aaj~stea ~~waFa-te-Fefteet-aAy-~Aeeme;-Aet-Feee~vea-fFem--tRat--~aFeAt; wA~eA-~s-a~Feetty-attF~B~tas+e-te-aAa-f~FA~sAea-eA-BeAatf-ef-a eR~ta-feF-wRem-tRat-~aFeAt-~s-f~AaAe~atty-Fes~eAs~8te~ If the parents of a child in foster care reside together, and neither parent has a duty to support any child who does not either reside with the parents or receive foster care, the income of the parents must be combined and treated as the income of the obligor.

The ramifications of program violations is established. Out-based program activities and eligible participants are defined. The rules outline administration and organization requirements and participant admission, discharge, and orientation guidelines. Case plans and ongoing records of participation are described. Guidelines for mail delivery, discipline and behavior management, health and medical care are provided. Staffing ratios and staff qualifications are outlined. If the out-based program is mobile, the rules establish communication standards for base station and regulatory agencies in the area where the out-based program operates. The rules provide for the maintenance of a daily log and the development of emergency and safety procedures. Transportation standards, minimum toileting, sanitation, nutrition, clothing, personal needs, sleeping shelters, equipment requirements, and limitations on hiking, backpacking, and solo activities are established. 75-83-16-81.

AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Chapter 75-02-11 Food Stamp Program. A public hearing was conducted on July 28, 1994, in Bismarck, concerning proposed North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-02-11, Food Stamp Program. The purpose of chapter 75-02-11 is to incorporate federal Food Stamp eligibility requirements into the North Dakota Administrative Code. Those federal requirements allow limited flexibility in the administration of the Food Stamp program. The new chapter also describes the policy to be implemented in areas where such flexibility permits choices. The department proposed rules amending North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-01-03, Appeals and Hearings, conducted a public hearing on those rules on September 14, 1994, and received written comment on those proposed rules until the end of the day on Friday, October 14, 1994. The department has determined that material proposed for inclusion in chapter 75-02-11 should in fact be included in chapter 75-01-03. Therefore, material originally proposed for inclusion in North Dakota Administrative Code sections 75-02-11-29, Consolidation of Administrative Disqualification Hearing with Fair Hearing; 75-02-11-30, Administrative Disqualification Hearing -Notice; and 75-02-11-31, Administrative Disqualification Hearing -Procedure, have been deleted from this chapter and inserted in chapter 75-01-03 with changes appropriate to conform those sections to the terminology, definitions, and structure of chapter 75-01-03. Consistent with that change, other technical changes, including renumbering, have been made to this chapter.

A household may apply for food stamps by requesting an application form in person, in writing, or by telephone, and filing the form with the county in person, through an authorized representative, or by mail. The date the county receives the application is the date of filing. An incomplete application may be filed if the form contains the applicant's name and address and is signed by a responsible member of the household or the authorized representative. 2. A household in which all members are applying for public assistance may apply for food stamps at the same time by completing an application for aid to families with dependent children, food stamps, and medical assistance. 3. A household in which all members are in receipt of, or are applying for, supplemental security income may file a food stamp application with the social security administration office at the same time the household files its supplemental security income application. 4. The household shall be interviewed and certain information must be verified before the household is certified to participate in the program. The county shall conduct a single interview for a household that applies for both food stamps and public assistance. It is the responsibility of the household to provide information and verification sufficient to establish eligibility for each household member. 5. The household shall designate a member as the head of the household.

The entire amount of a households aid to families with dependent children grant is considered unearned income. 4. A household billed for heating or cooling costs shall use a standard utility allowance in determining its shelter deduction unless the household verifies that its actual costs are in excess of the standard utility allowance. The amount of the standard utility allowance depends on the household size and is adjusted on October first of each year, using the same percent of change that the food and nutrition service 905 applies to the gross monthly income eligibility standards. A household that uses the standard utility allowance may not use the telephone standard. 5. A household not entitled to use the standard utility allowance but which incurs costs for a telephone in its home is allowed a telephone standard in determining its shelter deduction.

The county shall screen applicants at the time the household requests assistance in order to identify those households eligible for expedited service. Coupons must be made available to a household entitled to expedited service not later than the fifth calendar day after the application is filed. If a household is determined eligible for expedited service after the initial screening, coupons must be made available to the household not later than five calendar days from the date of determination. 5.

The person makes a satisfactory showing that: (1) The person intended to dispose of the income or assets, either at fair market value or other valuable consideration, and the person had an objectively reasonable belief that fair market value or its equivalent was received; (2) The income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid or benefits under this chapter; or (3) For periods after the return, all income or assets transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the person; d. The individual shows that the total cumulative uncompensated value of all income and assets transferred for less than fair market value by the individual or the individual s spouse is less than the actual cost of services of a type provided as benefits under this chapter, provided after the transfer was made, for which payment has not been made and which are not subject to payment by any third party, provided that such a showing may only be made with respect to periods when the person is otherwise eligible for benefits under this chapter. 3. There is a presumption that a transfer for less than fair market value was made for purposes including the purpose of qualifying for benefits under this chapter: a. In any case in which the persons assets and the assets of the persons spouse remaining after the transfer produce income which, when added to other income available to the 939 person and to the persons spouse totals an amount insufficient to meet all living expenses and medical costs reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the person and by the persons spouse in the month of transfer and in the thirty-five months, or fifty-nine months in the case of a transfer to a trust, following the month of transfer; b. In any case in which an inquiry about medicaid benefits or benefits under this chapter was made, by or on behalf of the person to any other person, before the date of the transfer; c. In any case in which the person or the persons spouse was an applicant for or recipient of medicaid or benefits under this chapter before the date of transfer; d. In any case in which a transfer is made by or on behalf of the persons spouse, if the value of the transferred income or asset, when added to the value of the persons other assets, would exceed asset limits; or e. In any case in which the transfer was made, on behalf of the person or the persons spouse, by a guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact, to the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact or to any spouse, child, grandchild, brother, sister, niece, nephew, parent, or grandparent, by birth, adoption, or marriage, of the guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact. 4. An applicant or recipient who claims that income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid or benefits under this chapter must show that a desire to receive medicaid or benefits under this chapter played no part in the decision to make the transfer and must rebut any presumption arising under subsection 3. The fact, if it is a fact, that the person would be eligible for medicaid or benefits under this chapter had the persons spouse not transferred income or assets for less than fair market value, is not evidence that the income or assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medicaid or benefits under this chapter. 5. If the transferee of any income or asset is the child, grandchild, brother, sister, niece, nephew, parent, or grandparent of the person or the persons spouse, services or assistance furnished by the transferee to the person or the persons spouse may not be treated as consideration for the transferred income or asset unless the transfer is made pursuant to a valid written contract entered into prior to rendering the services. 940 6. A transfer is complete when the person, or the person's spouse, making the transfer has no lawful means of undoing the transfer or requiring a restoration of ownership. 7. For purposes of this section: a. Fair market value is received: (1) In the case of an asset not subject to reasonable dispute concerning its value, such as cash, bank deposits, stocks, and fungible commodities, when one hundred percent of apparent fair market value is received; (2) In the case of an asset subject to reasonable dispute concerning its value, when seventy-five percent of estimated fair market value is received; and (3) In the case of income, when one hundred percent of apparent fair market value is received. b. \"Uncompensated value\" means the difference between fair market value and the value of any consideration received. 8. This section is applicable to all transfers whenever made. History: Effective May 1, 1995. purposes of this chapter: 1. A person is a resident of this state if: a.

History: Effective May 1, AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Regarding proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-03-21, Licensing of Family Foster Homes for Adults. A public hearing was conducted on September 14, 1994, in Bismarck, concerning proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code chapter 75-03-21, Licensing of Family Foster Homes for Adults. The proposed amendments make changes in definitions in conformity with amendments made to North Dakota Century Code chapter 50-11 by the 1993 legislative assembly concerning the provision of foster care to adults. The amended rules require that an application contain a self-declaration of medical history, documentation of completion of a course related to fire prevention and safety, a fire safety self-declaration form, and documentation of competence in providing foster care for adults in conformity with amendments to and requirements of North Dakota Century Code chapter 50-11. If requested, a report of a physician's examination, psychological examination, or drug and alcohol evaluation are to be submitted. The license is valid for a period of twenty-four-months, rather than twelve months. The amendments require an inspection of the heating and electrical system and provide that the department may at any time require inspection by a local fire inspector or the State Fire Marshal if the department suspects the home is not fire safe. Providers of adult foster care must furnish documentation of competence in providing foster care for adults. An amendment to North Dakota Administrative Code section 75-03-21-10(3) provides that substitute caregivers may not be left in charge of the home for more than sixty calendar days for a twenty-four month period. For every day a substitute caregiver is left in charge of a foster home for more than four hours, that counts as a day toward the sixty calendar day limit, the substitute caregiver may be in charge of a foster home for adults. A new rule provides for issuance of a provisional license to a licensee where a home does not comply with all applicable standards during the period the home is brought into compliance with standards not to exceed six months. A new rule establishes time periods for correcting certain deficiencies identified in a correction order. A new rule provides for a schedule of fines for violation of certain rules if a notice of noncompliance with the correction order is issued which implements amendments to North Dakota Century Code chapter 50-11. A new rule also specifies what records must be kept and maintained with respect to each resident in the home. 943 75-83-21-81.

An applicant denied services or a client terminated from services should be given an appropriate referral to other public or private service providers and should be assisted in finding other resources. 1015 4. For denial or termination of services, a review of the decision by the county social service board director or the designee may be requested. A request for review does not change the time within which the request for an appeal hearing must be filed. 5. Termination of all SPED program and medicaid waiver program services or immediate termination of a specific service must be considered by the department through its aging services division when continued service to the client presents an immediate threat to the health or safety of the client, the provider of services, or others. Examples of client behaviors that could lead to termination of services include physical abuse of the provider or contraindicated practices, like smoking while using oxygen. The county social service board shall inform the client in writing the reason for the termination, the right to appeal, and the appeal process, as provided for in chapter 75-01-03.

At the time of audit and final computation for settlement, the department may invoke a penalty of five percent of a provider's administrative costs for the period of deficiency if: (1) Poor or no daily census records are available to document client units. Poor census records exist if those records are insufficient for audit verification of client units against submitted claims for reimbursement. (2) After identification and notification through a previous audit, a provider continues to list items exempted in audit as allowable costs on the cost report. (3) For intermediate care facilities for the aeve~e~~eRta~~y--a~sae~ea mentally retarded, the provider fails the certification requirements one hundred twenty days after the initial startup date or is decertified after having been previously certified. c. Penalties may be separately imposed for each violation. d. A penalty may be waived by the department upon a showing of good cause. H;story: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985i June 1, 1. Except for intermediate care facilities for the aeve~e~~Rta~~y--a~sae~ea mentally retarded, payment rate limits will be established for services, room, and board. 2. Interim rates based on budgeted data, as approved, will be used for payment of services during the year. board charges to clients may not exceed the maximum supplemental security income payment less twenty-five dollars for the personal incidental expenses of the client, plus the average dollar value of food stamps to the eligible clientele in the facility. If the interim room and board rate exceeds the final room and board rate, the provider shall reimburse clients in a manner approved by the department. 4. In residential facilities where rental assistance is available to individual Fes~SeAts clients or the facility, the rate for room costs chargeable to individual Fes~SeAts clients will be established by the governmental unit providing the subsidy. 5. In residential facilities where energy assistance program benefits are available to individual Fes~aeAts clients or the facility, room and board rates will be reduced to reflect the average annual dollar value of such benefits. 6. Income from client production must be applied to client wages and the cost of production. The department will not participate in the gains or losses associated with client production conducted pursuant to the applicable provision of 29 CFR 525. 7. The final rate established is payment of all allowable, reasonable, and actual costs for all elements necessary to the delivery of a basic service to eligible clients subject to limitations and cost offsets of this chapter. 8. No payments may be soli cited or recefved b.f'a provider from a client or any other person to supplement the final rate of reimbursement. 9. The rate of reimbursement established must be no greater than the rate charged to a private payor for the same or similar service. 10. The department will determine interim and final rates of reimbursement for continuing contract providers based upon cost data from the: a. Submission requirements of section 75-04-05-02; and b. Field and desk audits. 11. Rates of continuing service providers, except for those identified in subdivision f of subsection 3 of section 75-04-05-10, will be based on the following: a. Rate for continuing contract providers, who have had no increase in the number of clients the provider is licensed to serve, will be based upon ninety-five percent of the 1026 rated occupancy established by the department or actual occupancy, whichever is greater. b. Rates for continuing service providers, who have an increase in the number of clients the provider is licensed to serve in an existing service, will be based upon: (1) Subdivision a of subsection 11 of section 75-04-05-09 for the period until the increase takes effect; and (2) Ninety-five percent of the projected units of service for the remaining period of the fiscal year based. upon an approved plan of integration or actual occupancy, whichever is greater. c. When establishing the final rates, the department may grant nonenforcement of subdivisions a and b of subsection 11 of section 75-04-05-09 when it determines the provider implemented cost containment measures consistent with the decrease in units, or when it determines that the failure to do so would have imposed a detriment to the well-being of its clients. (1) Acceptable cost containment measures include a decrease in actual salary and fringe benefit costs from the approved salary and fringe benefits costs for the day service or group home proportionate to the decrease in units. (2) Detriment to the well-being of clients includes a forced movement from one group home to another or obstructing the day service movement of a client in order to maintain the ninety-five percent rated occupancy procedures are as follows: a. Rate adjustments may be made to correct errors. b. A final adjustment will be made for those facilities which have terminated participation in the program and have disposed of all its depreciable assets. Federal medicare regulations pertaining to gains and losses on disposable assets will be applied. c. Any requests for reconsideration of the rate must be submitted in writing to the developmental disabilities division within ten days of the date of the rate notification of the final rate determination. The department may redetermine the rate on its own motion. d. A provider may appeal a decision ey-Fe~~esttA\u00a7-a-fatF ReaFtA\u00a7 within thirty days after mailing of the Fate AettfteatteA--eF--tRe written notice of the decision on a request for reconsideration of the final rate. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985i June 1, Reported allowable costs will be included in determining the interim and final rate. The method of finalizing the reimbursement rate per unit will be through the use of the retrospective ratesetting system. 1. Retrospective ratesetting requires that an interim rate be established prior to the year in which it will be effective. The determination of a final rate for all services begins with the reported cost of the providers operations for the previous fiscal year. Once it has been determined that reported costs are allowable, reasonable, and client-related, those costs are compared to the reimbursements received through the interim rate. 1028 2. a. Settlements will be made through a Fate--Fee~et~eR recoupment or refund to the department for an overpayment, or an additional payment to the provider for an underpayment. b. Interprovider settlements between intermediate care facilities for the eeve+e~meRta++y--e~sas+ee mentally retarded and day services will be made through a Fate Fee~et~eR recoupment or refund to the department from the day service provider to correct an overpayment; or a payout to the intermediate care facilities for the eeve+e~~eRta++y--e~sas+ee mentally retarded, for the day service provider, to correct an underpayment. 3. Limitations. a. The department will accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by providers. These statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations for efficiency and economy based on a determination of the standards of operations necessary for efficient delivery of needed services. These limitations may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs, on the costs of providing services, or on the costs of specific areas of operations. The department may implement such ceilings at any time, based upon the statistics available, or as required by guidelines, regulations, or statutes concerning title XIX of the Social Security Act. b. Providers, to maintain reasonable rates of reimbursement, must deliver units of service at or near their rated capacity. Upon a finding by the department that an excess idle capacity exists and has existed, the cost of which is borne by the department, the provider will be notified of the departments intention to reduce the level of state financial participation or invoke the cancellation provisions of the provider agreement. The provider must, within ten days of such notification, demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the department, that the department should not invoke its authority under this provision, or accept the departments finding. c. Providers will not be reimbursed for services, rendered to clients, which exceed the rated occupancy of any facility as established by a fire prevention authority. d. Providers of residential services must offer services to each Fes~eeRt client three hundred sixty-five days per year, except for leap years in which three hundred sixty-six days must be offered. Costs and budget data must be reported on this basis and rates of reimbursement will be established on the same basis. Providers will not 1029 be reimbursed for those days in which services are not offered to Fes~aeAts clients. e. Providers of day services must offer services to each client two hundred sixty days per year, except for leap years in which two hundred sixty-one days ~ay must be offered. Costs and budget data must be reported on--Ehis basis and rates of reimbursement will be established on the same basis. Providers will not be reimbursed for those days services are not offered to the clients. State recognized holidays will be treated as days in which services are offered. f. Services exempted from the application of subdivisions d and e are: (1) Emergency services. (2) Res~~te-eaFe~ {3~--~MteAaea-Fes~~te-eaFe~ {4~ Infant development. 1il Supported living. {8~--~eeAA~ea~-e~~~e~eAt~ {9~--QA-tAe-jes-tFa~A~A\u00a7~ g. (1) Days of services in facilities subject to the application of subdivision d must be provided for a minimum of three hundred thirty-five days per year per Fes~aeAt client. A reduction of payment to the provider in an amount equal to the rate times the number of days of service less than the minimum will be made unless the regional developmental disability eeeFa~AateF program administrator determines that a failure to meet the minimum was justified. (2) Days of services in facilities subject to the application of subdivision e must be provided for a minimum of two hundred forty days per year per client. A reduction of payment to the provider in an amount equal to the rate times the number of days of service less than the minimum will be made unless the regional developmental disability eeeFB~AateF program administrator determines that a failure to meet the minimum was justified. 1030 (3) For purposes of this subdivision, the fiscal year of the facility will be used, and all days before the admission, or after the discharge of the Fes~aeAt-eF client will be counted towards meeting the minimum. h. Salary and fringe benefit cost limits, governing the level of state financial participation, may be established by the department by calculating: (1) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions, by program size and numbers served, and programs in and out of state; (2) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions in state government; (3) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions in the community served by the provider; or (4) Data from paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, taken in combination. By using private funds, providers may establish higher salaries and benefit levels than those established by the department. i. Management fees and costs may not exceed the lesser of two percent of administrative costs or the price of comparable services, facilities, or supplies purchased elsewhere, primarily in the local market. H;story: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985i June 1, report. 1. The cost report provides for the identification of the allowable expenditures and basic services subject to reimbursement by the department. Where costs are incurred solely for a basic service, the costs must be assigned directly to that basic service. Where costs are incurred jointly for two or more basic services, the costs will be allocated as follows: a. Personnel. The total cost of all staff identified in payroll records must be listed by position title and distributed to basic services subject to the approval of staff client ratios by the department. Time studies may be performed for one week at least quarterly for allocation. Where no time studies exist, the applicable 1031 units must be used for allocation. Where there is no definition of a unit of service, the department will use the unit of service for billing purposes for residential settings. b. Fringe benefits. The cost of fringe benefits must be allocated to basic services based on the ratio of the basic service personnel costs to total personnel costs. Personnel costs on which no fringe benefits are paid will be excluded. c. Equipment. The total cost of all equipment, whether rented, leased, purchased, or depreciated, must be distributed to basic service based on usage or applicable units. d. Real property expense. The total of all property costs, whether rented, leased, purchased, or depreciated, must be allocated based on direct square footage. Where multiple usage of direct use area occurs, the allocation will first be done by square footage and then by applicable units. e. Travel. The total of all unassigned travel costs, which must not exceed the state rate of reimbursement, must be included in administrative costs. f. Supplies. The total of all unassigned supply costs must be included with administrative costs. g. Food services. The total of all food costs should be allocated based on meals served. Where the number of meals served has not been identified, applicable units must be used. h. Insurance and bonds. The total of all such costs except insurance costs representing real property expense must be included as administrative costs. i. Contractual services. The total of all contractual costs must be allocated based upon applicable units or, if appropriate, included as part of the administrative costs. j. Production costs. Total expenses for aay-aet~v~ty;-wePk aet~v~ty;-veeat~eAa~-aeve~epMeAt;-aAa-eMteAaea--eMp~e~At facility-based day and work activity must be allocated in part to production using the facility-based mean productivity percentage for each service where production occurred. If the providers records do not identify total expenses for nonfacility-based activities from total expenses for facility-based activities, the department will use total expenses and total mean productivity percentage for each service where production occurred. 1032 k. General client costs. Total general client expenses must be allocated to service categories, exclusive of production, room, board, and eMieAaea-e~~teYffieAt supported living arrangements based on actual census days. 1. Administrative costs. Total administrative expenses must be allocated to all service categories, exclusive of room, board, and production, based upon the ratio of the basic service cost to total cost excluding administrative and production costs. The percentage calculated for residential services must be based on total costs for training, room, and board for the specific residential service with the allocation made only to training. m. Administrative costs to production. A portion of the administrative expense allocated to Say--aet~v~ty;--W9PK aet~v~iy;--veeat~eAat-aevete~~At;-aAS-eMieAaea-e~~teYffieAi facility-based day and work activity must be allocated to production based upon the facility-based mean productivity percentage for each service wherein production occurred. If the providers records do not identify total expenses for nonfacility-based activities from total expenses for facility-based activities, the department will use total expenses and total mean productivity percentage for each service where production occurred. 2. Identification of the means of financing is to be as follows: a. Budget reports require the disclosure of all revenues currently used to finance costs and those estimated to finance future costs, inclusive of the providers estimate of state financial participation. b. Revenues must be distributed on the appropriate budget report by program. Where private contributions are used to supplement or enrich services, the sum may be distributed accordingly. Where contributions are held in reserve for special purposes, it may be described by narrative. c. The disclosure of contract income and production costs is required to establish a rate of reimbursement supplemental to, and not duplicative of, these revenues and costs. d. State financial participation in the habilitative costs associated with facility-based production activities where contract income is realized shall not exceed the percentage difference between the mean productivity of the clients, as determined pursuant to 29 CFR 525, and one hundred percent. H;story: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985i June 1, to cost and cost limitation. 1. Providers under contract with the department to provide services to aeve+e~~Ata++y----a~sae+ea persons with developmental disabilities must submit no less than annually, a statement of costs, both current and estimated, on the cost report. 2. Providers must disclose all costs and all revenues. 3. Providers must identify income to offset costs where applicable in order that state financial participation not supplant or duplicate other funding sources. These sources, and the cost to be offset, must include;-e~t-aFe--Aet--+~m~tea te; the following: a. Fees, the cost of the service or time for which the fee was imposed excluding those fees based on cost as established by the department. b. Insurance recoveries income, costs reported in the current year to the extent of costs allowed in the prior or current year for that loss. c. P~FeRase--a~see~Ats;-eest-ef-~tems-eF-seFv~ees-a~see~Atea~ a~--Reeates--aAa-Fef~ABS;-eest-ef-~tems-eF-SeFY~ees-Fea~eee-~A east~ e~ Rental income, cost of space in facilities or for equipment included in the rate of reimbursement. f~ d. Telephone and telegraph income from clients, staff, or guests, cost of the service. g~ ~ Rental assistance or subsidy when not reported as third party income, total costs. A~ f. Interest or investment income, interest expense. ~~ ~ Medical payments, cost of medical services included in the rate of reimbursement as appropriate. j~ ~ Respite care income when received for a reserved bed, room, board, and staff costs. k~ i. Other income to the provider from local, state, or federal units of government may be determined by the department to be an offset to cost. 1934 4. Payments to a provider by its vendor will be considered as discounts, refunds, or rebates in determining allowable costs under the program even though these payments may be treated as \"contributions\" or \"unrestricted grants\" by the provider and the vendor. However, such payments may represent a true donation or grant, and as such will not be offset against costs. Examples include;-s~t-aFe-Aet-+~~~tea-te; when: a. Payments are made by a vendor in response to building or other fundraising campaigns in which communitywide contributions are solicited. b. Payments are in addition to discounts, refunds, or rebates, which have been customarily allowed under arrangements between the provider and the vendor. c. The volume or value of purchases is so nominal that no relationship to the contribution can be inferred. d. The contributor is not engaged in business with the provider or a facility related to the provider. 5. Where an owner or other official of a provider directly receives from a vendor monetary payments or goods or services for the owners or official s own personal use as a result of the providers purchases from the vendor, the value of such payments, goods, or services constitutes a type of refund or rebate and must be applied as a reduction of the providers costs for goods or services purchased from the vendor. 6. Where the purchasing function for a provider is performed by a central unit or organization, all discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates should be credited to the costs of the provider in accordance with the instructions above. These should not be treated as income of the central purchasing function or used to reduce the administrative costs of that function. Such administrative costs are, however, properly allocable to the facilities serviced by the central purchasing function. 7. Purchase discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates are reductions of the cost of whatever was purchased. They should be used to reduce the specific costs to which they apply. If possible, they should accrue to the period to which they apply. If not, they will reduce expenses in the period in which they are received. The reduction to expense for supplies or services must be used to reduce the total cost of the goods or services for all clients without regard to whether the goods or supplies are designated for all clients or a specific group. a. \"Purchase discounts\" include cash discounts, trade, and quantity discounts. \"Cash discount\" is for prepaying or 1035 paying within a certain time of receipt of invoice. \"Trade discount\" is a reduction of cost granted certain customers. 11Quantity discounts\" are reductions of price because of the size of the order. b. Allowances are reductions granted or accepted by the creditor for damage, delay, shortage, imperfection, or other cause, excluding discounts and refunds. c. Refunds are amounts paid back by the vendor generally in recognition of damaged shipments, overpayments, or return purchases. d. Rebates represent refunds of a part of the cost of goods or services. Rebates differ from quantity discounts in that it is based on dollar value of purchases, not quantity of purchases. e. \"Other cost-related income\" includes amounts generated through the sale of a previously expensed item, e.g., supplies or equipment.

History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; January 1, 1989; August 1, 1992; June 1. The principles of reimbursement for provider costs require that payment for services should include depreciation on depreciable assets that are used to provide allowable services to clients. This includes assets that may have been fully or partially depreciated on the books of the provider, but are in use at the time the provider enters the program. The useful lives of such assets are considered not to have ended and depreciation calculated on the revised extended useful life is allowable. Likewise, a depreciation allowance is permitted on assets that are used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. Depreciation is recognized as an allocation of the cost of an asset over its estimated useful life. If any depreciated asset is sold or disposed of for an amount in excess of its undepreciated value, the excess represents an overstatement of the cost of the asset to the facility. 2. Depreciation methods are as follows: a. The straight-line method of depreciation must be used. The method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied on a basis consistent from year to year and detailed schedules of individual assets must be maintained. If the books of account reflect depreciation 1041 different than that submitted on the cost report, a reconciliation must be prepared. b. Depreciation will be computed using a useful life of ten years for all items except vehicles, which sRatt must be four years, and buildings, which sRatt must be twenty-five years or more. A different useful life may be used; however, when the useful life selected differs significantly from that established by the guidelines, the deviation must be based on convincing reasons supported by adequate documentation, generally describing the realization of some unexpected event. 3. Acquisitions are treated as follows: a. If a depreciable asset has, at the time of its acquisition, a historical cost of at least three hundred dollars, or if it is acquired in quantity and the cost of the quantity is at least five hundred dollars, its cost must be capitalized and depreciated in accordance with subdivision b of subsection 2. Cost during the construction of an asset, such as architectural, consulting and legal fees, interest, etc., should be capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset. b. Major repair and maintenance costs on equipment or buildings must be capitalized if they exceed five thousand dollars and will be depreciated in accordance with subdivision b of subsection 2. 4. Proper records will provide accountability for the fixed assets and also provide adequate means by which depreciation can be computed and established as an allowable client-related cost. 5. The basis for depreciation is as follows: a. The amount of historical costs sRatt must not exceed the lower of: -- (1) Current reproduction costs less straight-line depreciation over the life of the asset to the time of purchase; or (2) Fair market value at the time of purchase. In the case of a trade-in, the historical cost will consist of the sum of the book value of the trade-in plus the cash paid. b. For depreciation and reimbursement purposes, donated depreciable assets may be recorded and depreciated based on their fair market value. In the case where the 1042 providers records do not contain the fair market value of the donated asset, as of the date of the donation, an appraisal must be made. An appraisal made by a recognized appraisal expert will be accepted for depreciation. c. No provision shall be made for increased costs due to the sale of a facility. 6. Providers which finance facilities pursuant to North Dakota Century Code chapter 6-89.6, subject to the approval of the department, may elect to be reimbursed based upon the mortgage principle payments rather than depreciation. Once an election is made by the provider, it may not be changed without department approval. 7. Recapture of depreciation. a. At any time that the operators of a facility sell an asset, or otherwise remove that asset from service in or to the facility, any depreciation costs asserted after June 1, 1984, with respect to that asset, are subject to recapture to the extent that the sale or disposal price exceeds the undepreciated value. If the department determines that a sale or disposal was made to a related party, or if a facility terminates participation as a provider of services in a department program, any depreciation costs asserted after June 1, 1984, with respect to that asset or facility, are subject to recapture to the extent that the fair market value of the asset or facility exceeds the depreciated value. b. The seller and the purchaser may, by agreement, determine which shall pay the recaptured depreciation. If the parties to the sale do not inform the department of their agreement, the department will offset the amount of depreciation to be recaptured against any amounts owed, or to be owed, by the department to the seller and buyer. The department will first exercise the offset against the seller, and shall only exercise the offset against the buyer to the extent that the seller has failed to repay the amount of the recaptured depreciation. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985i June 1, 1. In general: a. To be allowable under the program, interest must be: 1843 (1) Supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required; (2) Identifiable in the provider's accounting records; (3) Related to the reporting period in which the costs are incurred; (4) Necessary and proper for the operation, maintenance, or acquisition of the provider's facilities used therein; (5) Unrelated to funds borrowed to purchase assets in excess of cost or fair market value; and (6) When representative of borrowing for the purpose of making capital expenditures for assets that were owned by any other Res~~tat; facility; or service provider on or after July 18, 1984, limited to that amount of interest cost which such Res~~tat; facility; or service provider may have reported, for ratesetting purposes, had the asset undergone neither refinancing nor a change of ownership. b. In such cases where it was necessary to issue bonds for financing, any bond premium or discount shall be accounted for and written off over the life of the bond issue. 2. Interest paid by the provider to partners, stockholders, or related organizations of the provider is not allowable as a cost except when interest expense is incurred subject to North Dakota Century Code chapter 6-09.6. 3. A provider may combine or 11pool11 various funds in order to maximize the return on investment. Where funds are pooled, proper records must be maintained to preserve the identity of each fund in order to permit the earned income to be related to its source. Income earned on gifts and grants does not reduce allowable interest expense. 4. Funded depreciation requirements are as follows: a. Funding of depreciation is the practice of setting aside cash or other liquid assets to be used for replacement of the assets depreciated or for other capital purposes. tRe ae~es~ts-aFe;-~A-effeet;-~aae-fFe~-tRe-easR--\u00a7eAeFatea--ay tRe--AeAeasR--eM~eAse--ae~Fee~at~eA~ This provision is recommended as a means of conserving funds for the replacement of depreciable assets. It is expected that the funds will be invested to earn revenues. The revenues generated by this investment will not be considered as a 1044 reduction of allowable interest expense provided such revenues remain in the fund. b. The deposits are, in effect, made from the cash generated by the noncash expense depreciation and do not include interest income. Deposits to the funded depreciation account are generally in an amount equal to the depreciation expense charged to costs each year. In order to qualify for all provisions of funding depreciation, the minimum deposits to the account must be fifty percent of the depreciation expensed that year. Deposits in excess of accumulated depreciation are allowable; however, the interest income generated by the 11extra11 deposits will be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense. ~Rts-~FevtsteR-ts-FeeeffiffieRaea-as--a--~aRs--ef--eeRseFvtR\u00a7 f~Ras--feF--tRe--Fe~taeeffieRt-ef-ae~Feetaste-assets~--ft-ts eM~eetea-tRat-tRe-f~Ras-wttt-se-tRvestea-te-eaFR-FeveR~es~ ~Re--FeveR~es--geReFatea--sy--tR~s--tRvest~Rt-wttt-Ret-se eeRstaeFea-as-a-Fea~etteR-ef--attewaste--tRteFest--eM~eRse ~Fevtaea-s~eR-FeveR~es-FeffiatA-tR-tRe-f~Ra~ c. Monthly or annual deposits representing depreciation must be in the funded depreciation account for six months or more to be considered as valid funding transactions. Deposits of less than six months are not eligible for the benefits of a funded depreciation account. However, if deposits invested before the six-month period remain in the account after the six-month period, the investment income for the entire period will not reduce the allowable interest expensed in that period. Total funded depreciation in excess of accumulated depreciation on client-related assets will be considered as ordinary investments and the income therefrom will be used to offset interest expense. d. Withdrawals for the acquisition of capital assets, the payment of mortgage principal on these assets and for other capital expenditures are on a first-in, first-out basis. e. The provider may not use the funds in the funded depreciation account for purposes other than the improvement, replacement, or expansion of facilities or equipment replacement or acquisition related to client services. f. Existing funded depreciation accounts must be used for all capital outlays in excess of three hundred dollars except with regard to those assets purchased exclusively with donated funds or from the operating fund, provided no amount was borrowed to complete the purchase. Should funds be borrowed, or other provisions not be met, the entire interest for the funded depreciation income account 1045 will be offset up to the entire interest expense paid by the facility for the year in question. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985i June 1. incidental funds. 1. Each client is allowed to retain a specific monthly amount of income for personal needs. These personal needs include such items as clothes, tobacco, or other day-to-day incidentals. This monthly allowance is not to be applied toward the Fes~aeAt~s clients cost of care. Generally, the source of income for personal needs is from social security, veterans benefits, private income, economic assistance, or supplemental security income (SSI). 2.

Miscellaneous items, such as tobacco products and accessories, beverages and snacks served at other than mealtime except for supplemental nourishment, television rental for individual use, stationery supplies, postage, pens and pencils, newspapers and periodicals, cable television, and long-distance telephone services. Nonprescription vitamins or combinations of vitamins with minerals may be paid when ordered by the attending physician and the PestaeAt client, parent, guardian, or responsible relative approves such use of the PestaeAtls client's funds. 7. Charges by the program for items or services furnished clients will be allowed as a charge against the client or outside sources, only if separate charges are also recorded by the facility for all clients receiving these items or services directly from the program. All such charges must be for direct, identifiable services or supplies furnished individual clients. A periodic \"flat\" charge for routine items, such as beverages, cigarettes, etc., will not be allowed. Charges may be made only after services are performed or items are delivered, and charges are not to exceed charges to all classes of clients for similar services. 8. RestaeAtsl A client's private property must be clearly marked wttR-Rts gy name. The facility must keep a record of private 1047 property. If items are lost, the circumstances of disappearance must be documented in the facility's records. 9.

No funds may be withdrawn from accounts of FestaeRts a client capable of managing tAetP the client's own funds without tAetF the client's permission. 11. Should a disagreement exist as to whether a FesteeRt client is capable of managing the PesteeRt!s client's own funds, a joint determination will be made by the individual service plan team, parent, guardian, or responsible relative in settling this dispute. The decision must be documented in the provider's records. 12. On discharge, the facility must provide the FesteeAt client with a final accounting of personal funds, and remit any balance on deposit with the facility. 13. Upon death, the balance of a FesteeAt!s client's personal incidental funds along with name and case number, will be maintained in an interest-bearing account for disposition by the FesteeAt!s client's estate.

Upon sale or other transfer of ownership interest of a facility, both transferor and transferee must transfer client's personal incidental funds moneys and records in an orderly manner. 15. Failure to properly record the receipt and disposition of personal incidental funds wt++ may constitute grounds for suspension of provider payments. 16. Client personal incidental funds must not be expended by the provider for the purchases of meals served in licensed day service programs nor may the purchase of such meals be a condition for admission to such programs. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985i June 1, discharge, and expulsion of clients. 1. Movement of clients between levels of service by a provider or between providers must be pursuant to a determination by an individual habilitation team. Reimbursement for the cost of tAe a new service must be contingent upon the timely submission to the department of a--Fev~sea an individual service plan. --- 2. Movement of clients must be subject to the policies and procedures of the North Dakota case management system and the approval of the department. 3.

A public hearing was conducted on September 14, 1994, in Bismarck, concerning proposed amendments to North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 75-82-87, Provider Reimbursement -Basic Care Facilities, specifically subsection 3 of Section 75-82-87-17, Ratesetting. The proposed amendments effectively raised the limit on maximum payable rates from the rate set for the seventieth percentile bed to the rate set for the ninetieth percentile bed. Subsequent to the hearing, the Fifty-fourth Legislative Assembly met and adopted Senate Bill No. 2812, which has the following impacts on the proposal: 1. Section 1 of the bill appropriates funds sufficient to increase the rate limit from the seventieth percentile to the eightieth percentile, but not to the ninetieth percentile, as proposed; and 2. Section 16 of the bill amends North Dakota Century Code Section 58-86-14.3 to delay changes in the ratesetting methodology to create \"rate equalization\" until after June 38, 1997. Based upon these circumstances, it was recommended that subsection 3 of Section 75-82-87-17 be amended as follows: 3. The department shall rank all licensed beds, in facilities for which an audit rate is established, by the respective audit rate set for the bed, and determine the position in the 1121 ranking below which lie seveAty eighty percent of the ranked beds. The reasonable rate established for each facility must be the lesser of the facility1s audit rate or the audit rate which has been established for the facility in which the bed thus determined is located. The reasonable rate sAa++ must be effective from July first through June thirtieth -or-the following year. 75-82-87-17. Ratesetting. 1. The department shall establish reasonable rates for facilities for the care and maintenance of individuals dependent in whole or in part upon state or county supplementation of supplemental security income benefits. 2. The department shall annually determine the allowable costs and shall adjust those costs to reflect changes projected in operational and labor costs for the year, beginning on July first and ending on June thirtieth of the following year. The rate thereby established must be called the audit rate. 3. The department shall rank all licensed beds, in facilities for which an audit rate is established, by the respective audit rate set for the bed, and determine the position in the ranking below which lie seveAty eighty percent of the ranked beds. The reasonable rate established for each facility must be the lesser of the facility1S audit rate or the audit rate which has been established for the facility in which the bed thus determined is located. The reasonable rate sAa++ must be effective from July first through June thirtieth -or-the following year. 4. A county social service board shall determine the payable rate for any resident whose care is, in whole or in part, paid for by that\u00b7 county social service board. The payable rate shall be an amount equal to forty-five dollars plus the least of: a. The reasonable rate; b. The rate charged by the facility to residents not dependent upon state or county supplementation of supplemental security income benefits; or c. A rate voluntarily agreed to by the facility. 5. In the event a county social service board establishes a payable rate less than that required by subsection 4, any county social service board expenditures made pursuant to that rate will nonetheless be considered by the department in determining that county social service board1S expenditures for poor relief pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 50-01-09.2. 1122 ****************************************************************** NOTICE 5. In the event a county social service board establishes a payable rate less than that required by subsection 4, any county social service board expenditures made pursuant to that rate will not be considered by the department in determining that county social service boards expenditures for poor relief pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 50-01-09.2. The amendment made under this subsection becomes effective with respect to rates paid for services furnished on and after July 1, 1991. ****************************************************************** 6. The payable rate shall include a forty-five dollar per month clothing and personal needs allowance which must be reserved for each individual. Facilities shall ensure that this monthly clothing and personal needs allowance is reserved for its intended purpose. 7. Partial year. a. For facilities changing ownership during the rate period, the rate established for the previous owner will be retained. b. For existing facilities adding beds, the rate for the new beds will be the same as for the other similarly licensed beds in the facility. c. New facilities will submit, for departmental approval, a proposed budget for operations for the period, at least three months but not more than fifteen months in duration, which ends on June thirtieth. The rate established based upon the approved budget shall be final and shall continue in effect until the beginning of the rate period next following after the end of the report period which coincides with the end of the budget period. 8. Adjustments and reconsideration procedures. a. Rate adjustments may be made to correct errors subsequently determined and shall also be retroactive to the beginning of the facilitys rate period. b. An adjustment must be made for a facility which has terminated participation in the program and has disposed of its depreciable assets or which has changed ownership. In this case, the regulations pertaining to gains and losses on disposable assets will be effective. 1123 c. Any requests for reconsideration of the rate must be filed with the department for administrative consideration within thirty days of the date of the rate notification.

A change of ownership includes transfer of a partnership interest eP--ef~ a stock interest in a subchapter S corporation or a membership in a limited liability company. 6. The income tax exemption may not be claimed by an individual taxpayer on North Dakota form 37 37-S. 7. A taxpayer with both exempt and nonexempt activities shall prorate its income pursuant to the provisions of North Dakota Century Code chapter 57-38.1. a. If the taxpayer has only North Dakota activity, exempt income must be determined by multiplying income from all activities, exempt and nonexempt, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of its exempt property, sales, and payroll factors and the denominator of which is three.

When a partial exemption on a project or plant has been granted, the percentage of the projects nonexempt property, payroll, and sales would be added to the other North Dakota taxable activitys factors. For instance, a twenty percent exemption would mean eighty percent of the projects property, payroll, and sales would be added to the other North Dakota factors creating a taxable activity. d. When a company has only one operating facility which has been granted a partial exemption, North Dakota taxable income shall be computed based on total income of the operation, and a percentage of the income which is equal to the percentage of the exemption shall be deducted from the total. 1132 History: Effective March 1, 199e; amended effective June 1, 1992; August 1, 1994; April and FSC subject to North Dakota income tax. A DISC (domestic international sales corporation) is treated as an ordinary corporation and subject to state income tax. If the domestic international sales corporation has no activity within this state, but the parent corporation is required to file a tax return with this state, the deemed and actual distributions made by the domestic international sales corporation must be included in business income of the parent and subject to state tax. The tax commissioner may require a combined report whereby income of the domestic international sales corporation is included in the parent's income for state tax purposes and deemed distributions and intercompany items are eliminated. If both the parent corporation and the domestic international sales corporation are nonapportioning North Dakota corporations, the domestic international sales corporation must be required to file a return and compute income subject to state tax based on its total income, and the parent corporation will be allowed a deduction for the deemed distribution to the extent of the domestic international sales corporation's business activity taxed in this state. If the domestic international sales corporation is taxed on its total income, then the parent corporation may deduct one hundred percent of the deemed distribution. A FSC (foreign sales corporation) must be treated the same as a domestic international sales corporation for state tax purposes. Distributions made by the foreign sales corporation to the parent corporation must be included in the parent's income for state tax purposes. The tax commissioner may also require a combined report by the parent corporation to include the total income of the foreign sales corporation, with deemed distributions and intercompany items eliminated.

The following special rules are established with respect to the apportionment of income derived from the publishing, sale, licensing, or other distribution of books, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, trade journals, or other printed material. 1. In general. Except as specifically modified by this rule, when a person in the business of publishing, selling, licensing, or distributing newspapers, magazines, periodicals, trade journals, or other printed material has income from sources both within and without this state, the amount of business income from sources within this state from such business activity must be determined under North Dakota Century Code chapter 57-38.1 and the rules adopted under that chapter. 2. Definitions. The following definitions are applicable to the terms contained in this rule, unless the context clearly requires otherwise. a. neuter-jurisdictional propertt means certain types of tangible personal property, such as orbiting satellites, undersea transmission cables, and the like, that are owned or rented by the taxpayer and used in the business of publishing, licensing, selling, or otherwise distributing printed material, but which are not physically located in any particular state. b. 11 Print or printed materia P inc 1 udes the phys i ca 1 embodiment or printed version of any thought or expression including a play, story, article, column, or other literary, commercial, educational, artistic, or other written or printed work. The determination of whether an item is or consists of print or printed material must be made without regard to its content. Printed material may take the form of a book, newspaper, magazine, periodical, trade journal, or any other form of printed matter and may be contained on any medium or property. c. ..Purchaser.. and 11Subscriber mean the individual, residence, business. or other outlet that is the ultimate or final recipient of the print or printed material. Neither of such terms means or includes a wholesaler or other distributor of print or printed material. d. 11Terrestrial facility .. includes any telephone line, cable, fiber optic, microwave, earth station, satellite dish, antennae, or other relay system or device that is used to receive, transmit, relay, or carry any data, voice, image, 1139 or other information that is transmitted from or by any outer-jurisdictional property to the ultimate recipient thereof. 3. Apportionment of business income. a. The property factor. (1) Property factor denominator. All real and tangible personal property, including outer-jurisdictional property, whether owned or rented, which is used in the business must be included in the denominator of the property factor. (2} Property factor numerator. All real and tangible personal property owned or rented by the taxpayer and used in this state during the tax period must be included in the numerator of the property factor. (a) Outer-jurisdictional property owned or rented by the taxpayer and used in this state during the tax period must be included in the numerator of the property factor in the ratio that the value of such property which is attributable to its use by the taxpayer in business activities in this state bears to the total value of such property which is attributable to its use in the taxpayer's business activities everywhere. The value of outer-jurisdictional property to be attributed to the numerator of the property factor of this state must be determined by the ratio that the number of uplinks and downlinks. sometimes referred to as \"half-circuits\", that were used during the tax period to transmit from this state and to receive in this state any data. voice. image. or other information bears to the total number of uplinks and downlinks or half-circuits that the taxpayer used for transmissions everywhere. Should information regarding such uplink and downlink or half-circuit usage not be available or should such measurement of activity not be applicable to the type of outer-jurisdictional property used by the taxpayer, the value of such property to be attributed to the numerator of the property factor of this state must be determined b the ratio that the amount of time in terms of hours and minutes of use or such other measurement of use of outer-jurisdictional property that was used during the tax period to transmit from this state and to receive in this 1148 state any data, voice, image, or other information bears to the total amount of time or other measurement of use that was used for transmissions everywhere. (b) Outer-jurisdictional property must be considered to have been used by the taxpayer in its business activities within this state when such property, wherever located, has been employed by the taxpayer in any manner in the publishing, sale, licensing, or other distribution of books, newspapers, magazines, or other printed material and any data, voice, image, or other information is transmitted to or from this state either through an earth station or terrestrial facility located in this state. Example: One example of the use of outer-jurisdictional property is where the taxpayer either owns its own communications satellite or leases the use of uplinks, downlinks, or circuits or time on a communications satellite for the purpose of sending messages to its newspaper printing facilities or employees in a state. The state or states in which any printing facility that receives the satellite communications is located and the state from which the communications were sent would, under this rule, apportion the cost of the owned or rented satellite to their respective property factors based upon the ratio of the instate use of said satellite to its total usage everywhere. Assume that ABC Newspaper Co. owns a total of four hundred million dollars of property everywhere and that, in addition, it owns and operates a communication satellite for the purpose of sending news articles to its printing plant in this state, as well as for communicating with its printing plants and facilities or news bureaus, employees, and agents located in other states and throughout the world. Also assume that the total value of its real and tangible personal property that was permanently located in this state for the entire income year was valued at three million dollars. Assume also that the total original cost of the satellite is one hundred million dollars for the tax period and that of the ten thousand uplinks and downlinks of satellite transmissions used by the taxpayer during the tax period, two hundred or two percent are attributable to its satellite 1141 communications received in and sent from this state. Assume further that the company's mobile property that was used partially within this state, consisting of forty delivery trucks, were determined to have an original cost of four million dollars and such mobile property was used in this state for ninety-five days. The total value of property to be attributed to this state would be determined as follows: Value of property permanently in state Value of mobile pro;ert;: 95/365 or (.2682) X $4_888_888: Value of leased satellite property used instate (.82) x $188,888,888: Total value of property attributable to state: $3,888,888 $1,848,888 $2,888,888 $6,848,888 .81289 b. The payroll factor. The payroll factor must be determined in accordance with North Dakota Century Code chapter 57-38.1 and the rules adopted under that chapter. c. The sales factor. (1) Sales factor denominator. The denominator of the sales factor must include the total gross receipts derived by the taxpayer from transactions and activity in the regular course of its trade or business, except receipts that may be excluded under North Dakota Century Code sections 57-38.1-15, 57-38.1-16, 57-38.1-17, and 57-38.1-18 and the rules adopted under those sections. (2) Sales factor numerator. The numerator of the sales factor must include all gross receipts of the taxpayer from sources within this state, including the following: (a) Gross receipts derived from the sale of tangible personal property, including printed materials, delivered or shipped to a purchaser or a subscriber in this state. (b) Except as provided in subparagraph c, gross receipts derived from advertising and the sale, rental, or other use of the taxpayer's customer 1142 lists or any portion thereof must be attributed to this state as determined by the taxpayer's \"circulation factor\" during the tax period. The circulation factor must be determined for each individual publication by the taxpayer of printed material containing advertising and must be equal to the ratio that the taxpayer's instate circulation to purchasers and subscribers of its printed material bears to its total circulation to purchasers and subscribers everywhere. The circulation factor for an individual publication must be determined by reference to the rating statistics as reflected in such sources as audit bureau of circulations or other comparable sources. provided that the source selected is consistently used from year to year for such purpose. If none of the foregoing sources are available, or, if available, none is in form or content sufficient for such purposes, then the circulation factor must be determined from the taxpayer's books and records. (c) When specific items of advertisements can be shown, upon clear and convincing evidence, to have been distributed solely to a limited regional or local geographic area in which this state is located, the taxpayer may petition, or the tax commissioner may require. that a portion of such receipts be attributed to the sales factor numerator of this state on the basis of a regional or local geographic area circulation factor and not upon the basis of the circulation factor provided by subparagraph b. Such attribution must be based upon the ratio that the taxpayer's circulation to purchasers and subscribers located in this state of the printed material containing such specific items of advertising bears to its total circulation of such printed material to purchasers and subscribers located within such regional or local geographic area. This alternative attribution method is permitted only upon the condition that such receipts are not double counted or otherwise included in the numerator of any other state. (d) If the purchaser or subscriber is the United States government or the taxpayer is not taxable in a state, the gross receipts from all sources, including the receipts from the sale of printed material, from advertising, and from the sale, 1143 rental. or other use of the taxpayers customers lists, or any portion thereof that would have been attributed by the circulation factor to the numerator of the sales factor for such state. must be included in the numerator of the sales factor of this state if the printed material or other property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage or business in this state. History: Effective April 1. 1995. Manufacturing or agricultural processing is a process which produces a new article with a different formt uset and name. An agricultural commodity processing facility is a manufacturing plant that processes agricultural commodities into new products. A facility that only storest cleanst dryst or transports agricultural commodities is not an agricultural commodity processing facility. The modification of articles of tangible personal property is not manufacturing or processing. For examplet the creation of steel ducts or I-beams is manufacturing whereas the modification of steel ducts or I-beams to meet the specifications of a particular real property construction contract is not manufacturing or processing. To be considered manufacturing or processingt the raw materials must be materially altered. By way of illustration and not of limitationt the following are manufacturers or agricultural processors: foodt plants; grain wood lumber plants; furniture and fixture makers; paper product makers; printers and publishers (includes newspapers); chemical producers; leather good plants; stone, clay, glass, concrete product makers; cement and asphalt plants; metal ware makers; auto/aircraft makers; dairy processors (not producers); photo finishers (not photographers); and dental, medical, ophthalmolic labs. By way of illustration and not of limitation, the following are not manufacturers or agricultural processors: farmers or ranchers, construction contractors, refining companies, artists, utilities, nurseries, restaurants, pharmacists, drycleaners, photographers, advertisement agencies, secretarial services, computer programmers, auto body shops, repair shops, radio and television stations, architects, jewelers, grain elevators, and tire retreaders or recappers. Manufacturing machinery and equipment are exempt from sales and use taxes if the machinery or equipment: 1. Is used directly in the process of manufacturing tangible personal property for wholesale, retail, or lease; 2. Is used in a new manufacturing plant or in a physical or economic expansion of an existing plant; and 3. Is used directly in the manufacturing process more than fifty percent of the time the machinery or equipment is used by the manufacturer. The manufacturing process begins at the point where the raw materials are first received at the plantsite and includes all direct processes prior to transporting the finished product from the plantsite. In addition, machinery and equipment used by a manufacturer to conduct 1145 research, development, and design activities qualify for the sales and use tax exemption. Examples of research, development, and design equipment include computer software and hardware used to draw, design, or plan products and machinery and equipment used to build or test prototype models. Machinery and equipment used directly in the manufacturing process includes molds and dies that determine the physical characteristics of the finished product or its packaging material, aAa computers and related ~eP~~hePat equipment that directly control or measure the manufacturing process, and testing equipment used to measure or test product quality. Machinery and equipment used directly in the manufacturing process also includes temperature or humidity control equipment necessary to maintain certain tevets-ef temperature or humidity levels in a limited area of the processing or manufacturing facility where either temperature or humidity must be closely regulated for the proper function or production process to occur.

Purchase of these items by a manufacturer is taxable, and suppliers shall charge sales or use tax on these eeAs~maete items. If the items are purchased from an out-of-state supplier or if a North Dakota supplier fails to charge the tax, the North Dakota manufacturer shall report the sales or use tax directly to the North Dakota tax manufacturer to e~y-geeas purchase machinery and equipment without paying tax or for refunds of tax paid on geeas machinery or equipment which qualify for exemption must be made in writing to the tax commissioner. Only the manufacturer may apply for a refund of the sales or use tax paid on exempt machinery or equipment. A request for refund must include documentation showing the amount of tax paid by the manufacturer or the contractor. The tax commissioner reserves the right to make an onsite inspection prior to granting permission to purchase qualifying geeas machinery and equipment without paying tax or prior to PeeetvtA\u00a7 approving a refund. the---taM eeMMtssteAeP!s-a~~Peva~-te-~~Pe~ase-geeas-wtihe~i-~aytA\u00a7-taM-eP-ie-gPaAi a-Pef~Aa-ts-etAatA\u00a7-~A~ess-a-f~PtheP-Pevtew--eP--aaattteAa~--tAfeFMatteA tAateates--t~at--t~e--aeetsteA--was--Maae--~~eA-MtSPe~PeseAiaiteA-ey-t~e a~~~teaAt~ An onsite inspection by the tax commissioner does not preclude an audit of the taxpayer's books and records. The tax commissioner shall respond in writing to each exemption request stating whether or not the machinery or equipment qualifies for the exemption. The manufacturer may provide the approval letter to its equipment and machinery suppliers to avoid paying sales or use taxes on approved equipment. If a manufacturer purchases equipment before requesting a sales tax exemption, it shall pay all applicable sales and use taxes at the time of purchase but may apply to the tax commissioner for a refund of the taxes paid. Tangible personal property consumed during the construction of an agricultural commodity processing facility or incorporated into the structure of an agricultural processing facility is exempt from sales and use tax. However, the contractor consuming or installing the materials shall pay the applicable sales or use taxes and the manufacturer shall apply in writing for a refund of the taxes paid by the contractor. To receive a refund of taxes paid, the agricultural commodity processor must provide documentation showing that the contractor paid North Dakota sales or use taxes on the tangible personal property consumed during construction, or on the tangible personal property installed into the processing facility. The tax commissioner may request an onsite inspection of the processing facility before approving 1147 the refund of taxes paid by a contractor. The agricultural commodity processor may request that the refund amount be taken as a credit adjustment on its next sales and use tax return; however, the tax exemption must be approved in writing by the tax commissioner before the tax credit may be applied on a sales and use tax return. A letter from the tax commissioner stating the amount of the approved credit must be attached to the sales and use tax return on which the credit was applied. History: Effective June 1, 1984; amended effective November 1, 1991; August 1, 1994; April collecting or recovering solid waste material and processing it so it becomes a raw material or another product for sale. The recycling process begins at the point where the raw materials are first received at the recycling facility and includes all direct processes prior to transporting the product from the facility. To qualify as recycling, the solid waste must be processed. Collecting or transporting waste materials without processing them is not recycling. Recycling machinery and equipment are exempt from sales and use taxes if the machinery or equipment: 1. Is used solely in the process of recycling solid waste that will become a raw material for manufacturing or that will become a product for sale at retail or wholesale; and 2. Is used in a new recycling facility or in a physical or economic expansion of an existing facility. Machinery and equipment used directly in recycling of tangible personal property includes pulverizers, shredders, balers, granulators, separators, and conveyors. Motor vehicles used to collect material to be recycled do not qualify for the exemption. Items consumed or destroyed in the recycling process, but which do not become a part of the finished product are not considered recycling machinery or equipment and are subject to sales tax when purchased for use by the recycler. Requests for approval to buy recycling machinery or equipment without paying tax or for refunds of tax paid on machinery or equipment that qualifies for the exemption must be made in writing to the tax commissioner. The tax commissioner reserves the right to make an onsite inspection prior to granting permission to purchase qualifying machinery 1148 or equipment without paying tax or prior to approving a refund. An onsite inspection by the tax commissioner does not preclude an audit of the taxpayers books and records. The tax commissioner shall respond to each exemption request in writing stating whether or not the machinery or equipment qualifies as exempt recycling machinery or equipment. The recycler may provide the approval letter to equipment and machinery suppliers to avoid paying sales or use tax on approved equipment. If a recycler purchases equipment before requesting a sales tax exemption. it must pay all applicable sales and use taxes at the time of purchase; however, the recycler may apply to the tax commissioner for a refund of taxes paid on qualifying equipment. When a recycler applies for a sales or use tax refund on qualifying machinery and equipment, the exemption application must include documentation showing the amount of tax paid. H;story: Effective April 1, 1995. Communication service. The gross receipts from the sale of all communication services provided in the state are subject to sales tax provided the communication service originates and terminates within the states borders, regardless of where the billing for the service is made. 11Communication service11 is the transmission of any interactive electromagnetic communication. including voice, image. data. and any other information, by means of wire, cable, fiber optic, microwave, radio wave. any combination of such media, or any other method now in existence or that may be devised.

Access charges billed to retail consumers are also taxable. Cellular telephone services. A cellular radio communication companys receipts for intrastate mobile telephone communications services to retail consumers are taxable. The taxability of roaming 1151 charges associated with this service is determined by the location of the first cell site. Gross receipts from interstate mobile communication services are not taxable. If the service provider's records do not identify a point of origination and termination of a communication, the communication is presumed to originate and terminate within the state and is taxable. Taxable communication services do not include: 1. One-way communication service; 2. Purchase of communication service from one communication provider to another, for resale to a retail consumer, provided a certificate of resale is provided to the seller by the purchaser; 3. Charges for interstate communication service; 4. Communication services to exempt entities; 5. Communication services to Indian retail consumers enrolled and living on an Indian reservation within this state; and 6. 911 emergency telephone charges. Charges for nontaxable services must be separately stated from charges for taxable services. History: Effective April 1, 1995. Tangible personal property used to provide a communication service by a communication service provider, but that is not sold, leased, or rented to a retail customer is taxable. Taxable charges include down payments, commission charges, or other service or handling charges applied in conjunction with the sales, rental, or lease of tangible personal property. Communication systems sold, leased, or rented to a retail customer may include both material and equipment that are installed, attached, or affixed to real property and material and equipment that remains tangible personal property. The material and equipment installed, attached, or affixed to real property is subject to sales or use tax based on the cost of the material and equipment to the installer. A communication system that includes material and equipment installed, attached, or affixed to real property and material and equipment remaining tangible personal property must be separately stated on the billing.

This penalty must be apportioned to the general fund. 4. The commissioner shall notify the taxpayer of imposition of the failure to file penalty by certified mail. return receipt requested. The notice of imposition of failure to file penalty must specify the wells or units for which a return was not filed, the reporting periods for which a return was not filed, and the amount of penalty assessed. If the taxpayer objects to the imposition of the penalty, the taxpayer may protest by filing an administrative complaint with the commissioner within thirty days of the notice of imposition of penalty for failure to file a return. The taxpayer will be granted an automatic extension of thirty days to file a complaint, provided the taxpayer makes a request for extension within thirty days of the notice. If the taxpayer fails to protest within thirty days of the notice and the penalty remains unpaid, the commissioner may bring an action to collect the penalty for failure to file a return. The two year statute of limitations on actions under North Dakota Century Code section 28-91-18 applies to imposition of this penalty by the commissioner and to protest of this penalty by the taxpayer. 5. The taxpayer may request a hearing before the commissioner relating to the imposition of the penalty for failure to file a return. An administrative complaint filed by the taxpayer must be served personally or by certified mail. The provisions of North Dakota Century Code chapter 28-32 apply to and govern the filing of the complaint and the administrative 1158 hear~ng. including any appeal from a decision rendered by the comm1ss1oner. History: Effective July 1, 1989; amended effective April and interest on delinquent tax. 1. A penalty is imposed on delinquent tax in the amount of five percent of the delinquent tax or five dollars, whichever is greater. This penalty does not apply to delinquent tax reported on an amended return if: a. Ninety percent of the total combined tax liability. reported on the original return and amended returns. was paid with the taxpayers original returni and b. The amended return is filed and all delinquent tax is paid within sixty days of the due date of the original return. 2. Interest is imposed on delinquent tax at a rate of one percent per month for each calendar month or any part of a month in which the tax remains unpaid. except that interest is not imposed in the month the delinquent tax became due. The commissioner will consider a taxpayers oral or written request for a waiver of penalty and interest and may grant a waiver in accordance with sections 81-01.1-01-09 and 81-01.1-01-10. Penalty and interest collected by the commissioner on delinquent tax must be apportioned in the same manner as the delinquent tax. The amount of penalty and interest due will be determined in the following manner: a. The penalty and interest rates must be applied to delinquent tax for each production period. Multiple tax underpayments for different production periods will not be combined to calculate penalty and interest. Tax overpayments and tax underpayments for different production periods will not be offset to calculate penalty and interest. b. The penalty and interest rates must be applied to the delinquent tax computed on an original or amended return. Tax overpayments and tax underpayments for individual well or unit entries on a single return will be offset and the penalty and interest computed on the net delinquent tax. Tax overpayments and tax underpayments reported on 1159 separate returns for the same production period will not be offset. History: Effective April 1, 1995. NDCC 57-51-85(1), 57-51-18 81-99-92-99.1. Reduction from gas volumes and reporting. 1. To determine the volume of gas upon which gross production tax must be paid, the following may be deducted from the total volume of gas produced and must be reported to the commissioner: 1~ a. Wet gas and gas products exempt from taxation pursuant to subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 57-51-85. The volume of gas to be deducted for the wet gas and gas products must be computed using the formulas prescribed in forms provided by the commissioner. 2~ b. Condensate reported as oil. The volume of gas to be deducted for each barrel of condensate must be computed using the formula prescribed in forms provided by the commissioner. 3~ c. Gas flared from an oil well by a producer that is not subject to taxation pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 38-88-86.4. 4~ d. In the event a substance is being injected into a reservoir as a part of a tertiary recovery project, and the amount of nonhydrocarbon gas produced from a well is disproportionally increased as a result of the project, the total volume of gas produced from the well may be adjusted subject to the approval of the commissioner in a manner approved by the commissioner. 2. A producer is not required to report exempt lease use gas and gas flared from an oil well that is not connected to a gas gathering line if the producer submits the following to the commissioner a: a. A chemical analysis of the flared gas, if available;-aAa; --af\"teP.i b. After the first years production, an industrial commission order exempting the producer from the provisions of North Dakota Century Code section 38-88-86.4~; and c. A written statement stating the specific use of exempt gas volumes used on the lease. 1168 History: Effective June 1, 1992; amended effective April from a gas stream. 1. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: a. \"Condensate\" means all 1 iquid hydrocarbons recovered from a gas stream in a gathering system after the custody transfer meter but before processing at a gas plant. Condensate is otherwise referred to as \"pigging liquids\", \"gathering system condensate\". or \"drip\". b. \"Gross value of condensate at the point of recovery means the price paid under an arms length contract for the sale of oil as defined in North Dakota Century Code section 57-51-92.3. c. processing\" means any process designed to remove elements or compounds, hydrocarbons and nonhydrocarbons, from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes that normally take place on or near the lease. such as natural pressure reduction. mechanical separation, heating. cooling. dehydration, and compression are not considered processing. 2. Gross value at the well includes the value of condensate from associated and nonassociated production. There may be deducted from the gross value of condensate certain costs incurred to recover the condensate from a gas stream after the custody transfer meter. Effective January 1, 1995, the costs of recovery must be calculated and deducted from the gross value of condensate under either of the following methods: a. By multiplying fifteen percent times the gross value of the condensate. as gross value is finally determined by the commissioner. This method establishes conclusively the costs of recovery of the condensate from a gas stream; or b. By using reasonable actual costs incurred to recover the condensate from a gas stream after the custody transfer meter. Actual costs do not include proceeds retained under a gas sales or gas processing agreement between a producer and a purchaser or processor. If the method under this subdivision is elected, the costs of recovery must be fully substantiated upon request and are subject to audit by the commissioner. 1161 The value of condensate is included in gross value regardless of the point at which it is recovered. This includes;-8~!-ts--Ae!--~tffittea !e; condensate recovered at the lease site, gas gathering lines, compressor station, and inlet separator of a processing plant. The commissioner shall review the cost of recovery methods under subdivisions a and b of subsection 2 after the cost of recovery provision has been in effect for two years.

Reporting requirements for producers and purchasers. 1. The purchaser of oil at the well must file a monthly oil purchasers report2 as follows: a. If the purchase of oil at the well is an arms length transaction. the first purchaser must file the oil purchasers report. b. If the first purchase of oil at the well is a non-arms length transaction and the oil is resold at the well to an arms length purchaser2 the second purchaser must file the oil purchasers report. c. If the first purchase of oil at the well is a non-arms length transaction and the oil is not resold at the well but is sold downstream, the purchaser at the well must file the oil purchasers report. d. The term arms length transaction as used in this section is defined in section 81-89-82-89. 1162 2. The purchaser is primarily responsible for remitting tax due on all oil purchased from an operator or working interest owner when delivery is made at the well. The commissioner may accept payment of the tax from the operator or working interest owner but failure of the operator or working interest owner to pay the tax will not relieve the purchaser of liability for the tax. 3. The operator and working interest owner shall report as follows: a. The operator of a property must report one hundred percent of production volume each month. The operator must also report the sales volume and the gross value at the well of the oil the operator actually sold. b. The working interest owners who take oil in kind must report the sales volume and the gross value at the well of the oil taken in kind. 4. The operator of a producing property must file a monthly oil producers report unless a written exception is granted allowing a working interest owner to assume the reporting responsibilities of an operator who does not have a working interest in production. 5. The operator must report and remit the tax on all oil not sold at the well including any oil used, lost, stolen, or otherwise unaccounted for after it has been produced. 6. Beginning January 1, 1995, the person reporting and remitting tax on a new property will be required to submit documentation to support a claim for exempt royalty interests. The documentation must be mailed to the commissioner within ninety days after the first report is filed on the property. History: Effective April 1, 1995.

History: Effective March 1, 1995. 1172 FEBRUARY 1995 CHAPTER 92-81-82 92-81-82-18. Experience rating system. The following system is established for the experience rating of risks of employers contributing to unless the context otherwise requires: a. ''Five-year losses\" means the total sum of ratable losses accrued on claims occurring during the first five of the six years immediately preceding the premium year being rated. For payroll periods beginning between July 1. 1994. and June 38, 1995, this term means the total sum of ratable losses accrued on claims occurring during the first four of the five years immediately preceding the payroll year being rated. b. \"Five-year payroll\" means the total sum of limited payroll reported for the first five of the six years immediately preceding the premium year being rated. For payroll periods beginning between July 1. 1994, and June 38, 1995. this terms means the total sum of limited payroll reported for the first four of the five years immediately preceding the payroll year being rated. c. \"Five-year premium\" means the total sum of earned premium for the first five of the six years immediately preceding the premium year being rated. For payroll periods beginning between July 1. 1994, and June 38, 1995, this term means the total sum of earned premium for the first four of the five years immediately preceding the payroll year being rated. d. \"Manual premium\" means the actual premium. prior to any experience rating. for the premium year immediately preceding the premium year being rated for claims experience. 2. Qualified accounts. An employer's account is not eligible for an experience rating until the account has completed three consecutive twelve-month payroll periods and has developed annual premium of one hundred twenty-five dollars or more. excluding optional coverages. on its last actual payroll report. Employer's and volunteer coverages are not eligible for experience rating. 3. For accounts with manual premium of less than twenty-five thousand dollars. a. The experience rating must be applied prior to the inception of each payroll year for all eligible employers' accounts. No minimum premium is eligible for experience rating. Notwithstanding a calculated experience rate discount, an employer may not pay less than the minimum premium for the highest applicable classification rate. A claim is deemed to occur in the payroll year in which it is accepted by the bureau. 1175 b. Experience rate discount or surcharge. Percentage of experience rate discount or surcharge is computed as follows: (1) Calculate the basic compensation allowance which is determined by multiplying the five-year premium by forty percent. (2) Subtract the basic compensation allowance from the five-year losses. (3) Divide this difference by the basic compensation allowance to obtain the percentage difference. (4) Multiply thirty-five percent by the percentage difference obtained under paragraph 3 to give the experience rate percentage to be applied in calculating the estimated premium for the current premium year. If this percentage is greater than zero, the account is subject to an experience rate surcharge in the amount of the calculated percentage. If this percentage is less than zero, the account is entitled to an experience rate discount in the amount of the absolute value of the percentage. c. Maximum percent of surcharge or discount. For payroll periods beginning prior to August 1, 1993, the maximum experience rating surcharge or discount may not exceed forty percent for all accounts. For payroll periods beginning between August 1, 1993, and June 39, 1994, the maximum experience rating surcharge or discount may not exceed thirty-five percent on an individual account with base premium of five thousand dollars to twenty-four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents, and thirty percent on an account with base premium of one hundred dollars to four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents. For payroll periods beginning after June 39, 1994, the maximum experience rating surcharge or discount may not exceed twenty percent on an account with base premium of five thousand dollars to twenty-four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents, and fifteen percent on an account with base premium of one hundred twenty-five dollars to four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents. 4. For accounts with manual premium of twenty-five thousand dollars or more. a. The experience rating must be applied prior to the inception of each premium year for all eligible accounts. A claim is deemed to occur in the premium year in which the injury date occurs. 1176 b. The experience modification factor (EMF) to be applied to the current estimated portion of an of an employer's payroll report is computed as follows: (1) Calculate the actual primary losses (Ap), which consist of the sum of those five-year losses, comprising the first ten thousand dollars of each individual claim. (2) Calculate the actual excess losses (Ae), which consist of the sum of those five-year losses in excess of the first ten thousand dollars of losses of each individual claim. (3) Calculate the total expected losses (Et), which are determined by adding the products of the actual payroll for each year of the five-year payroll times the class expected loss rate for each year. The class expected loss rates, taking into consideration the hazards and risks of various occupations, must be those contained in the most recent edition of the North Dakota workers compensation bureau summary of expected loss rates and information, which is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated within this subsection as though set out in full herein. (4) Calculate the expected excess losses (Ee), which are determined by adding the products of the actual payroll for each year of the five-year payroll times the class expected excess loss rates. The class expected excess loss rates, taking into consideration the hazards and risks of various occupations, must be those contained in the most recent edition of the North Dakota workers compensation bureau summary of expected loss rates and information, which is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated within this subsection as though set out in full herein. (5) Calculate the \"credibility factor\" (Z) which is the quotient of the total expected losses divided by the sum of the total expected losses plus one million dollars. (6) The experience modification factor is then calculated as follows: (a) Add the actual primary losses to the product of the actual excess losses times the credibility factor. (b) To this sum add the product of the expected excess losses times the difference between one dollar and the credibility factor. 1177 (c) To this sum add twenty thousand dollars. (d) Divide this total sum by the sum of the total expected losses plus twenty thousand dollars. The resulting quotient is the experience modification factor to be applied in calculating the estimated premium for the current payroll year. (7) The formula for the above-mentioned calculation is as follows: AP + (Z x Ael + [(1.99 -Z) + $29,999.99 Effective June 1, 1999; amended effective July 1, 1993i July 1, -Premium rates. Classifications and premium rates, taking into consideration hazards and risks of different occupations, must be those classifications and premium rates contained in the document entitled, 11ND Workers Compensation Bureau Summary of Premium/Loss Information ... 1994 edition, which is hereby adopted by reference thereto and incorporated within this section as though set out in full herein. Premium rates must be adjusted annually as recommended by the bureaus actuaries based upon the criteria set forth in North Dakota Century Code section 65-94-91. The minimum premium charge for all classifications will be one hundred twenty-five dollars per year except for the following volunteer classifications: Classification No. 7719 7715 9839 9385 Fire department, volunteer -minimum will be fifty dollars Civil defense volunteer disaster -minimum will be fifty dollars Civil air patrol, volunteer- minimum will be one hundred ten dollars Volunteer programs -minimum will be one hundred fifty dollars 1178 9840 Vocational training and work evaluation programs, volunteer -minimum will be one hundred fifty dollars History: Effective June 1, 1990; amended effective July 1, 1990; July 1, 1991; July 1, 1992; July 1, 1993; 1181 1182 FEBRUARY 1995 CHAPTER 97-82-81 97-82-81-81.
