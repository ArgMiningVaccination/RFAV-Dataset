Steffey, MD* *Department of Pediatrics, ECU Brody School of Medicine, Greenville, NC Pediatric bone health is determined by genetics, diet, mobility, and exercise, but it can also be affected by medications and chronic disease. Although a diagnosis of osteoporosis may inspire thoughts of the geriatric population, some children are also vulnerable. Physicians providing care to both pediatric and adult populations should particularly note the major differences in the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in children. Pediatric osteoporosis is de ned by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry based on 2 criteria. First is \"low bone mineral content or bone mineral density. \"Children with bone mineral density of 2 or more standard deviations below average measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) have \"low bone mineral content. \"DXA, which exposes patients to small doses of ionizing radiation, is the only current reference standard for assessing pediatric bone mineral density. A patient 's measurement is compared with standards for age, sex, and body size, and the result is reported as a Zscore, with a value of less than -2.0 being abnormal. Unfortunately, variability in radiologic technique, the multidimensional growth of bone in childhood, and normative data that inadequately account for bone changes caused by puberty orchronic disease all present challenges to reproducible and accurate interpretation of DXA in pediatric patients. The second criterion required for diagnosis of pediatric osteoporosis is \"the presence of a clinically signi cant fracture history, \"dened as at least 1 long bone fracture in the lower extremity, at least 2 long bone fractures in the upper extremity, or a vertebral compression fracture. Some physician discretion in applying this criterion is warranted, speci cally in cases of concern for fragility or low trauma fractures. For example, an adolescent with a long bone fracture of the leg after, for example, a fall down a flight of concrete stairs would be signi cantly less concerning than a similar fracture after minimal trauma. The incidence of pediatric osteoporosis is not known, likely due to a combi- nation of historical differences in diagnostic criteria, previous lack of well- established DXA reference data, and the wide variety of factors that may contribute to the development of osteoporosis. Increased risk of low bone mineral density and fractures is found with a wide range of genetic disorders, chronic illnesses, and use of speci c medications. Modi able factors such as calcium and vitamin D intake, soda consumption, and weightbearing exercise also affect the potential for pediatric osteoporosis, and pediatricians should incorporate screen- ing questions into health maintenance visits to help assess risk. Bone fragility is an obvious concern in children with bone disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta, but studies have also demonstrated increased fracture risk in patients with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. One factor contributing to osteoporosis in these patients may be decreased exercise or mobility. Other patients with a limitedAUTHOR DISCLOSURE Dr Steffey has disclosed no nancial relationships relevant to this article.

Weightbearing exercise confers a variety of health benets, and 2 studies have suggested that introducing school-based daily exercise in healthy prepubertal childrenhas the additional advantage of increasing bone accrual. Those with restricted mobility can similarly experience improved bone health through thoughtful physical therapy. Vitamin D de ciency with resultant impairment in cal- cium absorption may lead to rickets and eventual osteopo- rosis. Although decreased availability due to minimal sun exposure, poor nutrition, eating disorders, and prematurity are possible causes, it is also important to consider chronic disorders associated with malabsorption of vitamin D as predisposing to osteoporosis. Patients with short gut syn- drome, celiac disease, and cystic brosis generally are at risk for de ciencies in all fat-soluble vitamins, and patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hypopara- thyroidism with subsequent vitamin D de ciency. Medica- tions for seizures affect vitamin D metabolism and calcium absorption, and higher doses and use of multiple antiepi- leptic drugs further increase the risk of osteoporosis. Empir- ical vitamin D supplementation is reasonable in children with these conditions and in those receiving medical ther- apy for seizures. Chronic, systemic glucocorticoids also have a host of del- eterious effects on bone, includ ing interference with vitamin D metabolism, increased bone resorption, decreased bone for- mation, decreased calcium absor ption, increased calcium loss, and decreased sex hormone production. Patients receiving long-term immunosuppression medications, such as those with cancer, autoimmune disease, and organ transplants, are at risk for osteoporosis. Unfortunately, the underuse of these medications and inadequate control of chronic in flam- mation also places children at increased risk for fractures. Inflammatory cytokines associa ted with chronic conditions such as rheumatologic disorders or in flammatory bowel dis- ease can decrease bone production and increase resorption. Cytotoxic chemotherapy, cortic osteroids, and radiotherapy used for the treatment of childho od cancers also have a harmful effect on bone mineral density and can be of particular concern in children who may already have increased fracture risk due to bone-in ltrating malignancies. Although use of these treat- ment modalities is deleterious to bone health, it remains preferable to the systemic and bone risks associated withinadequate treatment of these underlying conditions.Children with type I diabetes, abnormal corticosteroid production, and disorders causing hypogonadism are all at increased risk for osteoporosis. Whereas these patients are typically already under the care of an endocrinologist, ado- lescents with exercise-related amenorrhea and Turner syn- drome and those receiving depot medroxyprogesteronetherapy are less commonly followed by these subspecialists and therefore should be monitored by their primary care physicians for fractures and the need for further evaluation and intervention. Inherent dif culties exist in performing and interpreting pediatric DXA, and there is a lack of clear predictive value in children without signi cant fracture history. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends DXA for children with clinically signi cant fractures and those with medical con- ditions that place them at increased risk for fractures. Speci cally, DXA should be performed in pediatric patients with vertebral fractures, fractures out of proportion to the inciting trauma, and multiple long bone fractures. Although screening questions and counseling to prevent modi able causes of osteoporosis are appropriate in all children, DXA is not indicated in otherwise healthy children. In all pedi- atric patients, therapeutic interventions should focus on addressing underlying etiologies of bone fragility. The treatment team caring for a child with low bone density should optimize medical management of the under-lying condition while simultaneously employing general strategies for improving bone health. For example, an adolescent with anorexia nervosa will have improved bone density with weight gain and return of normal estrogen production alone, and bone remineralization can be further augmented with supplementation with vitamin D and cal- cium. Bisphosphonates are not indicated to be appropriate forrst-line use in otherwise healthy pediatric patients with low bone density. Use of bisphosphonates should be reserved for children with symptomatic or severe osteopo- rosis that is refractory to supplementation and managementof comorbid conditions, and for conditions such as osteo- genesis imperfecta where, despite disease management, recurrent painful fractures may be ameliorated and risk of vertebral collapse minimized. Regardless of the source, pediatricians can ensure that all patients at risk for low bone mineral density have adequate vitamin D and calcium intake. Unfortunately, there are no standardized recommended daily allowances for children with these conditions, but adequate amounts recommendedfor healthy children should be a minimum expectation. 260 Pediatrics in Review Downloaded from http://publications.aap.org/pediatricsinreview/article-pdf/40/5/259/826860/pedsinreview_20170277.pdf by Stony Brook University user on 18 May 2023Currently, adequate vitamin D intake for healthy infants younger than 1 year is 400 IU/d and for healthy children 1 year and older is 600 IU/d. Vitamin D levels do not need to be measured as a routine screening tool but are reasonable in children with a history of clinically signi cant fractures. Similarly, calcium intake in high-risk patients should at leastmatch the recommended daily allowance for healthy chil- dren, which varies based on age. Consultation with a reg- istered dietitian may be helpful for parents striving to optimize nutrition. Pediatricians should encourage and facilitate participation in weightbearing exercise; collabora- tion with pediatric physical therapists can help to safely maximize activity in children at higher risk for osteoporosis and fractures. COMMENT: Theeld of pediatric bone health has rapidly expanded during the past decade. Pediatricians are a criticalpart of the health-care team in addressing preventive strat- egies. Studies have demonstrated that bone health in adult- hood is affected by intrauterine factors such as maternal vitamin D de ciency, smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeineintake, decreased physical activi ty, intrauterine growth retar- dation, and maternal diabetes. The period of childhood, from infancy through adolescence, is critical for bone health because 90% of bone density is determined by the end of puberty. Hence, pediatricians have the important responsi- bility to counsel families and patients about the importance ofvitamin D intake, calcium intake, and exercise. We all know some of the challenges of encouraging vitamin D and calcium intake for children. In one study it was noted that calcium intake by diet alone is approximately 50% of the recom- mended dietary allowance for girls. But asking speci cs about what types of food and dairy products are eaten and the quantities is essential. And, when found not to be suf cient, encouraging other alternatives, such as calcium-forti ed cereals, juices, other foods, and supplements. Pediatricians are also essential in coordinating the care of children with special health-care needs because bone health may not alwaysbe a primary concern through the lens of the subspecialists. -Janet R.
