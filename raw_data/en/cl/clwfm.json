The rubella vaccination programme has meant that the possibility of rubella damage to the foetus, a valid reason for termination of pregnancy, is now uncommon. It is important to remember that the ethical consideration of the treatment of children evolves as the child develops from a dependent infant to a fully autonomous adult. There are some ethical issues that are more specific to some group of children. As puberty approaches, the child's autonomy begins to develop. Through adolescence the parent's authority diminishes and the child becomes self-reliant and competent to make important decisions on his or her own account. Although General Practitioners occasionally take part in research projects involving their adult patients, the use of children as research subjects is not a topic relevant to primary care. Towards Reform, 1939-1967 [Barbara Brookes](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=Barbara+Brookes&tab=books) in [Abortion in England 1900-1967](https://www.routledge.com/Abortion-in-England-1900-1967/Brookes/p/book/9780415752466), 2012 The inter-war discussion of abortion brought the subject into the open and set the shape of future debates. The recommendations of the Birkett Committee and outcome of the Bourne trial put the abortion decision more firmly in the hands of the medical profession, who could decide when a pregnancy was threatening to a woman's health. In the post-war years the concept of health underwent a gradual expansion and the line created by the medical profession, between medical and social indications for abortion, became increasingly blurred. The issue was even more complicated by the issue of foetal abnormalities caused by rubella (German measles) and the prescription drug thalidomide. Therapeutic abortions increased and the grounds of mental health recognised by the Bourne case were stretched to meet a variety of indications. INFECTION [A.L. 1994 Rubella causes a mild viral illness in young children, but maternal rubella infection in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy may lead to fetal damage-up to 90% of pregnancies infected during the first 8-10 weeks are affected. Infants with the congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) are generally small for gestational age, with multiple congenital defects, including cataracts, retinopathy, deafness, microcephaly, congenital heart defects and bony lesions. be isolated sensorineural deafness. Diagnosis of congenital rubella may be confirmed by virus isolation from urine or nasopharyngeal secretions, or by the persistence of rubella-specific IgM in the infant during the first 6 months of life. There is no specific treatment. Since the introduction of rubella immunization cases of CRS have fallen in number. Girls between 10 and 14 years should receive rubella vaccine if not previously vaccinated with MMR. The status of rubella IgG antibody titer between antenatal postnatal among infection of rubella in pregnancy is worrisome due to the fact that it causes miscarriages, congenital defects, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). The purpose of this study was to determine the status of Rubella IgG antibody levels both during the antenatal and postnatal periods among pregnant women nonimmune to rubella and the incidence of exposure to rubella in pregnancy. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that included 4770 pregnant, who attended the obstetric clinics and delivered in Women's Specialized Hospital, King Fahad Medical City, between January and December 2015. The study utilized the following measures for rubella screening tests (IgG and IgM) during the antenatal and postnatal period. Pregnant women with recent rubella infection (IgM antibody positive), history of rubella infection, or had immunity against rubella (IgG antibody concentration 10 IU/ml) were excluded from the study. Results: The prevalence of pregnant women nonimmune to rubella was 6.3% (n = 301). The majority (93.7%) were immune (IgG antibody concentration 10 IU/ml). No patients tested positive for rubella (IgM +ve). Overall, The Median (IQR) Rubella (IgG) in the antenatal period (6.3 (8.30-5.00) IU/m) was significantly less in comparison to the postnatal period (5.0 (6.40-5.00) IU/m). The difference was statistically significant, p <.001. Conclusion: There is a significant decrease in the Rubella (IgG) titer between antenatal and postpartum periods, and we report a very low incidence of rubella infection and CRS among pregnant women nonimmune to rubella. Rubella Immunity and Morbidity: Effects of Vaccination in Finland Published in [Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/INFD19), 1988 [Pentti Ukkonen](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Ukkonen%2CPentti), [Carl-Henrik von Bonsdorff](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=von+Bonsdorff%2CCarl-Henrik) The occurrence of rubella antibodies and frequency of virologically proven rubella infections in different age groups were analyzed in a large serum material (about 60000 sera) collected both before and after the start of nationwide vaccination of children against measles, mumps and rubella in Finland in 1982. The combined live vaccine significantly raised the rubella immunity of children and shifted rubella infections to older ages. In 1986, 91-98% immunity was found in the 2-10-year-old children so far covered by the vaccination programme; no rubella cases were diagnosed in this age group. We also demonstrated that another rubella vaccine given to about 60% of 13-year-old girls since 1975 both raised the immunity and reduced the occurrence of rubella in the vaccinated population. It is concluded that the rubella vaccinations, especially the combined vaccine given to small children, are effective, although the total number of reported rubella cases in the whole population did not decrease significantly during the study period. Rubella Antibodies in Infants whose Mothers had Rubella during the Second and Third Trimesters of Pregnancy Published in [Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/INFD19), 1971 16 infants whose mothers had rubella during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy were tested repeatedly for rubella antibody. In 11 babies the rubella antibodies disappeared within 6 months after birth, in 2 others they declined to low titers within 1 year, but in 3 babies the titer of rubella antibodies remained unchanged or increased slightly during the first year of life. The total IgM concentrations were slightly increased in some infants examined soon after birth, but rubella-specific IgM antibodies could not be demonstrated in any of the babies. All attempts to isolate rubella virus were negative. One infant with permanent rubella antibodies has been chronically ill since birth, all the others have been clinically normal. The possibility of transient or chronic fetal infection following maternal rubella in the second or third trimester of pregnancy is discussed.
