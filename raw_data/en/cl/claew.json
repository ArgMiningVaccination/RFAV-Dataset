One that's growing steadily in recent months? Adaptogens. Adaptogens, which are sourced from [plants](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a41164767/milk-based-beauty-products/), aren't an entirely new concept. \"Plants, shrooms and roots have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda for centuries and have always been part of their healing traditions,\" says Rui Liu, co-founder of the adaptogen-focused skincare brand Herbar. But what exactly are adaptogens and how do they benefit us? Bazaar went to the experts to find out. What are adaptogens? \"Adaptogens refer to a group of plant-based ingredients that are believed to help the body 'adapt' to [stressors](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a41419695/shadow-work/), and help regulate the body's responses,\" explains medical doctor and skin specialist, Dr. David Jack. \"These are believed to have particular effects on hormones such as cortisol (the stress hormone).\" Not all plants are adaptogens, however. To classify as one, plants need to be able to support the body in resisting physical, biological and chemical stress without causing any harm. Mushrooms, specifically reishi and cordyceps, are some of the most popular adaptogens. \"Reishi are known to have these properties as well as being immune-boosters,\" explains Dr. Jack. \"Cordyceps are associated with anti-ageing properties and have extremely high antioxidant activity. They also have potent anti-inflammatory effects on all tissues, including the skin.\" Other adaptogenic plants include ginseng, yerba mate, ashwagandha, maca and sea buckthorn. Are adaptogens scientifically proven to benefit health and wellbeing? It might be a trending talking point within the Western world, but adaptogens have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda for centuries. \"Having grown up in China they are ubiquitous and part of many healing strategies,\" says Liu, whose brand Herbar is currently investing in clinical research. \"In China, it's common for people to seek acupuncturists and herbalists to help them with their skin conditions, and often they resort to these plants for a solution. Traditional Chinese Medicine has been an ally for years.\" While scientific trials on adaptogens are still a work in progress, Dr. David notes that there is anecdotal evidence that supports the benefit of adaptogens. What are the benefit of adaptogens on skin? \"Although it is difficult to make claims, since rigorous scientific evidence just does not exist (yet), early studies have shown many benefits to the skin and other systems through taking adaptogenic herbs,\" says Dr. Jack. Adaptogens are often rich in antioxidants, which help protect the skin against environmental aggressors - while also re-balancing the stress hormone cortisol. If you tend to break out due to stress, it's worth incorporating adaptogens in your diet and skincare. When used topically, adaptogens are known to help the skin adapt better to stress while keeping [redness](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a40392616/beauty-editors-guide-sensitive-skin/) and flare-ups at bay. How long does it take to see the effects of adaptogens? Since skin generally renews itself every 28 days, you're most likely notice a marked difference after a month of regular use. If taken in the form of [supplements](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a26140056/best-beauty-supplements/), Dr. Jack recommends trying it for a month and giving it a break. \"This is not particularly based on any scientific evidence but traditionally it is thought to be best to cycle adaptogens intermittently,\" he explains. Who are adaptogens for? Technically, anyone who works in a fast-paced environment and lives in a city can benefit from adaptogens. But, more specifically, if stress tends to trigger the condition of your skin, incorporating adaptogens will help as they impact the body's stress-response system, notes Rui. It's great for those prone to acne, [eczema](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a34724058/dry-skin/) and psoriasis, too. "}
