September 25, 2022 The Confess Project in Minnesota: A Mental Health Barbershop Movement Larry Tucker, LMFT, Owner and Co-founder and Owner, Kente Circle and Kente Circle Training Institute The Confess Project is a national organization committed to building a culture of mental health for Black boys, men, and families by empowering barbers and other frontline heroes and sheroes to talk about mental health and well-being. In 2020 Kente Circle, a mental health agency in Minneapolis, began implementing The Confess Project in Minnesota, in partnership with UCare and the national Confess Project leaders. To date, over 30 barbers across the state have been trained in identifying common mental health conditions, active listening, using trauma-informed language, and healthy coping skills. In 2020 Harvard researchers confirmed that participating Black barbers played an essential role in Black communities as change agents and were bridging the gap in Black communities between unmet mental health needs and mental health care. This is part of a nationwide movement to enhance the capacity of community members to provide mental health and well-being supports.

April 26, 2022 Building a Community of Belonging: Creating Essential Building Blocks for Community Leadership and Innovation Pat Stieg, MA CHES, Public Health Specialist Carver County Public Health What does it take to create a community of belonging? In late 2021 Carver County launched the Communities of Belonging initiative in eight area communities to begin asking and answering that question. This became a priority for the county after identifying belonging and well-being in the community health improvement plan (CHIP). Participating communities were invited to explore and implement strategies to improve the sense of belonging for everyone in their community. The Carver County approach is unique in several ways. The county made at firm commitment to support the participating communities for at least three years and is equally respecting the direction and pace of community leadership development. Carver has built buy-in for this process among county leadership and elected officials by making it clear how belonging impacts, and is impacted by, a range of community factors from health, well-being, active living, climate change to economic development. At least three county commissioners, along with three local city council members, have participated in this work to date. The eight communities have approached the task in various ways: through outreach, assessment, development of a common language and framework, and even implementation of several tools. Communities are building their partnerships and at least one has implemented a resident survey about belonging. A county staff member has become a certified [Living Room Conversations](https://livingroomconversations.org/) host, and more than 10 different conversations have been conducted. Learn more about how Carver is making 2022 about belonging, what is in store for the partners, and what challenges they are facing.
